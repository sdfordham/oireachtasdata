He is accompanied by Mr. John Riordan, deputy director of audit.  Are the minutes of 10 November agreed?  Agreed.  I propose we hold over the opening statement of Cerberus until we meet its representative in the afternoon.<\/p> <p>  The next item of correspondence in category B, that is, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings.  Items 154 to 163B, inclusive, 171B and 186B, all refer to late accounts.  I propose we note them for now and return to them when we discuss accounts and statements shortly.<\/p> <p>  Items 168B(i) and (ii) are correspondence from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, providing a response to a series of questions from the committee following our engagement with the Revenue Commissioners in October.  It is a fairly extensive reply and I thank Mr. Cody for that.  Is it agreed to note and publish it?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Items 169B(i) and (ii) is an e-mail from Ms Michelle Lowe of NAMA attaching a copy of PIMCO's offer letter to NAMA in December 2013.  I propose we note and publish that, and it will be added to our Project Eagle file.  Items 173B(i) and (ii) is correspondence from Dublin City Council responding to the committee's letter of 26 September on the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and contracting of professional services.  A copy of a response given at a Committee of Public Accounts meeting in the last D&aacute;il is attached.  Is it agreed to note and published?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Item 175B is an e-mail also from Mr. Martin Whelan of NAMA informing the committee that it cannot release statements of interests made by members of the board, committees and senior members of staff in accordance with section 35 of the Ethics in Public Office Act.  Is it agreed to note and publish that?  Agreed.  I have asked the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisor to prepare a note on this.<\/p><p>Our committee is agreed that, outside the meetings, the secretariat can seek additional information it knows is of interest to the members.  We had written to NAMA seeking a copy of any declarations of interest board members or members of the Northern Ireland committee had published.  They said that, under the legislation, the documents are confidential and not subject to the ethics legislation and not for publishing.  However, I was in touch since then looking for any declaration of interest signed by any member at any Northern Ireland committee meetings or board meetings in connection with Project Eagle.  I want to see copies because we have been told on several occasions that some members, especially those of the Northern Ireland committee, had signed a declaration of interest.  Mr. Rowntree, when he was here, said he never saw them and that they were just handed to the Chairman.  I checked the legislation this morning and noted it states they are to be made available to all board members at the meeting.  It is not satisfactory for it to be handed only to the Chairman.  That said, the minutes of the Northern Ireland committee record the items of disclosure but they have been redacted in the set of minutes given to us.  If we are considering this matter, we want to see the declarations signed by the people at the meeting.  We are quite specific on the fact that we should get that.  We will make clear to NAMA precisely what we are looking for.<\/p><p> The next item of correspondence is an e-mail from Mr. Martin Whelan of NAMA attaching a response to the information requested on 3 November.  We will note and publish that.  Every week, we have a letter going to NAMA seeking additional information.  The replies are coming back.<\/p><p> Items Nos. 177B(i) and 177B(ii) concern an e-mail from Mr. Brendan Smith of the accounts branch in the Department of Social Protection attaching a copy of the Social Welfare Appeals Office annual report for 2015, as requested at our meeting with it in October.  Can we agree to note and publish that?  Agreed.  It is not the document I was looking for, however.  The document we received yesterday is a summary of the activities of the Social Welfare Appeals Office detailing the categories of appeals it dealt with.  I was looking for its annual financial statement, not a summary of its hearings and activities.  We will be specific in seeking a copy of its financial statement.  There is other outstanding information from the Department of Social Protection that we have not received yet.  I would like to receive it within the next seven days because several weeks have elapsed since it was first requested.<\/p><p> Nos. 178B(i) and 178B(ii) refer to an e-mail from Mr. David Meisels, head of litigation at Fortress Investment Group, attaching a letter of response on the committee's areas of interest.  It is not an extensive letter but I propose to read it into the record because Fortress was the underbidder.  Cerberus was the successful bidder.  Some time ago, in early November, in advance of a committee meeting I asked the secretariat to write to Fortress posing specific questions.  We received a reply today but since our last meeting we have agreed to invite its representatives.  We have not had a response on that yet.  We wrote the letter to them because I wanted to get information flowing.  I have the authority to invite representatives without clearance from the committee.  We have since obtained it.  We still hope the representatives will come.  Although the letter received is short, it deals with a couple of specific issues.  Since Fortress is a key player on this issue, having been the only underbidder at the end of the competition, we should read the short response.  We will not have a big discussion on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479373200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I am not interested in doing so at all.

It is dated 11 November and it was sent by e-mail to the clerk to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It states:<div><\/p><p><i>Re: Special Report 94 National Asset Management Agency's Sale of Project Eagle<\/i><\/div>Dear Mr. Lenihan:<\/p><p>I write in response to your letter, dated November 3, 2016, to Mr. Randal Nardone of Fortress.  Fortress appreciates the opportunity to address the Committee's requests for information, which are reproduced in bold below, followed by Fortress's response.<\/p><p>The first question I asked was how Fortress became aware of the sale of Project Eagle.  The response is:<\/p><blockquote>Fortress learned of the formal Project Eagle sale through press reports on or around February 13, 2014 that NAMA was seeking to complete a sale of the NAMA Northern Ireland loan portfolio to PIMCO.<\/blockquote> <p>The second question I asked was how Fortress became involved in the sale process.  The response is:<\/p><blockquote>After learning of the Project Eagle sale process through press reports (described above), on February 13, 2014, Michael George of Fortress reached out to Andrew McDowell, Economic Advisor to the Prime Minister, and Brendan McDonagh, Chief Executive Officer of NAMA, to express interest in participating in the sale process.  Mr. McDowell put Mr. George in touch with Ronnie Hanna, head of Credit at NAMA, and John Collison, Head of Residential Delivery at NAMA, who informed Mr. George that Fortress would be invited to bid, and that NAMA had engaged Lazard to oversee the bidding process.  On February 14, 2014, a Fortress representative spoke with Lazard regarding the bidding process.<\/blockquote> <p>The third question I asked was about the basis on which Fortress made its bid.  This is the response:<\/p><blockquote>Consistent with its general approach, Fortress reviewed and analyzed available information, assessed the value of the assets for sale and the circumstances of the sale transaction, and exercised its professional judgment in determining its bid, taking into account its perception of the potential risk of the transaction in relation to the potential reward.  Fortress devoted substantial resources to this effort, which involved the deployment of a large team of its investment professionals, and the engagement of a number of external advisors at substantial expense to the firm, including legal counsel, property and asset advisors, and insurance and environmental consultants.<\/blockquote> <p>The fourth question I asked was about Fortress's rationale in making a bid below the reserve price.  It responded:<\/p><blockquote>As described above, Fortress formulated its bid on the basis of its professional judgment and its evaluation of the assets for sale and the circumstances of the transaction.  Considerations taken into account by Fortress included the quality and completeness of the diligence information made available to Fortress; that the portfolio constituted a large exposure in a very small, concentrated region: and that the bid process required an unconditional bid which could not be syndicated or financed pre-bid.<\/blockquote> <p>My final question was whether there were any other matters that might be of interest to the committee regarding the sale of Project Eagle.  The reply is:<\/p><blockquote>Fortress is not aware of any additional information that may be of interest to the Committee at this time.<br \/><br \/>We hope the information provided above is of assistance to the Committee.<\/blockquote> <p>The letter is signed by Mr. David Meisels, managing director and head of litigation.  Since we received this, we wrote to Fortress representatives, at the request of the committee, to invite them to appear before us.<\/p><p>Let me highlight the issue that has just been mentioned, namely, the condition of the bid such that it &quot;could not be syndicated or financed pre-bid&quot;.  That is a very important issue we will have to take up with NAMA.  The number of people who could bid was made very limited.  NAMA has said here a few times that it wanted people to bid who, in their own right, could write the cheque for the full amount and would not have to borrow or work with other people to put the funding together.  NAMA has said that was in the interest of confidentiality but, clearly, normal purchases of this kind would have some groups of people financing them.  The NAMA bid specifically excluded that.  It made it much more difficult for people to make a bid in that the person coming to the table had to write the cheque without recourse to any bank.  That is a very clear issue.  Is my interpretation reasonable?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#B00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479373200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Yes, I think that is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#B01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1479373200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>We will not discuss this at length because if Fortress representatives are coming in, we will want to discuss it with them.

As a result of becoming aware of the process through the media, both Goldman Sachs and Fortress made approaches to NAMA or Lazard.  We were aware of the cash-only bid.  I think we referred to it in the report.  I suppose the point is that none of the bidders were to be in a situation where a bank or funder would also have to get involved.  It would introduce a conditionality on their bid if they required external borrowing.  That is not to say that when the acquisition occurred, they used bank borrowing.

Category C is correspondence from or relating to private individuals and any other correspondence.

There is a specific note on that so members can see that this was already in the back of our heads all along.  The HSE has published substantial documents on its website in recent weeks relating to the cost of every HSE institution where people are being cared for.  Private nursing homes are providing information to us about what they are being paid by HSE.  The point about whether it is the same service or a similar service is moot.  There is quite a bit of information available to allow us to have a discussion early in the new year.  That report will take a while.  The Minister of Health will have three months to consider it and it will probably be after the summer before we see that report.  We can have our discussion early on in the new year.  I think there is unanimous agreement on that issue.<\/p> <p>  The next item is a letter from Deputy Niall Collins forwarding a copy of a letter from an individual about the Irish Greyhound Board and the Limerick Greyhound Racing Track.  I propose we write to the Irish Greyhound Board for a response on the issues raised in the letter.  <\/p> <p>  Item 165C is an e-mail from the Charities Regulator attaching a letter of response from Mr. Tom Malone, head of compliance, regarding a charity shop in Cork.

Before we go to statements and accounts, I want to refer back to the number of correspondence items this week dealing with late accounts.  Members will recall that the clerk undertook some weeks ago to write to the parent Departments of all bodies that laid accounts late, namely, more than three months after being certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am referring to all the accounts we have seen since this committee has been in place.  The requirements are stated in a circular from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and aim to ensure that in the normal course the accounts of bodies and funds under the aegis of Departments and offices are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within three months of the Comptroller and Auditor General issuing the audit certificate on the accounts.  These requirements are also stated in the Comptroller and Auditor General's letter on completion of his audit.  We decided at a previous meeting to compile a full list.  We have a list.  I will ask members to have a look at it and we will come back and discuss it in further detail in case there might be individual organisations about which members may have a query.  We will discuss it at our next meeting.<\/p><p>The list is comprehensive and will be included in correspondence for the next meeting.<\/p><p> The next matter is reports, statements and accounts of bodies audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and received since our meeting of 10 November 2016.  The list is short.  The first matter is the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange, which received a clear audit report.  The next matter is the Kerry Education and Training Board, which received a clear audit report, except that the report discloses that when the board took over responsibility for Tralee training centre in 2014 staff supporting the finance function of the centre did not transfer to the board.

To date, we have met the Comptroller and Auditor General on his report, representatives of NAMA, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and his officials, Mr. Brian Rowntree, a former member of NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee, or NIAC as it is known, and the deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr. Martin McGuinness.

I will start with Mr. Corrigan.  He was in a unique position in that he was a member of the board of NAMA but he was also in the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  The year 2013 was important in that IBRC was liquidated and instead of a &euro;3 billion payment annually, or a little more in some cases, it was elongated.  In terms of the European Central Bank, ECB, and the pressure that we have heard others talk about, was there additional pressure in 2013 to accelerate the process?  Was the ECB putting on more pressure than it had been?

I will talk about my own position in that I straddled the two organisations.  I was chief executive of the NTMA and I was <i>ex officio<\/i>then on the board of NAMA.  I would have characterised myself as a non-executive on the board of NAMA.  In my head I was acutely aware of the pressure that was on to make progress with liquidating, so to speak, NAMA&rsquo;s balance sheet.  There was pressure from the ECB.  It was general pressure really.  I attended a lot of meetings with the troika.  On the Irish side, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank would also have attended.<br\/><br\/>From my point of view, and also from Ireland&rsquo;s point of view, 2013 was a year where we were poised to come out of the IMF-EU programme.  The question which was being discussed at the time was whether we would come out of the programme or if we would have to go into a second programme.  Those were real issues that were being discussed at the time.  From the point of view of the particular brief of the NTMA there was also the question, which was very relevant, of whether we could come out of the programme under our own steam, so to speak.  There was also the question of the rating agencies, which had downgraded Ireland through the period we were in the programme.  In fact one of them, Moody's, I think it was, had us in sub-investment grade status.  The rating agencies in general adopted a very strange approach towards NAMA.  While technically the NAMA bonds were off the State&rsquo;s balance sheet, because they were only guaranteed by the Government, they were real liabilities.  From a statistical point of view they were not on the State&rsquo;s balance sheet, but when the ratings agencies looked at them, they actually put them on the balance sheet.  A number of them, in particular I think it was Standard &amp;amp; Poor&rsquo;s, gave no credit then on the asset side for the value of the NAMA assets, so a very aggressive approach was being taken by the ratings agencies.  There was general pressure on but in my experience at the NAMA board meetings, NAMA looked at its sales programmes, its sales process and its strategy purely in the context of the NAMA Act and the question of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Corrigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1479373200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Was there nothing specific to Project Eagle?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#E00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479373200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>No.  The mood music was there in the background that we had to get on with this but there was no specific pressure on NAMA and certainly we looked at things in the context of section 10 and section 2 of the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Corrigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1479373200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>In regard to when the sales process ceased to be confidential, when the information ended up in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, did Mr. Corrigan consider a review of the strategy to sell?

My fear was that something would go wrong and that possibility would go away and we would revert to dealing with the portfolio piecemeal.  That would have been very slow.  I never liked the Northern Ireland property market.  My belief was that it would perform badly.  I thought we would be better holding assets elsewhere.

There were a lot of shopping centres, which I believed would be an Achilles&rsquo; heel and indeed the Deputy has probably seen the close-down of retail in the UK.

It stated:<\/p><blockquote>In April 2013, PIMCO was approached by Mr. Tuvi Keinan, a partner at the law firm Brown Rudnick who then introduced PIMCO to Mr. Ian Coulter of Tughans and Mr. Frank Cushnahan, with whom Brown Rudnick appeared to be working to identify potential purchasers for the NAMA Northern Irish loan portfolio (which later became known as Project Eagle).  As we understood it, PIMCO was one of three firms who were approached at the time by these three parties.<\/blockquote><p>This was in April 2013.  The first discussions Mr. Mulcahy would have had as a board member was when PIMCO approached the NAMA board.  Brown Rudnick, Ian Coulter of Tughans and Mr. Frank Cushnahan were approached by PIMCO well before PIMCO made any approach to NAMA.

Given that this made up 50% of the loan portfolio, clearly it was an issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#L00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479373200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>That was a matter for the chairman of the Northern Ireland advisory committee to decide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Corrigan"},{"type":"speech","time":1479373200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>Was it not an issue for Mr. Corrigan, as a board member?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#L00900","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479373200,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I was not at the Northern Ireland advisory committee.

At no point was there ever a discussion at the Northern Ireland advisory committee on any specific borrower or any specific property.  That is a really important point to put on the record.  It was always a strategic discussion with the paramount focus being on the expeditious requirement of NAMA to sell the assets in the interest of the Irish taxpayers, with a stakeholder focus which was the Northern Ireland cohort within the country of Ireland.  It was a collaborative, strategic committee.  That was its purpose and that was how it carried out its duties.  We, and all members including the external members, were fully aware of its terms of reference and complied with the restrictions, which required confidentiality at the borrower level.  During my term of office, which coincided with the term of office of Mr. Cushnahan prior to his resignation, there were four disclosures at the committee.  They were not disclosed in the minute details but my recollection is that they referenced two or three borrowers.  At no point was there a disclosure about PIMCO.  It is really important to understand that up until the end of December 2013, the involvement of PIMCO or any other Northern Ireland party was not disclosed at the committee and therefore the board would not have had knowledge of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#L02300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Eacute;ilish Finan"},{"type":"speech","time":1479373200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>The Chairman might bear in mind that I lent some of my time to finish off a question for Deputy Cullinane.

At this stage, it becomes apparent there is a problem with PIMCO.  The problem is around fixer's fees or success fees.  Mr. Corrigan does not have to rehearse that they are normal and all that because we have heard that evidence and it is on the record.  Mr. Corrigan discovered that Mr. Cushnahan was in the middle of all this and it caused concern.  I am sure Mr. Corrigan shared those concerns.  I have no doubt Mr. Corrigan was taken aback to hear of this turn of events.  What I want to ask Mr. Corrigan about very specifically is a reference in those minutes to the date of April 2013.  It is the minutes of 13 March on page 118 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  If one looks at it, in the course of what is recorded within the minutes, it says \"The board noted that PIMCO had advised that the negotiations had commenced in April 2013\".  This is as the board is discussing Mr. Cushnahan and the success fees and so on.  I raised this matter with Mr. Corrigan's colleague, Mr. Ellingham, who initially suggested this was a typo.  He subsequently clarified for the committee that it is not a typo and that the date is correct.  That date, as Mr. Corrigan will know, pre-dates the unsolicited approach to NAMA by Brown Rudnick.  What I want to know is why that date of April 2013 is in there?  I want to tease this out with Mr. Corrigan.  This suggests to me that when the board was told about Mr. Cushnahan's involvement and that he was lined up to get a success fee, the board was also told that the genesis of this fee pre-dated any approach that was made officially to NAMA and that Frank Cushnahan was involved in discussions, negotiations and so on back as early as April 2013.

In early 2010, which was when the rate was struck, two considerations arose, as is correct.  First, the prevailing rate of increase of Government bonds at the time, which was approximately 1.5%.  Second, the perceived risk premium - this involves judgment - which the NAMA board deemed to be 4% in 2010.  We came to the 5.5% figure, which was then applied, from an accounting theoretical standpoint, to strike the carrying value.  Subsequently, every quarter, but especially year-end, there was an assessment of that carrying value.  What we were allowed to modify, as per the accounting standards, was the EIR rate, because that is locked once a company decides in accordance with IAS 39 on the take-on value of those loans.  Periodically, indeed every calendar year, we looked at the fair value of the underlying loans, not the underlying collateral assets.  In 2012, for example, the fair value of the loans, as disclosed in the NAMA financial statements, was actually discounted at 10%.  This was because the market had moved.  I have no bias towards the ultimate decision because I was not party to it.  However, to say that the carrying value at a discount rate of 5.5%, as decided in 2010, should somehow dictate the commercial transaction which, in the end, is defined by a market involving a willing buyer and a willing seller, is simply not a logical commercial transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#V00500","nonspeaker":"Ms &Eacute;ilish Finan"},{"type":"speech","time":1479373200,"counter":811,"content":"<p>That is fine.

There have been discussions about the borrowers and the failure of those borrowers.  There was also a sense of ill-liquidity in the Northern Ireland market.  NAMA was trying to sell a composite portfolio piecemeal.  Mr. Mulcahy is right.  Selling piecemeal over time was still a relatively short period.  Sale by 2020 was the strategic ambition of NAMA and the State in the best interests of the State.<\/p><p>There were, therefore, colours of strategic influence here.  One was the borrowers - absolutely - and the other was the illiquidity in the Northern Irish market.  The record and the transaction which had successfully been done in the Northern Ireland portfolio up until autumn 2013 gleaned about &euro;100 million of sales.  If one looks at the records, predominately the borrowers were put to enforcement.  So if one stress tests that decision strategically - if one holds the assets, and bear in mind we only had the luxury really until 2020 or early thereafter - one is looking at probably enforcement of a majority of Northern Ireland, which actually is financially draining.  The strategic element here, on behalf of the Irish taxpayer, was that there was a lot of uncertainty around holding those assets for what effectively was a relatively short window.  There was a known potential to deleverage the Irish NAMA balance sheet at &euro;1.322 billion.  I did not participate in the absolute decision of &euro;1.322 billion but the initial consideration and reference here - the change in strategy - was absolutely cognisant of the intricacies and complications about the Northern Ireland market, borrowers, politics and all that goes with that.

It is not to do with this.  It relates to the PIMCO letter we received and read into the record last week.  The phone call referred to in the minutes deals with the arrangement of the fee.  The minutes recorded categorically based on the phone call talk about the fee-sharing arrangement that had been put in place by PIMCO.  That is based on the phone calls with PIMCO.  However, PIMCO's letter to us last week stated:<\/p><blockquote>It should be noted that the reference to &quot;a success fee arrangement (being) in place between PIMCO and Brown Rudnick&quot; noted in the report [the Comptroller and Auditor General's report] is inaccurate.  Whilst an arrangement was proposed by Brown Rudnick, it was never agreed to by PIMCO.<\/blockquote> <p>Before us, up to this letter, we have the record of the minutes that state there was a fee in place, we have the board minutes that state the fee was in place.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report states that a fee was in place.  PIMCO's letter to us last week stated that there was never a fee in place; it was requested.  All I am saying is that the jury is out regarding those contradictory views.  In the interest of fairness, I want nobody to say just because NAMA said it, it is true and PIMCO is wrong.  Equally, I want nobody to say just because PIMCO wrote it in a letter, it is correct and NAMA is wrong.  I have to be fair.

We asked what happened and when and PIMCO indicated it was approached by Brown Rudnick, acting on behalf of and with Mr. Coulter and Mr. Cushnahan.

My name is Mark Neporent.  I am the chief operating officer and general counsel for Cerberus Capital Management.  I appear before the committee today on behalf of that entity and also with the authority and permission of our affiliates, Cerberus European Investments and Cerberus European Capital Advisors.  For today&rsquo;s purposes, I will refer to all of those entities and their affiliates as Cerberus.<\/p> <p>  As stated in the committee's letter to me dated 17 October 2016, Cerberus was invited before the committee to assist it in its examination of the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General with respect to the following matters: how Cerberus became involved in the Project Eagle sales process; the basis for Cerberus submitting its bid; Cerberus&rsquo;s engagement of Brown Rudnick; and the context around the assurances that were provided to NAMA regarding Cerberus&rsquo;s advisors and fee arrangements.  Cerberus welcomes this opportunity to assist the committee in its work.  I will start by reading this prepared statement that I hope will assist the committee in understanding our position on these matters and in respect of the Project Eagle sales process.<\/p> <p>  Cerberus is a private investment firm based in New York City and has been a leading investor in loan portfolios for over twenty years in the Americas, Asia and Europe.  Our investment strategy often focuses on the acquisition of sub-performing or non-performing loans, which we refer to as NPLs, many of which are secured by real estate.  Cerberus combines financial expertise with the infrastructure, capital and experience to service these NPLs, including the utilisation of our network of loan servicers.  As the largest, or one of the largest, acquirers of NPLs in the world, we have engaged in over 80 transactions in many different countries, with more than 40 sellers since 2010, pursuant to which we have acquired over 1.2 million loans from over 1.2 million borrowers, which had an aggregate unpaid principal balance, UPB, of over $80 billion.<\/p><p> Cerberus first became aware of the opportunity to purchase the Project Eagle portfolio when it received an unsolicited approach from Lazard on behalf of NAMA on 6 February 2014.  At that time, Cerberus had no knowledge of the transaction or any of the other bidders or advisers involved.  We note that PIMCO's submission to this committee dated 8 November 2016 states that three potential bidders were contacted by Brown Rudnick in 2013.  Cerberus was not one of those bidders.  At no time prior or subsequent to our involvement in Project Eagle has Cerberus worked directly or indirectly with PIMCO or any other actual or prospective bidder in the Project Eagle process.  Cerberus was formally admitted to the process on 14 February 2014.  NAMA openly communicated at the outset that it had set an initial reserve price of &pound;1.3 billion for the Project Eagle assets.  That reserve price was later revised downward by NAMA to &pound;1.23 billion to reflect interim asset sales or resolutions by NAMA and, again, this was openly communicated to Cerberus by Lazard on behalf of NAMA.  Lazard, on behalf of NAMA, made it plain from the start that the timeline for the sale process would be condensed and that only limited information would be made available in the data room.  Although this presented Cerberus with certain challenges, the process and the timeline was manageable given the depth of our team and our experience.  Cerberus submitted its bid of &pound;1.241 billion to NAMA on 1 April 2014.<\/p><p> The Cerberus preparation of its bid entailed the careful consideration of numerous factors, including the analysis of information made available to Cerberus in the data room.  Although Cerberus did not know what competing bids would be made, we believed, based upon our discussions with Lazard, that other bidders were taking the process very seriously and that if we were to be successful, we would need to submit a competitively priced bid at or above the stated reserve price.  Cerberus was informed on the evening of 3 April 2014 that its bid had been accepted by the board of NAMA.  NAMA announced the sale on 4 April 2014.  We have since learned that Cerberus submitted the highest bid.  Our bid was approximately &pound;141 million higher than the next highest bid.  We were the only bidder to bid above the reserve price and to allocate the purchase price as requested by NAMA in its terms.  The acquisition was formally closed on 20 June 2014, several months after the announcement of the award.  The purchase price is as shown at figure 2.2 on page 28 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  We note that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report suggests that NAMA believes Cerberus owes it approximately &pound;2.8 million under the applicable purchase documents, which, if my maths is correct, equates to 0.0023% of the purchase price.  We do not agree with the figures cited and there is an ongoing reconciliation process which typically occurs with transactions of this size and complexity.  We are engaged in an active and professional dialogue with NAMA on this matter and expect that a mutually satisfactory resolution will be reached very shortly which will result in an additional payment by Cerberus to NAMA.<\/p><p> Although Cerberus has extensive experience in acquiring and managing real estate portfolios in Europe, we had no investment history or experience in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland prior to the acquisition of the Project Eagle portfolio.  A decision by Cerberus to invest in a new jurisdiction is not undertaken lightly but only following careful research, investigation and due diligence to ensure we understand the local political, social and business concerns relating to the proposed investment.  We recognised the added complexity with Project Eagle because the loans were under the ownership and control of NAMA, a Republic of Ireland governmental entity, while the portfolio was comprised primarily of Northern Ireland assets.  The Project Eagle transaction was not a simple acquisition of assets, but as we anticipated, it has resulted in substantial ongoing involvement in the local markets, including detailed work-out activities and negotiations with borrowers.  Cerberus was keen to understand whether there were local sensitivities associated with making an investment in Northern Ireland.  Accordingly, we adhered to our long-standing practice of having senior Cerberus executives engage with representatives of the Northern Ireland Executive to explain our investment strategy and practice and to understand local political, social and business concerns relating to our proposed investment.  As a global investment firm, we understand the need to be sensitive to such concerns and to engage as a good corporate citizen.  We expended significant time, effort and money to ensure we developed a comprehensive understanding of the political, social and business issues relating to an investment in Project Eagle before we decided to commit this large amount of capital.  The decision to bid in the Project Eagle process was taken only after these due diligence efforts.<\/p><p> It is common with acquisitions of this type for Cerberus to engage a number of lawyers and other professional advisers to assist it in the preparation of a bid.  As stated above, the need for a wide range of advisory and support services was particularly acute in these circumstances.  Cerberus engaged Brown Rudnick as one of its advisers to provide both legal and strategic services in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Project Eagle portfolio.  Brown Rudnick was formally engaged on 24 March 2014.  This engagement followed an unsolicited approach to Cerberus from Mr. Tuvi Keinan, a partner at Brown Rudnick, in mid-March 2014 offering his firm's services in connection with the Project Eagle portfolio.  Brown Rudnick explained that it could assist Cerberus with its due diligence and evaluation of the Project Eagle portfolio.  Brown Rudnick did not itself have a presence in Northern Ireland but advised Cerberus that it had been working with Tughans and its managing partner, Mr. Ian Coulter.  We understood Tughans to be a well-regarded local law firm.  Brown Rudnick provided Cerberus with due diligence material containing information and research relating to the portfolio's borrowers' guarantees, assets and potential business plans.  Brown Rudnick directly advised Cerberus that Brown Rudnick was at liberty to share this information.  Brown Rudnick also offered to provide legal and strategic advice relating to the bid process and to help Cerberus position itself effectively with key stakeholders.<\/p><p> As the timeframe for the submission of a bid was condensed and only limited data had been made available in the data room, Cerberus understood that there was potential value in the services Brown Rudnick, and through Brown Rudnick, Tughans, was offering.  Brown Rudnick proposed from the outset to be paid a fee of &pound;15 million for its services.  It was agreed that Brown Rudnick would share half of the fee with Tughans, who would be engaged by Brown Rudnick, not by Cerberus, to supplement Brown Rudnick's work.  The proposed fee was only payable in the event that Cerberus completed the deal and succeeded in acquiring the Project Eagle portfolio.  Ultimately, Cerberus agreed to the fee on the basis that the services offered were expected to be especially useful under the circumstances and, when looked at as a percentage of the reserve price, the fee was approximately 1.1%, which we viewed as within a customary advisory fee range.  Brown Rudnick also told Cerberus that if Cerberus did not wish to enter into this arrangement, it would offer its services to another prospective bidder.<\/p><p> Cerberus is committed to high ethical standards in the conduct of its business.  This commitment is and always has been a paramount component of our culture and what we call our \"tone at the top\".  Prior to engaging Brown Rudnick, the Cerberus legal and compliance team held discussions with Mr Keinan and a number of other partners at Brown Rudnick, including a partner based in London who had previously been the head of enforcement at the UK's Financial Services Authority.<\/p><p>Cerberus was formally assured that Brown Rudnick was able to enter into the proposed arrangement, provide the services being offered and share the information Cerberus was told had already been compiled by Brown Rudnick.  The Cerberus legal and compliance team negotiating the terms of engagement with Brown Rudnick required Brown Rudnick to provide certifications, representations and warranties covering a number of issues, including compliance with anti-bribery and corruption laws.  Cerberus also required Brown Rudnick to obtain the same representations and warranties from Tughans, which it did.<\/p><p> In advance of Cerberus being selected as the preferred bidder, NAMA sought and Cerberus provided information on the way in which it had agreed to compensate its advisers.  Cerberus disclosed this information, including its engagement of Brown Rudnick, Brown Rudnick's engagement of Tughans and the existence of the success fee arrangement.  This was known to NAMA in advance of its announcement on 4 April 2014 of Cerberus as its preferred bidder and well in advance of the closure of the transaction on 20 June 2014. <\/p><p> NAMA also requested certain assurances from Cerberus that no fee, commission or other remuneration or payment was payable to any current or former board member of NAMA, any current or former member of the executive of NAMA or any current or former member of an advisory committee of NAMA in connection with any aspect of Cerberus's participation in the tender process.  Cerberus sought and obtained specific confirmations on the matters requested by NAMA directly from both Brown Rudnick and Tughans.  Only after receiving these specific confirmations from Brown Rudnick and Tughans and in a reliance on them, did Cerberus respond to NAMA providing the assurances sought.  Aside from seeking these assurances, NAMA did not express any concern or reservation about Cerberus having engaged Brown Rudnick, or Brown Rudnick's engagement of Tughans.  <\/p><p> Cerberus is confident that no improper or illegal payments have been made by Cerberus or any of its affiliates in connection with the Project Eagle portfolio.  Cerberus did not direct or authorise anyone to make any such payment on its behalf.  Until it was informed by Brown Rudnick on 18 April 2015 of the Law Society of Northern Ireland's investigation into Mr. Ian Coulter's conduct, Cerberus had no knowledge of Mr. Coulter's alleged use of the Tughans fee or his alleged intentions.  The terms of our engagement expressly prohibited Brown Rudnick from engaging any other person to work on this transaction.  For the record, Cerberus had no contact or dealings with Mr. Frank Cushnahan at any point before, during or after the acquisition of the Project Eagle portfolio. <\/p><p> We invested in Project Eagle in good faith.  We are confident that we behaved and acted appropriately at all times and that without a doubt our actions have been professional and correct.  Project Eagle is the subject of the UK National Crime Agency's ongoing investigation and also investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice in the United States.  We are co-operating fully with these investigations.  As they are ongoing, there are limits to what I will be able to discuss today.  I am also restricted in discussing individual borrower cases and commercially sensitive information because of strict confidentiality rules and obligations owed to borrowers and investors.  Where I can, I will seek to be as helpful as possible to the committee.<\/p><p> That completes the introductory remarks that I wish to make.  Cerberus very much appreciates the committee's invitation to attend this meeting and allow us to share our perspective.

I do not doubt his credentials or those of Cerberus in general but there is one line in the statement at paragraph 4.1 to the effect that Cerberus is committed to high ethical standards in the conduct of its business and that this commitment is and always has been a paramount component of its culture and tone at the top.  I do not like the tone of this comment.  It very much goes to the crux of the issue with regard to Mr. Neporent and his firm.  It smacks a little of elitism and a culture that exists.  Before Mr. Neporent arrived, we spoke about the auspicious name of the firm, Cerberus, which is the three-headed dog that guards the gates of hell.  It is quite interesting because it seems to be guarding a culture of opportunism and, in my view, there was opportunism at play.  Mr. Neporent stated that there was an unsolicited approach from Brown Rudnick to the firm but, nonetheless, questions arise in respect of the process in itself.<\/p><p>At the bottom of paragraph 3.3, Mr. Neporent states that at no time prior or subsequent to Cerberus's involvement with Project Eagle did it work directly or indirectly with PIMCO or any other actual or prospective bidder involved in the process relating to project.  He also states, at paragraph 3.13, that Brown Rudnick provided Cerberus with due diligence material, a point he confirmed earlier to Deputy Cullinane and two other Deputies.  These statements do not tally because there is an indirect link.  A moment ago, Mr. Neporent stated Brown Rudnick had a contractual right to share information with Cerberus.  This is of concern because in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General there were many complaints by other bidders who stated they did not receive enough information on the portfolio assets or enough time.  I am of the view that Cerberus was given an unfair advantage because of the salient and vital information it had on making the bid.  It was also the only bidder over the reserve price.  It is also very interesting that it had no investment history - Mr. Neporent stated this himself - in Northern Ireland heretofore.  Then it engaged this firm which approached it and an opportunity was taken.  Cerberus took an opportunity.  The risk was taken only on the basis that it would secure the bid.  This is the underlying theme.  The comment made, almost as an <i>obiter dictum<\/i>or off-the-cuff remark, about tone at the top indicates this to me.<\/p><p>What is also interesting is that NAMA described the assets as low value but Cerberus was still interested in bidding.  I know I have spoken a little bit, but I would like Mr. Neporent to answer some of this for me, if he does not mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#NN00500","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479373200,"counter":1191,"content":"<p>I am not sure if there is a question in there-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#NN00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Neporent"},{"type":"speech","time":1479373200,"counter":1192,"content":"<p>There is a question-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#NN00700","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479373200,"counter":1193,"content":"<p>-----but if the Deputy could articulate the question, I will be happy to answer it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2016111700002#NN00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Neporent"},{"type":"speech","time":1479373200,"counter":1194,"content":"<p>-----and the question relates to whether the means justify the end.

Mr. Maxim Peshkov, to today's meeting to discuss, among other items, the situation in Syria and Ukraine.  We are all shocked on a daily basis by the suffering of the people of Syria, particularly the people in Aleppo where the constant bombardment has affected so many lives killing and injuring thousands of civilians.  The rest of the world has a duty to do everything in its power to ensure this ceases as soon as possible.  As we in this country are very aware, this can only be achieved by dialogue between the opposing groups.  The carnage and horrors inflicted upon the people of Syria cannot be allowed to continue.<\/p><p>Before I call on the ambassador to make his contribution, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference with the recording and broadcasting equipment in the chamber even in silent mode.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>I now call on H.E. Mr. Maxim Peshkov to make his opening remarks.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016111700002#E00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479376800,"counter":1676,"content":"<p>I am very grateful for this invitation.  The direct exchange of views on any issues of interest to both sides is positive and helpful to deepening the understanding between us, our countries and our countries' politicians.<\/p> <p>  First of all, it is my duty to say a couple of words about the bilateral relations between Russia and Ireland.  I must stress that we are ready for business interaction on all levels, including contacts between parliamentarians of both countries.  In previous years, Russian and Irish parliamentarians planned some positive initiatives, for example, the boosting of activities of the group of friends of Russia in the D&aacute;il and the visit of the speaker of the council of federation, the upper house, of the federal assembly of the Russian Federation, Mrs. Valentina Matvienko, to Ireland. <\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, I do not have the exact figures for this year, but in 2015, the volume of Russian-Irish bilateral trade decreased by 32.5% in comparison with 2014 and came to $1.1 billion.  Russian exports fell by 19% and came to $271.6 million.  Imports from Ireland dropped by 36% to $831.6 million.  Therefore, Ireland is on the slightly more positive side from the point of view of our trade exchange.  This year, we have very interesting projects of co-operation between Russia and Ireland, mainly in aviation.  I am sure that these plans and projects will grow wider and deeper.<\/p> <p>  Ireland ranks in seventh place among foreign investors to Russia, behind Germany, the UK, China, the Netherlands, Luxemburg and Cyprus.   As we see it, our task is to preserve gained potential of the trade and economic relations and, if possible, to increase it by introducing new projects in spheres of mutual beneficial interest.  I must stress that economics and trade are not the only focus of our attention.  We have very close relations and co-operation in fields of humanitarian activity, education, arts, culture and so on and so forth.  The committee will know that annually in Russia we have traditional Irish events, such as St. Patrick's Day.  We also celebrate a pancake day in Russia, as is done in Ireland.  It is one of our biggest cultural events.  Groups and artists from Russia come to Ireland from time to time to show their art.  As far as I know, at the end of this month, there will be a ballet group from St. Petersburg and an opera group from Russia performing in Ireland.  That is ongoing.  <\/p> <p>  I prefer not to lecture.  I prefer to answer questions.<\/p><p> There were two points on the proposal for our meeting - Syria and Ukraine.  The main point of our position on Syria is that the only possible way to solve the Syrian crisis is through political means.  As far as we understand, the results of the last contact between our President and President-elect Trump was that this point is mutual for both sides.  We will see how we will manage it but the only forces that must be and are excluded from the peace process are terrorists, mainly ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra.  Those two forces are officially proclaimed as terrorist organisations.  They are the main goals of our attacks in Syria and, as far as we know, they are the main goals of the attacks by the coalition led by the United States in Iraq.<\/p><p> As for Aleppo, unfortunately, too many fakes and lies are circulating about this part of Syria including the bombing of civilians, the use of unconventional weapons and so on.  The Chairman is right.  Civilians are being killed there but the question is by whom.  As far as we know, there are dozens of shelling incidents every day from the eastern part of Aleppo against the western part of Aleppo.  Members will know that this eastern part of Aleppo is under the control of terrorists mixed with opposition forces.  The western part is under the control of the Government of Syria.<\/p><p> Accusations and allegations have been made, particularly in recent days, that Russia is using its air force to bomb and so on.  I stress and remind the members that as of today, it has been exactly one month since we used our air force in Aleppo.  We stopped it on 17 October, one month ago from today.  Syria's air force is doing the same, therefore, allegations or accusations about Russia bombing schools, hospitals and so on in Aleppo are a complete lie.  There was a briefing in the State Department yesterday at which the official representative, if I am not mistaken, spoke about six hospitals and one school that was bombed and so on.  He was asked to show the address of the school and the hospitals.  There was no answer.  Every time we ask for the facts in terms of where, who and how, we do not get an answer.<\/p><p>With an array of American and Russian military satellites over this zone, which can control every square metre of the situation, it is very questionable as to why they do not show maps or video materials.  Where is the evidence?  If real evidence is shown, it is okay.  If not, it is a lie.  I am sure there will be more questions about Syria.<\/p><p> As for Ukraine, I will be very short.  Our position is the Minsk agreements must be fulfilled.  It is the only way out of this situation in the eastern parts of Ukraine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016111700002#F00100","nonspeaker":"H.E.

It is impossible to guarantee 100% the security of every civilian.  Does the Chairman know that for more than one month we organised and guaranteed six humanitarian routes to eastern Aleppo, as well as two additional routes for the opposition, as we can call it, to leave eastern Aleppo?  Unfortunately, very few people use these routes.  Why?  The radicals on that side of Aleppo closed these routes, meaning very few people have had a chance to go away from Aleppo.<\/p> <p>  In the Syrian Government part of Aleppo, there are camps and hospitals for people coming from eastern Aleppo.  Just yesterday, we sent six children from Aleppo to Russia for treatment.  They have special diseases which could not be treated in Syria itself.  The six children, with their parents, are now in Russia going through this period of treatment.  These are not wounds from shooting, but serious diseases like musculoskeletal diseases.  Every week, we are sending our own humanitarian assistance to Aleppo.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, according to our information, when this assistance of food and medicine reaches the eastern part of Aleppo, the biggest part of it is caught by terrorists or opposition - however one wants to call them - and civilians get a smaller part of this humanitarian assistance.  The same assistance is given via the Red Crescent of Damascus.  In these activities, the United Nations humanitarian bodies are taking part also and we assist them in sending these commodities to Aleppo, and we are doing our best.<\/p><p> We are not aiming at any civilian populated zones with our shelling.  War is war, as the committee will understand, but we have had very clear and good intelligence there in place of a technical nature, from space, by drones and by those working in the field.  We aim our bombs and shelling only at the places where real terrorists are situated.  It is rather difficult.  By the way, as the committee will be aware, two days ago a rather big fleet of our naval ships came to the Mediterranean and we began our new shelling from these ships of the zones where terrorists are situated.  They say several bases and a factory where they were producing explosives were hit by our rockets.<\/p><p> Also, we may be closer to part of the political solution of this problem.  The committee will be aware that our military forces have been in Syria for more than one year.  During this year, we managed to sign nearly 900 local peace agreements with local groups of opposition, groups of villages, smaller cities, towns etc.  We feel that it is part of a real political process.  Maybe some of these Syrians who take part are backing Assad and his team.  Others call themselves \"opposition\", but they are not fighting.  They have their arms, they have their munitions but they are not fighting with Damascus.  They say that they are ready to take part in a wider political process.  As for how it will be managed, a basis exists in the Geneva communiqu&eacute;.  The roadmap is clearly written in this but the negotiations are ready.<\/p><p> By the way, we, the Russian side, not only have contacts with Damascus and with our western or eastern partners about Syria, but have contacts, negotiations and talks with the representatives of the Syrian opposition.<\/p><p>It is ongoing.  We are not angels and the committee members are not angels either.  Bashar al-Assad is not an angel at all.  We live in real life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016111700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

It is good to have this conversation, and the ambassador mentioned the importance of dialogue.  Regardless of who is doing what to whom in Syria, we can all agree it is an appalling humanitarian crisis.  When I looked at footage from the siege of Aleppo, it reminded me very much of the footage I saw of the siege of Stalingrad.  The Russian people have been in that situation and I hope, just as so much went into the rebuilding of Russia, that people will be prepared to do as much when the time comes for the rebuilding of Syria.<\/p> <p>  On getting aid to civilians as well as access to food, water and medical aid, we talk about medical aid for the victims of the war but what has been forgotten is the vital medical aid for those who had illnesses before the war started, such as diabetes, asthma and a range of cancers.  Those people have gone very far down the list when it comes to aid.  There are dangers that the aid is selective, with aid going to certain places but not to others and so forth.  I wish to hear a little more on that.  The ambassador mentioned that children are being evacuated, but will he say more about what Russia is doing?  The ambassador is critical of the UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Damascus, so will he elaborate a little on Russia's role in the humanitarian agenda?  Many countries are bombing Syria.  It is incredible that a peaceful protest years ago has degenerated into the current situation.  This was a functioning country with access to medicine and education, regardless of the human rights issues there.  My first question was about aid.  Has Russia taken any refugees as other countries are doing?  We are all aware of the refugee situation.<\/p> <p>  Second, will the ambassador go into more detail about the peace process and what he sees as Russia's role in it?  Does he agree that all the players must be involved?  He mentioned the roadmap but it would be good to hear more about it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Ukraine, the ambassador said political dialogue is the way forward.  There is an agreement for the Foreign Ministers to meet.  Is that happening?  How soon can we expect to see an end to that situation?<\/p> <p>  Russia has withdrawn from the International Criminal Court.  Perhaps the ambassador would elaborate on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016111700002#K00300","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":1685,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassador.  We would all agree that few of us here are angels, so there is agreement on that for a start.  However, we can all accept that the situation in Syria is truly one of the worst humanitarian disasters we have witnessed in recent times.  I wish to put it on the record that I do not see myself as a pacifist so I am not approaching this from that angle.  However, we must be consistent with the principles of international law.  I believe that the use of force can sometimes be necessary as a last resort to prevent the deaths of others or the repression of people.  I have been horrified by the brutality, the violations of international law and the suspected war crimes being carried out by all sides in the conflict.  That is my perspective.<\/p> <p>  I watched an interview recently with the UN ambassador to Syria.  He spoke about the aerial bombing of eastern Aleppo.  His belief was that Russia had come to the conclusion that the aerial bombardment was not working.  Russia has resumed that aerial bombardment.  It is supposed to be aimed at ousting approximately 900 whom the ambassador describes as terrorists.  However, there is a population of 250,000 or more in that area.  Does he believe there is a military solution to the conflict in Syria?<\/p> <p>  We have all watched reports about the hospital.<\/p><p> Is the ambassador stating the hospital that was supposed to have been bombed in the past couple of days does not exist?  If so, will he elaborate on that?<\/p><p> The humanitarian corridors in eastern Aleppo have failed.  The UN have vented their frustration that aid has not been allowed into Aleppo.  What is the reason for the failure of the humanitarian initiative? <\/p><p> I am a supporter of the International Criminal Court, ICC, and it needs to investigate all sides in the conflict.  President Putin signed an order to withdraw Russia from the ICC yesterday.  Can the ambassador elaborate on and outline the reason that Russia is withdrawing?  Is Russia seeking to block efforts by France and other EU member states who are supporting the efforts to launch an investigation into war crimes in Syria, and in particular to bring President Assad to the International Criminal Court?  Mr. Peshkov posed a question as to who is sponsoring the jihadists in eastern Aleppo.  Does he have a view on what countries in the region are involved?  Will he elaborate on that?  I have asked already whether this is a solution to the seven years of conflict.  I reiterate the only way forward is through dialogue, inclusive round-table talks, world leaders using their influence and so on.  It is foolish to believe we can bomb to a solution to the Syrian conflict.<\/p><p> In regard to the Ukraine, I am in the minority on this committee, but I think the Ukrainian people have suffered under corrupt and ineffective governments for far too long.  There has been a deterioration in the socioeconomic conditions and an effective bankruptcy of the Ukrainian State.  This probably also is a minority position but I think some of the recent problems in Ukraine stem from the EU, US and Russia playing a zero-sum political game with Ukraine.  Rather than trying to railroad Ukraine down one particular political route, I think the EU and Russia should have been working together to try to create some sort of beneficial and non-exclusive economic and political social relationship with Ukraine.  I think that is the solution in that region. <\/p><p> I have a number of questions on it.  The conflict has claimed 9,000 lives, tens of thousands of people have been displaced.  In the opinion of the ambassador, why has so little progress been made in implementing the proposals outlined in the Minsk agreements? <\/p><p> The referendum that took place in Crimea on 16 March 2015 was another factor in escalating the crisis.  As the referendum was held under the worst possible conditions, including poor security, a tense atmosphere, international pressure, the short run-in, the lack of open and democratic debate, press restrictions and the lack of dialogue preceding the referendum, would the ambassador agree the referendum was not in line with good democratic practice?  I am not opposed to referendums to decide self-determination but there must be agreement on good democratic practice and I do not see it in this situation.<\/p><p> A Dutch-led investigation has concluded that a powerful surface-to-air missile system was used to shoot down Malaysia Airlines' plane over Ukraine two years ago, killing all 298 people on board.  It was trucked in from Russia at the request of the Russian-backed separatists and returned to Russia the same night.  What is the ambassador's response to that damning report?  <\/p><p> The Turkish military shot down a Russian jet in November 2015, but recently there seems to be a warming between the two countries.  Is he concerned about the serious issue of Turkey's role in continuing to arm, train and fuel jihadists involved in the Syrian conflict?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016111700002#K00400","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":1687,"content":"<p>I invite the ambassador to respond to the items raised by Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Crowe, following which we will ask the other members to ask any further questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016111700002#M00100","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479376800,"counter":1688,"content":"<p>I will start at the very beginning.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked about humanitarian aid, medicine, etc.  Part of this issue connects to Deputy Crowe's question about who is to blame for the humanitarian routes not working.  I ask the committee to believe me when I say that Russia is not to blame.  We open them and we do not block them.  We try to use them.  I will explain what we are doing with regard to medicine.  Our hospitals are working directly in Syria.  Mobile hospitals linked with our military base are working in Syria.  Some of our non-military doctors and medical personnel are working in local hospitals.  Of course we would like to do more, but we are doing what we can.  We do not see any other foreigners doing the same things from a medical point of view.  We are the only ones doing this work on this side of the situation.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan also asked about refugees.  I do not think we have many refugees from Syria in Russia.  Perhaps some families have moved to Russia, but I do not think very many have done so.  Those who come to Russia from Syria tend to have family or ethnic links with people living in Russia.  I know there are such links between Kurds.  We have a rather big Kurdish diaspora in Russia.  Some family members of people who have migrated to Russia - perhaps not forever - have travelled to Russia to stay with their relatives, etc.  In many cases, those who are already living in Russia are from nations other than Syria, especially the nations of the Caucasus region.<\/p> <p>  I would not be able to tell the committee exactly how many foreign migrants live in Russia.  I think it is between 6 million and 7 million.  Most of them come from the CIS countries.  The majority of these migrants are economic migrants rather than refugees.  We have between 500,000 and 600,000 refugees - not more - and most of them come from the eastern parts of Ukraine.  As the majority of them have refugee status, they have places to live, work, etc.  The whole map of the migrants in our country can be completed with reference to Afghans who fled from Afghanistan when the mujihadeen came to power.  There are some migrants from other countries, but not very many.  The majority of migrants living in Russia are economic migrants from all parts of the CIS countries.<\/p> <p>  The next question Deputy Crowe asked about Syria related to the blocking of the French resolution at the UN Security Council.<\/p><p>The story of this resolution is interesting.  On the eve of the sitting of the UN Security Council the Minister for Foreign Affairs in France was a guest of our Minister in Moscow.  They discussed the contents of the resolution on Syria.  They were working on the text of the document.  We had agreement from the French side to include our position in the resolution.  Both sides were glad and happy and said goodbye.  Our French friend flew to Washington.<\/p><p> After talks with his American colleague, they proposed a draft to the sitting of the UN Security Council.  Not even one paragraph of our position was included in spite of the fact that our French colleague said he would do it.  This resolution was one-sided.  Not one word was included relating to the crimes of terrorists, ISIS or representatives of other terrorist forces and so on.  That is why we expressed our surprise to French colleagues and vetoed this resolution.  That is the simple answer.<\/p><p> I will address both questions about the criminal court.  I am unsure whether the committee is aware of it but neither the United States nor China is a member of this body.  During recent years, South Africa and some other African countries, perhaps Ghana, stepped away from membership of this criminal court.  The only reason is an absence of trust for the body.  During the 14 years of the existence of this criminal court, it has spent $1 billion and worked on only four cases.  In other words, it worked on four cases in 14 years.  That is the answer.  There is no trust and the court is not working at all.<\/p><p> Next is the question of Ukraine.  By the way, how does the Deputy understand the word, \"separatist\"?  That is my question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016111700002#M00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

That is the main idea of the Minsk document.  My advice to the Deputy is to read it attentively.  It is a very interesting document.  All the points necessary to solve this situation in the eastern part of Ukraine are written there paragraph by paragraph.  Everything is clear.  The main idea is that the sides, Kiev and Lugansk and Donetsk, must fulfil the obligations they signed.  As soon as they do that they will find a way out of this crisis, not immediately of course, it must be done step by step.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy talked about the role of Russia, Europe and the United States and other forces to help Ukraine but did not say a single word about what Ukraine must do.  It must do something to solve its own problems.  The Deputy is quite right about the level of corruption in the country.  It is not just my opinion but that of the analysts, even those in the West who write about the situation in Ukraine that the level of corruption is higher than before the coup d'&eacute;tat.  I do not know how to solve this problem.  It is not Russia's problem to solve the corruption problems in Ukraine.  <\/p> <p>  As for co-operation we are ready for any kind of co-operation.  There is a small town in the south of Ukraine called Genichesk.  The Deputy might find it on Google maps.  I tried and found it.  The town has annual problems with gas.  Before the coup d'&eacute;tat in Kiev it was taking gas via Crimea.  When all these things happened it was partially using its own gas but that was not enough for the winter.  Last year and this year the Crimeans opened their pipes to this town and are sending gas to it as a kind of humanitarian assistance because it does have money to pay.  Maybe afterwards there will be an exchange of accounts between Russia and Ukraine on this issue but it does not matter because the Crimean Government decided to give this assistance to its neighbour.  It is the only real way to achieve co-operation and mutual understanding.  The same happened last year when the Crimeans sent gas to this city.  On the contrary, Ukrainian radicals, not the Ukrainian Government or people, cut the electricity lines from continental Ukraine to Crimea.  It was a humanitarian catastrophe and I do not know if the Deputy is aware of this fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016111700002#O00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

That was all.  We said okay.  At the very beginning, during the time even before Yanukovych, we were telling our Ukrainian friends that if they wished to be a member or associated member of the EU, they were welcome, but let Moscow, Kiev and Brussels get together and see what the consequences of this association would be, especially the economic part.  We will have to construct new economic barriers for Ukrainian commodities if Ukraine becomes a member of the European free market.  Why?  It is to guarantee the security of our own economy.  We have special additional agreements with European countries on trade, the economy, tariffs, costs, prices and so forth.  We were telling our Ukrainian friends, &quot;You want to go this way.  Okay, let us sit down and begin the account.  Who will win?  Not us, and not you.&quot;  They did not want to do it, so now what do we see?  The main slogan of the coup d'&eacute;tat was to sign the agreement of association with the EU.  Then the process began.  What do we have now?  There is no result at all - no political association and no economic association.  The reason is that now the Netherlands is against ratification of this agreement.

I conveyed to the ambassador the terms of an all-party Seanad motion, tabled at my instigation, that we had passed condemning the bombardment of civilians in Aleppo and other areas in Syria.  Dialogue is  important on these issues.  As others have said, we are all in agreement about the appalling humanitarian crisis in Syria.  We would all join in condemning outright the brutality ISIS and its allies have perpetrated on the civilian population.  However, there are some clear issues for Russia's representatives to answer, in particular, Russia's involvement in the siege of eastern Aleppo, which has resulted in civilian deaths.  I know the ambassador has responded to some questions about that.  There is the matter of Russia's involvement in particular attacks which are fairly well established, in particular the attack on the aid convoy in September which led to the deaths of 12 aid workers.  We had this discussion last week and I know the ambassador has said that these are fabrications and so on.  Would Russia support international investigations into these attacks, into the deaths of civilians as a result of the bombardment and, if necessary, the bringing of President Assad of Syria before the International Criminal Court?  Would the ambassador support investigations in that way?  That is my first question about Syria.<\/p> <p>  To follow up on Deputy O'Sullivan's question on the peace process, the ambassador described Russia's involvement in negotiating 900 local area agreements to try to stop fighting.  That is very welcome but does he see a way forward to restart the Geneva process and how will Russia try to bring that forward?  With the election of President-elect Donald Trump in the United States, of whom many of us are critical, does the ambassador see a change in approach in negotiations on a resolution of the nearly seven year old war in Syria?<\/p> <p>  On Ukraine, there are some clear issues, if we are all agreed on them, that Russia illegally annexed the Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014.  In response to that and in response to Russia's failure to play a constructive role in the implementation of the Minsk accords, the EU imposed sanctions which Ireland clearly supports.  We were very concerned to see the report yesterday that Russia is repudiating the International Criminal Court, albeit that it is symbolic.

First, I am keen to say that some of us think we are angels.  I have never been involved in anything following which I would have considered myself not to be an angel.  As a country, we are used to conflict and terrorism.  It is not unusual for us to listen to reports of terrible things that have happened to people.  We are used to it.<\/p><p>As has been said by everyone else, the things that have happened to the people of Syria are atrocious.  I am not going to repeat what has been said already.  I have a comment from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation before me.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>We paid attention to the irresponsible statements on Russia that have been popping up with disturbing regularity in connection with the events in Syria ... We cannot but condemn these actions that have been dictated by the biased view of what is happening in Syria and the distorted perception of our actions against terrorists.<\/blockquote> <p>Earlier, the ambassador used the word &quot;fake&quot;.  A saying in Ireland holds that there is no smoke without fire.  Why does the ambassador think these opinions exist?  Why does the world &ndash; I use the term widely &ndash; have these opinions?  What does the ambassador think Russia can do to change the minds of people and to prove that these statements are fake or that these impressions are not true or correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016111700002#R00300","speaker":"1375"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":1714,"content":"<p>Does the ambassador accept that Ukraine and its people are entitled to get on with their lives and make their own decisions on whether they wish to have associate agreements with the EU or anyone else?  Does the ambassador accept that it is about time the Ukrainian people were allowed to do this?  I visited Ukraine twice in an official capacity.  The misinformation one gets is horrifying in this scenario.  I met university students in Ukraine.  They have no intention of joining the EU.  They want to be free to move between Europe and any other part of the world, and they should be allowed to do that.  I am horrified by the misinformation.<\/p> <p>  Let us be truthful and honest about this: there is resentment on the part of Russia that Ukraine is now totally independent.  Russia has taken over Crimea.  Russia should let the Ukrainian people decide for themselves.  They have a government.  Russia should let the people decide whether they go west or east and whether to stay where they are at present.  I see no attempt by the European Union to invite Ukraine as a member state or to interfere in any way with the Ukrainian relationship with Russia.  It is an independent country and it should be allowed to remain independent and make its own decisions.<\/p><p>It is not for the European Union or Russia to interfere with Ukraine in making those decisions.  It is simple as that, as far as I am concerned.  What is happening to Ukraine is a terrible shame, especially when one has had the opportunity, as I have had, to speak to young Ukrainians who just want peace and to get on with their lives and be able to travel freely, like every other citizen within the greater European boundaries.  It is about time we all stopped codding each other about the pretence that we are not interfering.  We are interfering with the independence of Ukraine and it should stop.  The same is happening in Syria.  I have been there on many occasions as a former Minister for Defence.  I used to go there when I visited our troops in Lebanon.  I used to meet the Minister for Defence who was also the Vice President of Syria.  Again, what is happening there is a terrible shame.  We can make all the excuses we want about bombings and killings, but the big question is who is defending what in Syria.  Why are we trying to defend the indefensible?<\/p><p> Every part of the world has become unsettled and it is due mainly to interference by outsiders in solving internal problems.  What are Russia's proposals for Syria?  When does it intend to withdraw from it?  What I would like to know is what is its desired end result in Syria.  Equally, I would like to know what its desired end result in Ukraine is.  Is this going to continue?  Are young people never going to have an opportunity to call themselves Ukrainian and be proud of the fact that they are Ukrainians?  Are they never going to have an opportunity to make their own decisions on whether they want to be part of a European entity or totally independent?  In Ireland we had to put up with this for many centuries and know what it is like.  It is about time we all stood back and asked the question as to what we are trying to achieve.  In the meantime, thousands upon thousands are losing their lives and young people's careers and prospects are being severely damaged.  I would like to hear from the ambassador what exactly is the agenda of the Russian Federation in both countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016111700002#R00400","speaker":"1219","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":1716,"content":"<p>Following on from what Deputy Sean Barrett said, it is a question I would put to other players such as the United States, the European Union and Saudi Arabia.  Is there a real desire to have a just peace in Syria?  What is Russia's position or is it, as we are seeing, just a question of continuing to bomb until eventually somebody throws in the towel and there is a winner?  There will not be any winner in Syria, least of all the Syrian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2016111700002#S00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479376800,"counter":1717,"content":"<p>I will begin with the last question.  The main desire is to rebuild and reconstruct this poor country to make it as stable as it was before.  On who will lead the country, that is not our business.  It is not Ireland's business and it is not the business of the United States, Saudi Arabia, Turkey or any other country.  Syria can manage and solve the problem by voting.  For this process, the roadmap - the Geneva I and Geneva II communiques - outline everything: how, when, what and so on.<\/p><p>One could ask how one should reach what is set out in the Geneva communiqu&eacute;s.  I agree that when we are speaking about the situation in Syria we are speaking about a humanitarian crisis.  I also agree that we are speaking about hostilities, but from time to time we forget with whom we are fighting and what is happening.  I mean not only Russia, but others such as Iranians, Damascus, the United States and their team.  We are fighting with ISIS.  We are fighting with terrorists.  This goal is our united goal.  It is our common goal to fight with those forces.  I do not understand how we can fight without firing or bombing.  I am not a military person.  Perhaps the military knows some special way to fight without fighting but I do not know how.  War is war.<\/p><p> The main thing then is that if we are a little more philosophical and look to the roots of all the events in the Middle East, not only in Syria, but what happened in Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Egypt, Algeria and Syria.  Can we blame Russia?  Did Russia go to Iraq and explode the whole situation in that country?  No.  Did Russia begin the crisis in Syria?  No.  We went there only when the fire was very hot in that country, to help the legal government of Syria to fight with ISIS, with terrorists.  That is our common goal.<\/p><p> I pose a question for everyone.  If one sees a reasonable way out of the situation to fight ISIS and not to harm civilians please tell us, advise us, and not only us but others who take part in the war against terrorists.  It is very simple to theorise, to say something is good or bad but when one gets down to the soil and sees what is happening in reality, it is quite a problem to find a way out and how to solve the problems.  All of us - us, the United States, their coalition, our allies - say that the only real way out is political.  Everybody agrees on that but to reach that stage needs efforts from elsewhere, not only from our side and not only from Damascus, but from those in opposition who calls themselves moderate.  If one calls oneself moderate, then one should show one's readiness for a political solution.  One should agree to a ceasefire and leave the zones where real terrorists are active.  Then we will have a real opportunity to fight with the terrorists.  When I say \"we\" I do not mean only Russia.  I mean all those who are fighting with terrorists in Syria, Iraq and other places.  That is it.<\/p><p>How can it be solved?  God knows, but we are doing our best to reach a deal.  <\/p><p> The next question was about Ukraine and independence.  The Deputy spoke about the Ukrainians and said, \"let the people decide\".  So, he gives this right to Kiev but not to the people of Crimea.  They do not have the right to express their will to live where they want to live, with whom they want to live and so on.  Only Kiev has this right and the Crimean people do not.

Fortunately, local paramilitaries, with no assistance from the Russian military, closed the border and turned the trains back.  That was an attempted invasion.  Of course, the Deputy knows much more than I do about Russia and the Russian military in Crimea.  He must believe me and try to be objective.  If one gives a right to people to do as they want on one side, why not give the same right to people on another side?  <\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, the Ukrainian decision on the European question was not only about visiting Europe.  That was not the main idea.  The main idea was to become an associated part of the European Union.  Maybe some of them were dreaming about membership of the EU but they got a clear answer from Brussels that it would be impossible in the circumstances.  Even the issue of association is now rather fragile.  The main idea was to attempt to turn Ukraine's economic priorities towards Europe.  As we see it, they were attempting to be fed by two mothers.  They wanted to have good co-operation with Russia and, at the same time, very good co-operation with Europe.  We said, \"Okay, we are not against that\".

A copy of the presentation has been circulated in advance to members of the committee.  In the time allocated to me, I do not propose to go through the pack in detail.  Therefore, my opening remarks will reference a number of slides and I will hopefully deal with those.<\/p> <p>  Our presentation includes a range of details, including updates on key highlights from the bank's interim results for the first six months of 2016; our interim management statement from 28 October 2016 which updated the market on our financial performance; the regulatory environment in which our bank operates; our mortgage business and our approach to mortgage pricing; our position on mortgage arrears; and some details on the governance we have both internally and externally.<\/p> <p>  In addition we have returned to the committee the answers to the range of questions sent to the bank in advance.  I thank the Chairman for his compliments to my colleagues who endeavoured to answer those questions.  At the outset I must briefly reference the requirements that Bank of Ireland must observe as a public company.  We are quoted on the Dublin and London stock exchanges.  We make extensive disclosures to our shareholders annually through financial statements, presentations and other materials during our financial year, including our annual report, interim report, interim management statements and other markets as appropriate.<\/p> <p>  All statements made and information provided in this public forum are considered to be market information which is disclosed to all stakeholders at the same time.  Therefore it has to be capable of verification and has been verified.  Any comments that my colleagues or I make must adhere to the same standards.<\/p> <p>  Members will be aware that the State holds a 14% discretion shareholding in the bank, which has 86% private sector ownership.  The State's shareholding is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  Under our approved EU restructuring plan, with all state aid having been paid, the relationship between the Minister for Finance and Bank of Ireland is governed by a relationship framework agreement, which recognises that the bank is a separate economic entity, is managed on a commercial basis and engages with the Minister for Finance in accordance with best institutional shareholding practice.<\/p> <p>  Our financial performance is covered in slides 4 to 8.  Slide 4 should give the committee some enhanced understanding of the scale of our business and our operations in the Republic of Ireland.  We have a comprehensive multichannel distribution platform, including Ireland's largest branch network, augmented by 1, 770 self-service devices.  We have more than 440,000 active mobile phone customers.  We have market-leading positions across the financial sector in Ireland serving 1.7 million personal and 183,000 business customers.<\/p> <p>  Slide 6 sets out our business highlights for the first six months of this year.  As I have already updated the market, I reaffirm that the group has continued to deliver on strategic priorities.  One of our strategic priorities is obviously lending money and we have continued to be the largest lender into the Irish economy having advanced &euro;3.5 billion of new money to Irish businesses and consumers in the first half of 2016, an increase of about 14% on a similar period last year.<\/p> <p>  The group continues to reduce the quantum of non-performing loans and the absolute number of customers who are in a non-performing category.  We report an underlying profit of &euro;560 million for the first six months of the year and all our trading divisions are contributing to group profitability.<\/p> <p>  Slide 7 outlines the geographic regions from which we derive our income.  Approximately 70% of income from our group's operations comes from our businesses in the Republic of Ireland; some 25% is derived from our business in the United Kingdom, which includes, because it is in the sterling area, our universal banking business in Northern Ireland; and the remaining 5% of our total revenue is derived from our international operations, which are probably exclusively in continental Europe and the United States of America, through our leveraged finance business.<\/p> <p>  Slide 8 gives some detail on our engagement with the communities in which we operate and serve in Ireland.  We have a number of activities which from our perspective are focused on encouraging enterprise, particularly in local communities, and supporting in particular small businesses and start-ups.  Most of these events take place in our local branches where our business customers are invited to showcase their business and advertise their products and services to new and existing customers.  During our last national enterprise week in May 2016, we hosted 750 events countrywide and approximately 3,000 businesses took part.  We will have another such event starting next week.<\/p> <p>  We also have an activity, called \"enterprise towns\" where we work with the local communities, businesses communities and sports, social and charitable organisations hosting major community events which are open to the public.  These activities are important to us as a commercial business to encourage community development in rural Ireland.<\/p><p>We have been looking at the configuration of our branch network, the reduction in the number of people utilising our branches and the fact that we have that space.  We have been converting a sizeable amount of the floor space within the branch network and we provide it to start-up businesses on a free basis to start their businesses, engage with each other and get advice from our staff.  We have opened five of those to date, two in Dublin and one each in Cork, Galway and Limerick.  More than 500 start-up companies have used Bank of Ireland workbenches to start their business.  That is important to us because it encourages enterprise and also, hopefully, those people will let us quote for their business.<\/p><p> Slide eight shows the continuing investment being made in the bank meeting our changing customer needs.  In that context, I wish to mention the work we do with customers in the Republic to support them in the use of new technology, whether that be desktops, use of the Internet or smartphones.  In particular, we are conscious of the fact that some of our customers are at different life stages or have different familiarity with the digital world.  We have groups of advisers throughout our branch network who engage with the active retirement groups, transition year students, business customers, farmers and community groups by holding events in our branches, local halls, communities, libraries, nursing homes and so forth.  That supports our customers not only in how to interact with us through online channels but also in being more comfortable using technology generally.  We have had 3,000 such sessions with senior customers so far this year.<\/p><p> Slides ten to 16 set out some key points from our interim results in more detail.  Obviously, because of the nature of this engagement and the fact the members are representatives of the taxpayer, we have set out the fact that we received &euro;4.8 billion from the taxpayers.  That money has been repaid in full.  We have returned in excess of &euro;6 billion in cash to the taxpayers for the investment and the contingent liability support that was provided.  I confirm that as of October the taxpayers do not have any risk or liabilities to Bank of Ireland under the eligible liability guarantee scheme.  The State holds a 14% shareholding in Bank of Ireland and at today's share price that is worth approximately &euro;1 billion.<\/p><p> Slides 18 to 20 detail the latest financial performance update, which we provided to our shareholders in October.  That confirms that we continue to trade in line with our expectations and continue to meet our financial objectives.<\/p><p> Slide 19 focuses on asset quality in the business.  It confirms that we continue to make significant progress in reducing the quantum of non-performing loans across our group.  They have reduced by &euro;800 million to &euro;9.1 billion at the end of September and the defaulted loans have reduced by &euro;600 million to &euro;8.1 billion.  I confirm that the reductions are across the geographies in which we operate and across the asset classes - corporate, property, business, mortgages and unsecured consumer lending.<\/p><p> I am providing the committee with a market update as well.  In the nine months to the end of September our total new lending in all of our business, including into the Irish market, was &euro;10 billion.  That compares with &euro;9 billion on a constant currency basis for the same period in 2015, so our new lending is up approximately 11% on the same period last year.  Our capital ratios continue to be supportive of our strategy.  Our core equity tier 1 ratio on a fully loaded basis was 10.5%, and in the period from the end of June to September we generated approximately 30 basis points of organic capital.  I should point out that since the end of September the movement in international bond yields will have significantly reduced our accounting deficit and our capital ratios will have improved quite materially in recent weeks because of that accounting movement in our defined benefit pension schemes.<\/p><p> Given the committee's focus on mortgage pricing and mortgage arrears, slides 26 to 30 give significant detail on that.  Slide 28 reflects our pricing strategy.  We keep all our pricing for all our products across the group under constant review and there is a range of factors for the bank, as a responsible lender, to consider.  In terms of mortgage pricing in Ireland, we have a particular focus on fixed rate mortgages.  I confirm that 75% of new mortgages provided by the Bank of Ireland in the Republic of Ireland in the past nine months have been at a fixed rate.  Our mortgage lending in the nine months to the end of September has increased from our mortgage lending in the nine months to the end of 2015.<\/p><p> Slides 32 to 39 give comprehensive detail, which is also covered in the questions, on our mortgage arrears.  Again, the mortgage arrears show that there has been a continued reduction in owner-occupier and buy-to-let mortgages in arrears.  At the end of June 2016, 3.3% of Bank of Ireland's owner-occupier Republic of Ireland mortgage arrears were greater than 90 days in arrears.  That compares with an industry average, excluding Bank of Ireland, of 9%.  Bank of Ireland mortgages in the Republic of Ireland which were greater than 720 days in mortgage arrears also continued to reduce.<\/p><p> Slides 43 to 44 give some further detail, outside of the financial results, of the work we do within the community, particularly in Ireland.  In May 2016, Bank of Ireland was awarded a businesses working responsibly mark from Business in the Community Ireland for our work in that regard.<\/p><p> We set out in slide 46 why we are highly focused on our strategic objectives.  We remain Ireland's largest lender.  We have market leading positions across our businesses.  Our businesses are strong and financially robust.  Our business model is working for our customers and our shareholders.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its attention.  I and my colleagues look forward to the members' questions, although perhaps not necessarily look forward to them but hopefully we will answer them professionally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016111700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479375000,"counter":1764,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Boucher and his colleagues, Mr. Farrell and Mr. McLoughlin.

I acknowledge the overall improvement in the bank's performance as it moves to a more stable environment following the severe economic crisis we experienced in recent years.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on mortgage pricing.  As Mr. Boucher indicated, the bank puts a big emphasis on fixed rate products.  That is evident from the fact that 75% of the bank's new lending in the mortgage area is on fixed rates.  That is a clear strategy on the part of the banks.  However, on the variable rates, the bank is still charging up to 4.5% for many customers at a time when the cost of funds for the bank is less than 0.75%.  The bank is still charging some customers more than six times the cost of the funds the bank is accessing.  How can that be justified?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016111700002#E00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479375000,"counter":1765,"content":"<p>We have a very clear strategy on this, and in particular we have reflected on some of the lessons of the past.  One of the issues in the past was that there are two reasons people can have problems repaying their mortgages - either their income falls or the cost of repaying the mortgage goes up.  As a bank, we do not take interest rate risk.  We have traders who take intraday risk, so we cut out as a bank on an ongoing basis.  Even though we trade in the markets all the time, we cut out interest rate risk.  We are a commercial business and we must consider how we use our shareholders' money.  We are deliberately incentivising customers to move to fixed rates.  We believe that the current interest rate environment is abnormal.  As I mentioned earlier, there has been a material shift in bond yields even in the past three weeks.  If anyone is taking out a 20-year mortgage and they do not believe that interest rates are going to rise over that 20 years, I would ask them whether they should really be making this investment.  If one does not think interest rates are going to rise over the next 20 years, that means the world economy will still require massive quantitative easing from the central banks.  That is an unrealistic proposition.<\/p><p>This is a very deliberate strategy.  We are trying to encourage our customers to move to fixed rates.  They get certainty on what they repay and we get certainty from our point of view.<\/p><p> I would like to reiterate for anyone watching or listening - I will use the free advertising - that every one of our existing customers can avail of a fixed rate.  Every one of our existing customers could save money today, if he or she is on a variable rate and goes on a fixed rate.  Obviously, going to a fixed rate binds one into a period of time, but we say one can go into a three-year fixed rate and one does not have to fix one's entire mortgage.  One can save money and one can get certainty on the repayments.  That is our strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016111700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479375000,"counter":1767,"content":"<p>It is fair enough that Mr. Boucher availed of the opportunity to highlight that.

For example, in every annual statement we send out to our customers on an ongoing basis, we point out our product range.  We are not allowed to actively encourage a customer to switch from one product to another but we have to inform the customers.

One contacts us and provides an updated valuation.  The reason one provides an updated valuation is, for example, on a three-year fixed, it is either 3.5% or 3.1%, depending on where one is.

Would he give his observations on the economic outlook currently?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016111700002#F02000","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479375000,"counter":1786,"content":"<p>In co-operation with the European Commission, we bring out what we call a monthly pulse survey.  We use an independent third party.  They interview, on a monthly basis, 1,000 consumers and businesses in a mix across regions and across industry sectors.  What I can say is there continue to be high levels of confidence in the economy.  Approximately 60% of businesses that we interview expect that their business and the economy will do better, 25% consider that it will be broadly static and 15% say it could get worse.  Broadly, sentiment is good and that has been reflected in our lending numbers.<\/p> <p>  However, I should say that we have been surprised, and slightly positive, about the lack of a real impact to date, both in our British business and in our Irish businesses, from Brexit.  We felt Brexit could happen and we spent a lot of time, in particular, with customers in the Border communities, for example, in the hospitality sectors and retailing, to understand how they could be impacted by different exchange rate movement.  Also, many of our mortgage customers might commute back and forth to London, or commute and work in Northern Ireland, but have mortgages in euro, and clearly their income has been impacted by that.  The impact has been surprisingly benign to date.<\/p> <p>  We believe that some sectors of the economy such as commercial real estate in the Dublin area could benefit but for small businesses whose sole market is the UK, clearly there is an exchange rate impact.  People in the Border countries could see switching.  Our retailer customers in Northern Ireland will benefit, and our customers in the South will not.<\/p><p>What I would say though, in talking to our business customers in particular, is that a lot of them have been through heavy cost reductions and their businesses are much more efficient.  I would say their risk of default is increased but it is still relatively low.  I think they will be like us - the money we earn in sterling is just worth a little bit less, and in some cases quite a lot less.  We could see some people looking at moving from what are called technical hedges, that is, buying their sterling forward, etc., to looking at perhaps structural hedging, in other words buying more raw materials in sterling or indeed relocating parts of their business to the UK to service that economy.  I think that there will be a negative impact on our economy from Brexit.  I cannot believe that there will be an overall positive basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016111700002#F02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479375000,"counter":1788,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Boucher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016111700002#G00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1479375000,"counter":1789,"content":"<p>I remind Members to put their phones away.

Does Mr. Boucher agree with the Irish Banking Federation&rsquo;s analysis from 2014 when it said that it remains concerned that housing supply constraints are becoming a serious impediment to sustaining growth and this is reflected in the widening gap it sees developing between the level of mortgage approvals and actual drawdowns?

I would not say it is the sole reason.  Sensibly, our customers are seeking mortgage approval before they go and look for a property.  In certain locations, for example, in the main cities, but more particularly in Dublin, there could be up to ten bidders for a property and it moves beyond the price range for many.  That would be a very significant factor.  The economy is improving and so are people&rsquo;s incomes but I have a view that the primary driver is the shortage of supply.  It is just basic economics that supply is constrained and therefore people cannot get the house they want at the price they want.  We think supply is improving.  There is still another phenomenon in that we still believe that just under half &ndash; it used to be more than half &ndash; of properties are being purchased for cash.  I do not mean that someone comes in with a bag but they are not being bought for mortgages.  People are converting money they have on deposit and buying property with it.  Our lending to the buy-to-let sector is relatively low but it is a market we still try to service.

There was certainly an issue when the Central Bank guidelines were introduced in 2015 when builders got a little nervous and wondered whether there would be demand.

I think about 15% to 16% is accounted for by commercial real estate lending which is also spread between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Mortgages are loans to people.  This goes back to one of the questions asked earlier.  There is a fallback on the collateral.  We lend on the basis of the repayment capacity of the customer.  We recognise that we have exposure to the overall property cycle.  This is reflected in some of our lending practices and policies, but it would not be normal to characterise our balance sheet as 70% dependent on property assets.

I think the current prognosis is that, whereas the UK economy will be impacted on negatively by Brexit, it is not anticipated, including by the Bank of England, that it will go into severe recession.  Our financial risk in British franchises is measurable and measured because it is a distribution arrangement.  It is focused primarily on the consumer markets.  These are distribution arrangements we have with our two principal partners, namely, the Post Office in the United Kingdom and the Automobile Association.  That is our route to the market.  Clearly, we take a credit risk where we provide mortgages, credit cards, car loans and so on and we must accept that risk.  We believe diversification is important.  Bank of Ireland and our UK business are capitalised and funded separately.  The fact that we are in different businesses means that we are not overly exposed to one single economy.  To go into one of the points the Deputy appropriately made earlier, we try to avoid an over-concentration of risk by having diversification.  We diversify in areas we understand.  We understand, particularly when we are outside our home market of Ireland, why it is that we are more competitive than others.

The Minister decided, for his own reasons, that he would follow that investment.  Our share price is now about 21 or 22 cent, up 100% from what it was.  Over a five-year period that amounts to a compound return of 23%.  Therefore, the share price should be considered over a longer period.  Clearly, we would prefer it to be higher.

Much of what has been discussed has been about arrears and mortgages, which is very important and has been covered quite well.<\/p> <p>  However, I come back to some of the matters covered by Senator Conway-Walsh - I also raised it when I was in the Chair - which is the operating environment of a bank branch.  Most people are willing to embrace technology as much as they can.  Mr. Boucher referred to people in different life stages, which is not a phrase I had heard before, but it covers a lot.  People are banking differently.  Presumably with contactless technology, credit and debit cards etc., the volume of cash circulating is lower than it used to be.  Where do the witnesses see cash versus non-cash transactions, where they have come from, where they are going?  What is Bank of Ireland doing to try to encourage people away from cash?<\/p> <p>  Obviously there is a significant cost in dealing with cash and transporting it.  I live relatively close to the Central Bank in Sandyford and I often see enormous cash deliveries being accompanied by three or four Army lorries before and after trucks and occasionally helicopters.  Cash is being transported all over the country when there are lots of alternatives.  Is there resistance from some customers to dealing in non-cash activity?  What is Bank of Ireland doing to promote it?  Obviously, there are charges on debit cards and credit cards.  I acknowledge that some of them are Government charges.  Is Bank of Ireland trying to encourage people to move away from pure cash and if so how?  What are the barriers in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016111700002#N01000","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479375000,"counter":1919,"content":"<p>The Senator referred to several digital devices, including contactless cards.  The bank has invested significantly in this technology and infrastructure to facilitate making that available to customers if they want.  The same applies to mobile and online capability.  Most of our activity is on mobile devices, as opposed to even on cards.  We have made the pricing in terms of fees and charges for those digital devices significantly cheaper than paper.<\/p> <p>  On the broader question on cash, I do not have a strong view on where it is likely to go.  Recent statistics from the Bank of England indicate that cash is still very prevalent and the quantum of cash in the UK has probably doubled in the past ten years.<\/p> <p>  However, we see a significant reduction in the use of cheques.  There is a very significant infrastructure behind the processing of cheques.  The bank has to take cheques in the 250 branches, bring them back every day to a clearing centre and process them overnight.  That is an expensive process and is a significant cost, which is ultimately passed on to the consumer in charges for cheques.  We see that number coming down.  I mentioned the trend of 23% in the past 12 months.  I believe that trend will continue.<\/p> <p>  People just like to have a wad of cash in their pockets and I do not think that number will change dramatically.  We constantly point out there is a security risk to customers when they take out significant amounts of cash, both bringing it to the bank and taking it away from the bank.  We are conscious of that.  We support our larger business customers who have significant volumes of cash by providing a cash-in-transit service to their business so they do not have to go from their business to the branch and then from the branch to the Central Bank in Sandyford.  We try to make that process as easy as possible.  I do not see cash reducing significantly but I see other paper items reducing.  The prices we charge customers favours the non-paper transactions, given it is a significantly cheaper means of making payment for customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016111700002#N01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam McLoughlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479375000,"counter":1920,"content":"<p>One of the potential consequences of negative or zero interest rates is having more cash.

We have to put that back with the European Central Bank and we get charged 40 basis points.  It is becoming even more bizarre that it is costing us money to take in that.  Our model is that we customer-fund it.  Learning some of the lessons of the past, our capital and our customer deposits should equal our customer loans.  Our wholesale funding should equal the liquidity we have to hold.  The incentives are relatively low other than there is nowhere else to place it.

We only introduced this service for customers.  They are dealing directly with the underwriters and we are providing services outside of hours where that suits customers.

I queued yesterday for 24 minutes for one teller, who had to go and have a comfort break in the middle of it and left us all staring at an empty hatch, and we were only in that branch because our own branch has gone cashless.

What does Mr. Boucher say to customers who say banks - I do not suggest it is only Bank of Ireland - do not really want customers in branches queuing for a transaction?  I suppose the banks do not, but what does Mr. Boucher say to those who say they want to go in as they always did?  They always used to do business in a certain way and while they accept they can do certain business online, they cannot lodge foreign cheques online.

Mr. Boucher may be aware that the bank has taken tellers out of a branch in Caherdavin, in Limerick city.  It is the first branch in the mid-west where this has been done.  The branch is used predominantly by an older population and the residents in the area have come to me.  Sixty of them, many of them elderly, held a dignified protest outside the branch.  I have spoken to the bank's regional management, who, in fairness, have been amenable to meet.  Bank of Ireland is creating branches where customers effectively meet machines when they go in.  I accept the bank has staff there to assist them.  However, I would have always recognised Bank of Ireland as very much the old-world bank.  It was the bank that had that image and gave that perception.  I have two questions.  Why Caherdavin?  It is a big issue.  The residents in the area asked me to bring it up with Mr. Boucher, and that is my role.  I would ask, \"Why?\"<\/p> <p>  Mr. Boucher made reference to closing branches and I do not like that kind of talk.  Bank of Ireland states it does not wish to lose customers.  Mr. Boucher might explain the logic.  He made reference to the 4%, but this particular branch in Limerick has a high concentration of older customers.  The question is whether branches are perceived as being cost centres or profit centres.  Why was Caherdavin picked, why is the bank moving towards this model of having a branch where there are only machines and what will there be in future?  Customers have an attachment to their local branch.  They have an attachment to their local manager and staff.  These are hugely important.  One can pay for all the advertising in the world on television, radio and elsewhere but the teller behind the counter is a hugely significant positive advertisement for the bank.  Will Mr. Boucher outline for me the logic behind why the bank, specifically, in Caherdavin in that region, is moving towards that model where it is removing all tellers and why the bank would not have a teller over time, maybe for one morning a week?

We think we have.  We are seeing write backs where the economy is improving and collateral value is increasing.

It is almost bringing business development into the bank.  We are pushing the model of the enterprise town initiative, we have 100 enterprise towns and we have five running this weekend.

This relates to what people think about banking generally and the fact that the banks received the support of the State.  What  we are coming to now is the bad debt within the bank that cannot be readily serviced.  The experience I have had with customers of banks - not just those of Bank of Ireland but right across the sector - is that the banks are now back up on their feet but that those who are still struggling in their homes and families are being treated badly.  While Mr. Boucher states that there is an individual approach and solution to most of the problems relating to borrowing in the bank, the amount of hardship that Bank of Ireland and others have inflicted on individual borrowers by chasing them for repayments is significant.  It would be remiss of me were I not to say to Mr. Boucher that I believe he treats people badly.  I am talking about people who are willing to attempt to repay but who, for one reason or another - they are in the same boat as the bank was it got the &euro;4.8 billion from the State - do not have the capacity, either in terms of their families or their businesses, to get back on their feet that easily.  While the bank has offered them solutions or is working with them to identify such solutions, matters are extremely difficult for them.  Mr. Boucher stated that the level of repossessions is likely to increase.  We have seen the repossessions up to now.  Bank of Ireland got &euro;4.8 billion in support from the State, which it has paid back.  However, people who borrowed from the bank and who are attempting to repay their loans are not, in my view, getting a fair deal from the bank.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee asked whether Bank of Ireland lobbied or made submissions on the mortgage-to-rent scheme and the answer from the bank was \"No\".  Some people might think that is fair enough but do not.

We believe we have done approximately 50% of that.  The vast bulk of that new lending - this relates to an earlier question but is quite a different matter - has been for land, where a farmer plans to expand his farm.  We found that most farmers fund new milking parlours and so on primarily out of cashflow.  Most of the new agri-lending is for farm expansion.  We try to be competitive on price and structure.  We were the first bank to recognise the lessons of the past, namely, that the dairy industry is a cyclical industry.  We were the first bank to bring in a flexible loan.  We saw how it worked in other countries.  Recognising that it is a cyclical industry, if a farmer is granted a seven-year loan, typically we would amortise on a sliding scale of seven years.  We recognise that there will be periods when cashflow will be stronger and when the customer can speed up the repayments.  During periods when cashflow is weaker, customers pay the interest but they do not have to pay the capital.  As Mr. McLoughlin pointed out, we recognise that we had a skills deficit, so we have hired people - including from banks that have exited the market such as ACC - with experience of the sector because we need to learn as well.  We are trying to invest in capability, product features and, obviously, in the provision of capital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2016111700002#U00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher"},{"type":"speech","time":1479375000,"counter":2159,"content":"<p>Regarding the Caherdavin example, it is not that we believe older people are not engaging with technology.  It would be futile for anybody to suggest that because we are probably the closest to the people on the ground in that we represent them every day of the week.  The angst in regard to the branches and how they are evolving relates to the deficit in the personal relationship.  While people of all ages can engage with the bank's 365 online model - and that can lead to subsequent phone calls with a person - the concern is about the one-to-one banking relationship.  It is in that context that we are to articulate the point regarding places, such as Caherdavin, where the bank has flashpoints.  It is not an ageism issue.  I am a customer of the excellent branch in Mallow.  I have a relationship with the people there.  Over the years, however, there has been a diminution of the traditional relationship, particularly in respect of people going into the branch to discuss new lending or borrowing for day-to-day services.  That is the point we are trying to articulate.  Traditionally, the pillar banks always had that relationship with the person on the street.  We recognise that the Bank of Ireland must evolve and move to a certain point and that there are cost elements involved, but it should not throw the baby out with the bathwater and move completely to an online process.  If it were to do that, customers might leave.  Customers need to know they are being listened to and they need to have eye contact with an official in the bank if they are transacting new business or even dealing with daily transactions.

I would be the first to admit that as we go through a transition period, we will not get everything right.  We are listening and trying to figure out what works.  We are trying to make this work because if it does not work, then we have a problem as a commercial entity.  If customers feel that we do not want to talk and engage with them, then something has gone wrong in what we are trying to achieve.  What we are trying to achieve is that balance between being a commercial organisation and being efficient.  If we do not have customers, we do not have a business.  We can be as efficient as we like but if customers do not want to do business with us, then the shareholders would boot me out pretty quickly.

I refer to the human rights implications of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  The Committee on the Administration of Justice is an independent human rights NGO that has worked in Belfast since 1981.  The organisation's opinion before and after the vote was that there were potential threats to human rights visible during the referendum campaign.  That is why we unusually and specifically recommended a Remain vote.  After the referendum result I am afraid our predictions were proved correct.  We said: \"Those voices leading the Leave campaign majored not on democratic or socio-economic deficits in the EU project but rather on nationalist sentiment, xenophobia and thinly veiled racism.  This result will embolden them and place them in the ascendency.\"<\/p> <p>  The first consequence of the vote has been the normalisation of anti-immigrant discourse, a huge boost for racist groups and an increase in racist attacks in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.  From the perspective of human rights, this is perhaps the most dangerous scenario.   Racism is the fundamental enemy of human rights.  Human rights are universal as they apply to everyone by virtue of their simple humanity.  Racism is the complete negation of that philosophy.  Furthermore, it is insidious.  Once racism is allowed into the political conversation, it becomes the ready and available put down of any attempt to express human solidarity. <\/p> <p>  The second area of concern, in terms of human rights, is a retreat from the European Union's protection of workers' rights, data protection, environmental and anti-discrimination legislation.  Exiting the EU would remove a backstop for rights protection and thus make it easier for current or future Governments to erode protections for workers' rights and equality. <\/p> <p>  The third area that we have identified is the withdrawal of the EU's PEACE funding and structural funds, and the likely increase in austerity policies.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that the expected ending of peace and structural funds will decimate the voluntary and community sector and remove support from many projects, such as ex-prisoner groups, which are vital for the peace process.  These economic pressures will pose a real threat to the social and economic rights of the most disadvantaged.<\/p><p> The fourth area is the threat of a so-called hard Border on the island of Ireland and the threat to the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.  The last area is that the result may pose a threat to the Human Rights Act.  That is not a direct consequence of Brexit and is nothing to do directly with the European Union but the justice Secretary, Liz Truss, has recently said that the repeal of the Human Rights Act, which is fundamental to the Good Friday Agreement, apart from anything else, is still on the table and there is clear opposition to the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law among certain politicians and journalists. <\/p><p> We have been involved in several events and discussions, giving evidence and so on.  Much of the material is available on our website if the committee wants more detail.  It may be interested in the process of litigation, CAJ is one of the applicants in one of the Belfast-based cases seeking a judicial review of the Brexit process currently before the High Court in Northern Ireland.  As a human rights organisation, we joined this action to help ensure that the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, and in particular its carefully crafted peace settlement, were fully taken account of in the Brexit process.  Several politicians, individuals and human rights non-governmental organisations, NGOs, have taken a case that concerns the intention of the UK Government to give effect to the exit from the European Union through the use of the royal prerogative.  An individual applicant, Raymond McCord, sought a judicial review on grounds which partly overlapped our case.  Our application argued that the prerogative was not available to trigger an exit from the EU because EU law had been given effect through the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and other provisions and thus required legislation to amend its effect; that in that case a legislative consent motion in the Northern Ireland Assembly would also be required; and, if the prerogative use was lawful there were a number of common law restraints upon its use and that any advice given by the Northern Ireland Office on this matter should be screened according to the equality provisions of section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  Our case was lost in the Belfast High Court.  We were allowed to argue only the Northern Ireland aspects but in England a three judge court of the High Court overwhelmingly supported a similar case on the grounds that the prerogative would change domestic UK law and in a principle going back to 1610 at least that is not possible under the UK Constitution.  In spite of the very conservative judgment in Belfast and the judge refusing a so-called leapfrog appeal direct to the Supreme Court, the Attorney General for Northern Ireland has referred the devolved issues to the Supreme Court, which is one of his powers.  While he will go there to argue against our position it is quite useful because that position will therefore be argued in the Supreme Court, in front of 11 judges who have been mobilised for this case.  We are in the process of trying to raise funds but we expect our lawyers to be in London on 7 and 8 December to argue the particular Northern Ireland aspects of the case. <\/p><p> Part of the Good Friday Agreement, and specifically the British-Irish treaty that underpins it, rests on common membership of the European Union as stated in the preamble: \"To develop still further the unique relationship between their peoples and the close co-operation between their countries as friendly neighbours and as partners in the European Union;\".  The withdrawal of that has unpredictable implications for the Good Friday Agreement.  CAJ does not take a position on constitutional matters but there is no question that as the effective ending to a 30 year long conflict the Good Friday Agreement is a guarantee of our peaceful future and of human rights.  In our view it has to be defended.  One particular aspect of it is that the North South Ministerial Council and the British Irish Council are given specific roles in regard to EU matters.  In respect of the North South Ministerial Council the agreement states: \"Arrangements to be made to ensure that the views of the Council are taken into account and represented appropriately at relevant EU meetings.\"  It is a channel for the particular circumstances of this island to be referred to the EU.  We are aware that the Irish Government is using this mechanism as a forum for discussion with the Stormont Executive.  How that is used will be a major preoccupation for this committee.  It may feel that further research into the actual implications of the UK withdrawal from the EU are for the infrastructure of the Good Friday Agreement. <\/p><p> I will not deal with the particular protections for human rights within EU law or where it is being invoked or within its scope.  There is extra protection from the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, which we will presumably lose after Brexit. <\/p><p> The committee's influence, however, would be very welcome in respect of the so-called great repeal Bill which, whatever happens about triggering Article 50, will be needed in the UK Parliament requiring that it maintain EU law in force unless it is specifically repealed.  It would be a complete train crash if EU law was suddenly withdrawn in respect of domestic UK law never mind anything else.  <\/p><p> Equivalence of rights across the island is a principle in our view of the Good Friday Agreement.  How will we manage that in circumstances where there will presumably be radically different legal jurisdictions on the island?  We would urge a second look at the role of the Charter of Rights for the island of Ireland, which was never implemented even though advice was given and it is a matter for the two human rights commissions.  The other related question is equality of citizenship.  People in the North have the right to choose to be Irish or British citizens or both.  We believe that the content of the rights accruing to those citizenships should be the same, rather than simply the right to choose between them.<\/p><p>It is our view that the content of the rights accruing to the citizenships should be the same, rather than simply the right to choose between them.  That will be a complicated mechanism.  That is associated with the threat of a hard Border.  The common travel area predates the EU, but in its modern manifestations to a significant degree it relies on Irish citizens asserting their rights as EU citizens anywhere in the UK and the right to travel in that sense will be under threat in the context of a hard Border.  What concerns us is that even if there are special arrangements for Irish and British citizens, we do not want a situation where a border on this island is the focus of racial profiling, for example, where people who look different are asked to produce passports while people who look like me, perhaps, are not.  It would be intolerable to have a racist border across this island.  I will finish there.  I welcome any discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016111700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Gormally","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479391200,"counter":2208,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gormally for the presentation.  The European Convention on Human Rights was incorporated into the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and is a central plank of the Agreement in many ways.  Any change in that regard by the British Government would mean a fundamental change in the operation of the Good Friday Agreement.  There seems to be a change in approach by the Twenty-six County Government because initially it was talking about defending the Good Friday Agreement and being foursquare behind it but the Taoiseach is now talking about defending the progress made in the peace process.  They are two different things.  There has been progress but that does not necessarily mean that will continue.  Perhaps that is something that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  If Brexit happens, where does that leave people involved in legacy inquests having access to the European courts?  Will that have a detrimental effect on how such cases progress?  Mr. Gormally mentioned court cases in which the Committee on the Administration of Justice, CAJ, is involved with other parties in the Assembly.  Reference was made to the intervention of the Attorney General.  My understanding is that office is independent of the Assembly.  What impact does Mr. Gormally envisage there will be on the court cases?  He said it is an advantage because it opens up the opportunity to argue the cases before the Supreme Court.  One of the Supreme Court judges spoke recently about the 1972 Act possibly having to be amended or a new Act being introduced before Article 50 could be triggered.  All sorts of opportunities are opened up in terms of how Brexit might or might not continue.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gormally referred to workers' rights.  It is interesting that the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance, NIPSA - one of the biggest unions in the North - asked its members to vote to leave, which seems a total contradiction in terms of the protection of workers' rights.  Having spoken to people from NIPSA, they have not given a convincing explanation as to why they pursued that line of thought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016111700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mickey Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1479391200,"counter":2209,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gormally, who we have met before, for his forensic insight into human rights and equality.  It is very good to see him today and helpful to the committee to hear what he had to say about the equality implications for the Good Friday Agreement of Brexit.  He mentioned the choice of citizenship between Irish and UK citizenship for residents of Northern Ireland and that the choice could be affected.  Could we tease out that issue a little more?  It is a situation with which we are not that familiar.  The choice of citizenship is a serious issue in terms of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  What are his views on how the campaign was led?  Perhaps he cannot comment, but it seems to me that most of the political parties in the UK were not really aware of the implications for the Good Friday Agreement and also for human rights and equality.  We must deal with the situation now.  We were a lot more informed on that point on the island of Ireland, which is most unusual, given that it was a decision taken by the United Kingdom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016111700002#F00300","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479391200,"counter":2210,"content":"<p>On the question of the Human Rights Act and the possible repeal and even the possible withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights, although that is probably a little extreme, as they are unlikely to go as far as that, but certainly severing the link with the European Court of Human Rights is clearly not part of Brexit, as such.  We are talking about the Council of Europe not the European Union when we talk about the European court and the European convention.  However, in our view it is part of the same movement.  It is a kind of xenophobic, anti-human rights movement.  In terms of the nature of the campaign, in our view this was not a referendum on membership of the EU, or at least it was not a verdict on how good or bad the EU is.  In practice, it was an expression of certainly disenchantment with the <i>status quo<\/i>but it was led by people with a racist and xenophobic agenda.  That is the crucial reason we felt we had to intervene and say vote &quot;Remain&quot;, which of course the people of Northern Ireland did, but that is another matter.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the legacy inquests, that is a real problem at the moment.  The immediate problem is that the Lord Chief Justice's programme for dealing with all the legacy inquests within five years is held up because of some kind of interchange between the UK Government and the First Minister, in that the First Minister will not allow the proposal for the extra money from the UK Treasury to be either tabled at the Executive or the Assembly so the UK Government has not received that request, theoretically, however we believe the obligation is still on the UK Government to provide the funds to deal with it.  Mr. Brady is quite correct in that if there was a withdrawal from the European court's jurisdiction then that final arbiter would be lost, although of course many of the cases that are awaiting inquests were decided by the European court in 2001, some of which the CAJ was involved in.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the role of the Attorney General, he is an independent law officer, unlike the situation of the UK Attorney General who is a politician, or at least is a member of the Cabinet and a political appointee.  He has his own views on constitutional matters and they differ from ours on this particular matter.  His referral to the Supreme Court jumps beyond the normal appeals process because otherwise we would have had to go to the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal and then to the Supreme Court and that would have meant that we would not have been able to make the arguments in early December.  Therefore, it is useful, even though it is unfortunate that the Attorney General will be arguing against some of the very important issues that we think are a part of the devolution settlement.<\/p><p>In the court case, the Scottish and Welsh Governments indicated their intention to intervene.  Coming to Senator Feighan's point, that demonstrates that the Northern Ireland issues have now been taken quite seriously, if somewhat late.  They are certainly taken seriously in the other jurisdictions of the United Kingdom by human rights activists.<\/p><p> Whenever there is an effort to introduce identity cards in the United Kingdom, it is recognised that Irish citizens cannot be forced to carry British citizenship identification.  The authorities were actually going to give people who identified as Irish in Northern Ireland the same kind of identity card system as would be provided for other EU citizens.  That proposal was dropped but it shows that even the UK Government recognises the importance of not forcing people to choose one way or another to access particular rights.  We do not know what the circumstances will be, however, without the underpinning of EU citizenship.  I cannot state the solution because we do not really know.  Probably nobody knows, least of all the UK Government, what precisely will be argued for with regard to the common travel area and the nature of the Border.  It is a bit up in the air.  In our view, it is equality of citizenship and rights across the island that comprise a crucial underpinning of the peace settlement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016111700002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Gormally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479391200,"counter":2212,"content":"<p>This is my first time to address Mr. Gormally.  He is very welcome.  From what I can gather, the plan is that we do not have a plan.  We are heading into what appears to be a legal nightmare, certainly for the people of Northern Ireland.  We speak about fundamental human rights, particularly workers' rights.  We have 30,000 workers crossing the Border every day.  Those who cross from Northern Ireland into the Republic to work will be able to avail themselves of all the rights that come with European legislation.  We have no idea what the circumstances will be for those who cross from the Republic into Northern Ireland to work there.  They may be allowed to retain the rights they currently enjoy as EU citizens.  The ideal would be that we would transpose European law directly into British law.  I understand from some of the meetings I have had that there is an intention on the part of Westminster to write its own workers' rights and fundamental human rights.  Whether it will simply transpose European laws seems to be far from certain.<\/p> <p>  On funding and austerity, we could face terrible circumstances in which Border counties on the Republic side will continue to avail of funding from Brussels under the Good Friday Agreement while counties on the other side of the Border will be in a different position.  Although funding has been guaranteed to 2024 for agriculture, I hear nothing about funding under the Good Friday Agreement or matching funding that would be available in the Republic for citizens of the North.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the hard Border, I have been predicting since the Brexit vote that there will be a hard Border.  I can see no other possibility because I do not believe the gift lies in the hands of the Irish Government, or the British Government for that matter, with respect to how the Border will be managed.  Twenty-six other countries will be involved.  I would be interested in hearing Mr. Gormally's view on that.<\/p> <p>  My last point is on the area of welfare, especially pensions.  At present in Northern Ireland, there is a lady who is unable to avail of her Irish pension because of an anomaly in our laws.  The rules for public service pensions, which used to be 50% of one's salary, or so many 80ths of one's salary, have changed.  One now gets a public service pension comprising 50% from one's Department with the old age contributory pension included in it.  I am sorry for going around the houses on this one but this is a particular case.  What has happened is that an employee from the South who lives in Newry retired under the age of 66, which meant she should be entitled to what we call a supplementary pension to top up her public service pension - the equivalent of quarter of her pre-retirement salary - to bring it up to the full rate.  She is being told that since she does not live in the Republic, she is not entitled to the supplementary pension.  This causes problems on both sides.  There are people in the Republic who worked for no more than a year in the United Kingdom but whose Irish welfare contributions are taken into account when calculating pension entitlements.  They get the British pension based on the fact that they have so many Irish contributions, thus bringing them up to the ten-year mark.  Does that create a huge problem for us also?  The more I see of this, the more complex it becomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016111700002#G00150","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479391200,"counter":2213,"content":"<p>I would hope to be a little more brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016111700002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alasdair McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1479391200,"counter":2214,"content":"<p>No guarantees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016111700002#G00300","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479391200,"counter":2215,"content":"<p>I speak my mind.  There is constant confusion between the European Convention on Human Rights and the European courts on membership of the European Union.  My understanding is that they are totally separate.

Mr. Gormally refers to this in the submission.<\/p><p>Is there any suggestion the Brexit vote will have a significant knock-on effect on the European Convention on Human Rights?  That is a bridge much further than just leaving the European Union.  The witness gets the point and I have given the lead.  I have an understanding of the following issue but it may not be accurate.  My understanding is the great repeal Bill will repatriate all European law or issues to Westminster <i>en bloc<\/i>.  There is a discussion on the variations of what will happen then.  Will Britain hold on to all those laws?  In other words, will they be non-devolved matters or will it devolve some of them to the devolved assemblies?  I am particularly looking in this case to the issues raised around human rights or laws that will affect human rights.  Worse still for me is the suggestion which is about - it is people thinking out loud - that Britain may very well modify those laws before they are devolved.  Am I making sense on that point?  It is that it will take back the laws but hold them for a period to be determined, and in the course of that period it will interfere, as it were, with those laws rather than devolving them <i>en bloc<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>These are two questions that may not be as easy to answer as they are to ask.  That is the nub of many of the issues being presented by the witnesses.  Britain may bring these back and modify them significantly before devolution.

Will Mr. Gormally comment, for example, on the European Union yesterday launching the European Travel Information and Authorisation System, ETIAS, which will introduce new travel arrangements for non-EU citizens visiting the Schengen area?  Under the proposals, non-EU citizens will still be able to travel without a visa but will have to obtain travel authorisation prior to their visit to the Schengen area.

Looking at the Border counties and PEACE funds, there is a real problem as we do not know exactly what will happen.  As far as I understand it, applications and so on are still being processed but the question of matching money, for example, is not clear.  It would be very foolish to assume there will be equivalent money from the UK Treasury to that which went into the various funds that Northern Ireland and the Border regions, in particular, have been able to take advantage of.  I share the members' concerns in that respect.<br\/><br\/>On the hard Border, it was suggested there are 26 other countries involved with that process.  It is clearly one of the difficulties.  On the one hand we do not know what the British Government is demanding but on the other hand we do not know what the EU as a whole will agree to.  We are in a position of unknown territory in a way.  It seems that whatever the feelings on constitutional matters, the island of Ireland has a common interest in having no hard Border.  Some of the alternatives are equally unappealing, such as having an effective border along the Irish Sea, which would be between two parts of the UK.  It is difficult to know how that is to be done.  I suggest the interests of the people of Ireland and our perspective in supporting the peace agreement and the human rights element of that means there should be free travel across the Border, with no racist border on the island of Ireland.  These are basic demands.  Whether they should be progressed through the North South Ministerial Council is debatable but that is certainly a common interest of the people of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>None of the laws implementing the Good Friday Agreement will fall <i>per se<\/i>.  In other words, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 was the basic legislative implementation of the agreement and it will not fall.  However, there are references in it to EU law.  The Assembly and the actions of the Ministers and Departments are constrained by EU law and they must obey it.  There is no doubt that a &quot;brick&quot; in the infrastructure has been or will be withdrawn with unpredictable results.  There will not be a direct domino effect in terms of legislation but it really is a problem.  There is a specific problem with respect to citizenship.  What about Irish citizens in the North who were born in Northern Ireland?  Will they have EU citizenship rights in the rest of the EU?  If not, we will see the introduction of two classes of Irish citizen.  That is a real problem when talking about people who are not Irish citizens because they have been naturalised or by heritage in a kinship sense but because it is their birthright, as put in the agreement.  If there are Irish citizens North of the Border whose birthright is to be an Irish citizen, yet they cannot access the same rights as those who are born in this jurisdiction, it seems there will be a big problem.  This may not entirely be in the hands of the Irish Government but it is a serious question.  I am asking it not from a constitutional perspective but because of its underpinning the equality of citizenship as a basic element of the agreement.  It is important.<br\/><br\/>I do not have knowledge of the pension issue, I am afraid, but it is an example of problems for cross-Border workers and so on.<\/p><p>For example, at the moment we can access health care as EU citizens when on holiday or if working across the Border.  There are bilateral arrangements between the two jurisdictions in terms of children's heart surgery in Dublin and particular things in Altnagelvin and so forth, but in general access to EU health care results from EU citizenship.  This is a particular issue that may well affect cross-Border workers.  There are arrangements for students, etc., but all of this is in the melting pot and will have to be worked out.<\/p><p> Dr. Alisdair McDonnell is completely right when he says that the Council of Europe and the European Union are two totally different systems.  They are completely separate except for the fact that EU membership requires a country to be signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights.  The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights incorporates the convention rights, but goes further in many respects.  They are distinct but in a way connected.  Dr. McDonnell is also quite right in that they are also connected in the minds of those who led the Brexit campaign.  Some of them - not all - are among the protagonists in favour of repealing the Human Rights Act, developing a British bill of rights of unknown character and breaking the link between the domestic courts and the European Court of Human Rights.  Our fear is that Brexit will embolden those who also want to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.<\/p><p> The question about the great repeal Bill is complicated.  I attended a lecture by Daniel Greenberg, a parliamentary draftsperson who worked with us on the model Bill for the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.  He said the more grandiloquent the Title of the Bill, the less that will be in it.  It is now being called the \"the Great Repeal Bill\", so it is likely to say that everything stays the same.  However, everything will not stay the same because EU law as it exists is of direct application in the UK.  This is not just a matter of EU law being contained in UK legislation; the Treaties and the Commission's Directives have direct effect.  We think the great repeal Bill should say that all existing EU law is to remain in force.  However, such provision would not include the interpretation of EU law by the Court of Justice of the European Union or its modifications.  That is, the way in which laws are living instruments in a sense will be brought to a halt, so that will have a dramatic impact.<\/p><p> The question of devolution is also important.  Northern Ireland is the only jurisdiction to which employment law is a devolved matter - history of the old Stormont regime.  It is not devolved to Scotland or Wales at the moment.  It would, therefore, fall to Stormont to re-enact employment protections if they were repealed.  The problem is that the whole devolution structure is provided for in law to an extent, but the power of the Westminster Parliament to legislative, even for devolved matters, is only restricted by convention and not law.  Therefore, as stated by Dr. McDonnell, the Westminster Parliament could hold onto employment law and modify it although it is a devolved matter.  Currently, employment law is devolved, so it is not a question of it being held in London to be re-devolved.  However, the UK Parliament could legislate on employment law for Northern Ireland.  It is only constrained by convention, so there is a danger that, even if we had a political consensus in the North to maintain them, all the protections in EU law could be taken away by the UK Parliament.<\/p><p> On freedom of movement, the Schengen situation is more advanced in that there is more freedom of movement within the Schengen area than there is in the common travel area.  UK citizens are outside the Schengen Agreement and, depending on what is negotiated, will not have the right to free movement because the right that accrues by virtue of EU citizenship will end.  Again, where does that leave Irish citizens who were born North of the Border?  How are we going to deal with that?  This is one of the imponderables to which, I am afraid, we do not have any answers at the minute.  Even if there is a special deal for Irish citizens born North of the Border, where does that leave British citizens born North of the Border who have the right to be Irish citizens?  We do not want a situation where different rights accrue to the two forms of citizenship that are available to the people of Northern Ireland because that is a basic equality aspect, if one likes, to the agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement basically says that there will be no second-class citizens.  Primarily, it is designed to say Irish citizens will not be second-class citizens in the North, but are British citizens to be second-class citizens in the South or are Irish citizens born North of the Border to be second-class citizens in the EU?<\/p><p> It is a very complicated issue which we cannot solve with a stroke of the pen.  This will take hard negotiation as well as an understanding of how basic these things are to the peace agreement that brought an end to the conflict and will depend on the extent to which the rest of Europe needs to be made aware of it in terms of the negotiations as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016111700002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Gormally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479391200,"counter":2221,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank Mr. Gormally for attending today and for his interesting presentation on the human rights implications of Brexit.

I am delighted to have the opportunity to update the committee on the development of the EU programmes.  The role of the Special EU Programmes Body is to manage the EU PEACE and INTERREG programme funds in the region.  We are also directly responsible for the grant-making of those programmes.  The EU programmes have been implemented on a cross-border basis for more than 25 years in the case of INTERREG and more than 21 years in the case of the PEACE programme, with &euro;1.1 billion going to the INTERREG programme and &euro;2.2 billion going to the PEACE programme.  That includes the current allocations.<\/p> <p>  The significant impact of these EU cross-border programmes cannot be underestimated.  The benefits that they have had in the region are far-reaching beyond the financial contributions.  I could not do justice to the impact of those programmes in these few minutes.  Many hundreds of thousands of people have benefited from those programmes directly and indirectly.  Cross-Border co-operation was taking place prior to the Good Friday Agreement and the EU programmes.  However, the establishment within the Good Friday Agreement of the Special EU Programmes Body with an all-island remit enabled a co-ordinated regional approach to cross-Border co-operation within the context of the EU programmes.  The programmes provide financial support for a structured approach to cross-Border activity and establishing cross-Border networks and relationships.  Undoubtedly, that may not have happened because of other pressures on public expenditure environments and competing spending priorities.  When I talk about the region with regard to these programmes, I am referring to Northern Ireland, the six Border counties of Ireland and, in the case of the INTERREG programme, western Scotland, which joined that programme in 2007.<\/p> <p>  The PEACE programme was established in 1995 and was a direct result of the EU's desire to support the efforts being made on this island to build a peaceful and stable society in Northern Ireland.  We have learned many lessons.  The programmes have evolved and changed over the programme period in 21 years, the budgets have reduced and we have learnt some lessons.  In the PEACE III programme, which has just concluded and is in the process of closing, there are some key figures that relate to its benefits.  A total of 200,000 people attended events that addressed sectarianism, racism and conflict resolution workshops; 44,000 attended events to assist victims and survivors; 7,000 people received trauma counselling; and 136,000 have so far enjoyed the very magnificent shared spaces that have been developed to create, build and foster cross-community links.  The committee may be aware of some of those examples, such as the Castle Saunderson scouting project in Cavan, the Peace Link, a cross-Border and cross-community sports complex in County Monaghan, the Peace Bridge in Derry-Londonderry, and the Girdwood project in north Belfast, a new state-of-the-art community centre hub built on an interface area at the side of an old army barracks.  It recently paid host to the president of Colombia on short visit to the UK, who was very interested to hear about the benefits of the PEACE programme.<\/p> <p>  The INTERREG programmes throughout Europe offer support on a strategic cross-border basis to create a more prosperous and sustainable region.  They have a focus on the well established and recognised needs of border regions.  Some of the projects funded in our last INTERREG programme included the North West Regional Science Park in Derry-Londonderry and also the extension of the Letterkenny IT campus.  Those projects help to form cross-Border networks between local firms.  There was also the refurbishment of the Drogheda viaduct and the upgrading of enterprise.  A sum of &euro;30 million went into a cross-Border health project entitled \"Putting Patients, Clients and Families First\", which assisted all of the residents in the eligible area to have access to quality health care.<\/p> <p>  Some of the numbers in INTERREG are also significant, with more than 120,000 benefiting from cross-Border support in areas of health, rural development, enterprise and tourism.  A total of 3,500 businesses were assisted to promote innovation and creative activities, with 1,300 of those SMEs directly collaborating on cross-Border ventures.  A total of 15,000 people have been involved in attending workshops to look at solutions to common problems in the Border area, such as joined-up delivery, improvements to service and access to services available.  We also had a large telecommunications project funded, which linked Northern Ireland and Ireland with Canada, America and parts of Europe, and other projects examining renewable energy and environmental sustainability.<\/p> <p>  Part of our role in the Special EU Programmes Body is also our statutory role to advise the North South Ministerial Council and finance Departments in negotiations with the EU Commission on future funding rounds.  SEUPB was also asked to develop the 2014-2020 programmes by undertaking consultation with all relevant interest groups and stakeholders, taking account of the policy objectives of the EU and how best to fulfil the policy objectives of the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive by complementing but not duplicating those services and reflecting the needs of the target areas.  In line with the Europe 2020 strategy, all programmes will focus on a narrow range of activities to ensure that the funding will bring about significant change in the region.  The content for those programmes, therefore, has been agreed by the Northern Ireland Executive, the Irish Government, the European Commission and, in the case of INTERREG, the Scottish Government as well.<\/p> <p>  The result of the UK referendum on 24 June had an impact on the delivery of those programmes.  I know that the committee is well aware of that impact.  Many complex financial and legal issues had to be addressed.  With the substantial assurance received from the UK Treasury in October and the work of the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, we are now in a very strong position and are making offers to projects that will last for many years to come.  We have been issuing letters of offer over the past few weeks.  I would like to take this opportunity to put on record our thanks to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and Minister for Finance in Northern Ireland, M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Muilleoir, and their officials who have worked so closely with us over these challenging few months.<\/p> <p>  The INTERREG VA programme, which we are now embarking on, is worth &euro;283 million.  It has four core objectives that we are funding.  In the area of research and innovation, there is &euro;53 million allocated to increase the capacity for cross-Border research within two target areas: health and life sciences, and renewable energy.  There is a further &euro;18.7 million to increase the capacity of 1,400 SMEs and micro-businesses in the region that are engaged in cross-Border research and innovation activity aimed at the development of new products, processes and tradeable services.  Environmental initiatives will benefit from almost &euro;85 million to protect and restore biodiversity and invest in the water sector, promoting cross-Border co-operation to facilitate the recovery of selected protected habitats and species and the development of common approaches to the management of the marine environment.  A sum of &euro;47 million is allocated to sustainable transport in order to provide support for greater connectivity between the three jurisdictions and to promote cross-Border, inter-modal and sustainable mobility in the region.  Health and social care is also a prominent feature of this programme.  A total of &euro;63 million has been allocated to that.  With cross-Border co-operation, we will see 50,000 benefiting from those essential services that we intend to support in the region.<\/p> <p>  The PEACE IV programme is worth &euro;270 million and provides opportunity for continued EU assistance to help to address the peace and reconciliation needs of the region.  The Irish Government played a pivotal role in securing the PEACE IV programme, which we are now implementing.  It has four core themes, with a strong emphasis on supporting young people to develop their skills to contribute to a more cohesive society.  Shared education has been allocated &euro;35 million.  The majority of schools in the region remain single-identity.  The project will see 144,000 students engaged in direct and sustained curriculum-based contact between pupils and teachers from all backgrounds.<\/p><p> A sum of &euro;37 million has been allocated to children and young people to form positive and effective relationships with others of different backgrounds.  This will target young people aged between 14 and 24 who are disadvantaged, excluded or marginalised and who have deep social and emotional needs and are at risk of becoming involved in anti-social behaviour.  We plan to fund at least eight capital projects to the value of &euro;53 million, creating a more cohesive society through the increased provision of shared civic spaces and services.  In recognition of the needs of those who have suffered in the trauma of the conflict, we are also allocating &euro;17.6 million to the capacity of services to meet the needs of victims and survivors.  It will add value by investing in cross-Border health and well-being services that develop proven expertise within the region and increase the capacity and the quality of care in the sector for victims and survivors and their families.<\/p><p> One of the successes of the previous PEACE programme was the involvement of local councils across the region.  Initiatives to address local needs will be directly delivered through them, with almost one third of the programme being delivered in that way.  We have invited local authorities across Northern Ireland and along the Border in the Republic to develop a local action plan for their area.  They will consider specifically local needs in respect of shared services and spaces, children and young people and building positive relations.  Each local authority has been given details of the indicative budget.  For example, Louth County Council has been allocated &euro;3.5 million and Monaghan County Council just over &euro;3 million.<\/p><p> A sum of &euro;16.4 million has been allocated for the objective of building positive relations at a regional level.  This objective will support groups particularly impacted by the legacy of the conflict.  The support will be used to fund up to 20 regional level projects that will result in meaningful, purposeful and sustained contact between persons from different communities.  Our main priority is to ensure those programmes are allocated in full to good quality projects which will deliver on the objectives we have set out.  There always have been challenges in the Border region and that is why we implement the INTERREG programme, and those challenges will be exacerbated in the context of Brexit in whatever form it may take.  We will monitor that closely in respect of our projects to see if there will be an impact on their delivery because they have been funded for several years.  We are also spending time on proactively undertaking work on future funding post-2020 and what we can do to see if we can remain involved in some EU programmes and minimise the impact of Brexit in the region in the context of EU funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016111700002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Gina McIntyre","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479391200,"counter":2228,"content":"<p>Before I open the floor to questions, I should have read the privilege notice.

It has managed significant moneys down through the years.  We could have our difficulties with the body at local authority level trying to get projects across the line, but it is important to have an administration to ensure the moneys are well spent.  I have often said that for many years along the Border we had our backs to each other, and when peace came, we faced each other.  The human aspect of the various programmes the SEUPB has administered has ensured people have got to know each other across communities that did not engage for many years.  This has helped to build on peace, prosperity and progress.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions which I have raised at the committee previously.  There is an agreement between two states to ensure peace, progress and prosperity continues.  The uncertainty around the planning of projects the body has on it books and various local authorities and communities are seeking to develop is not helpful.  How can we encourage the Chancellor of the Exchequer post-Brexit, if we are serious about peace on this island, to ensure the full moneys are ring-fenced to implement the programmes up to 2020 and beyond?  How can we ensure the model to which Ms McIntyre referred post-2020 and the projects continue in support of peace as opposed to being outside the EU or being inside it?<\/p> <p>  The Taoiseach indicated in the D&aacute;il last week that 17 projects have been signed off.

Over the years, I have had a close working relationship with her predecessor and other colleagues of hers regarding the PEACE and INTERREG programmes.  They have made a huge difference, especially in the most disadvantaged communities, both rural and urban.  At times where public services did not deliver, be it at local authority or central government level, the additional help from these programmes gave these communities the necessary capacity to build projects and to develop facilities.  Ms McIntyre mentioned two on my own doorstep - Castle Saunderson and the Peace Link sports centre in Clones.  They are excellent projects with substantial funding which has been put to good use.  Minister &Oacute; Muilleoir presented us with a worrying commentary a number of weeks ago.  He had not been given a commitment by the Treasury that funding would continue.  In a subsequent conversation I had with him, he was concerned about whether the British Government commitment would remain.

In its statement on 3 October, the HM Treasury gave a guarantee that in terms of any project funded between now and the time of a Brexit, whenever that may be, the UK share would be underwritten by the UK Government.  There were a couple of conditions attached to that, in that projects had to be able to demonstrate value for money and they had to be in line with the region's priorities.  Our projects do that.  Seventeen letters of offer have been issued and all of them will be issued by the end of the week.  Some of those projects run until 2021, 2022 and 2023.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the way we are addressing the projects, with the help of the officials from the Department of Finance here in Dublin and in the Northern Ireland Executive, the programmes are in place.  The EU side of the money is in place for the Irish contribution.  The Irish match-funding is in place.  The Northern Ireland Executive has its match-funding in place and should the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, element not be in place for the UK side, the Treasury will underwrite it.  That has given us the confidence to be able to issue those letters of offer, which include that line to the effect that the UK Treasury will underwrite that.  This is one piece of very good news because we see that funding as being as secure as it could possibly be.  We will keep that situation under review.  We will have to look at the impact on the projects and we intend to undertake evaluations and technical studies.  The impact of Brexit is one aspect but also in regard to the projects delivering outputs for which they were being funded.<\/p> <p>  As a result of the referendum we have to keep this under review.  We do not know how it will play out.  We do not know what the terms of the Brexit may be but we will continually manage that and look to do whatever we can to mitigate any of the negative aspects that would come with  that.  That will involve talking to the people behind those projects and to the Departments involved in the policy areas to make sure that we do complementary work to them with a view to seeing what we can do to help the projects.<\/p> <p>  From our point of view, those projects we are funding at present are as secure as they can possibly be.  The programmes are still in place.  We have the necessary assurances in place to be able to issue those letters of offer.  I totally agree with the Deputy that the projects have been delivered in disadvantaged areas with money that has been made available to those projects that would not have been able to be made available previously because of competing priorities.  The EU programmes, and the establishment of our body, give a good regional approach to that.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that those projects have delivered so much more than funding.  I would say the mind border was opened for all those projects.  They were able to face outwards from the region.  We are also involved with other projects in regard to the transnational programmes and we direct organisations in Northern Ireland to engage with those programmes.

We are currently assessing eight applications, which look at solutions in the area of precision medicine, advanced manufacturing for medical engineering and alternative energy.

They have removed the uncertainty that existed with regard to these programmes.  As I said earlier, the last thing we want is for uncertainty to set into the work of community groups.  Business, commerce and trade interests along the Border have enough uncertainty as it is.  We will have uncertainty until Britain's membership of the EU actually comes to an end.  The lead-in period is going to be difficult for everybody, but it will be particularly difficult for those involved in trade, commerce and business.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask Ms McIntyre about the funding of capital projects and revenue projects, which is a distinction that used to be made in central government Departments and at local authority level.  Capital projects involve the provision of new bricks and mortar facilities.  The revenue side involves the funding of ongoing programmes of support in areas like child care, health, education and community endeavour.  Ms McIntyre mentioned that some projects will continue beyond 2020.  Is it expected that such projects are more likely to be on the revenue support side than on the capital side?  Is there an expectation that capital projects will need to be completed before 2019 or whenever Britain leaves the EU?<\/p> <p>  As a representative of two rural Border counties, I have worked with Ms McIntyre's colleagues since the PEACE and INTERREG programmes were first established.  These programmes have been and continue to be of huge benefit to many urban and rural communities.  They have built capacity in communities and have given communities that were not previously getting assistance from central or local government the confidence to do things.  In many cases, the quantum of money was important but not as important as the assistance to help a community group to get a project moving along.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of facilities that were developed by great projects in counties Cavan and Monaghan and are being used day and night to a huge extent.  They would not have been developed without the PEACE and INTERREG programmes and the initiative of certain people.  Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach in 1994 worked with other people in the North and the South to get the EU to support these projects.  Mr. Alasdair McDonnell's party was hugely supportive of this very innovative and ambitious initiative in the European Parliament at the time.  Thankfully, there has been a huge return to communities, individuals and families on the work and investment of the Irish and British Governments and the EU, from which most of the investment has come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016111700002#O00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1479391200,"counter":2253,"content":"<p>I invite Ms McIntyre to respond to Deputies Breathnach and Smith and to make any concluding remarks she may wish to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2016111700002#O00300","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1479391200,"counter":2254,"content":"<p>I would say we are positive.

This matter needs to be kept under constant review.  At the end of 2018, we will review whether anything has changed and whether we need to make any specific changes in this respect within the programmes.

It relates to the timing of payments.  A number of similar amendments have been tabled and all relate to the date on which payments are to be made.  They seek to bring forward the date of payment of the relevant payments to 1 January.  The rationale for changing budget day some years ago was to ensure all payments and taxation measures would run for the entire calendar year from 1 January to 31 December.  It was to give departmental officials time to roll out the taxation measures and changes introduced in the budget from 1 January.  I understand the amendment has been ruled out of order because it would impose an additional cost on the Exchequer, but that does not take from the principle that a commitment was given to run budgets from 1 January to 31 December, a commitment from which we have moved away.  While many other taxation measures will take effect from 1 January, payments for pensioners and people with disabilities are being pushed back to March.

Ten amendments were tabled to seek to have all of the relevant payments made from 1 January.  It is unfortunate that old age pensioners and people with disabilities will have to wait until March to receive their increased payments.  It may be a little late in the day, but I urge the Minister to reconsider that decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#C01300","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2279,"content":"<p>The amendments are ruled out because they would impose a charge on the Exchequer.  I can understand the rationale but I believe it is time to look at this rule, especially in the context of the changed political situation.  I put it to the Minister that, at a minimum, this regulation preventing Members of the Opposition from putting forward amendments that are a charge on the Exchequer is being very broadly interpreted by the relevant officials.  We have put down amendments in the past which by no stretch of the imagination could be deemed to be a charge on the Exchequer, but they were ruled out of order on the one-in-a-million chance that they might be a charge on the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  I recall a situation when I was the Minister.  Certain amendments were put forward by the Opposition that were ruled out of order since they would impose a charge on the Exchequer.  I agreed with those amendments and I did not think they would impose a charge on the Exchequer.  The net result was that I had to bring an amendment on Report Stage because I agreed with the amendments being put forward.  It is high time we looked at that.<\/p> <p>  There is a more general point about the amendments.  Deputy Brady is right.  Since we introduced the practice of October budgets it has been automatic that increases come into effect from 1 January.  Obviously, this is a departure from that situation.  In my view, it is an unwelcome departure.  If the budget is in October, even late October, pensioners and those reliant on social welfare are entitled to assume that an increase in their social welfare will be an increase for the year beginning 1 January.  I call on the Minister to give an indication that it is his intention to revert to the logical system whereby changes in an October budget will come into effect from 1 January rather than six months later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#D00100","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2280,"content":"<p>The Deputies points are well made.  In the course of the budget negotiations my efforts were initially aimed at ensuring that there would be a &euro;5 increase in the basic maximum payments for all recipients and that this would be the case across the board.  That was my first priority.  My second priority was that the increase would be &euro;5.  My third priority was that it would be put in place as early as possible.  I got my way on the first two points but I struggled to get my way on the third point.<\/p> <p>  There was talk of May and June.  We managed to push it back.  With the assistance of the party opposite, we managed to keep bringing it back to an earlier date.  Early March was the date we agreed.  Of course I would have preferred for the date to be 1 January, but I do not have &euro;60 million to do that.  The only way to create the &euro;60 million necessary would be to exclude one group - potentially, jobseekers, and I had no wish to do that - or else pay less than &euro;5, for example, &euro;3.80 or &euro;4, and I had no wish to do that either.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, I will make the submission for the budget next year on the basis that we will revert to 1 January as the normal day for such payments.  Before that became the norm, it was not the norm.  Throughout the 1990s when we had budgets in October, it was regular for increases not to come into effect until March, April or even May.  These would have included McCreevy budgets, for example.  It is not unprecedented.  In this budget, as in previous budgets, certain measures come in at different times of the year.  The first-time buyer incentive is being backdated to July for a particular reason.  Other measures, such as the child care subsidy, are not coming into effect until September.  It is not unprecedented historically nor is it entirely unusual in the context of this budget and social welfare package.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#D00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2281,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2282,"content":"<p>SECTION 7<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2283,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 is out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#D00500","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2284,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2285,"content":"<p>Section 7 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2286,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2287,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 3 is deemed out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#D00900","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2288,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 3 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2289,"content":"<p>Section 8 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2290,"content":"<p>SECTION 9<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2291,"content":"<p>There are no amendments to section 9.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#D01300","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2292,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 9 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2293,"content":"<p>The Minister is extending the various benefits, including dental and optical benefits, to the self-employed.

This is the idea that everyone pays into the system.  Everyone should pay social insurance, even if it is only a small amount.  In return, everyone should benefit.  We run the risk in this society of dividing society into a group of people who pay a lot of taxes and get little in return, because they are excluded due to means tests and so on, and another group who contribute very little, who think they should not contribute anything, but who, at the same time, think they should be entitled to everything, even for free.  That is not the kind of society I want.  The society I want is one that is contributory, one in which everyone who can pay in, pays in, even if it is only a small amount.  In return, people get guaranteed benefits that are not means tested or do not involve waiting lists.  The social insurance benefits we get, such as the contributory pension, maternity benefit, paternity benefit and so on are good examples.  Treatment benefit is one of these.<\/p> <p>  While this may not be the position of my party, my personal view is that I foresee us in future using the social insurance system in the way that France does, for example, to pay for more things and, perhaps, more treatments.  For example, in France a person can have his doctor fees partially refunded from social insurance.  I am unsure about chiropodists but potentially it could work for them as well.  That is a good system of social insurance and it works.  First of all, it is contributory.  People understand that they have to pay for it and that someone else is not going to pay for it.  They know Apple or someone else will not pay for medical care.  That system also allows us to use private providers effectively.<\/p><p>There has never been a waiting list for any of these schemes.

Payment of class S contributions will also give entitlement to a range of other benefits, subject to satisfying the contribution conditions for these schemes.  In addition to State pension, councillors will be entitled to access widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension should a councillor die while at working age, guardian's payment, maternity benefit, paternity benefit and adoptive benefit should they need to take time off to look after a child.<\/p><p>With effect from December 2017, as we discussed earlier, self-employed workers will have access to invalidity pension on the same basis as employees.

The committee will return to this issue and make recommendations to the Minister.  It would, therefore, be good if the Department were to examine it, particularly in the light of the Crosse-Millar report, and report back to the committee to inform our discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#F01100","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2323,"content":"<p>I wanted to see something in the Bill to help lone parents and piggybacked on the amendment tabled by Deputy John Brady.  It is an important amendment.  I wish to bolster the argument made for it.  Disregarding the Minister's position on poverty levels, organisations such as Bernardos, Social Justice Ireland and SPARK, as well as the Crosse-Millar report, all emphasise that there is a continuum of child poverty rates among children of lone parents.  The figure stands at 22.1%.  It is 7.9% for two-parent families with fewer than four children.  That figure was referred to in another report in 2014.  We are talking about lone parents and a certain number of two-parent families.  The issue has to be dealt with and needs to be reviewed continuously.  I, therefore, urge the Minister to support the amendment.  As stated, the issue has been discussed in committee.  Three groups have attended to date and they have all emphasised the fact that there is no doubt that there is child poverty in this country and that we have to deal with the issue.  While they welcome the increase in the income disregard and the Christmas bonus, the fundamental issues have to be challenged.  I support the amendment and ask the Minister to support it also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#F01200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2324,"content":"<p>Lest anything I said in the past has been misconstrued, I do not deny for one second that there is child poverty.  Of course, there is.  I also acknowledge that the rate of poverty among children is higher than it is among adults.  The rate of child poverty in Ireland is significantly higher than the rate of among pensioners.  I acknowledge that the rate of poverty among children in households where someone is parenting alone is higher than it is in households where there are two parents.  While we might disagree on the percentage, I do not deny and totally accept that there is a problem.  How I think we should deal with it may be different.  We should deal with it by having more lone parents in work rather than in receipt of welfare payments and focusing on services such as child care rather than transfers.  Where there are transfers, the best way to deal with child poverty is through having a new system of transfers.  I hope the working family payment will do this.  It will be a targeted payment to reduce child poverty and which will not take much interest in whether a person is married or cohabiting or otherwise or even whether he or she is working.  I would like to see it, if one likes, as a second tier of child benefit for lower income families.  This is probably the best way to deal with child poverty.<\/p> <p>  On the amendments, the Deputies will be aware that my Department administers more than 65 separate schemes and services which serve a diverse group of clients, including families, employees and employers, jobseekers, people with disabilities, carers and older people.  All of the schemes and services are kept under constant review, with a view to ensuring they continue to meet the needs of my Department's customers.  In line with the programme for Government and the responsibilities of my Department more generally, a number of specific reviews are under way or will commence shortly.  They include a review of the back to work family dividend which will be a focused policy assessment which is being undertaken.  It is examining the rationale underpinning the scheme and its effectiveness in helping families to transition from welfare payments to work.  A formal review of the jobseeker's transition payment will commence in 2017.  It will take the form of a value for money review and examine the payment since its inception in 2013.<\/p><p>With regard to the working family payment, in line with the programme for Government the effectiveness of the family income supplement scheme is currently being examined along with a range of other supports for jobseekers and those in employment in the context of developing a new working family payment.  On the issue of reduced rates of jobseeker's allowance for young jobseekers, the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, is currently undertaking research to examine the effectiveness of the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training and employment programmes and opportunities.  The findings of this research will inform my Department&rsquo;s review of the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers into employment, education or training.  A review of the community employment, CE, scheme has been completed and the findings of that review are now being considered.  The proposed amendments call for the laying of reports before the House following a review of the impact of the increase in the national minimum wage on income thresholds for social welfare, the household benefits package, eligibility criteria for qualifying for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, eligibility criteria for the State contributory pension and changes introduced to the one-parent family payment in 2012, which I know is the matter of most concern to Deputies in the House, given their comments.  As I have indicated when I attended this committee recently, my officials and I will continue to work closely with the Oireachtas joint committee and will continue to regularly appear before the committee to present and respond on matters of interest to the committee, including the reports that I have mentioned, as well as addressing issues such those that affect lone parents and the working family payment.<\/p><p> From listening to Deputies just now, the obvious major concern is around the changes that were made to the one-parent family welfare entitlements.  The difficulty in doing any review now is that it is still early days and, as with any reform, it may take a number of years before the full impact of the measure is known.  We know already that 3,000 lone parents have moved from a weekly payment to family income supplement and therefore, by definition, have moved out of poverty.  That is positive.  There are a number of measures in the budget to assist lone parents back to education, to allow them to keep more earned income if they are working, and to increase their weekly payments whether they are working or not.  Again, we will not know the impact of those measures for some time.<\/p><p> Deputies are aware of the Millar and Crosse report on activation.  We had hoped that good advice would come out of the report on what activation measures work.  Unfortunately the report fell short in that regard.  It was not, and does not claim to be, an analysis of the impact of the changes - made by the previous Government - on lone parents.  The report was based on interviews with people from interest groups and with a number of lone parents.  It was not an econometric analysis of how the changes impacted on people across the board, but perhaps that is merited.  I would be open to asking my Department to commission a report from an independent body such as the ESRI, or another body, to actually carry out that assessment and have a look back on the impact of the changes.  For some people the changes have been positive.  For others they have been negative.  Perhaps it is an appropriate time to ask such an independent body to carry out an analysis to be published within six months.  I would prefer to not have that written into the legislation but if Deputies are willing to do that I would be happy to make a commitment that we would commission such an analysis and have it done within six months.  This may help us to inform any decisions we make going in to the budget negotiations in September 2017. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#F01300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2326,"content":"<p>I welcome the last couple of lines spoken by the Minister, if he is going to support this amendment.  It is critical that we have a report because we do not need to wait to see the impact on lone parents and their families of the measures introduced.  The Minister is correct - and he acknowledged the fact - that the reality is children in lone-parent families are at a higher poverty level of 22.1%, as opposed to 11% for children in two-parent families.  That is nearly double the State average of child poverty levels.  We do not need to wait to see the impact.  We need a report.  I welcome the Minister's support for this amendment.  The Minister made reference to the report by Dr. Millar.  It is interesting that there has been no formal response by the Minister to the Millar report.  This does not surprise me because the Millar report lays on the table, in black and white, the impact of these changes on lone-parent families.  It may not be the report the Minister wanted.  It may not be the report he was hoping for or was expecting but it is a report that shows the impacts quite graphically and it makes a series of recommendations.  The difficulties and the impacts of these changes on lone parents have been compounded in budget 2017.  For some lone parents it is actually better for them to go back on to a jobseeker's payment, and I assure the Minister this is happening as we speak.  Because of the changes in the budget, lone parents are looking at how much better off they are, either in employment or in receipt of the jobseeker's payment.  Unfortunately the measures that have been introduced - and compounded in this budget - mean it is more financially rewarding for lone parents to stay on a jobseeker's payment.  These are the realities.  I welcome that the Minister is going to agree to the amendment, and I welcome the fact that he chose to throw into the mix a number of the other reports that the Department is going to look at such as the programme for Government commitment around the discriminatory payments for unemployed people who are under the age of 26.  Last week I queried the T&aacute;naiste on the whereabouts of that report, as it was committed to in the programme for Government.  I welcome the fact that the report is coming, albeit a little bit late.  I believe the report with regard to the discriminatory cuts in payments for the under-26s was committed to be delivered in the last quarter of this year.  As the Minister brought these into the discussion here in the Chamber, and we probably will not have another opportunity, perhaps he could give members specific timeframes around the delivery of the reports, especially the report on the cuts in payments for those under 26.  When exactly can we see that report?  As with lone parents, people under 26 who are unemployed have not only been hit with cuts that are discriminatory, there are real hard-hitting consequences for young unemployed people as shown in figures provided by groups such as Focus Ireland which illustrate the increase in youth homelessness.  Could the Minister provide clarity around those measures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#G00200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2327,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's point but would like some clarity.  He spoke about an independent report, rather than a slight change to the wording, within six months.  I am concerned by this as the Minister has only recently had an independent report from Millar and Crosse.  The Minister has said that the report was not evidence-based, was not broad enough, it gave too narrow a focus and that it only interviewed particular groups and a few lone parents.  There was another report recently with regard to lone parents in education, which was supposed to have come before the budget to give some ideas around education.  I would like to reiterate to the Minister that lone parents, along with other groups such as disability groups, were really hammered during the austerity years.  In 2015 the one-parent family payment was taken away, the back to work family dividend was brought in at a much lower level and the family income supplement was introduced.  Two years later, a lone parent who works 20 hours per week has an income that is 17% less than before, even though they are in work and trying to earn money.<\/p><p>If they get sick, they cannot get any support either.  As a society, it will be shameful if we do not examine the effect it is having on child poverty and how we can change payments to support lone parents, families and people aged under 25 years.

Is JST exclusive to lone parents?  Perhaps the report could cover a number of the issues we are discussing.  The Minister said the best way out of poverty was to get a job.  The difficulty is that the changes brought about have made it less attractive for many lone parents to go out to work.  I have read the Millar report and it accords exactly with my experience in dealing with my constituents every day.  I could bring several constituency files to the Minister which clearly show how lone parents are losing out as a result of the changes.  Therein lies the difficulty.  The Minister said it was early days to review the system.  However, it has been in operation for more than two years.  Many people, not lone parents who stay at home and collect their social welfare but genuine people who want to better themselves and improve their family circumstances by going out to work, are worse off and continue to be worse off as a result of the changes.  We cannot put it on the long finger or discuss the potential for different schemes in the future.  It is having a real effect on real people as we speak.<\/p> <p>  I did not take in the Minister's last point.  Does he propose that he will commission the ESRI or some outside body to produce an independent report which would be available to the committee?  That is good and I welcome it.  However, I must be a little sceptical about these things.  I was here when the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Joan Burton, made a very firm commitment to the House that the changes would not be brought about until the Scandinavian child care system was in place in this country.

People in receipt of rent supplement are prohibited from working more than a certain number of hours, which deters people from returning to work.  Nowhere in the Millar report is it stated, nor did I hear at committee level until I asked the question, what the benefit will be to the families who will avail of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme that will allow them to work more hours than they are working, or the additional child care measures that have been put in place and that will come in for those families who need it the most.  The Minister has focused in on those very heavily.

Although I do not know when the final draft will be delivered, I will find out and let the committee know later in the afternoon.  Youth unemployment is falling very rapidly, and faster than unemployment among older adults.  That has to count for something.  There are specific measures regarding young people who are homeless, such as reducing their rent contributions, which I have included in the budget in response to requests from the homeless charities.  While some have said the reduction in jobseeker's allowance for young jobseekers has contributed to the rise in homelessness, I have yet to see any evidence-based paper or analysis that supports this opinion.  While people are entitled to their opinions, it is not a fact.<\/p> <p>  I do not think my Department commissioned the Millar report, although we funded it through the Irish Research Council.  It was to be a report on activation, what works and how we can get lone parents into employment.  Unfortunately, it was not that.  It turned into something different.  It was an interview-based analysis of the changes made over the years.  Unfortunately, it was not very useful to us.  We can do a formal response to it.  However, it did not give us what we wanted, what we asked for or what it said in its title, namely, Lone Parents and Activation, What Works and Why.  I had hoped what would come out of it would have been a study of, for example, ten different countries and a list of ten actions that succeed in activating lone parents and ten actions that do not.  It did not do this.  It fell down very badly on what it was supposed to give us.  It is disappointing.  However, the Millar report does show the need for us to commission a report into the impact of the changes and the reforms of lone parent payments during recent years.  It must examine several issues, including the impact on incomes, employment and welfare dependency.  Most of us in the House, maybe not all of us, believe reducing welfare dependency is a good thing.  Some academics question this view and believe people are better off on welfare than in certain types of employment.<\/p><p>I do not believe that.  For reasons of confidence, mental health, self-respect and how they are considered in society, people are always better off working than on welfare, even if they might be a little better off on welfare.  I appreciate that some politicians do not agree with that view.  Many academics certainly do not hold that view, although they never seem to identify where the funds should come from to pay for a contrary view.  With the Deputies' agreement, and if they are willing to withdraw these amendments, I propose to commission such a report and have it carried out by an external body.  I am not sure whether we must tender it but I would have thought a body such as the ESRI or similar would be the kind of body that could carry out the report and consider the matter in the round, namely, the impact on employment, incomes and welfare dependency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#H00700","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2336,"content":"<p>I will not withdraw the amendment.

We need the provision in the legislation, not for the sake of it, because, as Deputy Kenny said, we do not want a report or document to be prepared only to be put on a shelf alongside many other reports that have not been acted on.  It needs to be a factual report that ultimately will be acted on.  I could have tabled a series of other amendments to the Bill asking the Minister to take measures to reverse some of the measures that impact on lone parents but, as I outlined in my opening contribution, my hands are tied as to the type of amendment I can table.  We have seen numerous amendments ruled out of order because of a financial impact on the Exchequer.  Having the measure provided for in this amendment contained in legislation, tying the Government to carrying out the report, is one part of the equation; acting on it is the second part.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Minister's comments on welfare dependency.  I and my party strive to end it and to get people back to work, but it is difficult when zero-hour contracts affect many of the people about whom we are talking and when the Government has failed even on the family income supplement.  There has been no increase in the family income supplement to provide assistance to many of the people about whom we are speaking, such as lone parents, etc.  The Minister can come into the Chamber and talk the talk, but problems occur when there is failure to increase the support provided under measures such as the family income supplement.  That is what forces people on zero-hour contracts or in low-pay employment back onto jobseeker's allowance because the latter may be financially more advantageous to them because of the failure of the Minister's Government to provide an increase in the family income supplement.  He outlined that some economists and politicians put forward proposals and suggest increases but fail to show where they will get the money from.  If the Minister took the time to read through Sinn F&eacute;in's pre-budget submission, he would see that my party proposed an increase in the family income supplement and showed where the money for the increase would come from, in line with all the other increases and measures about which we speak.<\/p> <p>  Finally, regarding youth unemployment, the Minister said that the figures and statistics put out on youth homelessness are only that.  He said there are no figures and no hard or concrete evidence to back up statements on youth homelessness.  However, these are departmental figures that show that youth homelessness is on the increase.  That can only be down to the measures that have been introduced.  I welcome the marginal increase in the amount that young homeless people or young people in receipt of rent supplement must pay out of their pockets, but that will only affect in the region of 500 under-26s, so we are not dealing with huge numbers.<\/p> <p>  There are many issues in this regard.

The JST payment is discrete to those in that situation.  I would commit to a new report considering comprehensively the changes to the one-parent family, not just the JST payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#J01300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2348,"content":"<p>The Minister asks what the point is in having many different reports.

We want to make sure that, as Deputy Brady says, the money is targeted and spent in the most efficient possible way.  The Minister said that he has singled out one report, and I appreciate this.

This effectively happened with the Irish aviation superannuation scheme, IASS.  The OECD has recommended that no scheme should be permitted to wind down unless it is 90% funded.  That type of funding level makes some allowance for decent benefits to be paid out to members.  That must be examined along with abolishing single insolvencies.  We will table amendments on it on Report Stage.  I mention it now because there is nowhere else to mention it.<\/p> <p>  On section 12, FLAC, the free legal advice centres, contacted most of the members about a few amendments it wished to propose.  It made the point that the explanatory memorandum states that in order to facilitate reviews of entitlement where child benefit is payable in accordance with EU regulations, section 12 provides for an amendment to require employers to provide information relating to child benefit claims.  In effect, according to FLAC, section 12 proposes to provide wide powers to the Minister for Social Protection to enact regulations to compel all employers to provide information on employees for the purpose of determining entitlement to child benefit claims.  Child benefit is classified as a family benefit for the purpose of EU regulations.  Accordingly, EU nationals who come to Ireland to work but whose family resides in other EU member states have an entitlement to family benefits in Ireland under EU regulations.  This means that EU migrants can access child benefit in Ireland even if their children live in another EU member state.  FLAC and Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation, CLM, have a number of concerns about this proposed provision and how it will operate in practice.  In particular, they are unclear as to the necessity for such a provision.<\/p> <p>  First, section 12 as currently drafted does not fulfil its stated aim of applying solely to child benefit claims payable in accordance with EU regulations.  The proposed wording is extremely broad and goes beyond its stated intended scope to relate to any child benefit claims.  Given that the employment status of an Irish parent is immaterial to a child benefit claim, it is likely that the Department will only contact employers for information regarding non-Irish nationals if the provision is maintained in its current form.<\/p> <p>  Second, FLAC says the need for such a measure is questionable in light of the responsibility on all social welfare applicants to prove to the Department that they qualify for the payment they are applying for, including child benefit payments payable in accordance with EU regulations.  It is not clear why the Department is seeking to place legal obligations on employers to provide information regarding child benefit claims for EU migrant workers when the onus is already on those workers to establish their eligibility for the payment.<\/p> <p>  Third, information confirming the employment status of an EU migrant worker in Ireland will often be available to the Department of Social Protection through social insurance contribution records.  To be considered an EU migrant worker, a person must have been in genuine employment since coming to Ireland.  Casual work does not count.  Where an EU migrant worker is engaged in genuine employment in Ireland, they and their employer will be making social insurance contributions to the Department of Social Protection, thus the need for this measure is unclear.<\/p><p>Finally, there are also privacy concerns about this proposal.  Employers will be required to provide information in respect of child benefit and may become privy to personal information regarding the family situation of their employees which is of no relevance to the employment relationship.  <\/p><p> Is this really the right place to include an amendment of this sort?  I would like to hear the view of the Department on these issues and to tease them out further with the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#AA00400","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2376,"content":"<p>Before I go to the Minister, are there any other Deputies who wish to contribute on section 12?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#BB00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2377,"content":"<p>Yes.  I am concerned with the definition of a \"qualified child\" and seek some clarity from the Minister with regard to this section of the Bill.

In terms of a qualified child payment to a parent in receipt of social welfare, an 18 year old is deemed to be an adult.  There seems to be a serious anomaly there that the Minister must address.  We cannot have two different definitions of a child, one relating to child benefit and the other relating to the qualified child payment.  I ask the Minister to clarify that.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the proposed removal of the words, \"who is ordinarily resident in the State\".  Does that mean that a person living in this State is entitled to receive child benefit for a child or children who do not live within the State?  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Joan Collins made reference to direct provision earlier, about which I have serious concerns.

On section 11 as opposed to section 12, the provision does not relate to child benefit but to the supplementary welfare allowance.  The proposed amendment will amend the definition of a qualified child under the supplementary allowance scheme to ensure that the qualified child allowance payment is only paid in respect of children who are ordinarily resident in the State.  This measure will bring the conditionality of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme into line with other Department of Social Protection schemes.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is a safety net within the overall social welfare system and provides assistance to eligible people who are in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents.  The basic supplementary welfare allowance is a weekly allowance paid to eligible people who do not have enough income to meet their needs and those of their families and may be payable while such people are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment.  It does not affect child benefit.  It is simply a restating of the fact that people cannot receive the qualified child allowance for a child who is not living in the country.<\/p><p>On section 12, I have a lengthy reply for the committee because the Free Legal Aid Centres, FLAC has also been in touch with my Department about this section.  This reply gives me the opportunity to put on the record the answers to some of the questions posed by Deputy Joan Collins.<\/p><p>The purpose of section 12 of the Bill is to underpin the process whereby my Department contacts employers to verify continuing employment specifically for child benefit purposes.  The provision is modelled on existing provisions for other social welfare schemes such as the family income supplement, FIS, and the back-to-work family dividend, BTWFD.  My Department is empowered by these provisions to contact employers to verify employment details in order to establish entitlement, new or ongoing, to benefits.  European Union, EU, European Economic Area, EEA, citizens and Swiss nationals working in Ireland qualify for child benefit under EU regulations.  Their children may be resident either here or in their home countries.  The child does not have to be resident in the country but the parent does.  Where the children are resident abroad, customers are required to confirm their continued entitlement to child benefit every six months.  The confirmation includes a statement from the customer's employer or their spouse or partner&rsquo;s employer confirming that the employment is expected to continue.  <\/p><p>While it is absolutely correct to say that the employment status of an Irish parent is immaterial to a child benefit claim, all child benefit customers claiming under domestic legislation must satisfy the habitual residence condition.<b><\/b>One factor to be taken into consideration in determining habitual residence is the nature and pattern of a person&rsquo;s employment.  Persons are exempt from satisfying the habitual residence condition if they or their spouse or partner are currently employed.  So, by establishing that they are employed, they do not have to go through the process of verifying habitual residence because, by definition if they are employed here they are habitually resident.  For these reasons, it is sometimes necessary for my Department to have access to information on the employment of the customer or his or her spouse or partner.  <\/p><p>In general, the onus is on customers themselves to prove to my Department that they qualify for any social welfare payment they are applying for, including child benefit payments.  However, situations can arise where it is less problematic for the customer if my Department contacts employers directly in order to confirm employment.  For example, difficulties can arise in the case of child benefit when information on employment is required and where the information does not refer to the customer but to the spouse or partner of the customer.  This is particularly difficult in separation or divorce cases where the customer may not have the co-operation of the spouse, partner or former partner in terms of supplying the required information.  This can lead to a situation where there is an entitlement to child benefit but where the processing of the claim can be impeded.  Contacting employers directly removes this difficulty for customers in that situation.<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font><\/p><p>My Department has access to social insurance contribution records.  However, these records only become available at the end of the tax year and are not available to the Department in real time.  This means that they can only be updated in arrears but while my Department routinely requires employment information for benefit purposes in real time, to await updated social insurance records would delay payment to customers.  The practical thing to do, and the most customer-focused solution, is to contact employers directly where the customer is not in a position to easily provide the necessary information him or herself.  These inquiries with employers are not made on a routine basis and there are no plans to change that.  Having this provision in place will ensure that my Department has a robust legislative basis to make these inquiries where the need arises.  <\/p><p>I will sign the necessary regulations if this section of the Bill is enacted.  These regulations will set out the elements of the information which will be sought from employers for child benefit purposes. <\/p><p>I will now turn to the specific questions raised by FLAC.  On the first question, it is correct to stay that the employment status of an Irish parent is immaterial to a child benefit claim.  However, all child benefit customers must satisfy the habitual residence condition and one of the qualifying factors for that condition is the nature and pattern of their employment.  For that reason, it is necessary for the child benefit section in Letterkenny to have access to information on the employment status of one or both parents or partners.  <\/p><p>On the second question, while it is correct to say that the onus is on customers themselves to prove to the Department that they qualify, difficulties do arise in the case of child benefit, as I have already outlined.  I have also already addressed the third question posed by FLAC.  The fourth question relates to casual work.  FLAC has expressed the opinion that such work does not count but this is not entirely correct.  EU Regulation No. 883\/2004, Article 1, subsection (a) reads as follows: <\/p><blockquote>&quot;activity as an employed person&quot; means any activity or equivalent situation treated as such for the purposes of the social security legislation of the Member State in which such activity or equivalent situation exists.<\/blockquote><p>Confirmation of such employment is required to establish an entitlement to child benefit.<\/p><p> Regarding privacy, the Department is aware of the obligations of the data controller and makes every effort to avoid breaching these obligations.  The provisions contained in the proposed legislation already exist in terms of most schemes operated by the Department and have been successfully implemented over the years.<\/p><p> I hope that clarifies the matter.  To cut a long story short, it is not a provision designed in any way to take child benefit from people who are legally here and habitually resident.  Rather, it allows us the legislative basis to contact employers.  Once we know that people are here and in employment in Ireland, we do not need to go through the rigmarole of working out whether they are habitually resident.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#BB00700","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2383,"content":"<p>I listened to the Minister.

Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures contains the child-specific poverty target and commitments on improving economic security and opportunity outcomes for children and young people.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has published two annual reports on progress with implementing commitments to date.

Separate from that, the Department is carrying out a focused policy assessment of the back to work family dividend scheme.  This assessment is focusing on the rationale underpinning the scheme and examining its effectiveness in helping families transition from welfare to work.  The back to work family dividend was designed with the explicit aim of improving the financial work incentives of families in Ireland.  It is designed as an in-work income support to assist families when exiting welfare.  The scheme provides a targeted additional incentive for families to move from welfare to work as employees or self-employed by allowing families to retain payments for children to ensure they are better off in work.  The back to work family dividend scheme allows jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit recipients who have been jobseekers for 12 months or more or recipients of the one parent family payment to retain their full increase for qualified children for the first year in employment, tapering to 50% in the second year.  The dividend is payable at a maximum rate of &euro;29.80 per relevant child up to a maximum of &euro;119.20 for four children.  The number of recipients of the back to work family dividend at the end of September 2016 was just over 12,000 with more than 21,200 beneficiaries.  This includes almost 7,200 former one parent family payment recipients.  The dividend is payable in addition to the family income supplement and has no impact on a family's FIS entitlement.  Combined with the main in-work support, which is FIS, the dividend provides families with a significant financial incentive to make the transition from welfare to employment.  The ESRI also reached the same conclusion after undertaking detailed analysis of it.  Its findings were published in their budget perspectives 2016 paper, Making Work Pay More.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#DD01300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2423,"content":"<p>Did I understand the Minister to say the Department is already carrying out a study on this?

The amendments now being introduced arise from a recent change in secondary legislation and the pending commencement of certain sections of primary legislation enacted by the Department of Justice and Equality, both of which require that the habitual residence provisions of social welfare law be updated.  I emphasise that there is no change to the habitual residence policy resulting from these amendments.  They relate to the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015 and the International Protection Act 2015, both of which were introduced by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>The European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015 give further effect to the EU directive on the rights of EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within member states.  The regulations came into force on 1 February 2016.  They replaced the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 which are currently referenced in the habitual residence provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.  The amendment is necessary to continue to provide that a person who is in the State in accordance with EU law is among those regarded as having a right to reside in the State for the habitual residence provisions.<\/p><p>The International Protection Act 2015 restates and modifies certain aspects of the law relating to the entry into and presence in the State of persons in need of international protection.  Under the Act, certain legislation, including the Refugee Act 1996, the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 and the European (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013 are revoked.  They are currently referenced in the habitual residence provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.  The proposed amendments will replace these provisions with the relevant provisions of the new International Protection Act.<\/p><p>I emphasise that the amendments will continue to ensure that, once protection such as refugee status, is granted to a person, that person has a right to access social welfare supports in Ireland on the same basis as an Irish citizen.  Such persons are entitled to apply for any social welfare payment appropriate to their circumstances, subject to satisfying the eligibility criteria of the particular scheme.  The amendments provide that any person who has a refugee declaration or a subsidiary protection declaration under the International Protection Act will have a right to reside for social welfare purposes.  They also include similar provisions for family members of such persons who have permission to reside in the State and persons who are in the State as programme refugees in accordance with the International Protection Act.<\/p><p>While the amendments in respect of the International Protection Act primarily update the current habitual residence provisions, they also provide that persons who have been granted temporary protection as part of a group of displaced persons under that Act, are regarded as having a right to reside under the habitual residence provisions.  The amendments continue to provide that persons granted protection cannot be regarded as habitually resident in the State for any period before the date protection was granted to them.  They maintain the policy that certain persons such as applicants for or those refused protection, or in respect of whom a deportation order has been made, cannot be considered to be habitually resident in the State for social welfare purposes.  However, while applicants for international protection, mainly asylum seekers, cannot access the schemes to which the habitual residence provisions apply, the Department of Social Protection provides certain supports for them while they are awaiting a decision on their international protection applications.  Such supports include the payment of the direct provision allowance and, as appropriate, exceptional needs payments.  Such persons may also qualify for the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.<\/p><p>It is intended that the provisions relating to the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015 will take effect on the enactment of the Bill.  The amendments arising from the International Protection Act 2015 will come into force on the commencement of the relevant provisions of that Act.  This is expected to occur before the end of the year.  To cut a long story short, the International Protection Act which has been passed by the Oireachtas, is replacing a number of pieces of legislation, including the old Refugee Act 1996, the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 and the European (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013.  We need to update social welfare law by taking them out and inserting the provisions of the new legislation in order that everything will be aligned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#EE00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2434,"content":"<p>This is a long and complex amendment.  I understand the regulations of 2016 are replacing the regulations of 2005.  Is the Minister satisfied that the changes being made do not in any way diminish the right of the people concerned to claim social welfare payments?  Section 246 of the Act, to which the Minister refers, makes it a condition of receiving social welfare payments that a person must be present in the State or another part of the common travel area which includes Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, for a continuous period of at least two years.  It is my experience that this condition is being interpreted very rigidly by social welfare officers.  Many of the people concerned come here in circumstances where, even after two years, they are not able to provide telephone or other bills to prove that they are living here.  I have come across cases of injustice arising directly from the fact that the condition is being interpreted very strictly.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is incorporating a new category.

Perhaps after six months  or one year that job will come to an end and the person concerned will then try to sign on.  There are difficulties with the requirement for such persons to have lived in the State for two years.  While I am not asking for it to be covered in the Bill, I am flagging it as an issue.  I have come across Irish citizens who emigrated, came back, were in a job for a year and then sought entitlements.  It is difficult to prove they have been here for two years to qualify.

What used to be the two-year rule is no more.  I only discovered this in my studies in the past couple of months.  The two-year rule was overturned by the European Court of Justice in favour of a new provision, whereby a person's habitual residence is established according to consideration of five tests or factors to work out his or her centre of economic interest.  It concerns where he or she works and where his or her family and savings are.  That is, of course, much trickier to interpret than having something very straightforward such as a two-year rule.  That is what my officials have to look at in determining whether somebody is habitually resident.  It probably is interpreted strictly, which is not necessarily bad.  We do not want people to arrive in Ireland and claim under our welfare system if they are not habitually resident and do not have a centre of interest here.  I am sure most people do not want that to be the case.<\/p> <p>  Deputy John Brady made a very valid point about the downside of all of this in referring to returning emigrants who are Irish citizens.  I have come across this in the case of missionaries returning from missions having not been habitually resident in Ireland for a very long time.  We are looking to find some solutions to that dilemma.  However, obviously under European law we have to treat all European citizens the same.  There are many Irish citizens who have never lived in Ireland.  If we were to say they or somebody who has been out of the country for 40 years could avail of the welfare system straightaway, we would have to give the same right to 500 million EU citizens.<\/p><p>That is one of the consequences of the freedom of movement and the four freedoms that people are so attached to for various reasons.<\/p><p> With regard to returning emigrants specifically, arrangements are in place with Safe Home, a registered charity, to assist with the difficulties experienced by some returning Irish emigrants in demonstrating their intentions to live here permanently for the purpose of satisfying the habitual residence condition.  To assist such persons, Safe Home has arranged a checklist of a range of documents that will help show that a person has returned to Ireland permanently.  Safe Home has also designed a declaration which will confirm that a person is engaging with it as part of the person's repatriation.  The declaration is associated with any social assistance claim the person might make.  These measures help to expedite the decision-making process in these cases as it can be accepted as proof that the person has returned to reside in the State on a permanent basis.  This is very much for the case of the Irish person who retires back to Ireland after being gone for a very long time.<\/p><p> With regard to displaced persons, while the amendments in this subsection primarily update the current provisions to ensure all those categories of persons who were previously recognised in the habitual residence provision as having a right to reside retain that position.  It is also intended that an additional permission to reside in the State is included in the section.  This is for people who have been granted temporary protection in accordance with the International Protection Act 2015.  The Act provides for EU laws for immediate and temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons who are unable to return to their country of origin.  If this is invoked, this measure would provide a balance of efforts between member states in receiving such displaced third country nationals.  The section provides for a displaced person to be given permission by the Minister for Justice and Equality to enter and remain in the State, for temporary protection, as part of this group of persons.  If there was a mass influx, it would allow us to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#EE00600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2439,"content":"<p>Consider a case I came across a few weeks ago.

There has been an awful lot of talk about fivers being thrown all over the place but there is no talk around the issue of direct provision.

I should not just say woman, I should say a person's working life because some men are homemakers, and this is more frequently the case now than in the 1960s and 1970s, but there is a cohort of homemakers who are not being advantaged but are being penalised by the measure brought in during 2012.<\/p><p>When the average number of contributions is calculated over a person's working life, it means that even if they worked 30, 31 or 32 years from the mid-1980s up to 2015-16 when they retired, they will have got a much reduced State pension benefit.  I met some women this morning, and the cohort of people - there is one man involved - in contact with us on this issue is growing.  If these people started their working lives in the late 1960s or early 1970s, left the workplace to rear their children and be homemakers and then returned to work in the mid-1980s when their families were able to stand on their own two feet, the calculation based on the average contributions figure is pulling their State benefit qualification down to the lowest level.  The State contributory pension payment is &euro;230 per week based on the maximum contributions.  If the women I met this morning had their pension benefit qualification measured on the contributions they made over the large chunk of their working life, which was the period after they had reared their families from the mid-1980s until recently, they would have gained a contributory pension payment &euro;230 a week.  Instead their average contributions were measured over a prolonged period going back to the 1960s or 1970s where, to use the term those women used, they sold their contribution benefits back to the State; they both remember going down to Victoria Street and getting a fiver for the benefits they had paid in.  The whole stretch of benefits is averaged over that period, which means that these people are getting a contributory pension payment of &euro;209 per week instead of &euro;230 per week.  That shortfall amounts to a considerable amount of money in a year for any family.  Many people are affected by this and they have been contacting us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#FF02500","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2465,"content":"<p>In a bid to be helpful, the proposed amendment cannot be moved.

A person can earn X amount over three days and get social welfare benefit for the remainder of the week.  A person who earns exactly the same amount but does so over four or five days is not entitled to any social welfare payment.  That is an anomaly.  It constitutes a disincentive to a person who is working three days a week to take up more hours unless they can take them up within the three days.  It can create a disincentive to take up a job for four days a week because the person will lose their social welfare payment.  There are technical difficulties in moving from that system, which is a relatively simple system, to a hours worked based system.  I am seeking a report on that to see if it would be possible to advance something along those lines.<\/p> <p>  I am also seeking a report on the matter referred to by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith in her amendment concerning the change in the rules brought in by the previous Minister for Social Protection regarding qualification for  the State contributory pension.  Under the current system, a person who pays 520 contributions can, in some circumstances, be entitled to the full pension while a person who pays double that number of contributions might be entitled to a smaller pension.  Obviously, that is unjust.  That cannot be right.   We have received many complaints on this issue.  People are contacting me on a weekly basis asking what is happening about this.  It is a grave injustice.  People believe that the contribution of their payments have not been properly awarded on the basis that they know people who have paid fewer contributions who are in receipt of a higher pension.  I understood the Minister to say, and he can correct me if I am wrong, that some work is being done on that within the Department.  Is that correct?  I take it we will discuss the family income payment in conjunction with the report on the working family dividend when it comes before this committee.<\/p> <p>  Subsection (7) of my amendment deals with part-time and seasonal workers.  As my colleague, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, said this morning in the D&aacute;il, this has particular relevance in Donegal and certain coastal counties.  The method of, and regulations for, paying social welfare to seasonal and part-time workers has changed in recent years.  In order to qualify for benefit, a person is now required to have 117 contributions over a three-year period.  That equates to 39 contributions per annum.  It is pretty difficult for people in seasonal and part-time work to make that number of contributions in that space of time.  In addition to that, the subsidiary income threshold is &euro;12.70 per day.  That seems grossly unfair.  That is &euro;63 a week.  If a seasonal worker earns that from farming, he or she is not entitled to unemployment benefit.  People are told that they can depend on an income of &euro;3,302 per annum, which in these times seems somewhat unreal.<\/p> <p>  There is also a new requirement that when a social welfare claim ceases, a person has to make 13 contributions in order to transfer on to the next claim.  That does not make any allowance for the unique nature of seasonal work.  Some Deputies from coastal counties have told me that they have been dealing with these people for up to 20 years and it is only in the past two or three years that they have had difficulty accessing the social welfare system.  I am also advised that the current regulations are giving rise to skill shortages in seasonal and part-time work in businesses and that they urgently need to be addressed.  If I were to propose an amendment to change the system, it would be ruled out of order on the basis that it would pose a charge on the Exchequer.<\/p><p>I am trying to put some focus on this problem because it affects a number of people, especially in coastal counties.  On the face of it, it seems to be rather unfair.  The system appears to me to warrant close examination.  This is why I have proposed that we write into the Bill that the Department should carry out a report and then report back to the committee.  I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#GG02400","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2489,"content":"<p>The Deputy has raised several different issues.  I will try and go through them sequentially, if I can, with the exception of the lone-parent issue.  That is something we already discussed in detail.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the review of the impact on the national minimum wage to income thresholds.  We figure we can do a report on that quickly.  It is quite straightforward and we could easily have it to the committee in less than three months.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to the household benefits package.  Essentially, I think the Deputy is referring to cases where someone moves back to the house.  That person might be a grandson or daughter who has moved back to the house.  The household benefits package is worth approximately &euro;11.50 per week.  If a young person is not working, the household benefits package would not be lost.  If the person has come back and is working, he must be earning &euro;400 per week.  For that person to make a contribution of &euro;11.50 to the cost of running the house is not a great deal to ask.  I would expect a person who moves back to live with his parents to cough up &euro;70, &euro;80, &euro;100 or &euro;200 to help to cover the costs.  I do not see why it would make sense for us to continue to pay the household benefits package to a household that has someone in it who is working and earning.  It would be extraordinarily expensive and I do not think it would be right.  It is entirely reasonable that a younger person who moves back to live with his parents to save for a house or whatever should contribute &euro;12 per week to the running of the house.  In fact, that person should contribute more, in my view.  Certainly, I did when I was living with my parents.  The figure was far more than &euro;11.50.  I see no role for the welfare system in that scenario.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, we can undertake some work on the eligibility criteria for jobseeker's benefit.  The three-day rule is tricky and it is difficult to find a solution to it.  Like many things, when I first got this job I thought this would be a no-brainer.  However, it gets tricky because if we change the criteria from three days to a certain number of hours, we would then open up jobseeker's to a large number of people who do not currently claim it.  That would represent a significant cost.  The way of avoiding that is to reduce the level to a smaller number of hours.  This would mean many people who now work three days would lose out.  It is like many of these things in that it is often only when we realise why the rules are what they are that we realise why it might not be so wise to change them.  That said, I have no difficulty in giving the committee some figures and numbers as part of a report.<\/p> <p>  The question of the averaging system in the State contributory pension was raised by Deputy Smith and Deputy O'Dea.  Again, this area is far more complicated than people may think.  The State contributory pension works based on contributions.  People put money into the fund and at the end, when they retire, money comes out of the fund.  The fundamental difficulty in recognising anything that is not a financial contribution to the fund is that it devalues the pensions of those who have made a financial contribution to the fund.  Effectively, it would represent a tax on the financial contribution made by others.  It is done, in part, already with the homemaker's credit, but it is not cost free.  It imposes a cost on the taxpayer and it also devalues the contributions of those who have paid in.  The whole point of the contributory principle and the Social Insurance Fund is that people pay in and then the cash comes out when people retire.  If people start to put in credits and non-financial contributions, it is not going to work because people do not want to be paid their pensions in credits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#HH00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2490,"content":"<p>That is not the case.  Let us suppose a person has worked from 1984 to 2015 and that person made a home and left a job in 1969 or 1970 to rear children.  Finally, let us suppose the person went back to the workforce and worked for 32 or 33 years until 2015.  That person would have paid more than a sufficient number of contributions to get a full pension.  However, the figure is not calculated based on the past 33 or 34 years of full employment.  In the cases of the people I have met, wages were decent and so their contributions would have been decent.  However, when it came to measuring what they were entitled to, the reckoning went right back to 1969 and produced an average figure.  That put these people on a lower grade of pension, at &euro;209 instead of &euro;230 per week.  There are thousands of people in that predicament, and they are mostly women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#HH00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2491,"content":"<p>I was coming to that.  I was also coming to the issue around most of them being women.  Deputy Smith is referring to a system we call averaging.  Under averaging, it is not the number of contributions a person has made during the course of her working life that counts, but when she has made them.  That is a negative for people who have a gap in employment.  This is often, but not always, for caring and it usually, but not always, involves women.  If a woman works for some years, leaves employment for any reason and goes back to work again, she loses out because the calculation is averaged over a long period, including the gap in the middle.  The people who benefit from that system are those who are here and who perhaps never worked for a long time or who started work for the first time later in life.  Even though these people have paid fewer contributions overall, they get the full pension.  That is unfair.  We can equalise that, but by equalising it, this group is going to lose out.  This means there may be one group of tens of thousands of people who benefit, but we will also have tens of thousands of people who lose.<\/p> <p>  The way we intend to go - it is in the pensions framework already and we have committed to doing it by 2020 - is to move towards a total contributions approach.  This will get rid of averaging altogether.  This would amount to moving to a point whereby the total number of contributions a person makes is what counts.  However, that figure would have to be set at a higher level of contributions than a person currently has to make for things to work out.  It is not what it may seem, and there will be significant winners and losers.  At the moment we are trying to go through all the pension records and look at all the different types of cases and scenarios that might arise to get some clue of what the total number of winners and losers might be in each scenario.  I hope my officials will come to me at some point with an options paper.  I will share it with the committee members when I have it.  Every time we change the rules, there are winners and losers unless we are willing to drop hundreds of millions of euro to ensure there are no losers.  Before I make any decision or ask the committee to agree to any decision I want to have before me the options and the numbers of winners and losers in each case, as well as the cost.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Smith is absolutely right to say that when it comes to this particular aspect of State contributory pensions, most of the people who have a gap in their employment are women.  Therefore, when we meet these groups, they are mostly female.  That is true.  However, committee members should bear some points in mind when considering the Social Insurance Fund overall.  Women gain more from it.  They live longer and get paid their pensions for longer.  They gain far more from the maternity benefit system, for example, than men do from the paternity benefit system, and they pay less in for fewer years.  This is not my opinion.  An actuarial review was undertaken of the fund and it showed that women benefit more from the social insurance system than men.  Therefore, if we are going to go down a gender equalisation route, it would require a shift in benefits from women to men.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#HH00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2492,"content":"<p>The Minister has not referred to the fact that the average is disregarded for homemakers after 1994, but it is not for homemakers prior to 1994.

It deals with cases of unfair dismissal and proposes that the employer, if found to have unfairly dismissed an employee, would pay back any social welfare payments issued to the employee from the date of his or her unfair dismissal.  This would realise a saving for the State.  The amendment is reasonable and I urge the Minister to accept it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#JJ02200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2522,"content":"<p>The unfair dismissals legislation provides that any social welfare payments which the employee may have received after the date of dismissal are not taken into account in calculating the financial loss that the person suffered as a result of the dismissal.  This ensures that the person is not penalised for having been in receipt of a social welfare payment following his or her dismissal.  Recouping the cost of welfare benefits arising from unfair dismissals would require a change in this position on the principle of no double compensation.  That is, a person cannot be compensated twice, both by his or her employer and by the Department of Social Protection.  This could reduce or even eliminate the award for the person who was unfairly dismissed where he or she is also in receipt of a social welfare payment because that payment would have to be taken into account in calculating the financial loss to the individual.<\/p> <p>  The reference to social welfare payments is a catch-all term which could include benefits directly linked to unemployment and those relating to other contingencies such as illness, lone parenthood, old age or caring responsibilities.  The linking of a broad range of welfare contingencies to unfair dismissals would be difficult to justify.<\/p> <p>  The time period envisaged in the amendment, that is, between the date of dismissal and the date on which the finding is made, is potentially open-ended and disproportionate.  What is proposed would also give rise to significant additional costs to employers and businesses.  For example, one year of jobseeker's benefit for a person with an adult dependent and two children would be &euro;20,000.  In turn, these losses could result in other losses of employment at the business.<\/p> <p>  There are several other reasons why I cannot accept the amendment which I will not go into now.  To be straight with the Deputy, when I first looked at this amendment, I thought it seemed like a good idea.  Why should the Department not recoup the money if an employer has dismissed an employee unfairly?  Indeed, that money should not have had to be paid out because the employee should not have been dismissed in the first instance.  However, what made me change my mind is the principle of double compensation, namely, that somebody cannot be compensated twice.  Essentially, what would happen is that any money paid to the employee from the Department of Social Protection would have to be deduced from his or her compensation award from the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  The WRC would then have to pay the difference to the Department.  Therefore, the individual employee would be no better off and the State would be no better off because we would just be making a circular payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#JJ02300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2523,"content":"<p>On the amendment, Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#JJ02400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2524,"content":"<p>I am fascinated by this.

This is a grey area because it affects those like me who have lots of grey hair, not to put too fine a pun on it.  It should be re-examined.  As the Minister said himself, we may need to look at mechanisms to balance this out.  I emphasise that at no point do I or any other Deputy intend, by putting down amendments, to come out with a scheme that penalises one group of workers over another or that the load of this should be passed to another group of pension recipients.  In other words, extra money will have to be forked out but that is not extra money the State had not received in contributions from these people.  This is provably a cohort of people who went back to work in the mid-1980s, worked until now and paid a lot of pension contributions but who are now being penalised because of the time they left.  It is worth reminding ourselves that a lot of people in their 60s and 70s left school quite young and started working at age 14 or 15.  It would be unusual to do that nowadays but in those days it was normal to go into a factory or shop work having left school early due to the absence of free secondary education.  There were a lot of social and economic reasons for it but they are being severely penalised and that is wrong.  If it does not get sorted out at departmental level, it will go elsewhere and probably end up being more of a rigmarole and expense to the State.  As the amendment will not be accepted, I ask that a report be laid out very soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#LL00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2545,"content":"<p>I apologise for my absence, I was speaking on the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill in the D&aacute;il.

The scheme was introduced in the context of the recession, particularly for people who may fall very ill for short periods, and it was taken away.  This has had an impact on people who are being put into difficult situations and has prompted concern among FLAC and Community Law and Mediation, which are seeking the restoration of the scheme for short-term mortgage arrears problems.

The most appropriate pathway for customers experiencing mortgage difficulties is through ongoing engagement with their lender, exploring sustainable solutions detailed within the mortgage arrears resolution process under the Central Bank of Ireland's code of mortgage arrears.  Section 11 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013 amended section 198 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to provide for the closure of the mortgage interest supplement scheme to new entrants from January 2014 and the cessation of the scheme by the end of January 2017.  Customers availing of this support prior to 1 January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1 January 2018.  Approximately 2,200 people are still in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, with an estimated expenditure of &euro;6 million for the scheme in 2016.  It is expected that over the remaining period, existing recipients will continue to exit the scheme through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders, securing employment or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, such as the mortgage-to-rent scheme.<\/p> <p>  A review of all current mortgage interest rate supplement cases is currently being finalised by the Department, which is gathering information on property types and lending institutions involved.  As part of the process, the cases will be profiled in order to consider appropriate exit strategies for these customers, with a particular emphasis on activation, where appropriate.  Engagement with the dedicated mortgage arrears Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, will also be considered.  MABS assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes and people living on social welfare payments.  In addition to its traditional core business, MABS has been developed to provide more targeted services to support mortgage holders in arrears.  Since 2015, a dedicated mortgage arrears MABS service has been established across the MABS network of services.  The service is focusing on post-mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, cases and empowers mortgage holders to assess the extent to which the option on offer from the lender is the best and most sustainable one for them and helps them in negotiating an alternative payment arrangement with their lender.  There are 30 specialist advisers in place in 25 locations across the country, and almost 2,500 people have benefitted from the service.  MABS also has a network of court mentors.  More recently, with the T&aacute;naiste, I launched Abhaile, which is a scheme of aids and advice to borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  It provides people with vouchers for independent financial and legal advice if they need it.  The scheme has only recently got under way.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty I have with any proposal to reintroduce mortgage interest supplement is that it never really worked.  The Department of Social Protection, that is, the taxpayer, paid people's mortgage interest for months and years, which suited the banks down to the ground because they were getting the interest paid on the asset.  It would suit them even more now, by the way, because the asset, namely, property, is accumulating in value.  The Government pays the interest forever, the banks still own the asset and it creates a trap for the borrower because he or she has no incentive to deal with the problem, namely, the fact that he or she cannot afford the mortgage any more.  Other than for the reason of saving money, that is why the scheme was closed down.  What we should do, instead of \"extend and pretend\" at the expense of the taxpayer for ever, is deal with people who will never be able to pay their mortgage again through such measures as mortgage-to-rent, which I know is not working, but it needs to start working, the housing assistance payment, HAP, and other housing solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#MM00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2557,"content":"<p>The mortgage interest supplement scheme probably went on longer than initially anticipated.

When they got back to work, they were able to go back to paying the full amount of the mortgage interest.  In some cases it went on for a very long period - say, since 2000.  Even in the case of lone parents on short-term sick leave, if they break an ankle or are temporarily out of work for six or ten months after an operation, are they expected to go into the mortgage process at that stage?  They do not normally do so, apart from in the first quarter, if they have problems, they go into the bank or approach MABS or something and may then have to fill out a form with the bank and so on.

The biggest problem is people not engaging with their lender for various reasons.  They may be scared or embarrassed - there are numerous reasons - but the Abhaile scheme that has been put in place is a very positive one.

That is the reality in dealing with legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#NN00900","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2578,"content":"<p>I do not agree with the Minister on that point.  On the extension of benefits to the self-employed, he is not tying himself to a date, rather he is saying it will be done by way of a commencement order.  Why not commit to a date?  I know that he is saying he wants it to take effect in March, but that is not contained in the legislation.  Why not give a specific date for the commencement of the measures included in the Bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#NN01000","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2579,"content":"<p>Because we could end up in a situation where something goes wrong and there would be a legal right to reimbursement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#NN01100","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2580,"content":"<p>Is the Minister conscious of something in particular?

Of course, there will be.  Anytime one discusses anything with any professional body or interest group, it is going to try to maximise the fees its members receive from the taxpayer.  Having a definite commencement date in law would strengthen its hand.  It would be able to state there was a date laid down in law by which it would have to be done.  The fact that I will have a commencement order means that I will be able to say to it that I am being funded to introduce the measure in March and that if it is unreasonable, I can wait until it comes up with a fee that will be more affordable to the taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#NN01300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2582,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2583,"content":"<p>Section 23, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2584,"content":"<p>Schedules 1 and 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2585,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2586,"content":"<p>Bill reported with amendments.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1479376800,"counter":2587,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#NN01900"},{"type":"speech","time":1479376800,"counter":2588,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 90, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <p>   The Select Committee on Social Protection has completed its consideration of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 and has made amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPS2016111700002#NN02000","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1479376800,"counter":2589,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 4.10 p.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
