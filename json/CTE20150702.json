I understand he said the Garda made it clear to him there may not be prosecutions.  It now seems to be suggested that the terms of reference for the senior counsel appointed to investigate the matter will be so narrow that they will only cover the procurement aspects of this entire affair.  Given that the Garda indicated criminal prosecutions are unlikely and that the committee was at the forefront of dealing with this matter with the HSE, we should ask that the terms of reference be broad enough to include all events since the early 1990s or late 1980s.  It is not good enough to merely review or investigate the procurement issues.  I understand we have a remit in this regard.  We dealt with procedure, which was why we had the HSE before us, but we also dealt with much more subsequently.  The committee should ask that the terms of reference be as broad as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#B00300","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Arising from the correspondence received on the matter and the suggestion that a senior counsel be appointed, it is clear that the investigation is to be limited to procurement issues.

It would not do any harm to note our concerns about the allegations and the children involved, who are young adults now.  Is that agreed?

The Accounting Officer was asked the reason for selecting the most expensive bid, and she replied that the organisation did not select the most expensive.  We noted in the report that Abtran received maximum points for each of the tender criteria except for ultimate cost, which was significantly higher in both tenders than the next best candidate.  I included in my correspondence two tables setting out the tenders for document management and call centres, respectively.  The values in the blue columns of the tables are the maximum scores available, which can be compared with the scores for each of the under bidders.  The maximum score of 3,000 points for cost went to under bidder A, which means it was the least expensive.  There is not inconsistency of fact but it is a question of how one examines the information.  The bid price from Abtran was &euro;1 million, compared to &euro;600,000 from the next best candidate.  Our report drew attention to this.  Under bidder C proposed a cost of &euro;1.7 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>One of the aspects of the Abtran affair which concerns me is that it seemed to have a get-out-of-jail-free card.

We drew attention to the fact that while the initial requirement was that 100% of calls had to be answered within 30 seconds, that was dropped to 80% of calls.  It is interesting that she stated in her correspondence: \"[i]t is also the case that the agreed service levels under such a contract when the relevant agreed forecast is exceeded\".  That is a useful scenario for a service provider because it effectively means that any demand risk in provision of the service is carried by the State rather than the contractor.  Much of the process in agreeing public-private partnerships involves the appropriate sharing of risks by assigning them to the party best placed to carry them.  It is arguable whether that is a good deal in terms of the likely service provided to persons trying to use call centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The most important issue is that SUSI now seems to be working effectively as an organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#B00800","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435827600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#B00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Mr. McCarthy may not feel it appropriate to comment on one of my other concerns, namely, whether the company was paying the right share of tax in this country given that its parent company was based in the British Virgin Islands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#B01000","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435827600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>That is a place about which I would not feel comfortable commenting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#B01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>It would be an interesting place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#B01200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435827600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>It could be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#B01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>We could go there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#B01400","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435827600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>If it is necessary to carry out a thorough investigation, we could go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#B01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>He will need an assistant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#B01600","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>It gave an assurance that it paid the tax due in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#B01700","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435827600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>It is important to bear in mind that every supplier is required to provide a tax clearance certificate.

What happened was that incomplete data was given in relation to certain tenancies submitted for registration or, in other cases, an incorrect fee was paid, or perhaps, if it was submitted late, there was liability for a late payment penalty, which might not have been included.  A backlog built up, therefore, while they were trying to figure out how they would treat these.  Strictly, in law, they should all have been returned to the landlords in question, but the PRTB took a pragmatic decision in 2013 that it should draw a line under it and recognise that there was fee income that could have been collected had the items been returned to landlords and had the landlords returned the correct amount.  The cost of this was estimated at &euro;1.3 million.

The account includes receipts of taxes and duties remitted by Revenue to the Exchequer and receipts collected by Revenue on behalf of other agencies.  In total, net receipts in 2014 amounted to &euro;50.2 billion, up around 9% year on year.  Net receipts of taxes and duties amounted to &euro;41.4 billion in 2014.  Receipts collected by Revenue on behalf of other agencies amounted to &euro;8.9 billion.  Approximately 92% of the receipts on behalf of other agencies was accounted for by PRSI and health levy contributions.  These contributions were remitted directly to the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 15 examines the implementation of the local property tax, LPT, which was introduced as a self-assessment tax on residential property commencing with effect from 1 July 2013.  It replaced an interim household charge on residential property at a flat rate of &euro;100 per year and a similar flat-rate charge of &euro;200 per year on non-principal private residences.  The report presents the situation that pertained up to and including 30 June 2014.  The Accounting Officer will be able to provide information about how matters have progressed since then.<\/p> <p>  A key challenge for Revenue in implementing the LPT was the creation of a comprehensive and accurate register of residential property and ownership.  Overall, the examination found that Revenue had been effective, compiling a register of some 1.95 million residential properties by the end of June 2014.  The register will be in a continuous state of change, reflecting changes in property ownership and as additional relevant information becomes available to Revenue.<\/p> <p>  The report recommended that Revenue should review its controls over the inputting and updating of information in order to ensure that information was recorded accurately.  This was in response to findings that, while the register was generally comprehensive and accurate, there were some gaps and errors.  For example, we found that the register showed that no owner had been identified for approximately 3.5%, or 68,000, of the properties on the register at June 2014.  In respect of approximately 2,700 of those properties, we established that Revenue's tax collection systems showed that property tax had already been paid.  We also found that 137,300 properties had been de-registered by the end of June 2014, but that there had been tax paid already in respect of approximately 3,300 of those.  On that basis, we concluded that the operational controls over changes made to the property register should be reviewed.<\/p> <p>  The report also examined the process implemented by Revenue to assist property owners in valuing their properties.  This included the publication of an Internet-based guide to the expected value of certain property types in specific locations or regions.  In addition, it issued its own estimates of the valuation band for 1.57 million properties based on data it was able to compile from a variety of sources.  As at the end of June 2014, approximately 42% of the valuation bands actually used by taxpayers were either those proposed by Revenue or valuations submitted by taxpayers in the absence of a Revenue estimate.  A substantial proportion of taxpayers did not accept the Revenue estimates.  In most of those cases, a lower valuation band was submitted, including more than 270,000 cases in which the valuation submitted was two or more bands below the Revenue estimate.  Revenue had commenced analysis to identify properties with declared valuation bands that were substantially different from the generality of neighbouring properties.<\/p> <p>  The examination recommended that Revenue should consider how it could use up-to-date technologies to compare declared valuations with actual sale prices of properties and carry out in-depth, on-site reviews on a sample basis of properties in designated areas in order to validate valuations submitted.  The Accounting Officer agreed with those recommendations and, I understand, has provided an update on progress in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The report also recommended that the Revenue Commissioners consider collecting from taxpayers some basic information on the relevant characteristics of properties as an aid in validating declared property valuations.  As examples, we suggested objective or quantifiable property characteristics such as floor or site area, type of dwelling, age of property, number of rooms, etc.  At least some of this is the kind of information that is routinely provided by householders in census returns every five years.  However, the Accounting Officer did not agree with this recommendation, citing the valuation validation processes it had already implemented and the possibility of harvesting data about property characteristics from sources other than the property owners.<\/p> <p>  Based on the declared valuations, the level of payment compliance for the LPT has been high.  As at the end of June 2014, the overall payment compliance rate for 2013 liabilities was estimated at approximately 97%.  This included the impact of mandatory deduction-at-source arrangements put in place for some 40,000 properties as at that date.  Compliance measures had also been taken to collect household charge arrears in respect of an estimated 477,000 properties, with potential arrears liability of up to &euro;95 million.  At the report date, some &euro;25 million of those arrears had been collected, including &euro;17 million received after Revenue issued compliance notification letters in April 2014.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 16 reviews the effectiveness of systems in place for identifying rental property owners and managing taxpayer compliance in respect of rental income.  The chapter also reviews progress by Revenue in implementing the recommendations of this committee following a previous report by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2006 regarding the potential for data sharing and record matching with third-party sources of information.  Gross rental income declared in 2012 amounted to &euro;4.4 billion, of which &euro;4 billion related to rents on properties in Ireland.  The balance of &euro;400 million related to rental income on properties outside Ireland.  We found that the number of foreign rental properties declared to Revenue increased by approximately one third between 2009 and 2012.  In contrast, the amount of gross rental income declared in respect of such properties declined by approximately 7% during the same period.<\/p> <p>  The review found that there had been a significant improvement since 2006 in the extent to which Revenue matched information relevant to residential rental income from third party sources to its taxpayer accounts.  The range of data sources used by Revenue has increased, as has the rate of matched records.  In 2012, between 88% and 94% of records from four principal sources of third party information were matched to Revenue records.<\/p> <p>  The outcome of audits of rental income in 2012 and 2013 suggests that the audits were well targeted at higher-risk cases.  Over 70% of the cases audited resulted in additional yield.  However, we noted that not all of the audit yield arose from undeclared or under-declared property rental income; some of the yield related to undeclared income from other sources.  The review recommended changes to the categorisation of audit yield to assist the Revenue Commissioners in analysing and planning its compliance activities.<\/p> <p>  Administration and operational expenses incurred by the Revenue Commissioners are charged to its Vote.  No such expenses are charged to the accounts of the receipt of revenues of the State to which I referred earlier.  The 2013 Revenue Commissioners appropriation account received a clear audit opinion.<\/p><p>It shows that the total spend by Revenue in 2013 amounted to &euro;393 million, up just over 3% relative to 2012.  Taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;78.6 million in 2013, net expenditure amounted to &euro;314 million.  This resulted in a surplus for the year of &euro;8.3 million liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.<\/p><p> Audit of the 2014 appropriation account is under way.  It will be reported on and published in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and invite Mr. Cody to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#F00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435827600,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to make this short opening statement.  As time is limited, I will confine myself to a brief overview of the two relevant chapters from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<\/p> <p>  Since assuming responsibility for the administration of local property tax in early 2013, Revenue has collected in excess of &euro;1 billion for the Exchequer, including &euro;45 million in respect of the household charge, and achieved compliance rates of 97% for both 2013 and 2014.  The compliance rate for 2015 currently stands at 96%.<\/p> <p>  The introduction of the local property tax was the largest extension of the self assessment system in the history of the State and was, as acknowledged in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, a huge undertaking for Revenue during a time when its resources were diminishing, both in terms of staff numbers and its administrative budget.  Within a timeframe of less than nine months Revenue had to design, build and implement a fully functioning tax system.  We had to assist in the drafting of legislation, build a property register, develop flexible payment options to suit different customer preferences and deploy resources to the provision of a customer support service.<\/p> <p>  The compilation of the first register of residential properties in the State required us to identify the properties and connect each property to a liable person using Revenue data and data from a range of other sources such as the Local Government Management Agency and the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  Data from the various sources were cross-checked to ensure the register was as accurate as possible.  However, given the scale of the data matching process, it was inevitable that there would be some errors and, from the outset, Revenue was very open with the public about this.  We updated the register as issues were brought to our attention and the register continues to be updated as additional information becomes available to us.  There are currently 1.95 million properties on the register.<\/p> <p>  We also developed an online interactive guide to provide average indicative property values to assist property owners in the self-assessment of the value of their property.  Our main concern in developing the systems and processes necessary for the effective and efficient administration of this tax was to make it as easy as possible for individuals to pay and difficult to avoid.  From March 2013, our focus was very much on ensuring that property owners understood the requirements of this new tax and their obligations.  A comprehensive communications strategy was implemented.  The various payment methods include a number of phased options.  The various options are all working very well and are assisting customers to be compliant by giving them the option to pay that works best for them.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the minority of property owners who failed to meet their LPT obligations, there is a range of debt collection and enforcement options provided for in the LPT legislation.  The collection method used necessarily depends on whether the individual is a PAYE worker or self-employed.  These options include mandatory deduction from salary, pension or certain Government payments; referral of the outstanding debt to the sheriff or solicitor, a surcharge on income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax returns, withholding tax clearance certification.  Over the course of the 2013, 2014 and 2015 compliance programmes Revenue issued approximately 600,000 warning letters, deducted payments from salary or pension in more than 140,000 cases, some being repeat cases, refused tax clearance certification in approximately 29,000 cases and imposed surcharges in approximately 19,000 cases.  We also referred in excess of 1,000 cases to the sheriff for collection.  To date, no LPT liabilities have been referred for court action, nor have we used our attachment powers to secure payment, although we reserve the right to use both options if required.<\/p> <p>  Household charge arrears that remained unpaid at 1 July 2013 were converted to a &euro;200 per property LPT debt and Revenue was given the responsibility for collecting the outstanding amounts.  As a result of our household charge compliance campaign, almost 318,000 property owners have become compliant and paid almost &euro;45 million in arrears.  Compliance activity is ongoing in the 47,000 cases that have yet to pay the charge.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to the rental income chapter, I would like to first state that Revenue commits a significant proportion of its compliance resources to combat shadow economy activity and the rental sector is an area we have particularly focused on in recent years.  We select cases for intervention based on the presence of various risk indicators and other information available to us.  Third party information is a really important element in addressing non-compliance.  Matching this data against returns filed by taxpayers and addressing outliers or cases that have failed to include this data in their returns has been a feature of our compliance strategy for many years.  This approach is particularly relevant in the rental income sector, where significant amounts of third party information are made available to Revenue and matched to landlord records.  Currently, this data includes Private Residential Tenancies Board data, rent subsidy payments from the Department of Social Protection, rental accommodation scheme payments from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, student accommodation lists, letting agent returns, non-principal private residence data and, of course, Revenue's local property tax data.  <\/p> <p>  The increase in the number of data sources used has been influenced by work carried out previously by the committee and following on from a previous report from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Our matching rates have also increased significantly to a position where we now have matching rates of around 90% for the biggest data sources.  This compares with figures of around 50% when that report was originally published back in 2008.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has commented favourably in the report on the significant improvement in the matching of this data to landlord records.  The matched third party data is fed into our risk evaluation analysis and profiling system, REAP.  REAP has over 50 risk rules that are related to property ownership or rental income.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has commented favourably on the successful targeting of interventions in the rental sector.  Our focus on compliance in the sector continued in 2014.  In the past two calendar years, we have conducted over 1,100 audits and nearly 9,000 risk management interventions in the rental sector, with a total yield of &euro;81 million.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to discuss any issues and answer any questions raised by the committee, subject of course, to taxpayer confidentiality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>May we publish Mr. Cody's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#F00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435827600,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Certainly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Cody and thank him for his opening statement.  Based on everything we have read, the undertaking by Revenue was a huge task for it at a time of diminishing staff and budget resources.

I compliment Mr. Cody on that.<\/p> <p>  I note from the briefing that Revenue has a property register of approximately 1.95 million, which is a huge workload for any Department.  Reference is made in the briefing to 3% or 55,988 properties in respect of which no owners have been identified.  That is extraordinary.  Perhaps Mr. Cody would elaborate on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#F00700","speaker":"1194"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435827600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct that the undertaking was a huge challenge.  We had to prepare a register.  The register was prepared from a number of data sources.  One of the particular challenges was that of non-unique addresses, namely, addresses in country areas where there are different variations of address such that an address and a name could be slightly different.  We will have picked up data from different sources.  Some of the houses are not houses.  At the time the report was being compiled there were 68,000 no-owner properties on the register.  The current figure is 47,000, which is a reduction of 21,000.  Of that 21,000 more than 60% were duplicate properties - there was not a property.<\/p><p>It is a really difficult part of the register to work on because each case must be looked at to see if the property is a real property, and then we must see if there is an ownership.<\/p><p> The census figure is the figure we have always used as our target for what the property register is.  The last census figures had a figure of 1.99 million properties.  Of the 1.9 million properties, approximately 236,000 were uninhabited, vacant and in various stages of vacancy.  One of the key issues is that the property tax is payable on habitable properties.  I have seen some of the cases, and some of the committee members have seen some of the cases when representations were made.  If somebody dies in a property, it is habitable when they were living in it, but it very quickly falls into a state of disrepair.  Some of the cases become uninhabitable and we knock them off the register.  The figure of 47,000 sounds like a large figure, but it is just over 2% of the property register.  I am fairly satisfied that there are not 47,000 liable properties.  There are some.  Some of them are building stock that were unfinished.  As houses are finished and sell, we pick them up.  As people buy the house, do it up and it becomes habitable we pick it up through our stamp duty.<\/p><p> However, if the committee had asked us in 2013 whether we would get to 1.95 million properties by 2015, we would have said we did not think so.  My predecessor was before the committee talking about the property tax, and we are really surprised that we have got it so accurate.  The problem with everything to do with property tax is that 1% is approximately 20,000 and when we talk about telephone calls and contacts afterwards, 3% is just massive numbers.  It is so out of the scale of something such as corporation tax, where we have less than 200,000 cases, or VAT, where we have a register of approximately 250,000.  This is massive.  The Collector General has a team in Ennis and Limerick working through the register as we come across contacts.  In fact, in the period from the start of March 2013, when we started issuing our letters, we have had 600,000 contacts that are related to register issues.  Of the 600,000, half are about owners' names being added to the register.<\/p><p> One of the key bases of our register was the household charge and the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, data.  With regard to the LGMA data, I know people say it was not a success until the Revenue Commissioners took over, but we see it as a very credible start.  We would be a great deal further behind if the LGMA had not been there first.  One of the features, and this is in the report, is that the LGMA data registered the person who paid, not the owner of the property.  In many cases one had adult children paying on behalf of parents.  When we were having our various meetings about it we used to talk about particular parts of the country.  As is known, I am from Kilkenny so we used to talk about Tipperary people.  If one takes a name that is quite common in Tipperary such as Ryan, in any parish in rural Tipperary there are multiple numbers of Ryans.  They will have similar names such as Patrick, Paddy and P.J.  The names may be the same but they may actually be three people with three houses.  If we are back before the committee next year and there is an item about the LPT register, I am quite satisfied the 47,000 will be down considerably, but I believe it will take us until properties are bought and sold and there is a reasonable amount of churn back in the market before we will get to the end of it fully.<\/p><p> One of the other features of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, register is that bedsits are captured by the CSO.  They were liable to the household charge but they are not liable to property tax.  If there is a house comprised of bedsits, and I know there are all sorts of rules about bedsits now, that is one property for LPT although it could be five addresses for the LGMA and for the CSO.  We will continue to work on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>According to the briefing we were given, a sample of 50 was taken from the 5,000 properties that were awarded exemptions.

We have done considerable work on the unfinished housing estates.  In excess of 4,900 unfinished housing estate exemption claims have been received.  Of that, at this stage, 1,800 cases have been reviewed and contact has been made where there was doubt over entitlement to the exemption.  Approximately 600 cases have had the exemption claim refused.  The findings of the exemption team indicate that in mixed estates, where the delineation between exempt and non-exempt properties is unclear, up to 40% of the claims submitted were invalid.  However, apart from mixed estates, there is no evidence of the submission of invalid claims for the unfinished housing estate exemption.<\/p> <p>  It is important to outline some of the background regarding the unfinished estates.  Obviously, it was a very emotional issue.  The household charge provision had an exemption for unfinished estates.  It covered just under 50,000 properties.  By the time LPT was introduced the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who controls the prescription of the unfinished estate, had work done from 2011 to 2013.  The unfinished housing estate for LPT covers approximately 5,100 houses as opposed to the almost 50,000 houses covered by the household charge exemption.  What happened was that there were estates where partial work had been done in the meantime and one had an estate which, for the household charge, was unfinished in its entirety but by the time the 2013 regulations were made the element of the estate that was finished was taken out of the unfinished estate.  That is where we talk about the mixed estates.  Somebody who was in an estate that was exempt from household charge may not have been exempt for LPT.  The errors we found were in that.<\/p> <p>  We are quite satisfied that they were mostly unintentional.  I remember looking at this back in 2013.  Some of them had filed their LPT return claiming the exemption before the revised regulations were enacted, so they thought they were exempt.  It is also probably fair to say that a number of them felt that they should have been exempt, regardless of the regulations, and claimed it.  It is a really sensitive area.  If one is in an estate that is reclassified as finished while some of it is still unfinished, there is no doubt it has significant impact on the valuation band.<\/p><p>Generally what happens, particularly in rural towns, is that the property becomes liable in band 1.  We have not written out what we would call enforcement letters.  Often, we contact them by phone call to say that as far we can see, they are on the wrong side of the line and to ask them to have a look at it and resubmit.  Those phone calls can be very difficult and there can be a number of contacts.  We are working through the exemptions.  The one thing we can safely say is that we do not see any evidence that people have set out to claim the exemption.  Overall, the exemptions cover about 50,000 houses.  It would not be where one would start.  Regarding the amount of money that is at risk for many people, ignoring the local authority variation, most of them will be in band 1, for which the LPT liability is &euro;90.  We want to get it right and get them into a position going forward.  Yesterday on the radio there was some commentary on the considerable work that is now being done on unfinished estates and one of the issues for the Thornhill review will be what comes out of that exemption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Anyone looking for an exemption in an unfinished estate is perfectly right to do so, because many people are quite miserable living in estates that are not finished properly and which might be dangerous.

There can be absolutely valid reasons for that.  I remember being shown the pilot of this project, where it was being mapped and we were looking at an area in south Dublin where there was one property that was, say, six bands below the value of the street.  When we focused in on it, we found it was a mews house in the back garden of one of the houses, totally out of proportion with all the rest and the difference was perfectly reasonable.<\/p> <p>  We have been busy with the register, with payments and with collecting the money that people are declaring.  Our work on valuations and reviewing valuations has three bases.  The first is property sales.  Where property sales arise, part of the clearance system is seeing whether it sold for a hell of a lot more than the person declared it.  It was interesting in 2013, where people put properties on the market with an asking price that was double the band they declared on 1 May.  They probably had not thought they were going to sell the house in a couple of months.  There is a process for that.  We also provided a facility in the LPT system to allow people to revalue their band.  There are nearly 8,000 valuations up since it started.  We are now looking at setting up a compliance valuation team to look at the outliers.  We will do it like we do everything else.  We will ask people whether they are happy with their valuation.  There are all sorts of valid reasons, such as the state of the house and so on.  However, there is no doubt that some of them have a problem.  We would see it in the context of, leaving out the local authorities, housing bodies and so on, the 1.65 million ordinary residential properties.<\/p> <p>  The level of undervaluation is actually really low.  People really tried.  Overall, I think something like 85% of properties are in the first four bands.  The average prices for rural Ireland were in the paper the other day.  They are mostly in bands 1 and 2.  It will take a fairly significant house to move it up by &euro;50,000 or to the next band.  The challenge in urban areas is clearly different.  One of the other factors is that 1 May 2013 was probably very close to being the bottom of the market in Dublin.<\/p><p>Probably the first sign that property prices in parts of Dublin were starting at least to stop dropping was in July 2013.  Another feature that I and everyone can see in parts of Dublin is that a house may sell for a price that is four bands higher than the value on 1 May 2013, and this is not a sign of non-compliance.  When my predecessor appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts and was asked about the procedure when someone sells his or her house for a sum four bands above what he or she valued it, she said good luck to them.  That is the reality.  <\/p><p> We will continue to work at obvious under-declarations but we are fairly satisfied there is no significant evidence of it.  The patterns of value tie in with the work that the original Thornhill group and the ESRI group had done.  If one thinks one's house is in the band between &euro;95,000 and &euro;105,000 and declares it for the LPT at &euro;95,000, I do not think anyone could argue with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#H01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I think people have been very compliant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#J00200","speaker":"1194"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435827600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>In respect of the household charge, it is stated that &euro;95 million has not been paid or has been waived or exempted, and that &euro;25 million in arrears has been collected.

The figure of &euro;95 million was theoretically possible if the gap between the LPT register and the household charge related to a property.  We have done a raft of matching.  There is a difference in the number as some paid the household charge under a different name.  We have been going through the gap in the registers.  We had hoped to get to do this work earlier than we did because we were trying to get the LPT register right.  The household charge was &euro;100.  In the legislation to bring in LPT, the unpaid household charge was capped at &euro;130 if it was paid before April 2013 but rose to &euro;200 if it remained unpaid at 1 July 2013.  It doubled.  We started a process.<\/p> <p>  The household charge has been the hardest property related tax to collect.  The household charge was very unpopular.  No one was asked in writing for the money.  The local authorities did not write to everyone asking them to pay the household charge.  When we asked people to pay the household charge and penalty, which amounted to &euro;200, the usual response was that no one had asked them for this payment when it was set at &euro;100.  Their response was: \"I am not paying anything.\"  We started the process of collection, and we have collected &euro;45 million.  Some 100,000 people who are paying their household charge and penalties are on phased payment arrangements.  The Collector General told me this morning that &euro;23,800.83 was paid in household charges yesterday.  Approximately &euro;25,000 a day is being paid and those who owe the household charge go into the post office and pay it on the drip.  There are approximately 45,000 properties that we have not yet checked out.  We are going through the list and we will write letters once we work out who owes the money.  There are about 10,000 people who are deferring the household charge.  As the household charge becomes the LPT, all the provisions in respect of LPT apply to the &euro;200 charge.  This charge will stay on the record of those properties.<\/p> <p>  We knew that collecting the household charge would be difficult.  We had hoped we would collect between &euro;40 million to &euro;60 million and we will collect between  &euro;50 million and &euro;60 million.  It is a finite piece of work to get it on record.  Another issue in regard to the household charge is proof of payment.  People who had paid online with the Local Government Management Agency were fine.  Members may recall that there was provision to pay the local authority &euro;130 before 31 March 2013 and people were issued with a paper receipt.  I remember the LGMA referring to the bags of payments and receipts they had at the end of the day.  Some of the records are challenging.  If a person has paid their LPT for 2013, 2014 and 2015 and he or she says the local authority was paid the &euro;100 household charge, we will treat each case on its merits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I have two brief questions on rental income.

Each district will have a programme on selecting cases, profiling them and selecting them for risk interventions, including audit.  That applies to rental income, medical consultants, contractors.  This is a sophisticated risk system which is improving with every data source we get.<\/p> <p>  There is a tax defaulters list published quarterly.  It includes a small proportion of cases where there are audit settlements.  They must meet certain criteria before they are published, mostly related to the fact they do not make a disclosure, either prompted or unprompted.  If one makes a disclosure and pays the settlement figure, one will not have one's name published.  I cannot say how many landlords appear in the publication list but can safely say that every quarterly list includes a number of landlords.

The reality is that most people who have rental income have other business income interests.  Generally, our yield from them has far more to do with their understating their income from rentals or from other sources, including cash sources.

It provides that the first valuation period is three and a half years and that there will be a three-year valuation period thereafter.  The local property tax legislation, as it currently stands, provides that a revaluation based on values at 1 November 2016 will be valid for three years.  As Deputies will be aware, the Minister has asked Dr. Don Thornhill, who was involved in the original report on what type of property tax should be introduced, to carry out a review of the valuation process and a number of other features of this matter.  His terms of reference are to review the operation of the local property tax and to make recommendations on issues that arise from the review.  In particular, the review will have regard to recent residential property price developments, the overall yield from the local property tax and its contribution to total tax revenues on an ongoing basis, and the desirability of achieving relative stability in the local property tax payments of liable persons over the short and longer terms.  Dr. Thornhill will also review a number of specific issues, such as the process around pyrite.  My understanding is that the report of the Thornhill review is due to be submitted to the Minister between the end of June and the middle of July.  I think that is the target that was set.  I presume it will be submitted before the end of July.  I understand that Dr. Thornhill will submit his report to the Minister.  I do not think I am breaching the policy guidelines when I mention that the Minister has said he will consider Dr. Thornhill's report in the context of the budget.  I am not privy to his plans.  He will review the report and put forward his proposals.  I will explain what our involvement has been.  Obviously, we have all the data.  We have provided reams of data on stamp duty, for example.  If there is a revaluation, we will have to update our valuation guidelines.  We have played a full part in supporting Dr. Thornhill and the Department of Finance.

I would like to start with fuel laundering, which has been a massive problem.  We are involved in significant activity in regard to fuel laundering.  Since 2011 we have been involved in a major, linked strategy to tackle fuel fraud.  We have closed down 134 filling stations, revoked licences and introduced new electronic record returns for oil trading.  This significant development has been introduced with the support of the legitimate trade and everybody dealing in mineral oil must send in a monthly electronic return of their supply.  What we are trying to do is to build up a supply chain view.  What happens with marked diesel is that it eventually gets diverted and laundered and sold back as clean diesel and that is the challenge we must address.  We have been trying to identify where suspicious quantities end up and to follow through on that.  In the Finance Act, the Minister introduced a provision on reckless trading.  Therefore, if a legitimate distributor sells what is clearly a load that does not make sense, we will tell him he should not be trading unless he has X, Y or Z and we can go to him, carry out an assessment and hit him.<\/p> <p> The latest development is the new marker we have introduced, in conjunction with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.  From 1 April, there is a new marker on both sides of the Border in addition to the marker already used, which was red in the North and green here.  We now have a new marker in addition to the colour marker.  We have done a fair degree of testing of diesel since April and of 277 diesel samples we took, we have the results of 78 of them back from the State Laboratory and of that 78, some 23 have tested positive for the new marker.  In July we will have roadside analysers in place.  On both sides of the Border, we have commissioned new testers who can do roadside testing and these will be in place by the end of this month.  This will facilitate detection.  Currently, we must send samples to the State Laboratory and that process takes time.  The State Laboratory is a significant partner in this new process.<\/p> <p>  In the past year, we have carried out a study of the impact on the diesel market of laundering.  This study was carried out by economists in Revenue and is based on the size of the legitimate market.  Indications are that the work over the past few years has led to an increase in the yield from the legitimate trade of in the region of &euro;200 million.  It is very hard to say this is a result of what we have done, because there are various factors involved.  However, we feel we have made a serious dent in the business of oil laundering, but we are not naive enough to think that this is the end of it, because people involved in fuel laundering and its distribution are very organised, determined and ruthless.  We have certainly seen a difference in regard to people who would accept an occasional load over the years and sell it mixed up with legitimate fuel.  These people have probably shied away from that.<\/p> <p>  However, there are forecourts around the country and pop-up stations that are fronts for the organised gangs involved in fuel laundering.  Even where we think they are doing it, we must detect it and then go through the process of revocation of licences.  Sometimes in parliamentary questions we deal with for the Department, we are asked why we did not close X, Y or Z if we had evidence there was once marked fuel sold.  However, people use the cover of limited liability and people set up different companies.  If we revoked licences, we would be subject to judicial review and in certain cases, the immediate response we would get would be a legal letter.  It is a serious matter to revoke somebody's licence to trade.<\/p> <p>  We feel we are having a significant impact on the illicit fuel market.  The difficulty is that it is an all-island issue.  If we succeed in stopping any laundering south of the Border, and if it continues north of the Border, we will not know visually whether the laundered fuel was red or green laundered, although we will know from testing.  That is the reason for the new fuel marker.  The UK authorities are interested in our electronic monthly system, because they have a paper based system, which is about as useful as the paper it is on - it sits in a file and the risk analysis cannot be carried out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#N00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":209,"content":"<p>What Mr. Cody is saying is that Revenue is seriously seeking to address the issue through its new mechanisms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#N00200","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435827600,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Can he give us an idea of the value of the illicit fuel laundering?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#N00400","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435827600,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I cannot because -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>There are no estimates.

There have been decisions in the courts in cases where we had revoked licences and a decision was overturned in the courts because of the legislative framework.  Some of it is not all that clear.  Let us concentrate on the oil issue.  Since the Finance Act 2010 provisions have been put in place every year as a result of representations we have made.  The provisions relating to the return of the oil movements are based on recommendations we make.  It is somewhat like the local property tax.  We have to design an information technology system and framework to tackle all of that.  The new marker came in as a result of an agreed process between the United Kingdom authorities and the Revenue Commissioners.

I am asking Mr. Cody about diesel laundering but I have heard the same thing said in respect, for instance, of illegal cigarettes.

In this case, what was purported to be road diesel was clearly laundered.

We have devoted huge resources to tackling the illicit fuel market.  We devote significant resources to tackling cigarette smuggling.  We are very conscious of the competitive advantage involved.  In the context of illicit fuel, part of the problem is that some of it is being used by people who see themselves as legitimate traders.  We recently published a list of detections and prosecutions relating to laundered fuel.  Among those involved in using such fuel were hauliers.  All of this illicit fuel is not sold to motorists.  We sample the fuel used by hauliers in their trucks.  Standard haulage trucks incorporate two 1,000 litre fuel tanks.  There is a significant financial advantage for the owners of such trucks who use laundered fuel and they can undercut legitimate hauliers as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#T02500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435827600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>That is the point.  Revenue set out to trace the activities of people in this area of the shadow economy, namely, those who trade in laundered diesel.  I am concerned about hauliers who are conducting their legitimate businesses and paying tax to the Revenue.  I must confess that my background is in haulage and I still have an interest in it.  What annoys many hauliers and those retailers who sell cigarettes and other goods is that as they fight to comply and pay their taxes, which has been a battle during a difficult period for the economy, it would seem that while those involved in illicit activity are being caught - Revenue has a good record in this regard in terms of the figures - there is a great deal more of this type of activity taking place.  It is easy to ensure that the owner of the local convenience store on the corner pays his taxes.  However, people who own such stores and others would say that the same emphasis is not applied to those involved in illicit trading.  The shadow economy is growing and represents a dangerous challenge to those who are operating on the basis of a lower mark-up or percentage.  Mr. Cody knows - probably better than me - that most hauliers operate on the basis of a mark-up of between 4% to 6%.  I do not know why some of them are still trading because they are not making a profit.<\/p> <p>  I am not defending them - I am merely acknowledging the fact - but there are some legitimate operators who are turning to the black economy because they feel they are being cheated.  A concentrated effort must made to deal with the issues they raised last week in the context of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, even if it is only by means of providing an explanation.  Our meeting today provides an opportunity to get the message out in this regard, namely, that Revenue is doing its best.  If there is a lack of resources, then that matter should continue to be highlighted.  Earlier, Mr. Cody said something that is very true.  This is not something that happened in the past year, it has been going on for a long period.  I refer to the fact that as soon as Revenue puts a tag or a trace in place, those involved in the illicit trade will spend money to ensure they find ways to circumvent it.  As a result, Revenue is involved in a constant battle.  Those involved on the side of right must continue to up their game.  I reiterate, however, that people involved in the legitimate economy are of the view that they are being short-changed.  That is a fact.  I have listened to their concerns and I am sure Deputy Perry, who previously served as Minister of State with responsibility in this area, will agree with what I am saying.  I do not know whether what is required is for Revenue to provide an explanation in respect of its activities on a regular basis.  All I will say is that those involved in legitimate trading are not convinced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015070200002#U00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435827600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I assure the Chairman that we dedicate significant resources to tackling these sectors.  We are very serious about what we do.  I referred earlier to our report on the oil market.  We are sometimes reluctant to become involved in measuring the level of the shadow economy because one can never say what is that level.  If one could do so, obviously one would be aware of the areas in which illicit activity was taking place.  In the context of the study we conducted in respect of the oil market, we are continuing to invest significant resources and to develop new technologies.  The Chairman is correct: as the process moves on, countermeasures are being taken.  A significant proportion of the 2,000 staff involved in compliance activity are involved in tackling the shadow economy.  The Chairman is also correct to state that sometimes we do not offer a sufficient explanation with regard to what we are doing.<\/p> <p>  Margins are very tight.

The ICBF is the independent industry-owned agency responsible for the generation of genetic evaluations for cattle in Ireland and it is licensed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We have attended the various farmer meetings around the country over the past couple of months and have fielded many queries and concerns in regard to the technical breeding and genomic-related aspects of the scheme.  I am also aware that two weeks ago, Brendan Gleeson and his colleagues were in attendance at this committee.  In that context, and in the context of the invitation to attend here today, I propose to cover some of those issues raised and my colleague, Dr. Andrew Cromie and I will be more than happy to answer any questions from members.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the core issue of genetic gain in the national suckler herd, the reality is that despite profitability gains in the terminal traits, namely the meat, these gains have been offset by continued decline in the maternal traits in suckler cows, that is, milk and fertility.  While the dairy herd is pushing on with close to optimal gains of around &euro;20 per replacement per year, the replacements in the suckler herd are going backwards.  These are very different industries in terms of structure but the suckler beef sector cannot afford to let on the table the increased profitability available through the use of better genetics.  The beef data and genomics scheme gives us a chance to help reverse that trend. <\/p> <p>  The majority of the data used in genetic evaluations, the ultimate purpose of which is for the Euro-Star system, comes from the individual farms themselves.  The 2008 suckler scheme changed the landscape in terms of data for suckler cattle in Ireland and the culture of data recording on suckler farms the scheme has brought about has had a dramatic impact on the quantity and quality of data that is available for use in genetic evaluations.  The participation of on-farm recording, in conjunction with the Department's aim linkages, has also facilitated the linking of mart and factory data, which are very powerful data for genetic evaluations.  That is why the genetic evaluation system available to Irish farmers is as powerful as it is, because of the high levels of integration in the various industry data capture systems. <\/p> <p>  On the question of what are Euro-stars and how are they calculated, in order to make it easier for beef farmers to quickly evaluate the genetic merit of an animal, a star rating system was introduced in 2011.  The idea was that the animals would be divided into quintiles based on their genetic evaluations.<\/p><p>The top 20% are five star; the top 40%, four star and so on.  The system has been successful in terms of farmers quickly grasping the genetic merit of an animal and in recent years the use of the Euro-star ratings has been widespread as part of the purchasing decisions on stock bulls.  This has been demonstrated by the number of individual searches using the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation bull search engine which provides public access to the star ratings.<\/p><p> How do we know that the Euro-star system works?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Coughlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":489,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Coughlan speak a little slower, please?

This should not be surprising.  The basic genetic evaluation models being used have been well proved internationally and are used across species.  If we combine this with good quantities and quality of data, we have a sound basis for confidence in the figures produced.  Each evaluation is provided in conjunction with a reliability figure, which indicates the level of data and confidence in that evaluation and the likelihood of subsequent movement in it.  The better the quantity and quality of data, the higher the reliability of the evaluation.  Of course, there will be anomalies where one-star animals perform well - that will always be the case - but in building a more sustainable and profitable industry we need a strategy of pursuing the highest star ratings possible.<\/p> <p>  Are the evaluations trying to force a one-size-fits-all approach on participants in the scheme, despite the fact that they are operating in different farming environments, for example, land types and systems such as weanling or calf-to-beef systems?  This is absolutely not the case. The economic model developed by Teagasc that underpins the calculation of the Euro-star rating means that animals with different characteristics can be profitable and, therefore, have high star ratings.  Hence, we have animals from all breeds with high and low star ratings.  There is often more variation within than across breeds.<\/p> <p>  What is genotyping and why is it useful?  Why do we need a 60% genotyping figure?  Genotyping is the process by which a tissue sample - in the context of the genomics scheme, it is an ear notch - taken from an animal is used to generate its DNA profile.  This DNA profile can then be used to further enhance the accuracy of the genetic merit of an animal.  For example, it can predict the genetic merit in terms of fertility when an animal is only a few days old at a level that would typically only be available at the end of its lifetime.<\/p> <p>  Why do we need to genotype 60% of the reference animals?  To ensure we are making the most accurate selections possible in respect of replacement females, we need to genotype all female calves.  This immediately takes us to a 50% genotyping requirement.  We also need to ensure stock bulls coming onto farms are genotyped.  We will want to continue to genotype cows on farms to ensure that where there are high performing cows, we get a picture of their DNA and build their records into the training population for genomic calculations.  In a small number of cases some male animals may be genotyped.  This will be useful in building further data on the terminal traits of animals.<\/p> <p>  Are there enough replacement bulls and heifers with the required star ratings?  There are more than enough replacements to meet the requirements of the scheme.  Typically, approximately 40% of the females born each year will be four and five star, of which less than half will be required as replacements.  We are running a 16% replacement rate approximately, which figure has been reasonably consistent in recent years.<\/p> <p>  For those who wish to breed their own rather than buy replacements, there will be more of a challenge, especially where they cannot or do not wish to use artificial insemination.  However, it is still possible. There are stock bulls in each of the breeds which can deliver four or five-star replacements.  This is where pedigree breeders have a key role to play in delivering such animals to the industry.<\/p> <p>  What happens when the Euro-Star indexes move?  I emphasise the word \"when\".  The first thing to note is that the indexes will move.  Some will move more than others, but they will move.  That is the case for dairy animals, sheep, pigs and chickens.  Beef will be no different.  The key from a scheme perspective is that once an animal has a four or five-star index at the required time, in other words, when it is genotyped, it will be eligible, even if it subsequently drops to a three-star rating.<\/p> <p>  I wish to note a point about imported genetics.  Imported genetics will continue to have an ongoing role in bringing new bloodlines to the national cattle population.  In 2014, 60% of the imported artificial insemination bulls were of a four or five-star rating.  We have made significant progress in recent months in having the ability to provide more accurate evaluations of animals being imported based on their genetic indexes in their country of origin, but there is more work to be done.  The relevant breeding societies have a key role to play in securing data flows from their sister organisations in other countries.  We are confident in the ability of genetics to deliver improved profitability for suckler cow farmers.  As a result, we strongly believe the scheme has the capacity to deliver significant long-term benefits to the suckler cow industry, well beyond the six year timelines of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Coughlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coughlan for coming before the joint committee and making a presentation.  It is a pity it did not happen before we got to where we are, that is to say, a position where we have a scheme with an incredibly low take-up, particularly among smaller herdowners.  From the figures the Minister gave me yesterday, it seems that 52% of herds in the country are less than ten years old.  One could say statistics do not count and that may be the case, but there are 198,000 cattle.  Only 21% of farmers have sent in the forms and there will be an attrition rate of up to 50%, which leaves the figure at 10%.<\/p> <p>  We have to keep in mind that there is an income element.  I realise the Minister has said this is not an income support scheme, but it was certainly sold to farmers that Pillar 2 would provide income support for poorer farmers, particularly those on marginal land.  That is why they were asked to give all of the money that the Commissioner told us he was offering to big farmers on good land.  The idea was that they would benefit under Pillar 2.  Unfortunately, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, is in the eye of the storm that has many complexities.<\/p> <p>  Were those on the board of the ICBF aware of the proposals that the federation had put to the Minister on the beef data and genomics scheme?  Presumably, the ICBF was asked for proposals when the scheme was being put to the Commission in Brussels and that the federation made proposals on how a genomics scheme might work in an Irish context.  Were those on the board of ICBF made aware of the federation's initial proposals?  Were they made aware of the changes as the negotiations continued, including when it changed from an improvement to breed for productivity purposes scheme?  This was ruled out of order in Brussels and it had to become an environmental scheme under it was changed from being a payment per head to a payment per hectare and so on.  Were those on the board aware of this?  Many of the farming organisations maintain that the scheme had major flaws.  I understand they have representatives on the board of the ICB.<\/p> <p>  My second question is about data collection.  My understanding is that this has worked well in the dairy herd.  Perhaps Mr. Coughlan might set out whether all dairy farmers are involved in genomic recording?  Am I right in thinking that in genomics much of the data for dairy herds, for example, for milk quality and so on are not qualitative but quantitative?  In other words, they are data the federation receives from processors with the permission of farmers.  Will Mr. Coughlan outline in more detail the nature of the data the federation will capture from farmers?  Will he outlne the data which are qualitative such as whether it is easy to calve?  There may be a temptation to say it was because if a farmer was to say it was not, it would be difficult to sell cattle.  How much of it is subject to human decision, as opposed to being definitive figures received by way of an accurate measurement which is independently verified?  How are the data collected?  Will Mr. Coughlan explain how the federation separates qualitative data, as I put it, from purely quantitative data?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Coughlan said he would link the data with factory data.  I can understand how the federation receives data for terminal traits.  One could confirm the rating an animal receives in the factory on the eurostar scale.  Will Mr. Coughlan explain the nature of the data the federation collects in marts, other than the fact that it records that an animal has passed through?<\/p><p>Are any data collected in the marts?  As the delegates stated, participation in on-farm recording has also facilitated the linking up of mart and factory data.  What are the mart data?  Is anything recorded other than the fact that the animal has passed through?  We need to understand this.<\/p><p> I take it that when Mr. Coughlan states the top 20% would be five-star and the top 40% would be four-star, he is really saying the top 20% would be five-star, the next 20% would be four-star and the next 20% would be three-star.  Is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#C00400","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435833000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Coughlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":494,"content":"<p>The submission does not say that.  I take it that is what is meant.<\/p> <p>  The federation states how the system is built.  On the one hand, Mr. Coughlan refers to fertility.  That is understandable because one wants as much fertility as possible.  Mr. Coughlan also referred to milk quality, which is also understandable.  He then said all types of land are factored in.  He is the expert and I do not know that much about this but I do know that while lowland sheep, for example, tend to have much higher fertility and lambing rates than mountain sheep, there is not much point in putting a lowland sheep up on a mountain.  The poor creature would not survive a wet week there.  With cattle, if one wants a lot of milk one brings in Friesian breeds, dairy crosses and so on.  However, how suitable are such breeds to very marginal land?  How does one achieve the right milk and fertility while suiting all the different land types at the same time?  How are all the calculations produced?<\/p> <p>  The delegates state that, on average, 50% of calves are male and 50% are female and, therefore, one has to genotype 50%.  One should remember, however, the requirement is to genotype 50% every year, which presumes that one calf must be produced per 12-month cycle.  I understand that farmers do not achieve this rate.  The money is being paid on the number of female cattle one has.  The witnesses might explain how the system will operate in practice.<\/p> <p>  This leads to another question.  Even as we stand, the take-up under the scheme is low.  The take-up on the previous genomic scheme, even at 15%, was low.  There will be a high level of genotyping among those in the scheme.  The delegates are the ones who produce the figures.  If 50% of people join the scheme and 60% of the animals are genotyped, that is 30% of the total herd.  On the other hand, if we could get 70% of the farmers to join the scheme and they had to genotype only 40%, it would result in a rate of 28%.  There is not very much difference, give or take a percentage point here or there.  Based on the figures the Minister gave me in the D&aacute;il yesterday, there seems to be a drop in the interest in the scheme by comparison with last year, particularly among smaller farmers, although the payments are higher.  This seems to suggest the high level of genotyping required and the associated cost are quite burdensome for the farmer.  It is great for the federation because it will make a pile of money out of it.  Perhaps if the federation had set the bar lower and attracted more farmers to the scheme, it would have got as many cattle genotyped and spread the money.  It would be more expensive for the Minister but better for the farmers.  The money would be spread a lot more fairly around the country.<\/p> <p>  Did the federation think of saying that in respect of small herds, of 20 or 30 cows, which comprise 78% of the herds in the country, it would accept genotyping at a rate of 30% or 40% because the farmers with small herds are the ones who find the process difficult?  It would have got them into the habit of recording and so on, thus reducing the costs and increasing the profit.  Did the federation think about that?<\/p> <p>  Did the federation discuss with the Minister and the Department the difficulty this scheme will cause on offshore islands such as the Aran Islands, Inishbofin, Tory Island, Clare Island, etc.?  Bere Island does not pose such a difficulty as it might be possible to do artificial insemination there.  There is a good boat service there, which takes ten minutes.  On the real offshore islands, however, artificial insemination is not feasible.  The difficulty now is that if the farmers do not want inbreeding among the cattle, their only practical option is to swap around the bulls.  Is the scheme just not practical on an island at present?  Would it impose an enormous cost on farmers?  Even if a four-star or five-star bull were introduced and it were shared by all, it would have to be moved on fairly fast or there would be an awful genetic mess.  Would the delegates be willing to propose to the Minister that he rethink the rules for islands because artificial insemination is not an option on an island?  By the time the artificial insemination man or woman could get to the cow on the island, the cow would not be in heat anymore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#D00300","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  From the presentation, it appears there is a low take-up on the suckler side as distinct from the dairy side.  I can understand why.

Obviously, there is a cost factor.  Consider also the perception that exists.<\/p> <p>  The federation states artificial insemination is probably the best approach to reach the required star rating.

I believe there were at least two or three farm organisation representatives on the board.  Was this discussed at board level?  Did those board members participate?

Meath could have had an opportunity to intervene at half time, in the way our manager did, and to make a few changes.  My view is that everyone goes to the politicians to sort out issues, but people are sitting on boards.  Was there a silence or did they have an opportunity to make their input, which they should have done?  A board is not there to be dictated to.  It is there to reach consensus based on erudite and informed contributions, which I am sure the farm organisations had.  They certainly made plenty of noise outside.  I wish to know whether they were making the noise inside.  I am always very interested in that.  That is my way of life.  I am concerned about 60% genotyping.<\/p> <p>  We had a big list of issues, some of which would not involve the witnesses.  I have some sympathy with what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, although I do not live near an island, but some of the points he made in terms of trying to achieve the target are valid.  Artificial insemination, AI, would not be a way to achieve it.  It could be difficult for smaller farmers to purchase replacements or bring in bulls and that would not be profitable given the size of their enterprise.  I am concerned about people who have 20 suckler cows or fewer.  It cannot be all just for the big people.  It is grand if one has 120 or 130 suckler cows but those who have 15 and 20 have been the backbone of the industry as well and we cannot disregard them or discard them.  Has any thought been given to the practical application of the scheme for those people?  First, the cost factor is fairly significant.  It is one thing if the herd involves 100 cows but if it is a ten cow herd it is another thing in terms of the application.<\/p> <p>  Could the federation have a graded cost to ensure feasibility for a ten-cow or 12-cow herd?  There would be very little left for the smaller producer, as opposed to a 100-cow herd.  I was always of the view that when the star rating was selected initially and animals were classified as four-star or five-star and it was dropped two or three stars subsequently, the four-star or five-star prevailed.  I never had any doubt about that.  I do not know where that got into the discussion or who fed it out.  It was mischievous in the extreme.  I do not know much about those matters.  I have a certain background in it, but I never had any view other than when one started off, as Magnus Magnusson used to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve started, so I&rsquo;ll finish&rdquo;.  What one starts with, one will finish with and therefore one will finish with the four star or five star.  I do not know whether it was mischief or whether someone had a vested interest in perpetuating the myth but it did cause a lot of concern.

The witnesses indicated in their presentation that they have travelled throughout the country informing people at meetings of farm organisations.  They might have attended every one of them.  It appears that farmers were more frustrated leaving the meetings than they were before the meetings.  The witnesses gave us very little explanation for that today.  It does seem strange that farmers were bemused and frustrated leaving the meeting and that they were not aware of how the process would work.  Both previous speakers mentioned the consultation process.  When were the witnesses asked to give their opinion on how the system would work, and were they brought along the entire way?  When were they given the final document before it was approved?<\/p> <p>  The new scheme involves a lot more work for the federation.  Do the witnesses believe they will be capable of handling the extra work?  They have been successfully involved in the dairy sector for a number of years.  A large number of animals will require to be tested in the future.  Are they up for the game, as such?  Will they be able for the challenge?  The figure has risen from 15% previously.  I would like to know how the figure was arrived at and what the reason is for the big increase.  In terms of cost, who will pay for it?  How will the cost be passed on?  I wish to hear how the process will work.<\/p> <p>  There has been much talk about AI.  From a practical point of view it is always more difficult to use AI with sucklers than using a bull because it is not as easy to identify when they are ready for that procedure.  How will the system work?  How will it be practical?  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned smaller suckler farmers might have alternative jobs, for example, and there is only a specific window of opportunity when AI will work.  First, how will it work?  In the event that it does work, once calves from an AI sire are born, will they all be five-star?  Are there enough four-star and five-star bulls in the country to operate the scheme?  That is a big question.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made in the presentation to the collection of data on sucklers from 2008.

What exactly is the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF?  Who owns it?  What is its structure?  Is it a not-for-profit organisation or a charity, which would mean all assets have to be distributed to other non-profit organisations in the event of a dissolution?<\/p><p>While Mr. Coughlan stated there are farm bodies on the board, who owns it and what are its legal structures?  Is it a co-operative, a private company or what is it?  It is fair to state the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation will get a lot more business as a result of this programme.  Is the ICBF the only outfit - I do not mean that in a pejorative way - or the only organisation in the country that will carry out this genotyping?  If so, is there anything to prevent a monopoly in respect of increasing the prices?  Do the federation's staff members, including the witnesses, have performance-related or profit-related pay, because obviously there will be a great deal more business coming its way as a result of this programme?  To revert to the question asked by Deputy Deering, what was the ICBF's role in the design of the scheme?  Was it consulted formally or informally at any point along the way and if so, when?  Did the federation have input into the design of the scheme or into the tweaking of the scheme in any way?  That is it from my side for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#E01100","speaker":"977","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I thank the two gentlemen for their presentation.  First, members are meeting as an Oireachtas joint committee on agriculture and must acknowledge how improved genetics in the dairy industry have increased profitability in the milk industry.  Members must be positive about the scheme although I acknowledge there have been some teething problems.  While I heard members of the Opposition state the scheme is not being taken up, the scheme is full and 30,000 farmers have applied for it.  While it will be their decision as to whether they remain in the scheme, the improved genetics within the dairy industry have been evident and Mr. Coughlan has made a point there.  In respect of the earnings to be made, he stated it was &euro;20 extra per replacement per year.  Is he stating that if one is at a one-star animal rating but gets to a five-star animal rating, the animal in question will be &euro;100 more profitable?  Is that basically also his point in respect of the suckler industry, if one can achieve a five-star rating?<\/p> <p>  The data began to be collected in 2008, depending on whether people had participated in the previous scheme.  As some farmers are entering this programme for the first time, I presume their data are on record and the federation will be able to access those.  In respect of cows or bulls that have been in the scheme since 2008, does that mean those data will be available immediately to facilitate the rating of those animals?  My third point pertains to the animals in the west in particular where, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has noted, there are many small suckler farmers, many of whose animals are exported.  What is the position regarding the genomics of an animal that is exported as a weanling calf?  There is no record here if it is killed in France, Italy or Spain or wherever.  Is the ICBF able to gain access to ascertain how that animal graded in respect of its weight and things like that?  Would that be part of the scheme?<\/p> <p>  I note that 20 June 2019 is a key date because people will have until that time to increase their percentage of animals up to four stars.  While it will be all right if one is using an artificial insemination five-star bull, many people in the suckler industry must use a stock bull because it is hard to detect heat in cows in a suckler herd.  However, in the case of larger farmers and even some others who are obliged to run two stock bulls, how will the ICBF differentiate between the bulls they have used on the farm?  Moreover, some purebred breeders are not even in genomic schemes and one may buy a bull without knowing whether it is a four or five-star animal, and until one starts to use that bull, it will not be rated.  If one is filling out a registration form for a calf, one merely specifies the breed of bull as the form does not ask for the bull's tag number if one is running two bulls.  Will this be taken into consideration and has the federation considered that it will be necessary to identify them?  If one uses artificial insemination, one knows precisely what bull one has used but if someone is using two stock bulls, they may not keep records indicating what cows were with what stock bulls.  How will that be solved or sorted on the ICBF's side of the scheme?<\/p> <p>  Although it has teething problems, this scheme is welcome.  If the benefit is &euro;20 per star rating or &euro;100 per animal, that is a lot of money to put into farmers' pockets.  As sucklers and the beef industry have been under pressure in recent years with regard to profitability, it is to be hoped the scheme will improve our herd in order that it will become more profitable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#F00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I thank the gentlemen for appearing before the joint committee to go through this with members and I apologise for arriving a little late.  Senator O'Neill has outlined benefits of &euro;20 per star, which certainly is welcome, and I note that 30,000 people are participating in the scheme at present.  Many people are stating they might pull out, particularly the smaller farmers, which would be worrying and members should ensure such farmers do not pull out and that the scheme is made somewhat easier.  At a meeting last night, the Minister assured members that 50% of farmers already are or almost are where they need to be in 2018 or 2019.  This is important because if they are at that point, it takes the star worry out of it.  <\/p> <p>  When will farmers know the star rating on their herd?  Speaking personally, I have only one cow in my herd of 24 or 25 cows that is a five-star animal.  I have kept daughters from that cow.  She is from a dairy herd and is a Belgian Blue from a Friesian cow.  When will farmers know the star rating of their herd?  <\/p> <p>  As for the cost of genotyping, it is important, especially in respect of smaller farmers, that the cost be kept as low as possible as one does not wish to have farmers forking out a lot of money.  It is desirable to try to keep costs as low as possible and if that cost can be reduced, it will be highly positive.  While many of the areas have been covered,  I revert to the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v about a five-star bull not being able to survive on the sides of the hills.  I am sure one could use a five-star Angus bull and he would survive for a number of months in difficult conditions.  Those are my comments for the time being.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#F00300","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I thank the gentlemen for their attendance and it is good to have this discussion.  I definitely welcome the scheme in general, in that it will mean a payment of &euro;52 million per year to beef farmers and more than &euro;300 million over the lifetime of the scheme.  I have a couple of specific questions without repeating what has been said earlier.  If a bull that is bought this year or next has a four-star rating and that star rating drops to two or three stars, I understand that it will be accepted that the farmer bought it in good faith and, consequently, it will still be taken as a four-star down the line and the farmer will not be penalised.  However, what about the progeny?  If that bull ends up having heifer calves, they will end up with three or three and a half stars.  I acknowledge there will be a mid-term review and it will be important to keep an eye on this but are members satisfied there is a sufficient number of safeguards in place to avoid ending up in a position in the final year or two whereby farmers will go mad trying to outbid each other in marts to fight for the last few four and five-star cows?  This is to ensure an environment is not created in which all the money farmers get probably ends up being spent on cows simply to avoid running into penalties in such a situation.<\/p> <p>  As for the rule specifying that 50% of the maternal animals cannot be born before 2013, is the date of 2013 rigid or is there flexibility in this regard?  Why will cows then be tested that will not be counted as part of the 50%, if cows are now being tested that will not be counted at the end because, obviously, they were born before 2013?  Seven years is quite young and while one does not want cows that are 20 years old, one could have a good cow that is eight, nine or ten years of age.  Why was the age of seven years picked?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#F00400","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I welcome the two representatives from the ICBF to the meeting.  I understand that 30,000 farmers have signed up to the scheme thus far.  However, having spoken to many farmers, I am afraid that many people still are wary of this proposal and do not know enough about it.  While people may have signed up, they are thinking of pulling out and may not go ahead with the full plan, which is a worry.  The Minister told me in a reply to a parliamentary question that in respect of the stock bull replacement requirement, he does not consider there to be any risk of inbreeding as a result of the requirements and that the majority of stock bulls on reference year herds are already four or five stars. Can the witnesses give members a guarantee that this will be the case two or three years down the line?  This is why I worry about inbreeding, especially in respect of artificial insemination, where I am told there are only one or two Charolais in the entire AI system that are four or five-star at present.  If there are only one or two bulls, will we have inbreeding within a couple of years because only one bull is available at present?<\/p><p>A wide range of four-star and five-star bulls are available for pedigree beef breeding on the replacement and terminal index.  How many of these could be given to a pedigree Charolais breeder to produce four-star or five-star animals?  I have put this question to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, because I know of a Charolais breeder who got best price for a heifer in the Tullamore show last year based on a three-star rating.  He has been building that herd for the past 20 years but he is being told that the best animal he produced last year only has a three-star rating.<\/p><p> The ICBF recently completed a listing of recommended sires for bull breeders involved in a gene Ireland maternal beef breeding programme.  It found that 92% of animals on the replacement or terminal index were rated four or five stars, which again brings the rating system into question.  Many farmers have concerns about these young and unproven bulls.  The case of the sire Cottage Devon springs to mind.  He nearly broke many farmers because they found him impossible to calf.  The only people who made money off him were the veterinarians.  Farmers will not be happy to put pedigree heifers under an unproven bull in something that resembles a lucky dip system.  What assurances can the witnesses give in that regard?<\/p><p> I also have concerns about the export of animals, which I previously raised with departmental officials.  The Minister has stated that under the new scheme all herdowners will be required to record data on calf quality and docility.  What farmer in his right mind will record an animal as poor quality or hostile?  I have never seen a farmer advertise animals for sale in such a manner.  How will we be able to record accurate information?  The Minister has noted in reply to a parliamentary question that the ICBF collects data on the weights and prices recorded for a large volume of animals sold through livestock marts prior to export.  This additional data help to improve the accuracy of indexes.  A considerable number of calves for export are simply weighed in a group of five to ten animals.  How can the mother of those animals be credited if they are weighed as a group?  This bulk weighing does not reflect the value of an individual animal given that a super May calf might be weighed alongside a September calf which obviously varies in age and weight.  How does the cow get the appropriate star rating for producing a top quality weaning calf? <\/p><p> Last year pedigree breeders had to wait six months to receive their certification to export animals.  Some simply got rid of their calves without the data.  What will happen now that there are 25,000 to 30,000 farmers?  Are there sufficient advisers in Teagasc to manage the scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#F00500","speaker":"1199","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":514,"content":"<p>In regard to the requirement on four and five stars for bulls and replacements, am I correct to say it only has to be on either the terminal or maternal side?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#G00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435833000,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Just the bulls.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Andrew Cromie"},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>On heifers it is on replacement, not terminal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#G00400","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435833000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Andrew Cromie"},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":518,"content":"<p>In regard to Deputy Aylward's comments, the Charolais needs a strong maternal trait.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#G00600","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435833000,"counter":519,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Andrew Cromie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435833000,"counter":520,"content":"<p>In regard to members' questions on our involvement in the scheme, in terms of policy this scheme is under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

This change has a strong scientific basis and I will now elaborate on the science behind it.  Last year, the scheme was based on an atypical 20-cow herd and we would have genotyped three cows and a stock bull.  That was done with the objective of collecting the relevant data under which to develop the genomic prediction equations.  The scheme for 2015 to 2020 is all about rolling out genomics to the industry.  It is new technology that integrates both the pedigree information, which is what we would have used conventionally in cattle breeding in the past, and the data collected with additional DNA data.<\/p> <p>  I will try to provide a sense of the potential value of the DNA data.  In the dairying sector, genomics have been rolled out since 2009 and this year about 65% of all of the AI or dairy semen that was used by farmers was from young genomic bulls.  The consequential effect of genomics has been to double the rate of genetic gain.  Mr. Coughlan alluded earlier to the fact that the ICBF is all about genetic gain.  Therefore, when people ask why there has been a big increase in the level of genotyping, it is with the clear objective of increasing the level of genetic gain, because we know that with the use of the DNA data, we can double the rate of genetic gain that can be achieved within a relevant population, the relevant population in this case being suckler cows.<\/p> <p>  I will give a specific example of what I am talking about in terms of the potential of the science.  The research work is being done in conjunction with Dr. Donagh Berry of Teagasc and we are working our way through the research work currently, taking the 2014 data to develop the genomic predictions.  The work we have done to date indicates the value of the DNA, in the context of getting a handle on a trait such as female fertility, a trait that has very low heritability.  In other words, it is a trait that is difficult to breed for.  With the additional DNA data, we can predict with a level of accuracy, on a young calf, a bull or heifer calf, at three or four days of age, the equivalent of that animal having 70 calvings through the use of the DNA data.  Therefore, it is like looking at that calf, but at having 70 calving intervals on that animal, based on the knowledge from its DNA.  We can take a hair sample, look at its DNA and then use the research work done last year to develop the genomic prediction equations from known patterns in the training population.  In terms of the DNA from the training population, we know that whenever we see these patterns within the animal's DNA, that conveys, for example in this case, more fertility.  In the context of female fertility, a trait such as that is the sort of level of gain we want.<\/p> <p>  This knowledge is critical, because calving interval is currently at 415 days in the suckler herd and going in the wrong direction.  Calves per cow per year, a very relevant female fertility trait, is at 0.79 calves per cow per year, and going in the wrong direction.  It is that increase in accuracy of our ability to identify the more profitable animals that the DNA brings.  It gives us the logic or scientific reasoning behind why we now want to take the research and apply it widely to all candidate animals.  As Mr. Coughlan highlighted, all candidate animals are the potential females being born in the scheme herds.  Every year, the average size of the scheme herds is approximately 20 cows and on average eight or nine heifer calves are born.  Our goal is to genotype all of those heifer calves on an annual basis.  There are additional benefits in this from an operational perspective in that we move to a system where, with tissue tagging at birth - we already mentioned BVD in that context - there is the opportunity to tag the animal, take the tissue and generate the genomic evaluation on all of those calves at birth.  Therefore, from an operational or procedural perspective, there are many additional benefits to the farmer. <\/p> <p>  However, our goal there is to identify quickly and at an early stage the most profitable calves for the farmer.  Therefore, if he has eight or nine calves, we can say at that stage, for example, that five, eight or nine are eligible for the scheme.  In some cases, none will be eligible.  We accept that and this is part of the replacement strategy discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Andrew Cromie"},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":558,"content":"<p>Is Dr. Cromie saying that when we tag a calf in the beginning for BVD, we could also test for the genomes with the one sample?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#N00300","speaker":"1199"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435833000,"counter":559,"content":"<p>Yes, that is our goal within the context of this scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Andrew Cromie"},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":560,"content":"<p>That is good news.

In the case of some farmers, we know approximately 40% of the replacements coming onto suckler farms are purchased-in replacements.  We would pick those up as additional animals or we would also prioritise additional cows, in the context of ongoing research and development around supporting the training population work.<\/p> <p>  Some people have asked whether we will run out of females.  We expect that in a small proportion of cases, perhaps towards the end of the scheme, we may find ourselves genotyping some male calves, but they are not valueless in the context of the scheme, because the scheme is also focused on beef traits and carcass traits.  Therefore, in the case of any male calf that gets genotyped, we will pick up all of the carcass data subsequently.  I will revisit that question of the data, carcass, weanling and weight data.

On an ongoing basis one trains one's genotype or DNA against the data to ensure that every year one gets the most accurate picture and constantly updates one's predictions equations.  If we want to do such work, and if we develop the research project in 2014, and then ask farmers to genotype their animals, by the time we reach 2020 we would be providing genomic predictions that are based on data that was collected six or seven years earlier.  Therefore, the accuracy of one's prediction equations is reduced.  Genomics is all about how do we, with confidence, identify the most profitable animals for farmers for breeding, whether that breeding be males or females.  That is why the scheme has been designed to marry the genotyping with the data recording element on the farm.<\/p> <p>  The second part of the scheme, in the context of the 60%, is that we must ensure that all potential candidate animals that will enter the breeding herd are genotyped.  Quality has been one of the major challenges in the industry.  I mean by this that we have not brought enough four and five-star animals into the herd and we have been too focused on output and determining traits.  Invariably, the wrong types of females are coming into the suckler herd and that is why the maternal traits are moving in the wrong direction.  Having said all that one could argue that it is as much value to genotype one and two-star animals - the poor animals - because it would ensure that they get pushed out of the system and do not come back into the suckler herd.  Also, genotyping helps us to identify the genes that relate to poor performance because those are the genes that we want to push out of the suckler herd.<\/p> <p>  Let me explain the strategy and rationale for having a 60% rate.  Some people have suggested that the scheme was an opportunity to increase the percentage or whatever.

However, I said that if I decided to apply pure science to a human issue such as road safety then the simple scientific fact is that if one limited the ability of a car to travel no more than 5 mph then there would be virtually no car accidents.

Would four fifths of the female calves, in a higher number of herds, not generate the same amount of genotyping in total?

Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made a point about the level of uptake and asked whether farmers will fall out of the scheme.  It is important for everyone to grasp the data from our latest analysis of the 30,000 herds that are now in the scheme, which showed that 80% of the bulls in 20,000 herds have stock or breeding bulls which means they are eligible, as per the requirements of this scheme.  That means 20,000 herds are using breeding bulls and the remaining 10,000 use AI, which is generally used by smaller herds.  That data shows a positive message.<\/p> <p>  Senator Comiskey raised the issue of communicating statistics.  I can tell him that 80% of the bulls are eligible as per the current terms and conditions of the scheme.  Let us look at the replacement strategy which has left a lot of farmers feeling nervous.  Earlier the Senator said his herd report showed that he had only one four or five-star cow out of 24 cows.  The comparable figures for the 30,000 herds that are now in the scheme is that 61% of them are eligible and meet the 2018 requirement of having 20% of the herd comprised of four and five-star females.  In addition, approximately 38% of herds are already compliant with the 2020 requirement.<\/p><p>We see these as very positive figures.  At the end of the day, responsibility lies with the ICBF now and in the next few weeks.  There has been some discussion about the reports and the pack that will be sent to the 30,000 herdowners; we will communicate a picture of their herds, including their stock bulls, cows, young stock and the Euro-Star status of the animals, directly to them.  <\/p><p> One of the challenges - probably the biggest one we faced in the context of the scheme - was the lack of knowledge of many participants on the current status of their herds.  That they were entering a scheme with incomplete knowledge created nervousness among farmers.  When we look at the number of herds on the ICBF HerdPlus system, the genetic evaluation or report service we use, about 10,000 of the 30,000 herd owners are receiving these data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#O02800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Andrew Cromie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":603,"content":"<p>There were 73,000-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#P00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435833000,"counter":604,"content":"<p>To clarify, of the 30,000 herdowners participating in the scheme-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Andrew Cromie"},{"type":"speech","time":1435833000,"counter":605,"content":"<p>That is one third of one third.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#P00400","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435833000,"counter":606,"content":"<p>-----approximately 10,000 are currently knowledgeable of or have reports that indicate to them the status of their herds, which means that there are 20,000 who do not have that information.

Exports are not a cause of concern primarily because we get data on the exported calves.  As part of the scheme, participants are required to record calf docility and calf quality.  At the end of the day we find a very high correlation between the farmer's recorded calf quality and price per kilo in the mart.  For the calves traded through marts that are exported, we get the weights.  In circumstances where the exporters are buying them in a sale. we get the price per kilo.  We have a lot of data on exported calves and it is certainly not a concern that where a farmer or suckler herd owner is exporting his calves, the value of his cows are undervalued or undermined in any way..  I hope that answers that question.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v sought clarification as to the data we get from marts.  The central cattle breeding database has a live link with the 70 or so marts throughout the county.  With the co-operation of the marts, in addition to the mart movements, we also get information on the weights and prices per kilo of all animals traded.  Those data are used directly in genetic evaluations.  We run evaluations about three times a year based on the data from marts.  We would have about 3 million records of the weight of animals.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about qualitative versus quantitative data.  On the question of quantitative data, we would be dealing with the meat processors who provide us with data on every animal that is slaughtered.  There are approximately 5.5 million to 6 million carcass records and genetic evaluations and 3 million live weight records.  We have quantitative data on the calving interval, which is based on the cow calving dates and cow survival.  We have about 3 million calving interval records.  We have a very good handle on female traits.<\/p> <p>  In terms of some of the qualitative data, which is from the farmer's recorded data, we have about 12 million calving survey records.  We have data on calf docility, calf quality, cow milk score and cow docility.  These data have been recorded through the beef data programme originating in the suckler herd.  We have a couple of million records for each of those traits.<\/p> <p>  An interesting observation in the context of the traits and heritability is that an issue that is a constant cause of concern for people is that farmers record just anything.  If that were the case, there is no way we could estimate genetic evaluations or pick up heritabilities.  Heritabilities are based on consistency.  Deputy Aylward used the example of the breed Cottage Devon, but the bottom line is that every farmer finds those calves difficult to calve.  That generates a heritability, because one knows that a certain breed of sire is easier than another and there is a difference which is known as variation.  That genetic variation expressed as a proportion of the total is heritability.  The farmer recorded data generate very good heritabilities.  As a consequence we see it as a key component of the scheme.  In terms of our objectives, we can get farmers to record data for traits such as cow docility.  Can one image how one would collect data on cow docility if one had to put staff on the road to collect those data?  These are critical data in the context of health and safety on farms.  We also collect data on stock bull docility.  We could not put people on the road to collect that information from 30,000 farms.  Roughly speaking it would cost &euro;80 to send an official to a farm to collect data.  The objective of the scheme is to get the farmers to record the data.  Another aspect is that the farmers are part of the scheme because they are recording data on their animals and they buy in to the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015070200002#Q01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Andrew Cromie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435833000,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I will deal with the other points.  Members expressed concerns around the smaller herd sizes.  The reality is that artificial insemination is used in the smaller herds.  While only 20% of the progeny in last year's scheme were from AI, 50% of the herds were using some AI.  There is potential in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the herds on offshore islands, the actual profile in terms of star ratings is not dramatically different and there are four and five-star cows on the island farms as well.  I do not see that being a significant issue.<\/p> <p>  I think Deputy Aylward raised the query on untested bulls.  We have the same issue with the dairy herd.  The key is that if one has a herd of 20 cows, it is best practice to use AI from a panel of bulls and spread the risk in terms of calving difficulty and the evaluations going up and down.  That is just good practice.  That is what the dairy farmers are doing.  That is what we would expect beef farmers to do as well.<\/p> <p>  To respond to a question on the star ratings, if the star rating of the bull goes down, it may affect some of the offspring which may not then be eligible.

In doing so I'd like to welcome everyone to the public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with senior members of the Government who had key roles during and after the crisis period.  This morning and this afternoon we will hear from Mr. Brian Cowen, former Taoiseach and Minister for Finance.  Brian Cowen was a TD for Laois-Offaly from June 1984 until February 2011.

I welcome the opportunity to address today's session and to assist the inquiry where I can in its deliberations.  As requested by the inquiry, I have submitted two separate written statements relating to what you describe as themes and lines of inquiry which the committee wishes to discuss with me.  The first written statement covers my tenure as Minister for Finance from September 2004 until May 2008 and the second relates to my time as Taoiseach from May 2008 to March 2011.  I understand that at today's proceedings we are discussing my period as Minister for Finance.  Next week, I am to return to deal with my time as Taoiseach.  These are the arrangements that you have asked me to comply with and I am happy to do so.  If I may, Chairman, as this is my first appearance before the committee, I wish to make a few introductory remarks?<\/p>  <p>  I want to say, first of all, to the Irish people, that the Government I led dealt with the financial crisis to the very best of its ability.  I know the crisis brought with it difficulties and problems of all kinds to many people throughout the country and as Head of the Government I accept full and complete responsibility for my role in and our response to that crisis.  I am sorry that the policies we felt necessary to put in place in responding to the financial crisis brought with it hardship and distress to many people.  The human cost of dealing with this crisis, which we sought to mitigate as best we could, was the most difficult aspect of the decisions we had to make.  What we did was about restoring financial stability to the country.  We must learn from this difficult experience and ensure that it doesn't happen again.<\/p>  <p>  This exercise, however, is not just about expressing regret or sorrow but to indicate that I will be approaching all questions in as an objective and non-defensive a manner as possible.  To do otherwise would not serve the interests of this inquiry or future generations.  I hope also to dispel some of the assertions which have been pushed sometimes for personal or party political reasons.  I think the best contribution I can make before this inquiry is to give you and the public an insight into what our thinking was at the time and what were the factors we had to consider in making decisions.  We did not have the benefit of hindsight.  While there is ... there was an international context to our difficulties, there is no doubt that there were failures on the domestic front also.  I hope that my engagement with you here will help people to understand the nature of the problems we faced - there's never as much room to manoeuvre in the crisis as some would have one believe.<\/p>  <p>  The Government I led has had these matters examined by commissioning and publishing two reports - Regling and Watson, and Honohan.  We also set up a statutory commission of investigation, chaired by Mr. Peter Nyberg.  He produced another valuable and substantive contribution in the examination of the banking crisis.  The Oireachtas banking inquiry is another important exercise in accountability.  I have always intimated, since the inquiry was first mooted, that of course I will co-operate with you as you undertake your work here.  <\/p>  <p>         In relation to the actions I took, I want to make it clear from the beginning that nothing I have to say here should be interpreted by anyone in any way as an attempt by me to pass the buck to anyone else.  Mr. Nyberg makes a very prescient comment in his report with which I fully concur and subscribe to when he says:<\/p><blockquote>\tPeople in a position to make decisions are and must be ultimately responsible for them regardless of what advice or suggestions they have received.  The higher and more influential their position the greater their responsibility. <\/blockquote> <p>It is a reality of life today that a country's economy cannot operate without a functioning banking system.  The Government's responsibility was to try and save the economy.  In doing that, we also had to have a banking system.  I agree with Professor Honohan when he says in his report that the primary responsibility for this crisis rests with the banks themselves.  It's important to recognise that, in the pre-crisis period, there was what turned out to be reckless lending by individual banks, made worse by a bonus culture incentivising short-term gains.  I also accept that the Irish and European regulatory systems failed completely to recognise the extent of the risks that could materialise and to stop the over-dependence of Irish banks on overseas wholesale funding.  In terms of the bank guarantee, I believe it was the most decisive step that the Government could take on that night to deal with the problem.  It was clear that we were on our own.  We had one shot at it.  If we did not get it right, Ireland, we were told, would be set back 25 years.  We had to go with the best information available to us at the time.  <br\/><br\/>So, Chairman, taxpayers' money has been put into Bank of Ireland, AIB, Irish Life and Permanent and EBS building society, which will, I believe, be recovered over time.  The vast majority of losses in Anglo and Irish Nationwide, totalling some &euro;34 billion, will not be recovered.  Had they collapsed, the cost to the State and the economy would have been catastrophic because of the consequent impact on the whole banking and economic system.  When the scale of the losses were identified, we were in favour of imposing losses on senior bondholders.  We were left in no doubt that burning bondholders would have meant no EU-IMF programme; it was one or the other.  We assessed that there was a far greater financial and economic benefit to the country entering the programme at the time than to burn remaining bondholders.  Nationalising Anglo Irish Bank would not have been a simple solution.  There were serious risks attached to that approach too.  It is now becoming increasingly clear to people that there are, or were, no cost-free or risk-free solutions.  The decisions made were finely balanced and there were legitimate pros and cons with all the limited options available.  No option looked good; it was a case of taking the least worst option available.  I can say that the Government that I led strove tirelessly to do its duty in the most difficult of circumstances.<br\/><br\/>Our primary motivation at all times was to try to protect livelihoods as best we could and to steer a course that would progressively close the gap between what Government was spending and what it was taking in in taxes.  This was made doubly difficult by the fact that the economy was contracting for a period and unemployment was rising.  Added to this central task was the need to stabilise the financial system in the country when there was an unprecedented turbulence in the markets after what was described as a &quot;once in a century event&quot;. <br\/><br\/>Chairman, I will now speak to the issues you have asked me to address as Minister for Finance.  On macroeconomic policy, the budgets that I presented were built on what appeared to be conservative economic projections, targeting very modest deficits and an ongoing decline in the national debt burden.  At the time, many of those assumptions proved to be overly conservative with the actual fiscal outturn being better than that projected on budget day in a number of instances.  Those outcomes were targeted at the same time that the Government was putting aside 1% of our national income every year for investment in the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  These were responsible fiscal targets at the time, which appropriately balanced the resources at hand and the demands for better services and infrastructure.  As Minister, public investment was a major priority.  <\/p>  <p>         This country had suffered from decades of under-investment in our physical and social infrastructure, and I was determined to use the resources at my disposal to put that right.  Our rate of public investment, at around 5% of GNP, was approximately twice the European average.  This was a correct level of public investment in my view, as we sought to close the infrastructure deficit, to underpin competitiveness, and to improve the lives of all citizens, young and old.  I also took the opportunity presented by our economic growth to transform the funding of services for the disabled, to support child care, particularly in the early years, to improve the lives of our elderly citizens and to make the tax system fairer.<\/p> <p> While the rate of growth in public expenditure was, with the benefit of hindsight, high, I do not recall any other public representative ever arguing in the D&aacute;il or Seanad that I was providing too much for the old age pension, for welfare payments, for child care supports or improved services.  In fact, there were demands for greater spending coming from every interest in the State, much of which could not be met.<\/p> <p> I do regret that current spending growth was not lower during my time as Minister for Finance.  However, even a slower, more modest rate of growth in spending on health and education and welfare, would not have eliminated the need for the painful fiscal adjustments we saw from 2008 on.  That adjustment was driven by the global financial crisis and the collapse in economic activity, a collapse which was more pronounced in our country because of the level of construction activity taking place in Ireland at the time.  When I was Minister for Finance I shared the positive view of our prospects which was held by all the main research and international agencies.  But contrary to what some are now trying to suggest, I was concerned about the potential vulnerabilities and risks arising from the rapid escalation in property prices which was a recurring theme in risk assessments.<\/p> <p> It has since been alleged that no action was taken by our Government to deal with those risks.  This seems to be based on a view in some quarters, it seems to me, that I was in some way beholden to property market interests, and that is simply not true. The facts are that prior to any signs of an emerging international crisis, there were four important actions taken to attempt to minimise the potential vulnerabilities in the banking sector related to the dependence on highly valued property.  The four actions were: the decision in December 2005 to abolish a wide range of property-based tax incentives; secondly, the refusal by the Government to abolish or dramatically reduce stamp duty; thirdly, the decision of the Financial Regulator in early 2007 to increase the capital requirements on banks for speculative property lending from 100% to 150%; and fourthly, the decision by Government to continue to allocate 1% of GNP every year into the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  These key actions taken prior to the crisis were significant and reduced the risks and vulnerabilities of the Irish economy, without which the crisis in the Irish economy would have been far worse.<\/p> <p> In order to refute the suggestion that no action was taken to minimise vulnerabilities, it is worth considering the significance at the time of each of the four main actions cited above.  It is important to reflect that some of the opposition to these actions which, if heeded, would have left Ireland in a more detrimental position.  Regarding the abolition of property-based tax incentives, those who suggest we did nothing to curb that property spiral ignore the fact that in presenting my 2006 budget, I announced the most radical abolition of property-based tax incentives taken by any Minister for Finance.  I did this because I was concerned that these incentives were contributing to an over-valuation of property, with resultant vulnerabilities.  This decision did not gain favour with many interested parties in the property market.  It also represented a decisive policy shift, because over a long period, successive Governments since 1985 had added more new property incentives rather than engage in wholesale abolition of existing incentives.  I took these and other measures to reduce the vulnerabilities of the Irish economy to the escalation in property prices, to secure a greater return for the Exchequer, to enhance equity, and to do so in a way that reflected the fact that there were over 250,000 jobs in the sector at the time.<\/p> <p> Transitional arrangements were put in place for projects that were, at that stage, up and running or being completed, and no new projects were eligible under any of these schemes from the date I announced their abolition, December 2006.  A further protection before any future proposal of this type could be brought forward was the provision by me in the Finance Bill that a cost-benefit analysis showing the economic benefit that would accrue from any such introduction would have to be shown, first of all, and that there would be an automatic three-year review after it became law.  <\/p>  <p>         If such a provision had been in place when this type of tax relief was first introduced in 1985 by the then Government, the achievement of the economic objectives for which the schemes were initially devised could have been apparent much sooner.  But in any event, in hindsight, these schemes could have been terminated much earlier.  In late 2006 and up to the general election in 2007, I was also the subject of sustained criticism for my decision as Minister for Finance to resist widespread demands to abolish or dramatically reduce stamp duty on property.  At that time, I accepted that the levels of stamp duty in Ireland were among the highest in the world and that this meant real consequences for people buying houses.  While I agree that some adjustments were appropriate, I realise that the high levels of stamp duty were a brake on the escalation of property prices and acted as a disincentive to greater property speculation.  I felt that calls for the abolition or serious reduction of stamp duty were simply irresponsible in the context of rapid property price growth and I therefore strongly resisted such demands.  There is no doubt abolishing or reducing stamp duty at that time would have been politically popular.   But it would also have increased the vulnerabilities of the banking system and the Irish economy to overvalued property and I therefore refused to go down that route.  It's hardly surprising today that the cheerleaders for the abolition of stamp duty, or its radical reduction, are now silent on what would have been the impact on property prices or the resultant impact on the scale of the banking crisis had I heeded their calls.<\/p> <p> The decision of the Financial Regulator at the start of 2007 to increase the capital requirements on banks for speculative property lending to 150% from 100% was a decision which I strongly supported.  I accepted that this brought the capital requirements on Irish banks for speculative property lending to one of the highest in the developed countries but I believed that it was totally appropriate given the vulnerabilities of Irish banks to property prices.  This was taken at a time when international agencies and others were still benign on the prospects for Irish banks.  We now know that given what happened since, this action again should have been taken at the start of the period of lending growth by banks but it was a significant initiative.<\/p> <p> The final action taken to reduce vulnerabilities was to allocate 1% of GNP every year into the national pension fund.  This was despite calls from the political Opposition from time to time to use that fund for more expenditure in Ireland.  This would have increased further the Government spend in the economy.   The tax revenues from the economic growth were used to engage in unprecedented capital investment to provide key infrastructure such as roads, public transport projects, the Luas, the tunnel, schools, third-level research facilities, energy, communications and health.  And this infrastructure has greatly increased our productive capacity and will be essential in returning the economy to a sustainable growth rate as global conditions improve. <\/p> <p> The economy was operating at or close to its potential over the period when I was Minister.  During this time the economy was enjoying conditions of full employment with an unemployment rate at 4.5%.  With full employment the labour market got much tighter, which reflected in further price and wage pressures and inevitably a loss in cost competitiveness.  Large public investment in infrastructure to deal with development bottlenecks arising as a result of the economy being at full tilt could not totally compensate for that fact, certainly within the same period.  In my view, this investment was necessary and appropriate to continue to expand the productive capacity of a growing economy.  While headline indicators suggested that fiscal policy was on an appropriate track over the period, more attention could have been paid to the underlying fiscal position and stance which was pro-cyclical.  However, it must be acknowledged that few independent observers of the policy-making process, either domestic or external, highlighted that as a major concern.  There was a failure to adopt policy to reflect the realities of membership of the euro.  With monetary policy conditions set with regard to euro area conditions as a whole and the exchange rate no longer available as a macroeconomic adjustment tool, fiscal and other policies, for example incomes policy, needed to play a greater role in macroeconomic stabilisation and adjustment.  However, such conditions do not appear to have received adequate attention over the period to 2006. <\/p> <p> Opposition parties criticised Government during growth years for spending too little.  Their new revised criticism, to fit changed times and circumstances, is that during these years we actually spent too much.  <\/p>  <p>         Yet the facts are we recorded budget surpluses in ten of the 11 budgets up to when I left office as finance Minister.  We used the period of sustained economic growth to more than halve the general Government debt as a percentage of GDP from 64% to 25% in the ten-year period to 2008.  If the assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund are taken into account, the net debt position at the time I finished being Minister was about 14% of GDP.  This undoubtedly slowed the Irish economy from the rate which would have applied if an additional percent of GNP each year was allocated for more spend at the time.  This subsequently gave the Government vital head room to borrow to help us through the crisis when large deficits had to be funded, even after serious annual adjustments were made to start closing the gap that had then emerged between spending and revenues.<\/p> <p> On prudential policy, the role of the Department of Finance was to promote financial stability by developing financial services legislation where required which was implemented by the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  The former was charged with formulating macro-prudential policy, whereas the regulator was managing individual financial institutions through micro-prudential policy.  The entire regulatory system was under the guidance of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, which was established on the continuing principle of being independent of the Department of Finance.  All of the quarterly reports prepared by the Central Bank were independent, the financial stability reports were drawn up by the Central Bank in consultation with the Financial Regulator.  Briefings were provided to me as Minister based on these findings.  I had and was given no reason to doubt the economic and financial stability projections contained in these.  By 2000 ... by summer 2007, the Central Bank's report noted that growth in credit had started to abate, as had house prices.  This was viewed as being evidence of an incremental steadying of the market.  Throughout 2007 and up to the summer of 2008, third party domestic and international economic and independent reports suggested a slight slow-down in economic activity.  The analysis from the Central Bank was that there would be what is termed a soft landing regarding the property market, which is usually, to be definitive about it, it is about stagnating price and gradual reduction over a period of years after that.  <\/p> <p> I agree with the conclusions of the Regling and Watson report which stated that banking practices, governance failings and financial supervision \"seriously exacerbated Ireland's credit and property boom\" which left the economy vulnerable to a deep crisis and depleted its fiscal and banking buffers when the crisis struck.  I believe that had there been more robust independent work and scenario planning undertaken by both the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator regarding the banking system, this would have informed the silently evolving risk scenario and enabled the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance to develop timely strategic interventions, policies and strategies.  There was a lack of analysis by both the Central Bank and Financial Regulator in challenging the over-concentration of risk in property and the emphasis seemed to have been more on the residential housing market than on the commercial property sector and that was a mistake.  There was clearly a culture of deference in operation between the Financial Regulator and the financial institutions it was regulating.<\/p> <p> I agree with the findings of the Nyberg report which asserts that the policy apparatus was complacent.  As Minister, I should have been more doubting, more questioning by challenging the broad consensus of opinion that had developed on these matters.  There were vulnerabilities built up within the banks, property prices were over-valued and there had been a gradual loss of competitiveness in the Irish economy.  I believe that if the unprecedented global financial collapse had not happened, there would have been a softer landing for the Irish economy but the over-valuation of properties and related vulnerabilities within banks put Ireland in a weaker position when we had to face the global crisis.  I accept that ongoing actions would have been required to address these vulnerabilities, even in the absence of the global crisis.<\/p> <p> The views on the prospects for the Irish economy in 2007 from the OECD, from the European Union, from the International Monetary Fund, from Moody's, from the ESRI and many other commentators were conclusively positive.  The advice at the time was that the balance of evidence suggested that the banks had sufficient capital to absorb the likely losses but that there were vulnerabilities and risks.  With hindsight, this proved to be fundamentally wrong.  However, those were the views expressed at the time.  We know now that grave mistakes were made in the judgment of the capital adequacy of the Irish banks and the assessment of future loan losses.  <\/p>  <p>         It is, however, important to note that no one in the independent authorities ever advised the Government that the capital adequacy was not sufficient or that higher capital adequacy ratios should be imposed.  These lessons have now been fully taken on board and policies implemented to ensure that a banking crisis like that can never happen again in Ireland.  While Government shares responsibility for its roles in these mistakes, it is noteworthy that many of the strongest critics of the Government were silent on these issues prior to the crisis and indeed were proposing measures such as a radical reduction or abolition of stamp duty which would have made the position much worse.  <\/p> <p> On the adequacy of the assessment and communications of both solvency and liquidity risks in the banking institutions and the banking sector, I state that when we joined the euro Irish banks got access to a new source of wholesale funding at low rates of interest and with no exchange risk.  Integrating the Irish financial system within the euro area was always viewed as a positive development.  The more integration that took place, including financial integration, the better it was deemed to be for us.  The question of access to this liquidity being cut off completely was never seen as a realistic prospect in any foreseeable circumstance.  When problems with liquidity arose, being part of the euro system and having access to ECB policy responses was again seen as a strength for Ireland.  <\/p> <p> Regarding solvency of the banks, the message from the authorities was that the banking system was adequately capitalised given their level of profitability, and that they appeared in good financial health.  While concerns were expressed when overall financial stability was being assessed, there was no suggestion that downside risks would transform into such a critical situation for Ireland.  The external surveillance mechanisms, including the OECD, IMF and European Union, together with the ESRI, were forecasting a continuation of strong economic growth in Ireland compared to our EU counterparts.  Credit rating agencies looked favourably on Irish banks.  During my time as Minister, there was no consensus that we were heading for what ultimately happened.  <\/p> <p> As is noted in appendix 6 of the Wright report, the international reports on the Irish economy undertaken by the European Commission, the IMF and the OECD from 1999 to 2007 in fact commended the performance of the Irish economy, while domestic reports up to mid-2008 also talked down any idea of a hard landing for the Irish economy or the Irish property market.  None of these reports made any reference whatsoever to a systemic banking crisis or a possible banking collapse.  <\/p> <p> I was not aware of contrarian views within the Department of Finance which differed in substance from the Department's overall assessment.  Regarding external contrarian views, the most notable was a research paper by Professor Morgan Kelly of UCD which was published by the ESRI when it launched the ESRI summer quarterly economic commentary review of the Irish economy in July 2007.  In an interview on publication of the review, the ESRI economist Dr. Alan Barrett made it clear that the ESRI did not share Professor Kelly's prognosis that house prices in Ireland over the following eight years would drop between 40% and 60% in value.  Whilst the ESRI thought that house prices were overvalued by 15% to 20%, it did not believe there was going to be a sharp fall in house prices.  It was forecasting a house price decrease of 3% for 2007, with it stabilising the following year.  The ESRI view was that economic growth would be 4.9% in 2007, moderating to 3.7% in 2008, a growth rate which they said was consistent with a degree of stability in house prices in 2008.  The mainstream view remained amongst most commentators that house price increases had been underpinned by many factors, including a strong economy, increases in employment and earnings, reductions in taxation and lower interest rates resulting from participation in monetary union.  Professor Kelly's more pessimistic view proved to be more accurate, as we now know, although in his paper he said the main macro-economic effect of this as being ... he saw it as being higher unemployment due to reduced house building activity as prices fell over the period in question.  He states in the paper that he remained of the view that Irish banks were well capitalised at the time.  <\/p> <p> Regarding the effectiveness of the Oireachtas, throughout my period as Minister for Finance the critique from the political Opposition was that we were not addressing economic issues quickly enough.  There were constant demands for more spending.  Practically all economic Private Members' motions which allowed the Opposition to debate issues of their choice in the D&aacute;il involved demands for more public spending in the areas of health, education, transport, etc.  On other occasions the Opposition was calling for more money to be returned to taxpayers.  <\/p>  <p>         They were predicting continued economic growth and were proposing looser fiscal policies than the Government during the 2007 general election campaign.  Very few parliamentary questions were put down on banking issues generally, let alone suggestions that the banking system and the economy were facing ruin.  There were parliamentary questions on subprime lending, which was a very small part of the overall Irish mortgage market.  The capital adequacy or otherwise of banks was not, to my knowledge, ever raised as a priority issue.<\/p> <p> I was in favour of improving opportunities for better D&aacute;il oversight of the annual budgetary process as Minister for Finance.  I introduced new arrangements whereby, from January 2006, I met with the Committee on Finance and the Public Service to discuss the economic and fiscal background to the 2006 and two subsequent budgets.  From 2007, individual Ministers would publish an annual statement on the outputs and objectives of their Departments and from 2008, the actual outturns.  These statements were then presented to the relevant Oireachtas committee along with the Department's annual Estimates.  After these individual examinations the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service would co-ordinate the preparation of a report to the D&aacute;il on the outcome of these deliberations.  I instituted those changes to meet the desire on all sides of the House for better debate, better scrutiny and better results from the raising of tax and spending of public money in the State.<\/p> <p> During my time at the Department of Finance, there was a recognition that keeping tax levels lower generated economic growth which, in turn, produced tax revenues to fund public expenditure.  Despite the obvious international risks, the outlook was broadly positive and the budgetary strategy allowed for significant policy initiatives.  The Department was advising that spending growth should not exceed growth in revenues.  There was room for substantial sustained infrastructure investment consistent with projected levels of economic growth but at the same time, keeping the burden of taxation and debt at reasonable levels.  The Department was expressing caution regarding the economy and the need to keep the budget balanced at a level which could cope with any slowdown in growth that may occur over the period ahead at that time.  Department views with ministerial sign-off were submitted to Cabinet in the annual June memo on budget strategy, but after Cabinet discussion and subsequent bilateral discussions on the departmental Estimates, spending and tax relief outlined in the December budgets were above that advocated in June.<\/p> <p> Key drivers for public policy, when asked about that ... obviously, programmes for Government and the social partnership processes, which included spending and tax expenditure commitments, were drivers of Government policy.  The enlargement of the EU in 2004 led to significantly increased net immigration to Ireland in the following years.  At the same time, our own population was also increasing and, indeed, emigrants coming back home again.  This required expansion of day-to-day public services and capital investment needs in housing, education and transport, for example, among many others.  All this left us more vulnerable than would otherwise be the case to deal with the current economic challenges.  However, there was a limited amount of formal analysis and advice on fiscal risks outside of the June memo for Cabinet.<\/p> <p> Regarding the interaction with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank was responsible for overall financial stability assessment, the Financial Regulator was responsible for day-to-day supervision of the lending institutions.  I was aware that when financial stability reports were being compiled, that the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator interacted on that exercise.  The Central Bank issued quarterly bulletins and financial stability reports to the Department of Finance.  The Governor of the Central Bank would update me, usually around the time of quarterly bulletins being issued, and before budget time, he would also formally issue a pre-budget letter setting out the overall stance of the Central Bank on the economic and budgetary situation.  There was contact between the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance at official level, as one would expect.  During my tenure as Minister, I met with the chairman of the Financial Regulator on three occasions to discuss IFSRA business at the time.  I would have expected that any concerns would initially be escalated through the existing channels of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator through the Secretary General of the Department.  Any briefings I received from the Governor of the Central Bank and through the financial stability reports were overall conclusively positive.<\/p> <p> There was no evidence from any of the reports already completed on the banking crisis that the Financial Regulator did not have adequate powers to deal with the emerging situation, if it had been analysed and identified at the time.  The principles-based approach to regulation, which operated in Ireland and in many countries throughout the world as an orthodoxy, was deferential in its report here in Ireland towards financial institutions.  Processes were checked but outcomes and risks that the banks' behaviour was causing were not identified and corrected.  <\/p>  <p>         Both the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator had significant resources in terms of dealing with supervision and regulation of lending institutions.  The Department of Finance primarily saw its role as preparing any legislation that the Central Bank and Financial Regulator might seek.  It did not see its role as one of second-guessing the work and assessments of the Central Bank and the regulator, which were independent, separate and had specific statutory responsibility within this area.  It cannot be said that the supervisory practice was effective since the analysis concentrated on liquidity being the problem, without adequately preparing for a situation where the whole financial system was at risk.  The change which saw the banks accessing increased amounts of wholesale funding did not prompt a review by the authorities as to what wider effects a property downturn would have on the capital adequacy of the banks and there was insufficient first-hand evidence available about the deterioration in the banks' risk management policies.  Worst-case scenarios were not worked out because of the general regulatory approach which relied too heavily on trusting the governance mechanisms within the banks themselves.<\/p> <p> There was no indication of any significant financial or banking problems on the horizon before 2007 when the US subprime mortgage crisis impacted the global banking system.  This had the effect of dramatically reducing liquidity within and between banks throughout the eurozone area.  While there was a settled view that Irish banks had not acquired any of these toxic assets, Irish financial institutions were not immune from the impact of interbank lending and the closing off of traditional liquidity channels.  The domestic standing group was established in 2007 when I was Minister for Finance and sought to enhance cooperation between the Central Bank, Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance in light of the emerging financial situation across Europe.  The group was monitoring and continuing to analyse the liquidity issue which was impacting banks right up until the crisis in September 2008.  There was a view across the board that Ireland's banks were well capitalised and this view was shared with me as Minister for Finance throughout this period.  As Minister for Finance, I attended monthly Eurogroup and ECOFIN meetings which discussed economic policy, taxation and the regulation of financial services across all EU member states.  During the period 2004 to 2007, Ireland comfortably met the revised Stability and Growth Pact targets of having an annual debt-GDP ratio of less than 60% and an annual deficit of under 3% of GDP.  During late 2007 and early 2008 the work of domestic standing group remained focused on liquidity and contingency planning, including the impact of ELA on the confidence of an institution following the Northern Rock scenario in the UK.<\/p> <p> During this time, the European Central Bank was provided supplementary liquidity via long-term refinancing operations to the eurozone financial system where markets previously provided same without any problem.  The memo of understanding which was agreed with other EU states on the issue of banking was operated by the domestic standing group at a national level.  It must be stressed that national or institutional responsibilities did not change under this memorandum.  With the enormity of the financial crisis which emerged across Europe in September 2008, each member state became focused on national stabilisation measures.  As a country, Ireland was on her own.  DSG officials worked on all issues arising.  During my time as Minister for Finance, the work intensified and a liquidity group was established in early 2008 to obtain and disseminate information on liquidity developments from the main credit institutions and to identify any potential problems.  At no point during my time as Minister was it thought by the authorities that any of the banks were facing imminent solvency risks or that there was a fundamental threat to the entire financial system in Ireland.<\/p> <p> The expert advice received during this time included the OECD, European Commission and IMF, who were, in overall terms, positively disposed toward Ireland's economic and financial situation.  The relationship of the Department of Finance with the banking sector and the property sector was primarily through their federations - the Irish Banking Federation and the Construction Industry Federation.  Individual banks dealt with the Department through contact with the relevant officials.  My own interaction with banks was seldom and infrequent.  Every year the Minister for Finance would receive many pre-budget submissions in writing from economic and social actors, including the IBF and the CIF.  The main groups would be met every year by the Minister for Finance at meetings attended by officials where oral presentations would amplify the written submissions put forward.  The incumbent Minister for Finance would always be, from time to time, a guest speaker at IBF or CIF functions or an awards ceremony or whatever.  As Minister for Finance, I regarded my relationship with these two sectors as being appropriate.  Their access to the Department was in no way different from how other organisations of economic importance were dealt with.  Thank you, Chairman, and I am here to answer any questions you have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cowen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435791600,"counter":713,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Cowen, for your opening comments this morning.

There obviously are risks at all times.  In a small, open economy like Ireland, risks have to be assessed.  It is true, in the context of the work that this inquiry has to do, that there was a misjudgment of risk in relation to the banking sector, a misjudgment of risk in relation to the cross-border effects of globalised capital markets.  We weren't unique in that - that's the reason why we had a global financial crisis - but I take the point that, you know, I'm not here to suggest that all was well; otherwise we wouldn't be here in the first place.  <\/p>  <p>         But I do make the point that if you look in a balanced way at the assessments of risks, that whilst risks are mentioned in various stability reports, you also look at positives and you see what the overall assessment is.<\/p> <p> To answer your question directly, the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank had been set up in this new statutory arrangement 2003 and was bedding in, I suppose, when I arrived.

We had, for the first time, in ... probably since the history of the State, a rising population in our country.  We had overcome the historic problems of under-investment and under-employment in Ireland.

He was the guy that was dealing with me there, because there were ... it was in the context of financial stability issues.  And I've explained to you that when you look at lending growth, and I've explained it in my statement, that you look at lending growth in any year there was ... in fact, in one of the stability reports, a very interesting paper done - and I would say that in relation to these stability reports, which only began in 2004, prior to that they were incorporated in annual reports, that in fairness to the Central Bank and the regulator's office, there were always excellent and relevant papers attached to these reports by either their own staff or others in relation to certain issues.  And on lending growth, they had one actually.  And one of the things you have to remember is that the function of increasing lending growth is not just ... if you take it that prices are rising every year, year-on-year, plus you increase the numbers, the number of people who are getting mortgages increases, that dictates what your rate of growth is.  And I think it's important to point out that the research paper that sets that out ... whilst is was higher, it was higher, we were coming from a position where we had low, believe it or not, even in EU comparative terms, low occupation of population in housing, we were coming through a social change where there was no longer any inter-generational living going on.  People where you had one house would do as a family unit, was now three or four required, you get my point?  So all of that social change, the question of different types of families and all that was funding ... that was fuelling the lending growth.  But the issue that came up from the regulator was that he decided in 2007 to do something about that.  It should have been sooner, in hindsight.

The desire to portray Ireland as business friendly led, I believe, to a reluctance to introduce prescriptive rules and a particular focus on keeping costs down [and then continue a little while on] ...

That was never ... there was no licence in the public policy area for anyone to be involved in some of the practices that they were involved in.<\/p>  <p>  The problem, I agree, with principles-based legislation is that it doesn't talk about proportionality, which is fine, it does talk about flexibility, which to my mind is fine, it does talk about various other things, but it doesn't abdicate people from doing their job.  And it wasn't the case that we had set up a statutory framework where people didn't have the powers to do their job.  The job wasn't done.

I'm saying that there was another place, in Spain, where you had rules-based regulation, and you had the crash.  It's down to people implementing the frameworks they have effectively, keeping distance, being rigorous, looking at worst-case scenarios, thinking outside the box, not taking people's assurances, you know.

I don't believe that, given what is under investigation here, that there was confusion of such a nature that people couldn't do their job.  I just feel that there seems to have been a position where financial stability issues seemed to be left with the Central Bank Governor perhaps, when there was an input required from the Financial Regulator, and the Financial Regulator left to deal with individual institutions when maybe people in the Central Bank should have just let them know if they had concerns.  It seems to me that there was a separateness there that whilst understandable in terms of the statutory powers that were assigned to both bodies and despite the fact that there was an effort to have a good working relationship, it may have been the case that people didn't want to tread on other peoples' turf to the extent that maybe they otherwise would were the structure different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070200002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cowen"},{"type":"speech","time":1435791600,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>Was there an expectation that the Governor would invoke his rights under the MOU and intervene with the Financial Regulator and did any examples of that cross your desk?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070200002#W00400","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435791600,"counter":1018,"content":"<p>No examples of it crossed my desk that I am aware of but I do think yes, that there is no doubt that the macro-prudential responsibility trumps a micro-prudential responsibility any day of the week.

In December 2006, you announced a proposal for moderation ... sorry, modernisation of the legislative regulatory framework.  An advisory group was set up by the Department.

Clearly, in an issue such as this, which is quite complex and specialised, you need to have the inputs of people who are working on the front line, who understand the industry, understand where the trends of the industry are going.  So you'd have inputs from all of them.  Relating to the specific point you raise about this question of consolidating the legislation into one Act, that was, if you like, a recommendation of the McDowell report, to have a unified legal framework to underpin, if you like, effective and efficient operation of a single regulatory authority for financial services.  There was a lot of stuff coming in from the EU as well.  There was a lot of directives and things like that.  So there was a need to pull this together and to have that, if you like, as a sort of a window to potential investors in the future as to what the regulatory situation in Ireland was, to be able to communicate that in a coherent way rather than having five or six statutes all over the place and directives here and all the rest of it.  So, from an administrative clarity point of view, as well as policy clarity point of view, it was suggested that we would do it that way.  To answer your question was the tone set, I think, you know, at the end of the day, Government must take responsibility for legislative proposals it brings forward, but I believe that it's ... the principles that are set out in the wider regulation document you're talking about is again about Ireland ... it's in Ireland's interests as a small open economy to have modern frameworks, to be updated in its laws, to have legal certainty - that's an important point for potential investors - to have, if you like, a continuum of policy regardless of political changes of Government - that involves co-operation at the political level, at the Oireachtas level, to make sure people buy into the concept.  So that's all part of the democratic consideration of these things.  And ... but in a case as specialised as this, without contradicting myself, clearly, you know, the advisory forum that was set up to begin the work on doing a heads of a Bill would involve people from the industry that would be well regarded, have good reputation with the Department of Finance, working with our own draftspeople to come up with a proposal that would meet the requirements not only of today but of the future as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070200002#Z02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cowen"},{"type":"speech","time":1435791600,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>Was there an over-dependency on advisory ...

We don't have, thankfully, a class society.  We have a certain sense of community and society about us.  I believe that the social partnership model in many ways worked very well.

He says from '02 to '08, 80% of all credit growth was property-related, that by 2008, property-related lending reached 60% of the total loan book.  He describes 2004 to 2006 as a key period of high growth and that, \"net lending to the [C and P] construction and property sector increased at a compound annual rate of almost 45%, enough to treble exposure in this sector over this period\".  Now, my question, Mr. Cowen, is did you challenge the reports that you were getting and the advice you were getting from the Central Bank, the information in the financial stability report, while highlighting risks was reaching a central scenario, that ... that this would all work out fine?

Now the responsibility for whether that lending was good or bad should be laid as the responsibility of those who lent it.  We live in a market situation here.  Those lending decisions were made by bankers and Irish PLCs.  Now the question of, did I regard that as an imminent risk, I have to say I didn't regard it as an imminent risk.  That's a misjudgment of risk that has taken place.  It was basically, again, the belief that, if you look at the demographics, if you look at the increased disposable income, if you look at all of these things that you've heard before, as components in what was driving demand, that that was the reason for it.  And there was very low impairment rates on the loans.  No one without a job was getting a loan.  You know, we had a position where employment was high, prospects were good, people were optimistic about their futures, the medium-term outlook was reasonably good, people were making decisions.  And what we were doing ... what I was trying to do was, &quot;Well, look, we need to make sure that the supply side of the house gets to this point quickly because this obviously can't continue <i>ad infinitum<\/i>&quot;, and in fact that's what happened.  We got to a plateau and it started to recede.<br\/><br\/>But the problem is, Deputy McGrath, as you know, that when the financial crisis hit, we were exposed.  There's no question about that.  And the banks were exposed.  But, you know, I'll be honest and say that the 20% year-on-year increase in lending growth was probably something that, in hindsight, needed to be dealt with sooner than it was, but with interest rates reasonably low and staying reasonably low, the price in the property market ... I'd done what I could in relation to the property incentives, so far as they had a major ... People are saying in the research papers on this that attach to the stability reports, that in fact the rate of economic growth is a greater factor in the demand for housing than anything else.  So it was our success that was driving this, if you like.  People were quite confident about the future and, unfortunately, that didn't work out at the end of the day.<br\/><br\/>So, to answer your question, did I question it sufficiently?  Clearly, it wasn't questioned sufficiently and I accepted the consensus view.  I've said in my statement that I wish I were more questioning or that we looked at other scenarios.

The Minister has ... and his Government have a programme that they want to set out there and they believe what they think is the room to manoeuvre and they'll use that and do that responsibly I'm sure, from their point of view.  So that ... you know, we don't live in a technocracy here, we live in a democracy ... and you make decisions and you've to stand over those decisions.  I've explained, going into that budget same as others, first of all the pre-budget submissions treated the very same as at any other time, courteously.

I'm not going to be foolish in front of the Irish public and say it's never a consideration in an election year, now let's just be honest about it and cut the nonsense.<\/p>  <p>  By the same token I believe what we did was responsible and was required and warranted.  There were pressures, wage pressures on the economy which were very strong, a very tight labour market situation.  But I had made it clear earlier - and I made this point from ... when my budget in '05, if you want to look for consistency in my budget, it was about spreading the benefits of prosperity to as ... to more people.  People were seeing a more prosperous Ireland, they were not exactly sure where they were fitting into it.  And there were many people, including in whether they'd be in the public system or others, saying, \"You can't do that this year, you can't do that, now is not the right time.\"<\/p>  <p>  And there comes a point where you have to say, as a politician, \"What do you want to achieve here, what do you want to do, who are the people you think need to get some of the benefits of this wealth that's being created?\" And I was very clear where I stood.  I mean if you want my political philosophy it can be reduced to four straightforward rules.  Firstly, invest in education, skills and infrastructure to raise productivity to enhance competitiveness and protect prosperity.  Secondly, reduce taxes to reward work, promote enterprise and spread the burden fairly across society.  Thirdly, increase spending on services to improve the lives of our citizens, and fourthly, follow a prudent budgetary policy characterised by balanced budgets and falling debt burdens so that we can continue to spend on tax policies which will be sustainable over the longer run.

You were talking there earlier about the liquidity issue - and then I'm going to bring in Senator O'Keeffe - and you were saying that liquidity had a relationship to the difficulties that were being caused, Mr. Cowen.  However, in that regard, would you consider or accept that Irish banks were, to a much larger extent, dependent upon wholesale funding than banks in other European countries?

The demand that we were having was because we're a generation behind, demographically speaking, to Europe.  And so, therefore, what you saw in Holland and elsewhere in the '70s and '80s is something that you're seeing in Ireland today because of the demand that there was for housing at the time.  But the point ... the simple point I am making is that, you know, not since the 1920s have we had a liquidity crisis like we saw in 2008.  Not since after the Depression have we seen a liquidity crisis of that type and that there were pools ... huge pools of liquidity looking for places to go, if you like.  Cash looking ... capital looking for somewhere to go and we were a growing economy, we were an open internationalised economy, we had a banking system that was able to source those revenues and credit rating agencies put them at the very top of their rating charts.  So, you know, we are not a country that has our own natural wealth like older states who built up wealth in other ways in the past.

I'm just saying it is not... I take your point but it is not just residential mortgage debt; it's also personal debt, credit card debt.  I think that basically what you see in the experience of moving from a low wage to a high wage economy that Ireland did from the 90s up to the mid-noughties, I suppose, you have the question then, because of higher disposable income, you have also better prospects, people feeling better about it and being prepared to invest whether it is in property or whether through personal ... use credit cards, etc. ... people felt obviously that they were in a position to do this because they saw their prospects as quite positive and the horizon out over the future quite steady and quite predictable. So that's the first point.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, the economic growth was driving the credit growth.  There's no doubt about that.  When economic performance went into reverse, credit growth stopped.  So the issue is affordability, at the end of the day, and there were warnings I take it, and there were statements made by regulators and others about the need for people to be prudent, about the question of the interest rate cycle, and all this stuff.  But, at the end of the day, moral suasion doesn't necessarily change behaviour; that's why you needed, perhaps, a more interventionist model.  And it is true that the principles-based model that we had allowed this to continue.  Before an intervention was made it was probably too late in terms of the size of the debt.  So that's very much to be regretted.  But I do make the point that, because of the formation of capital in the country, the ability ... where you get access to capital if you haven't indigenous wealth in your community, if people don't have the earnings for a long enough period of time to build their own wealth, then the question of low interest rate loans becomes a very attractive option for people if they're looking for housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070200002#JJ01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cowen"},{"type":"speech","time":1435791600,"counter":1413,"content":"<p>Should you have done more?

I think there's also the question of being such an open, internationalised economy.  If you look at those who were ... who have had the biggest recessions, or the biggest contractions in the economy in the aftermath of this financial crisis, you're looking at Ireland, you're looking at Singapore, you're looking at Korea.

From August 2007 there was turmoil in the financial markets.  In September 2007, we had queues on the streets of Dublin as customers of Northern Rock sought to take out their money.  Now, in November 2007, the domestic standing group was told, and it's on a document which is on your screen now Mr. Cowen, the domestic standing group was told of a ...  an increased risk of liquidity issues arising for Irish banks into 2008, if present market conditions persisted.  There was a reference to the banks making contingency plans and there was also a reference to negative international sentiment regarding the Irish banking sector and the Irish property market generally.  So this was in November 2007.  Now, in January 2008, in a financial stability issue scoping paper, which I'll put up in a few moments, looked at a range of scenarios including an institution being illiquid but solvent, the scenario of an insolvent financial institution, it looked at an examinership process and in view of all of that Mr. Cowen, my question for you is, given the possibility - and it was clearly a distinct possibility - that a State intervention in the banking system would be required in the following months, why was it not considered to be a good idea for someone to go in and examine the underlying financial health of the institutions, given that there was a likelihood that the State was going to have to intervene?  And by that I mean look at the quality of their loan book, look at the quality of the underlying collateral or security, look at the concentration risk in property construction, why was that not done as soon as the warning flags were beginning to be waved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070200002#RR00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435791600,"counter":1503,"content":"<p>Well, I don't believe that the members of the domestic standing group believed that such an intervention would ... was likely at that point.

As you say, the liquidity issue was becoming clear, sort of in relation to ... sort of interventions the ECB were making from the time that Paribas Bank started to require liquidity, so the scenario planning you're talking about, in January, was really about setting out a sort of a work schedule and the scoping exercise was that point, what do you do now ... what sort of work do we need to be doing here.  <\/p>  <p>         One of them as you say was in relation to emergency liquidity assistance, and looking at that, as to whether that would be a tool that may be used in the future if things deteriorated or if liquidity could no longer be obtained by the Irish banking system.  And they looked at ... the Northern Rock situation obviously came into play there, and that seemed to be a strong consideration that they had.  Throughout this period unfortunately, looking back on it now, it doesn't seem to me that there was a realisation that there could be a systemic risk and that they were really talking about developing options in respect of any troubled institution rather than system, so it wasn't clear at that point ... now looking back now perhaps ... but at that point it wasn't clear that there was a need to do anything other than watch the liquidity situation through the establishment of the liquidity group and then be working on contingency scenarios in the event of an institution becoming problematic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070200002#RR00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cowen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435791600,"counter":1505,"content":"<p>Can I ask that the next document would be put up, please, and this is the January 2008 paper, which is \"Financial Stability Issues - Scoping Paper\".

So, contrary to what you've just said, the issue of financial stability, and the issue of a systemic threat to that stability, was being actively considered in January 2008.  So I go back to my very first question, which was: in light of that fact, and this was eight or nine months before the issue of a guarantee was executed as such, why did the authorities and why did you, as Minister, not insist that there would be a detailed examination of what the State may well have to take on?  You were taking on, eventually, the liabilities of banks.

Now to come to your point, should the regulatory authorities have insisted on whatever powers were available to them to go in and look and see what the situation was, maybe that's something that you've put to them already.

Once again under the housing output one there it says, ''The ESRI has highlighted the Irish economy's exposure to the high volume of house building.''  These are all, kind of, one-page documents, briefing documents.<\/p>  <p>  There is another one then that comes up.  This is a Central Bank quarterly bulletin - I think it's from 2005 -and the very last paragraph of that page makes mention to the bank, also expresses concern about ''the current high rate of house price inflation.''  And the last one then, is an OECD autumn report of 2007 economic forecasts and if you can move down mid-page there, it says, ''Nevertheless, the risks of the international outlook are skewed to the downside with the key risks including a more pronounced cooling of housing markets, the possibility of additional financial market turbulence, further upward pressure on commodity prices such as food and oil\", and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  So, as I said, these are one page briefing documents, they are issued to politicians on an ongoing basis.  Preparation for Leaders' Questions and such, maybe for a meeting with a Finance official, visiting delegation or whatever.  When you receive these notes, Mr. Cowen, would you have knowledge of the original documents that were given to you and the substantive material behind these or did you fully rely on the notes received from the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070200002#GGG00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435791600,"counter":1813,"content":"<p>No, I'd have knowledge of the documents that back those up.

But sometimes you'd be going out, you know, as Ministers do out to some ... to do something or to a meeting or go somewhere and you might end up meeting someone from the media might waiting to talk to you and you'd have some speaking notes as you travel to see what the story was.

I don't accept that.  He had a view, a strong view, in relation to that particular matter in 2003, something came to pass in 2008, and he, obviously, may feel he's vindicated in what he had to say.  My view is we need people who are able to build houses to do so in a well-planned and organised way at an affordable price for our people.  And there is no doubt that the price rise of houses from the time we became part of the euro, because of the interest rate situation, you would normally have an ability to use exchange rate policy where you're outside the euro to try and deal with that.  <\/p>  <p>         But, you know, I think that it's not right to say that people who were involved in this industry are people who, you know, shouldn't be allowed get ... do their work.

That's what we were doing.  My Government ... I've served in Governments at various times, there's never been a fear to take difficult decisions when we felt that was necessary.  We felt that the priority was to build the productive capacity of the State at that particular juncture and there was sufficient optimism and positivity about what the future economic growth prospects were to justify that.  It wasn't meant to be one that would be sustainable out into the future because you'd obviously have to adapt to a lower growth rate trend thereafter.  But its was about ... genuinely about making sure that we didn't take a view that, where the bottlenecks that were coming up in the economy were allowed to stay there ... and that would undermine your ability to compete in the future.  There comes a time, sometimes, where you just have to go and make the investments.  And we had ... you've got to remember, as I say, democratic governments have to be mindful of the legitimate expectations of their people, that we had, for various reasons in the past, not been able to consider doing things that needed to be done.  We know that this ... this society was one that was undergoing huge social change then - and it continues today - and that brings about different house formation policies that's required to meet the diverse needs of different families in our society.<br\/><br\/>So we were moving, transitioning from a low-wage to a high-wage economy.  Yes, I agree that there was an issue in relation to lending growth but that lending growth was a result of an economy driving forward.  When the crash stopped, lending stopped. But we always, you know, were of the view, that this was an opportunity that could not be missed.  And, I agree, that, you know ... and, by the way, in relation to the turnaround, we were the Government <i>in situ<\/i>that made the changes - made huge changes - at great, perhaps, difficulty for the people but it had to be done.  Because all of us ... I don't distinguish the Government I led from this or any other Government.  Every Government goes out to do its duty by its best lights based on the circumstances it's confronted with.  All of us have a hope to see the State and the country improve and I believe we are getting back onto the right track.  And it's as a result of the work of successive Governments that that happened and I'm glad - even if I'm not in power or I no longer have a political career - I'm glad that this country is getting back where it needs to get to.  But I'm also very satisfied that the Government I led took whatever decisions were necessary, regardless of what was going to be the outcome politically.  That wasn't the issue.  Things were so serious, the right thing had to be done even if it meant a heavy price had to be paid.  That's no ... it doesn't matter.  In the overall scheme of things, that's not really relevant, to be honest.  What's relevant is that we had sufficient response in our society to say, &quot;Look, if it means going back to standards of living of 2004, we'll do it.&quot;  <\/p>  <p>         If it means, because of our expenditure, our tax levels were back to 2003 levels so that we can come again in the future and progress again, that's the right thing to do and thankfully, the people, despite the hardships, could see that bigger picture - that if you didn't do it, if you delayed making these decisions, yes, the adjustment you'd have to be making would be even greater and might be even more difficult to manage.  And I think that's a lesson to be learned and as I say, I want to reiterate again that if it's a fact that any acts or omissions of mine have caused any hardship to any person in this country, I deeply regret that.  But our motive and our purpose at all times was, in fact, as I say, to see an ambitious improvement for people.  And when something like this hits, you have to change course completely.  I did my duty as I saw as best I could and I'm sure it's something that we can return to when I come back tomorrow ... next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015070200002#DDDD00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Cowen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435791600,"counter":2129,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I hope we can meet our deadline of 12 noon.  We will all strive for that.  To my mind, this is one of the most important of the amendments that I have tabled.  Its purpose is to limit the amount of time children spend on remand.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, has highlighted the general issue of remand, and that it should not be more than six months, but in the case of children it should be limited to a period of three months and, ideally, they should not be remanded at all.  The change is necessary because three months is a substantial amount of time in a child&rsquo;s lifespan.  The figures are available on the number of children who were detained, who were on remand and who ended up getting a conviction.  We have highlighted them previously.  We must factor that in as well.

I also believe that children on remand should be kept separate from children who have been convicted if that is in the best interests of the child.  People who have not been convicted previously should not be placed with others who have been convicted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015070200002#B01100","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1435831800,"counter":2183,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 proposes to insert a new provision in section 88 of the existing Children Act, which deals with the remand of children in custody.  The effect of the proposed amendment would be to impose a maximum period of remand in custody for a child of three months from the date of being remanded in custody by the court.<\/p> <p>  Section 88 of the Children Act allows that a court may remand a child in custody who is charged with or found guilty of an offence, who is being sent forward for trial or in respect of whom the court has postponed a decision.  The section in question also provides that a court shall not remand a child in custody if the only reason for so doing is that the child is in need of care or protection or the court wishes Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to assist in dealing with the case.  In addition, section 76B of the existing Act provides for the involvement of Tusla in such cases as deemed necessary by the court.<\/p> <p>  As provided for in various District Court rules, a child may be remanded in custody in the Children Court for an initial period not exceeding eight days and subsequently for an individual period not exceeding 15 days.  Children can be remanded in custody for successive periods within this framework but they are brought back before the court at regular intervals.<\/p> <p>  While there is no legislation governing the length of remand periods in the criminal Circuit Court for children, the right to an expeditious trial applies to every accused person irrespective of age.  Section 100 of the current Act provides that where a court is satisfied as to the guilt of a child, it may remand a child in custody for the purpose of preparation of any necessary reports, but for not longer than 28 days, and this period may only be extended once by a maximum of 14 days.<\/p> <p>  It is also important to note that all children remanded in custody have access to independent legal assistance.  Children remanded in custody can apply to a court to be remanded on bail at any time, and a refusal of bail can be appealed to the High Court in accordance with the Bail Act 1997.<\/p> <p>  The effect of the amendment, as drafted, would be to impose a maximum period of remand in custody of three months for all children.  That would create a blunt rule which would apply in all cases relating to children in the criminal justice system, irrespective of the circumstances where remand in custody may be considered necessary by the courts.  The creation of such an upper limit to apply in all cases would not be consistent with the operation of the existing safeguards in the courts system and would limit the scope for individual consideration of whether a child should be granted bail at any particular time.  This is a matter best left to the Judiciary in individual cases.<\/p> <p>  I would be particularly concerned in relation to the application of the proposed amendment where very serious charges may be a factor in an individual case.  One must also take into consideration the victim.  For those reasons, I do not accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015070200002#B01200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1435831800,"counter":2184,"content":"<p>The precise point is that we are speaking about people on remand, which means they have not been convicted of any crime.  We live in a state where someone is innocent until proven guilty.  The statistics compiled by the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance show that last year only 27% of the children who were remanded ended up with a conviction.  In other words, if we do not put a limit in place, we could have three out of every four who do not end up being convicted being imprisoned unnecessarily.  We must put a ceiling on the maximum period.  It is necessary to do so and so doing would focus the mind.<\/p> <p>  It has been highlighted by the IPRT that children have been remanded for breaches of bail conditions, which would be a substantial component of the children in this category.  It makes the point very well that there is no support or supervision given to children who are out on bail and they might not understand the terms.  If we addressed the issue and gave the support, then it would potentially reduce the number of children in that category.  I do not think three months is too onerous on the courts system in the context of children.

This is within the independent remit of the Judiciary but it has been the subject of commentary in our Second Stage debate.  Further progress in this area perhaps by enhanced community alternatives for the courts to not place children in custody and remand would make a significant contribution in this area.<\/p> <p>  I believe that one could argue the case both ways.  The low number of people in detention does indicate that we are trying to ensure that detention is absolutely the last resort.<\/p><p>I have asked my Department to inquire further into the possibilities in this area under the current Youth Justice Action Plan 2014 - 2018, in conjunction with other agencies in the criminal justice system.  As matters stand, section 88(10) of the existing Act already provides that children shall not be remanded in custody if the only reason for doing so is for reasons of care or protection, or for obtaining the assistance of the Child and Family Agency with the case.  We are looking at a bail support scheme and we will make provision for that when we put in our bid in the Estimates for 2016, because I acknowledge there is an issue there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015070200002#B01400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435831800,"counter":2187,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435831800,"counter":2188,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1435831800,"counter":2189,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, line 10, after &ldquo;of&rdquo;,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and by the deletion of &ldquo;as far as practicable and where it is in the interests of the child&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>This is very clear.  It is about where a remand centre is part of a children's detention school.  When children are remanded in custody to the centre the legislation as currently stands says that &quot;as far as is practicable&quot; they be kept separate from, and not allowed to associate with, children in respect of whom a period of detention is being imposed.  This amendment is to remove the term &quot;as far as practicable&quot; because it gives a little too much wriggle room to achieve an objective which, we agree, should be that they should be kept separate.  It is better to be clear about it.  I believe that we need to firmly set out that children on remand and those in detention should not be put together.  The children who are on remand may never end up with the sentence of detention, most of them do not and they may be there for other reasons.  It is entirely inappropriate to have these children in with children who have been convicted, some of serious crimes.  I believe this amendment will remove that prospect. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015070200002#C00400","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1435831800,"counter":2190,"content":"<p>With respect the issue raised was discussed in fair detail in the Seanad and on Second Stage.  Amendment No. 3 as proposed would result in a free-standing requirement that remanded children would be kept separate from sentenced children in all circumstances.  Section 88(8) of the existing Children Act 2001 deals with the issue of the separation of remand children and detention children where the remand centre is located in a children's detention school.  The existing section 88(8) outlines an important principle that where children are remanded in a remand centre situated in a children's detention school, such children shall, as far as practicable and where it is in the interests of the child, be kept separate from and not allowed to associate with children in respect of whom a period of detention is being imposed.  The effect of the proposed amendment would be to remove the reference to \"as far as practicable and where it is in the interest of the child\" from the section and would require complete separation of remand children and committal children in all instances, irrespective of whether this is possible operationally.<\/p> <p>  It should be noted that the existing children's detention schools in Oberstown tend to be full on most occasions with varying numbers of children on remand and serving a sentence at different times of the year depending on the demand for detention places from the courts system.  In line with section 88(8) every effort is made to accommodate children in custody on remand in separate residential units from children who are serving a sentence of detention.  This is an issue of professional assessment of the situation of each child and day-to-day operational management of the children's detention schools.  However, in an environment of high demand for both remand places and places for children serving a sentence it would not be possible to keep remand children and committal children separate on all occasions.  This would require a significant increase in detention accommodation.  It would also result in new accommodation, currently being built on the Oberstown campus, being insufficient to cater for all children up to the age of 18, as is currently planned.<\/p> <p>  The need to meet the requirements of the proposed amendment could also undermine the existing policy in place in all circumstances of keeping male and female children in separate residential facilities.  There are also circumstances where the separation of a remand child from committal children may not be in the child's best interests.  In addition I have been advised that there are cases where a child is remanded in custody on one set of charges but serving a sentence of detention on another set of charges.  This proposed amendment could also lead to a situation where a person would be in solitary confinement, being the only person in the place who is on remand.  I do not believe that would be in the child's best interests.  It was raised by Judge Michael Reilly  in relation to the situation at St. Patrick's where 17-year-olds on remand were sometimes there on their own.  That is a scary situation for a child to be in.  I understand the idea behind Deputy Daly's proposed amendment and I concur with the sentiment, but the practicality and the practice of it could be detrimental to the best interests of a child. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015070200002#C00500","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1435831800,"counter":2191,"content":"<p>The last point made by the Minister is the only one that I believe carries any weight.

Section 88 (2), as drafted, requires the Minister to consult the director or board of management of both remand centres involved in the proposed transfer so as to ascertain whether the transfer would be in the child's best interests or if the transfer would not be in the child's best interests whether another course of action should be adopted in respect of the child.

I have raised this matter with the Office of the Attorney General and I am advised that the inclusion of the phrase \"or if the transfer would not be in the child's best interests\" has the effect of narrowing the Minister's position to deciding \"what other\" course of action should be adopted in respect of the child, rather than \"whether another\" course of action should be adopted.

The first part is in relation to putting a ceiling on the sentencing of a child - that is, that a court may not sentence a child to more than three years in detention.  The original Children Act of 2001, before it was amended in 2006, contained an upper limit on the time a child could spend in detention and it did not permit the court to impose a sentence longer than that.  I do not know why this was taken out in 2006.  I do not see any good reason why we could not revert to what are, in reality, the more humane provisions of the 2001 Act.  We say we want prison to be about rehabilitation and helping a child in trouble.  We have seen the statistics on the types of children who end up in detention - they have difficult circumstances in their backgrounds and so on.  Three years is more than enough to work on and assist that person to be rehabilitated.  I think that what was in the 2001 Act should be maintained.  I actually think three years is a bit long.  I would revise it down to two years on Report Stage, if that were possible.  The principle is critical if we talk about prison as being about rehabilitation rather than punishment.  That is the first aspect of it.  It is the second most important amendment.<\/p> <p>  The second part of amendment No. 7 follows on from what the Minister has said about the laying down of a sentence and it proposes that that should be done in writing.  I agree with the Minister's amendments and the rationale for them, but the IPRT points out that the requirement to have a sentence in writing is a good practice to get into and I think it would complement what the Minister proposes here.  I think it would focus the Judiciary on the reasons it is handing down a custodial sentence to a child.  It would give a backup and a certain consistency in decision making if there was a written record.  I do not think it is hugely onerous - it would bring clarity and transparency to courts where children are being sentenced.  I think it would help victims and legal practitioners as well to have that in writing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015070200002#D00900","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1435831800,"counter":2206,"content":"<p>I support this amendment.

One often finds that children in these circumstances have special needs or additional needs and may suffer from mental health issues, and I think they should not be just thrown in prison for up to three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015070200002#D01000","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1435831800,"counter":2207,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 7 proposes to provide, in a new subsection (2) at section 149, that the Court shall not impose a period of detention in excess of three years and, where it imposes any period of detention, that it shall give its reasons in writing in language that is appropriate to the age and level of understanding of the child.<\/p><p>Detention is always a measure of last resort, and that is clearly set out at subsection (2) of section 96.  Subsection (4) of section 96 makes it clear that the penalty imposed on a child should be no greater than that which would be appropriate in the case of an adult who commits an offence of the same kind, and may be a lesser period.  Section 143 of the principal Act also makes it clear that a court should not make an order imposing a period of detention unless it is satisfied that detention is the only suitable way of dealing with the child.<\/p><p>The Children Act 2001 provides various safeguards in terms of detention always being a measure of last resort and the duration of any period of detention to be imposed <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>an adult, where detention is the penalty imposed on a child.  The amendment proposed imposing a limit on the period of detention of three years in all circumstances, regardless of the level of seriousness of the offence that has been committed, would not be appropriate.  In relation to the proposed amendment to provide, at section 149(2) of the Children Act, that where any period of detention is imposed on a child, the court shall give its reasons for doing so in language that is appropriate to the age and level of understanding of the child, I refer to the amendment that I accepted during the passage of the Bill in the Seanad.  In the Seanad, following consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality, I accepted an amendment to section 149(2) providing for a statement of the reasons in open court in language that is appropriate to the age and level of understanding of the child where a period of detention exceeding three years is imposed on the child.  It is important that where a lengthy period of detention is imposed on a child, the child fully understand the reasons for it.  In addition to section 149, which deals with periods of detention in excess of three years, section 143(2) provides that where an order is made for the detention of a child, the court making the order shall give its reasons for doing so in open court.Amendment No. 5, which I have brought forward, proposes an amendment to section 143 of the Act to provide for the insertion of &quot;in language that is appropriate to the age and level of understanding of the child concerned.&quot;  This will mean that where any period of detention is imposed by a court on a child, the court shall give its reasons for doing so in open court in language that is appropriate to the age and level of understanding of the child.  The amendment to section 143 will provide safeguards in terms of the reasons being stated in open court in age-appropriate language in the case of all children appearing before a court who have a period of detention imposed on them by the court.  <\/p><p>I also wish to note recommendation 33 of the recent report of the working group conducting a strategic review of penal policy.  This was published in September 2014 by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The recommendations stated that in all cases where a custodial sentence is imposed by a court, the court should set out its reasons in writing for so doing, and that this requirement be incorporated in statute.  I am advised that the recommendation in question is one of many in respect of which a high-level implementation group was recently established by the Minister for Justice and Equality to progress.  It is envisaged that this recommendation - and, indeed, all recommendations on penal reform relating to sentencing - will be the subject of consultation with the Judiciary.  This process should not be prejudiced and, therefore, I am not in a position to accept the amendment to provide that the court must give its reasons in writing.  I will continue, however, to have close co-operation with the Minister for Justice and Equality on criminal justice matters relating to children.  I am also taking measures in the Act to prevent children from progressing into the adult prison system or to reduce the number of those who do.  We have made provision for children reaching 18 that they can stay on until 18 and a half if they have not finished their education or still have further sentencing to go and they have been co-operating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015070200002#D01100","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1435831800,"counter":2208,"content":"<p>It is precisely in the context of an awareness that there are talks going on behind the scenes on the requirement to have the judgment in writing that we moved the amendment.<\/p><p>The Law Reform Commission, LRC, also recommended this.

The point of this Bill is that children will not go to prison.

As I have already stated in respect of amendment No. 5, section 149(1) implicitly makes provision for the period of detention imposed on a child to be less than that imposed upon an adult.  The only limit being imposed by section 149(1) is that the period of detention imposed on a child by a court shall not be more than the period of detention or imprisonment that could be imposed on an adult.  This does not mean that a lesser period of detention cannot be imposed on the child.<\/p> <p>  I refer to section 96(4) of the Act providing for the powers of the court in respect of child offenders.  It provides that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that which would be appropriate in the case of an adult who commits an offence of the same kind, and may be less.  The Bill is not proposing to amend section 96(4) in any way.<\/p> <p>  I do not consider the words proposed as necessary, as section 149(1) implicitly makes provision for a lesser period to be imposed on a child.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  Regarding adding the words \"The Court shall have regard to the age, level of maturity, best interests of the child and the principle of detention as a last resort in determining the nature of any penalty imposed\", the principles proposed in the amendment are already inherent in the Children Act 2001.  I refer to Part 9 of the Act, which provides for the powers of courts in terms of child offenders.  In particular, section 96 provides for the principles relating to the exercise of criminal proceedings over children.  In Part 9, section 96(3) provides that a court may take into consideration as mitigating factors a child&rsquo;s age and level of maturity in determining the nature of any penalty imposed unless the penalty is fixed by law.  Section 96(5) provides that when dealing with a child charged with an offence, a court shall have due regard to the child's best interests, the interests of the victim of the offence and the protection of society.  Section 96(2) of the principal Act provides that a period of detention should be imposed only as a measure of last resort.  Amendment No. 6, as proposed, relates to principles such as a lesser period of detention than an adult being imposed on a child and the court having regard to the age, maturity and best interests of the child and the principle of detention as a last resort.  These are already clearly provided for in the Act in section 96, which sets out the principles to be applied by a court when exercising criminal jurisdiction over children, so I am not accepting amendment No. 6.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE22015070200002#E00500","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1435831800,"counter":2214,"content":"<p>I thought we were supposed to be co-operating here and that everybody was supposed to tighten up on their contributions.

Several issues of relevance to the Department have been raised before the committee in the intervening period.  I thank the committee for its ongoing interest in these issues and the value that derives from its active involvement in dealing with them.<\/p> <p>  On 24 April the Supreme Court delivered a unanimous decision to uphold the result of the referendum on the 31st amendment of the Constitution which explicitly enshrined children&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution.  I welcome the Supreme Court&rsquo;s judgment.<\/p><p>The Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Act 2012, inserting Article 42A into the Constitution, was signed into law on 28 April 2015.  The referendum on children's rights was an important part of the Government's commitment to reorient fundamentally the way we make policy as well as the context in which we provide services for children.<\/p><p> We continue to make progress on important issues in the Government's legislative programme.  The Government approved the Committee Stage amendments to the Children First Bill 2014 in April and the Bill is now progressing through the Oireachtas.  Subject to availability of time in the Oireachtas, I hope to have this important legislation enacted before the summer recess.<\/p><p> The Children (Amendment) Bill was published on 14 May 2015.  It updates the legal framework for the detention of children, including the amalgamation of the three existing children detention schools.  Again, I hope to have this Bill enacted before the summer recess and will arrange for commencement as quickly as possible.  This will coincide with the completion of the national children's detention facility project at Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin.  We invested a further &euro;13.5 million in 2015 towards the completion of this project which, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government, will see an end to the detention of children in adult prisons.  I welcome the visit of members of the committee to see the new facilities in Oberstown on 23 June last, to which the Chairman has referred already.  I know that committee members saw at first hand the significant progress made to date and got a sense of the challenges ahead as well as the genuine efforts of all involved to address them.<\/p><p> Intensive work is continuing on the adoption (information and tracing) Bill.  I am proposing as progressive an approach as is possible within the significant legal and operational complexities that arise.  Recently I gave a set of specific proposals to the Attorney General for her consideration.  Following this, it is my intention to have the general scheme and heads of the Bill finalised as soon as possible and submitted for the consideration of Government in advance of referral to this committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p><p> The Government has recently approved some amendments to the aftercare Bill.  Work is progressing with the Parliamentary Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General and I hope to publish the Bill as soon as possible.  Work is also continuing with the Parliamentary Counsel to finalise the draft child care (preschool services) regulations, which will strengthen the regulatory and inspection powers of Tusla in respect of early years services.<\/p><p> In accordance with legislative requirements, Tusla has developed its first three-year corporate plan for 2015-2017 in response to my Department's performance framework.  The plan includes the agency's key objectives, outputs and related strategies and sets out the agency's medium-term strategy for service delivery and reform.  Tusla has continued to work to develop its services and address a number of key concerns regarding child welfare and protection services.  As Minister, I am fully supportive of the agency's implementation of a wide-ranging programme in this area.  Tusla is progressing the roll-out of national standardised business processes to promote and support consistency in the delivery of services and to improve outcomes for children and families.  Tusla will build on these initiatives in 2015 and the further necessary reform of services will continue to be a high priority.  In this regard, the committee will be particularly mindful of the issues highlighted by the agency and the Health Information and Quality Authority that arose in some parts of the country, including Laois, Offaly, Louth and Meath.  Tusla has worked intensively to address these matters by dealing with the areas of immediate concern and putting in place special measures to support good practice in future.  Naturally, there is more work to do and those in Tusla would be the first to say as much.  However, in its recent annual overview, HIQA noted evidence of improving services and good practice in children's social care in many regions.  Moreover, in the context of concerns raised about child protection services, all urgent cases referred to Tusla are dealt with immediately.  It is important to emphasise that point and HIQA has found this to be the case in its inspections.<\/p><p> The committee will be aware that for some time I have been concerned about the number of cases awaiting a dedicated social work service.  At my request, Tusla has carried out an audit of these cases and is finalising its report to me on the matter.  Action in this area along with its work on developing caseload management, standard business practices and a quality assurance strategy will help Tusla identify fully the demands on the service to enable it to meet the needs of all vulnerable children in the right way and at the right time.  It will also give Tusla and my Department strong evidence to support our efforts to secure resources in the annual Estimates process and ensure the services continue to meet the protection and welfare needs of children and families.<\/p><p> I am pleased to report on a number of important developments in the area of children and youth affairs policy over the past quarter.  I realise the joint committee is undertaking independent work in the area of affordable child care costs and that it has met all the key stakeholders.  I know officials of my Department met the committee last week to outline the approach being taken by the interdepartmental group I established on the matter and to listen to the views of the committee.  The group will report shortly and I will bring the document to Government in the next few weeks.  I will then deal with the matter as part of the Estimates process for 2016.<\/p><p> The committee may also be aware of the work in progress to agree and cost a model to meet the requirements of children with special needs in mainstream schools.  The group responsible, which includes representatives of the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Health and Education and Skills as well as relevant specialist agencies, will report in early September.  I will also deal with the associated proposals in the context of resources for 2016.<\/p><p> Since our last quarterly meeting I have launched a number of important initiatives.  On 4 June, I launched phase two of Growing Up in Ireland: The National Longitudinal Study of Children.  This second phase of the study will run from 2015 to 2019 and will be implemented by a team of researchers led by the Economic and Social Research Institute and Trinity College Dublin.  The purpose of the study is to understand the factors that contribute to or undermine the well-being of children in contemporary Irish families.  Through this, it will contribute to the setting of effective and responsive policies relating to children and to the design of services for children and families.  My Department will continue to fund and oversee this important study in association with the Central Statistics Office and the Department of Social Protection.  I am pleased the Government will continue to invest in Ireland's research and data infrastructure relating to children.  It is critical that this study is continued.  It has been invaluable in terms of the information it has given us and many researchers.  It will absolutely inform our policies in future and will assist in realising what I have always sought, that is, evidence-based policies.<\/p><p> On 17 June, I launched the National Strategy on Children and Young People's Participation in Decision-Making 2015-2020.  It is the first national strategy to give children a role in making decisions.  The strategy is intended to ensure children and young people have a voice in decision-making that affects their lives and I am proud that we are the first country to take this initiative.<\/p><p> I hope to be in a position to publish our new youth strategy soon.  An extensive process of consultation has been completed.  I know this will be an important supporting strategy as part of the national policy framework, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  I also hope to publish a new early years strategy later this year to build on the extensive commitments already contained in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.<\/p><p> We have made good progress in the initial year of implementation of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  We have a comprehensive implementation structure in place and it is working well.  We have developed an implementation plan and I look forward to presenting shortly the annual report on the first year of implementation.  A key element of implementation arises under the children and young people's services committees or CYPSCs, as they are known.  I was pleased to launch the blueprint for the development of the children and young people's services committees recently and to note the progress being made.<\/p><p> Last week, I launched Comhairle na n&Oacute;g's Let's Go Mental campaign.  This is a major new nationwide campaign designed by young people - a critical factor - to promote positive mental health among young people.  The campaign involved 31 separate events in every local authority area throughout the country, using music, sport, the arts and other activities to stress the value of positive mental health.<\/p><p> On the same day that I had the pleasure of celebrating the exuberance of youth in launching this important initiative, sadly, we stopped to commemorate the loss of six young Irish people who died in such tragic circumstances in Berkeley, San Francisco.  I imagine the committee members share the nation's sadness in this tragedy.  I offer my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and reaffirm the support of the Government for those who were injured.<\/p><p>On a different theme of remembrance, on 26 May, along with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, I met a group of primary school children to hear their ideas on how the children of the 1916 Rising should be remembered next year and to hear their view on the future of Ireland beyond 2016.  This meeting was part of a series of children's consultation events led by my Department as part of the youth and imagination strand of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme.  The children will explore what life was like in 1916, imagine what they would like for Ireland in the future and consider ways to honour the children who died during the Easter Rising.<br\/><br\/>On a separate note, I attended the EU Council of youth Ministers meeting in Brussels on 18 May last.  Ministers adopted the Council's conclusions on enhancing cross-sectorial policy co-operation to address effectively the socio-economic challenges facing young people and reinforcing youth work to ensure cohesive societies.  Along with the other youth Ministers, I participated in a public policy debate entitled Empowering young people for political participation in the democratic life of Europe<i>.  <\/i>Luxembourg presented its upcoming EU Youth Presidency programme in the field of youth for July to December 2015.  It will focus on youth empowerment, including encouragement of young people's rights, autonomy, participation and active citizenship.<br\/><br\/>We have had a busy and productive period of work since our last quarterly meeting.  I am pleased with the progress made but, as always, there remains much to be done.  I will press ahead with my priorities in the coming months.  I look forward to the committee's support, involvement and encouragement to get as much done as possible in the interests of our children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015070200002#A00400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435835700,"counter":2270,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials to the meeting.  I will commence by analysing his presentation.  The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the result of the referendum on children's rights is welcome.  I am someone who actively participated in the campaign and actively campaigned.  Now that the decision is final, I want to know who will take responsibility, or be held accountable, for the fact that material was published, at a cost of &euro;1 million, which did not concur with the McKenna principles and, as a result, has delayed implementation of the result from the vote that was held in November 2012.  Someone must pay the consequences for the publication of that material.  When we have the decision, I want to know where the legislation is to give effect to, for example, the new adoption regime for children in foster care long-term.  These children have lost two years because of a decision taken by someone, whether it was the Minister's predecessor or a senior official in the Department, to publish the document in advance of the referendum.<\/p><p>The adoption (information and tracing) Bill has been ongoing for a long time.  In October 2013, the committee held a quarterly meeting with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  On that occasion it was stated that the legislation would be published shortly and the heads of the Bill would be sent to the committee.  Unfortunately, we have never received the heads of the Bill.  Today the Minister used the phrase &quot;as soon as possible&quot; when discussing the Bill.  Can he guarantee that the legislation will be published before the term of this Government ends?  Can he guarantee that the legislation will deal with both prospective and retrospective adoptees?  Can he guarantee that all adult adoptees will have access to their birth records?<\/p><p>The draft child care (preschool) regulations were promised in the aftermath of the television programme &quot;Breach of Trust&quot; being broadcast in July 2013.  It is almost two years since the programme was broadcast and almost two years since the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Fitzgerald, issued her eight-point plan.  Unfortunately, we are still awaiting the publication of the regulations and the enactment of the new registration process.  Why?  Will the Minister give a definitive update on when this work will be done?<\/p><p>The Minister said: &quot;The committee will be aware that for some time I have been very concerned about the number of cases awaiting a dedicated social work service.&quot;  In fact, when I highlighted this matter over the past 12 months, and since the Minister assumed his portfolio, he and his predecessors said there was no issue with the number of social workers and claimed we have a full complement of social workers.  I welcome that he has belatedly come around to the fact we do not have a sufficient number of social workers.  An RTE programme that was broadcast in February 2015 identified the fast rate at which people were leaving the service.  The Minister indicated that a pilot 12-month contract was being introduced to deal with people in the service on maternity leave.  I ask him for an update on how the pilot scheme is going.  I also want to know the following, which is something I have sought in written parliamentary questions and it is very difficult to get a confirmed answer.  What target figure does the Minister have in mind for the number of social workers?<\/p><p>The next issue that the Minister mentioned was special educational needs.  Another group has been set up despite that a report entitled A Framework for Action on the Inclusion of Children with Special Educational Needs was commissioned by the Department of Education and Skills in 2012.  The report has not been implemented.  We have another group looking at a problem we already know exists.  It is amazing and bamboozling to hear the Minister say that the Secretary General of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, along with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills, will seek to gain agreement.  Have the Departments kicked responsibility for this issue from one Department to another?  I thought the formation of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs would mean responsibility for piloting and spearheading issues related to children, specifically early childhood care and education, would belong to the Department.  At this stage it is not good enough for the Minister to say he will seek to gain agreement.<\/p><p>I will revert back to the quality agenda.  Two years ago it was announced that by September 2015 all <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">staff working with children in early years services should have a minimum level 5 qualification, and team leaders in the free preschool year should have a level 6 qualification.  I asked a parliamentary question two weeks ago in reply to which the Minister said that of the staff working in the early years sector, 87% were qualified to level 5 and 50% were qualified to level 6.  If that is the case, why have we decided to kick the increased requirement under the quality agenda out by a further 12 months?  It is wrong that we have decided to do so.  There was sufficient time for this measure to be introduced.  Again, it is another stream of the eight-point plan that has yet to be implemented.  If we want quality then we should adhere to the goals and timelines, not set down by me, but by the Minister and his Department.  He has failed to adhere to the guidelines.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The next issue is child protection.  Unfortunately, the legislation to put a proper structure in place, despite the Government being four and half years in office, has yet to be enacted.  The national vetting legislation has yet to be commenced.  The Children First legislation has yet to go through all Stages in the Oireachtas.  Can the Minister give a guarantee that the Children First legislation will have gone through by the summer recess?  When will the national vetting legislation be commenced?<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  <\/font>The Minister mentioned the campaign called Let's Go Mental.  Last week Dr. Muldoon was here and he described mental health as being disjointed, having a lack of co-ordination or being unco-ordinated with calmness.  Will the Minister give an update on his opinion of the subject?<\/p><p>He also said that the reduction in staff in his office was inhibiting the work he does in ensuring children's concerns are met.  Will the Minister give an update on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015070200002#C00200","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435835700,"counter":2272,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his team.  I agree with the conclusion to his opening statement, &ldquo;We have had a busy and productive period of work since our last quarterly meeting.&rdquo;  While we have had the Children First Bill and the Children (Amendment) Bill, the adoption (tracing and information) Bill has still not been published.  The Minister and his predecessor stated it would happen shortly.  Will we see it before the end of the D&aacute;il term?<\/p> <p>  Tusla has developed its first three-year corporate plan for 2015 to 2017, which is to be welcomed.  Tusla worked intensively to address issues that arose in Laois-Offaly and Louth-Meath.  Did the re-allocation of resources and the redeployment of staff to deal with these matters mean services in other areas suffered as a consequence?  The Minister stated he is concerned about the number of cases awaiting a dedicated social work service.  The committee has been concerned about this for some time too.  Tusla has carried out an audit of these cases and is finalising its report for the Minister.  When will he have the report?<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about Tusla&rsquo;s response to parliamentary questions, which is slow.  I tabled questions in early April but I still await responses to them.  Tusla is not operating to its potential and this is an indication of some of the shortcomings in the agency.<\/p> <p>  We met the interdepartmental group on child care last week.  However, the meeting was more about how the group was constructed.  We got no indication as to budgets.  It is difficult to make recommendations when one does not know what type of budget one has.<\/p> <p>  Regarding provisions from the Government for survivors of child abuse who lived under State-paid foster care during the period 1953 to 1967, abuse which was reported by social workers and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children to the Government of the day, the Minister has stated the Government has no plans to carry out any further systemic historical reviews at this time.  He referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having a role in investigating historical abuse.  We must recognise these individuals have been failed by the State.  Accordingly, the State has a duty to investigate these acts as they happened under the State&rsquo;s watch when they were children.  It is not good enough to close the book on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015070200002#D00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1435835700,"counter":2273,"content":"<p>We will suspend the meeting until after the vote in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015070200002#D00250","speaker":"989"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435835700,"counter":2274,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 12.45 p.m. and resumed at 1.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1435835700,"counter":2275,"content":"<p>I apologise to the officials and staff for the delay as this was due to votes in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>I have a final question, on mother and baby homes.

I appreciate the work of all the staff in the Department who supported and helped the young people in organising Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and ensuring their voices got heard in their campaign Let's Go Mental.  It was very good to be part of something so positive regarding mental health.  I congratulate those concerned.<\/p><p>With regard to Oberstown, I thank the Department for facilitating the committee's visit.  The Children (Amendment) Bill is progressing.  I thank the Minister for taking my amendment on board and keeping his word on bringing forward the subsequent amendment earlier today on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>I have a concern following our visit to Oberstown in regard to the educational attainment of children there.  Some of the figures provided to Oireachtas Members were stark.  There are children who enter with a cognitive age of 14 and a literacy age of nine.  This points to wider failings in our educational system.  Perhaps we need to examine what is occurring not only at the point when children enter Oberstown but also at the steps that lead up to that point.<\/p><p>I am concerned about decisions at judicial level on where children are to be sent.  I am going to do some work on this personally.  There is anecdotal evidence that girls tend to be sent into special care rather than Oberstown.  There are only six places in Oberstown for girls.  I am concerned that if only one girl is sent there, she is effectively put into solitary confinement.  I am also concerned about the number being sent on remand.  It is an issue we might be able to explore further.<\/p><p>The Children (Amendment) Bill must be applauded.  I hope it will come into law very soon.  We had very constructive engagement with Dr. Fergal Lynch last week on child care.  I will not go back over the points made and the work of the interdepartmental group.<\/p><p>I was very concerned to hear on the news earlier in the week that the Government is considering increasing child benefit by &euro;5.  This is an incremental increase.  I would like to be giving out lots of money everywhere but believe that if there is a priority, it is to invest in services that lead to better outcomes for children.  When the cuts were being made, we were lectured &mdash; I will use that word wisely &mdash; to the effect that all the evidence proves investment is the answer.  I acknowledge that what is occurring is not in the hands of the Minister but I am concerned.<\/p><p>With regard to special needs, is the interdepartmental group considering an anticipatory model for special needs?  All the evidence shows that we should be considering this model for child care.<\/p><p>I would also like to raise the issue of child abuse material, particularly on the Internet.  I produced a considerable report on this and was delighted to see that many of my recommendations have been taken on board in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill.  Thanks to this committee, I attended the European Forum on the Rights of the Child.  The Bill uses the term &quot;child pornography&quot;.  I ask the Minister to suggest to the Minister for Justice and Equality that we call the phenomenon what it is, child abuse material, as requested by Interpol and Europol.  In some ways, the term &quot;child pornography&quot; makes one believe there is consent whereas &quot;child abuse material&quot; names it for what it is.  I ask the Minister for his support on that issue.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for his answer in regard to question No. 6, on guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.  I very much welcome the reform he is proposing and look forward to seeing the heads of the legislation.  With regard to my question on the constitutional amendment on children, I very much welcome the Minister's interpretation.  On a side note, perhaps he or somebody else can give me advice.  The President signed the legislation into law on 28 April but the Statute Book information in the Attorney General's office, with which I had been in touch, states the legislation is &quot;subject to legal challenge&quot;.  The office stated we have to wait for a reprint of the Constitution.  For that reason, I contacted the OPW, which tells me that it does not intend to reprint the Constitution for some time, or basically until the marriage equality legislation is sorted.  I have determined that we reprinted the Constitution after every other referendum, yet we decide we can wait where children are concerned.  I know this is outside the Minister's hands but I am being sent from one party to the other on the matter.  The Attorney General's statement on the website that the legislation is subject to legal challenge sends a wrong message.  It is not subject to legal challenge, it is in law and the changes need to be reflected.<\/p><p>I am very happy with the Minister's response to me on the issue I raised.  Can I presume the interpretation he has given us is shared by all Departments?  He said the amendment sets certain standards relating to determining the views and best interests of children in specified proceedings which both comprehend existing provisions and require that all future legislation must comply in the areas concerned.  My question for the Minister is on the Department of Social Protection and the Gender Recognition Bill and the issue of the voices of those under the age of 16.  During the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, children asked to be heard.  They were told by an Oireachtas committee that we do not hear from children.  I have all the documentation to show that.  The Norwegian Government announced earlier this week in heads of a Bill that it is to allow children from age seven to have their gender and identity recognised where there is parental consent.  There is a missed opportunity.  It is our first opportunity to give life to the amendment on children but we seem not to be doing it.<\/p><p>While I welcome the Minister's answer on adoption, I am waiting to see the Bill.  There are approximately 50,000 to 60,000 people who are waiting for the relevant information.  Complex constitutional issues continue to be raised but the reality, which I can state as a hobbyist genealogist, is that I can actually find out an individual's identity if I have enough money.  With enough money I can order enough birth certificates under a certain name for a given period and area to allow me to work out a mother's identity.  One could end up on somebody's doorstep asking her whether she is one's mother.  Senator Averil Power and I have been trying to prevent door-stepping, unless one has a very common name.  However, if one has a not-so-common name and enough money, one can do as I describe.  We saw how Ms Catherine Corless was able to order certificates for the babies buried in Tuam.<\/p><p>For me, the right to identity is the issue.  We talk about the right to privacy but it is about a balancing of rights; one right does not trump the other.  I continually feel the advice being given is purely accounting for the right to privacy.  Very often, if one talks to the groups of parents who gave up children, one learns some gave them up voluntarily while others gave them up without consent in the sense that we would understand &quot;consent&quot; today.  We have to push harder on the issue of adoption and ensure people have a choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015070200002#J00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1435835700,"counter":2278,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his report.

Has the Minister heard the complaint?  If so, can he tell us his view on it and why we would be taking that track?<\/p> <p>  Yesterday in Leinster House a person complained to me that a number of preschool child care providers have refused to take her two-year-old child who has a severe nut allergy and needs to use an EpiPen.

It is estimated that only approximately 20% of survivors of sexual abuse actually make contact with Tusla.  They approach other agencies or organisations to try to get support because as members are aware, they are uncomfortable, afraid, embarrassed or ashamed to make an official report in this regard.  What services or plan does the Minister have to meet the needs of people who are survivors of sexual abuse but who fall outside that or who do not make contact with Tusla, when it is known that only approximately 20% of survivors of sexual abuse actually make official contact through Tusla?<\/p> <p>  My second question pertains to a report commissioned by Tusla.  I understand its purpose was to review the transition period as a new agency and the contract to review the working of the agency was awarded to Accenture at a cost of &euro;123,000.  I would have thought such a scoping exercise and that kind of planning would have happened beforehand.  Why, if this agency is only just up and running, are reports already being commissioned, at a cost of &euro;123,000, from a company I am not sure has experience on how a good model of social care can be developed?  Perhaps I am wrong and I seek a response from the Minister.  The Minister's written answer refers to operational and management structures.  I had thought Tusla was about doing things differently.  It is only in its infancy and already, with all the management structures, the reports, the foresight and whatever we have had, reports now are being commissioned for &euro;123,000.

I wish to ask one or two questions with regard to the information given to members on foot of our visit to Oberstown.  It is an outstanding facility, albeit that all members were struck that notwithstanding the great, state-of-the-art school, the state-of-the-art building and the plans to have less segregation, more common areas, more integration and so on, it still is a detention centre.  I wish to place on record the enthusiasm, energy and commitment of the staff who were present because their energy for their roles and the jobs they carry out was infectious.  They are a great bunch of people.  Notwithstanding this, however, one point I kept going over in my head in the days afterwards was that the woman who showed us around told us the vast majority of the young people who are there come back.  They do not get rehabilitated and do not go away.  She stated it was highly unusual for them to not recognise the name or know of a person who was coming to the facility because they already are being failed in other settings.  They then enter Oberstown for three months, six months or sometimes longer; they do come back.  For all of the money that is being spent, for all of the programmes in place, as well as the enthusiasm and commitment of staff, we are still not reaching or helping whatever the difficulties are with which the young people are presenting.  As there are 90 spaces there at present, is there a long-term plan in place to only have a need for 40 or 20 spaces because of other programmes that are being used to reach people and communities?<\/p> <p>  In addition, issues were highlighted to members by the chief of staff there, in that there are ongoing human resources issues and rolling staff and roster issues with which he is not getting satisfaction.  Are negotiations with senior management from the Department ongoing to assist with those issues?  Why is the rate of sick leave still as high as it is in an institution that has such obvious commitment from the staff?  Are there ongoing issues in this regard that must be addressed?  In addition, I was amazed by the huge amount of money it costs to keep one young person there on an annual basis.  The Minister might describe and explain to members why that is, when it does not appear to be having the desired effect of not having recurring visits from some of the younger people, who appear to keep coming back to the facility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015070200002#K00700","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1435835700,"counter":2286,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their comments and questions and I will answer them as best I can.  Deputy Troy asked who will take responsibility for the material that was published and for the children's referendum.  In this regard, I emphasise the court found that the Government acted in a bona fide manner at all times.  Moreover, the Department and the Minister of the day entered into the information campaign in good faith.  The Government has accepted responsibility for what happened and there are lessons there to be learned for all subsequent referendum campaigns.  In addition, the Government made a commitment to work within the parameters of the McCrystal judgment and has done so since.  As for delays, that is a matter within the courts and as there is a separation of powers, the Government cannot very well interfere in that.  This relates to the delay in the legislation on foster care.<\/p> <p>  Many people have raised the adoption information and tracing issue.  The Department has been working on this highly complex area and I do not wish to repeat everything I have put into the written responses to the questions because I do not believe members would appreciate it.  However, I will state that a huge amount of effort, energy and work has gone into this complex area.  There is a balancing of rights, as some already have pointed out.  I want it to be as progressive as possible and more recently, my Department has put to the Attorney General a new policy position devised by one of the people in the Department.  I believe a way forward in this regard may have been found that now will allow me to expedite the Bill.  However, I cannot over-emphasise the difficulty that was involved here in respect of trying to achieve an outcome that would accommodate both the retrospective and the prospective situations alluded to.<\/p> <p>  There also is an adoption (amendment) Bill pertaining to foster care, eligibility for adoption and step-parental adoption.  I acknowledge this matter is of particular interest to some members present and it also is being worked on.  Clearly, it was also influenced by the children's referendum in some respects and is being worked on and I hope to have something on that by October.  In a small Department such as ours, with limited resources available in terms of personnel and expertise, the emphasis has focused on information and tracing.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised other issues like how many social workers are needed.  We have the Measuring the Pressure analysis and ongoing work is being done there in respect of quantifying the number of staff we will need.  We wish to consider how we use social workers, what supports can be given to them and what work can be done by other people to avoid social workers doing work that is more appropriate to less qualified people or certainly to people with different qualifications.<\/p> <p>  This relates to something else Deputy Regina Doherty raised recently, namely, the question of turnover of staff.  We have, by international standards, a good rate of turnover of social worker staff.  One cannot compare the turnover in social worker staff with nurses, doctors or others.  It is a very different type of work and is very tough work, which is not to denigrate the toughness of the other professions but when one compares them with international rates, we compare very well, particularly when we draw comparisons with the United Kingdom, America or even Australia.<\/p><p>That work goes on and we want to have a business case that we can put from Tusla to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when the Estimates process gets under way in order that we can address the issues comprehensively.<\/p><p> The Deputy said that I had said that we have plenty of social workers.

There is no question that we want more social workers.<\/p> <p>  My Department leads the special needs interdepartmental group.  This will not delay the other work, as this group is doing specific work on the needs of children with special needs in both preschool and school and examining how best to meet them.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether I will get the Children First legislation through by the summer.  It is our intention to so do and it will be subject perhaps to a little co-operation from the members.  As I said earlier in the context of the Children (Amendment) Bill 2015 and Oberstown, that are many provisions people want to add to the legislation that might be better dealt with elsewhere and I would not like the issue of perfection to get in the way of a good Bill.  I want to get this passed to end the scenario whereby children are sent to adult prisons.  Nobody agrees with that.<\/p> <p>  It is our intention to introduce the adoption information Bill before the end of the D&aacute;il term.  We have made a breakthrough, about which I am pleased, over the past few weeks and, therefore, I hope to get the heads of the Bill to the Government as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of redeployment by Tusla in Laois-Offaly and then Louth-Meath.  The officials learned many lessons from the Laois-Offaly experience and they repeated the process in Louth-Meath in a way that does not impact on the other services, from which they draw members of the special team.  In fairness to Mr. Fred McBride, the chief operations officer, he has taken personal control over these two areas and he has gone in on a regular basis.  Up until recently, we had fortnightly meetings.  We had one only a fortnight ago and we will have one again next week.  I asked for that yesterday, although that may come as news to Tusla.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that there is no indication of the budget for the interdepartmental group.  The group is to put forward a properly thought out plan to address our child care needs and how quickly or slowly we can go on the basis of how much money the Government has.  Those matters are beyond my ken.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McLellan referred to closing the book on Question No. 18.  There is no question of the book being closed.  The Garda continues to investigate these issues and any other issues that are brought to its intention.<\/p> <p>  She said Tusla is slow in answering questions.

That is something we should examine but it is an indication of \"in the past\" and I do not wish to upset any group.  We mentioned it specifically in the Bill we were discussing earlier.  In the past, there may have been a sense that the only way to protect the child was to send him to Oberstown but that is not appropriate.  A range of measures need to be taken to develop community support, bail support and so on and they are under consideration at the moment.  Measures are also required to support the Judiciary in understanding what is available to them rather than looking at this option because I am sure judges do not want to send people to detention centres if there is an alternative facility or service for them.<\/p> <p>  With regard to putting girls into special care instead of Oberstown, I do not know enough to comment on that but I will look into it.  I am reminded of the idea of putting people into solitary confinement by bringing into law practices that might be appropriate most of the time but, in certain instances, might be inappropriate.  We would then be caught by the legislation and, therefore, we must be careful about that in framing it.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the interdepartmental group and the talk about an increase in child benefit.  The international evidence points to the fact that subsidies in this regard subsidise places that give children the service, make it more affordable for parents and leave parents with choices and this needs to be examined.<\/p> <p>  I take her point about child pornography and the terminology and I will speak to Department officials about that.  I will have the language changed to \"child abuse\".  It is also a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality and I will talk to her about that.<\/p> <p>  The Senator then mentioned the Department of Social Protection and the gender Bill and the fact that the Norwegians are talking about bringing the age threshold down to seven with parental consent and other supports.  Given this matter is before the courts in respect of the referendum we had on marriage equality and that impacts on all of this, we have more time to work on this.  However, I made it clear that I was concerned at the lack of consideration of children in the Bill, as drafted.  We need to have a proper consultation with young people on this and that cannot be rushed but, on the other hand, we do not want to delay a Bill that is of such importance to so many people and forms part of our EU obligations.  We may get this into the Bill if time allows because nobody can predict what the courts will do, which goes back to our separation of powers, but, on the other hand, there are other Bills through which we might be able to accommodate these concerns in the autumn.<\/p> <p>  With regard to balance and ensuring choice, I touched on the adoption information and tracing Bill and I am much more optimistic than I was when we spoke a number of months ago because we had hit an impasse that would have caused tremendous angst for many people.  I think we have found a mechanism to get around that and I look forward to progressing the legislation.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor referred to education and Tusla inspections.  It has been a concern from the outset that officials would conduct the inspections in a way that would cause the least disruption.  We do not want inspections every second week with different people coming in; we want to streamline the process and we are working on that.<\/p> <p>  She referred to a two year old with an allergy who is having difficulty accessing preschool.  I acknowledge the Chairman said that can be dealt with this week when the HSE appears before the committee but we could have a look at this.  There are enough barriers to young children accessing preschool services, even though we have an excellent ECCE programme.  We do not want children like this becoming a problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015070200002#L00500","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1435835700,"counter":2292,"content":"<p>I support Deputy Mitchell O'Connor because the State does not have a policy on the issue and there is no cross-sectoral approach to anaphylactic shock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015070200002#L00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1435835700,"counter":2293,"content":"<p>Early Childhood Ireland has a policy in this regard-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015070200002#L00700","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1435835700,"counter":2294,"content":"<p>I am referring to a joined-up approach.

There is a specific reason for it.  It is a young agency which brings together three previously separate organisations in one agency and it is a challenge.  Tusla is focused on the need to address legacy issues arising from its three parent organisations, including the inherited structure from the HSE and we all know how complex that was.  It also needs to address the challenges posed by the development of new services against a backdrop of an increasing demand for its services.  To address these issues and initiate a review project to examine the agency's current structures and how it operates, Accenture was engaged to assist with the project in September 2014.  It came to an end in December 2014 with a draft high level operating model review report.  Changes are proposed on how the organisation is structured to better support the delivery of services to children and families.  I will not read all of the long note I have been given.  The bottom line is that it is a new agency which brings three agencies together.  There are opportunities to do things in a far more cohesive, coherent and more effective way to better deliver for children and their parents.

From that point onwards it is a separate issue but it is also the same, if the Deputy knows what I mean, in the sense that under Children First people will be mandated to inform Tusla.  There are adults who are suffering because of events that occurred in the past.  We have to protect children.  We also have to satisfy ourselves, through Tusla, that anybody reported as being an abuser by an a adult - if this is not too convoluted - is not a risk to children.

We covered this issue in the Children (Amendment) Bill 2015.  One can say only 25% of children approximately on remand, although it might be 27%, end up in detention.
