It is a privilege for me, on behalf of the institute, to have the opportunity to meet the committee today.  I will give a short overview of the general spread of work of the institute for those members who may not be familiar with us, although I know several are.<\/p> <p>We will be happy to take questions or provide further detail on some of the topic areas I will cover rapidly.  <\/p><p> The institute is a statutory body with key functions spanning what we generally understand as fishery science, advice to the Government on the environment, food safety issues, scientific and oceanographic services and understanding the marine ecosystem.  One unit focuses on shipping and maritime development services and is responsible to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and a corporate services function.  We provide five key families of services for the Government, including scientific advice; monitoring and assessment services; preparation of strategic research planning and policy advice for the Government related to the marine.  We manage and operate key national marine science infrastructure, including research vessels, unmanned submarines and data buoy networks.  We conduct research and have succeeded very well in winning significant earnings from foreign competitive research programmes that provide substantial employment.  We also fund research and design and advise the Government on funding programmes related to marine areas both by us and in conjunction with other Government parties.  That is a very substantial part of our work to which I will allude in the presentation.  A very important area of our work is mapping the seabed because more than 90% of our territory is land under the Atlantic Ocean.<\/p><p> We have a broad budget of &euro;25 million in grants from the Government and an additional &euro;11 million from sources such as competitive EU research programmes, while approximately 30% and above of our turnover is generated by non-voted income from the Government.  <\/p><p> One of our key areas of service which has a very long track record in the Marine Institute and prior to its establishment is fishery science advice.  Fisheries are living through a rapid change process, as many committee members are aware, through the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy which was secured during the Irish Presidency of the European Union.  Ireland sits on some of the richest fisheries in all of the European Union.  Approximately 1 million tonnes of fish are captured every year, with a value of &euro;1.2 billion.  Ireland's share of these fishing opportunities represents approximately 23% by tonnage and 17% by value.  The Marine Institute works with international groups providing independent scientific advice for the management structure for the Common Fisheries Policy, a partnership between the Commission and member states.  We provide annually the most comprehensive stock book showing the state of stocks in the Irish territories of relevance to Ireland.  This is formulated in partnership with international scientists, but it is the envy of many countries in Europe because of the information it has provided for almost 20 years to successive Governments to negotiate on behalf of the State in the management of fish resources.  The new Common Fisheries Policy will require significant development of science capacity and knowledge of the ecosystem approach and I am confident that the Marine Institute is well equipped to meet that challenge and has funded significant research to back it up.<\/p><p> In addition, we provide a wide range of services related to environmental food safety and the conditions within which the marine food produced within this country, 90% of which is exported, can access the market and have a good competitive standing for that business.  Our services include food safety monitoring in conjunction with national and international food safety authorities.  In 2011 we had a major success when, after several years of research, Ireland led the way in changing the regulatory monitoring programme EU-wide, moving away from mouse bio-assays to very sophisticated chemical analysis.  That research was started and is conducted in the Marine Institute and we brought the regulatory authorities across Europe to a new regime which was signed off on by all stakeholders, regulatory authorities, governments and the Commission.  That is a demonstration of the scientific calibre and capability within our teams.  Fish health licensing support and advice, sea lice monitoring and research in all of these service areas are particularly important.<\/p><p> A matter of note which has featured in the newspapers this year concerns harmful algal blooms and their natural occurrence.  In 2011 we started a significant research project for national funding and succeeded in winning a large EU award.  Earlier this year that project, AZIMUTH, received the highest accolade of the COPERNICUS award for best earth-monitoring service in the European Union.  This involves the ability to use ocean observation satellite monitoring to generate a predictive capacity for when there might be or might about to be harmful algal bloom to assist shellfish farmers in preparing for and managing their stock around that event which occurs naturally but is not easily predicted.<\/p><p> A new and emerging area of great significance and importance to Ireland and the global marketplace is where ICT meets the ocean.  Ireland can really succeed because our industrial complex research expertise built up in universities can be applied in marine business opportunities, from fisheries to renewable energy and ocean energy development, through monitoring the ocean.  The ocean to the west of us is strategically important not only to Europe but also to the world in order to understand climate change which we can study with new technology, new eyes.  Ireland is very much to the forefront in Europe in the design of programmes to do this, working with multinationals and SMEs across the country and a range of university groups.  This is an area that I believe will bear great fruit for Ireland.<\/p><p> Seachange is the name of the research funding programme for the period 2007 to 2014.  Through it the Marine Institute has sequentially invested up to &euro;60 million in creating new teams with expertise in areas such as computing, ICT, modelling sensor technologies, ecosystem approaches to fisheries biotechnology and bio-discovery.  We have also catalysed the ability of other funding agencies and drawn in science funding from other bodies that would not traditionally have regarded the marine as an important area.  We have been very successful, with several Irish universities, in winning record levels of EU funding in recent years.  That funding has exceeded &euro;60 million from all sources, which would rank the marine as the sixth largest funding area in the European funding programmes in the period of the seventh framework programme.  It has created and supported over 150 jobs and there will be over 200 jobs before the programme is over.  In the next seven years several hundred jobs will be created.  These are jobs for graduates, like my son in Australia.  The first job presents a significant opportunity in science and engineering and we are confident that these opportunities can be created through externally won resources in Ireland.  This, to all intents and purposes, is like an export of services and generated on the basis of investments made wisely in Ireland, a capacity built in the past 20 years that has eliminated our deficit in that space and enabled us to compete with the best in the world in marine science and engineering.<\/p><p> Over 90% of Irish sovereign territory, over 200 million acres, is underneath the Atlantic Ocean.  It is incredibly important for us to be competitive in the science, knowledge and ability to generate wide uses, prudent planning for and the ability to generate the socio-economic potential of that resource.  Members may have read in the newspapers this morning about the discovery of a new biotope, as it was called, located in the south west corner almost at a 45&deg; angle from the border between County Kerry and County Cork on what is a vertical cliff of over 700 m discovered by the Irish research vessel, <i>Celtic Explorer<\/i>, using an unmanned submarine called <i>John Holland<\/i>, with a team of researchers led from NUI Galway in collaboration with Queen's University, Belfast and international partners.<\/p> <p>This is a revolutionary discovery, details of which are published today, but the funding for that work was commenced in 2011.  The team which created that knowledge was aided by funding from the Marine Institute the previous year by means of the Beaufort award for biodiscovery.  These unique habitats in deep high pressure environments house significant opportunities for development of pharmaceutical and medical applications.  The mix of animals is unique such as oysters at a depth of 700 m, other shellfish and a mix of corals that could be centuries old.  This is a very significant discovery.  The knowledge it will create will be capable of winning and creating jobs in Ireland in the years ahead.  <\/p><p> The seabed survey is the largest civilian underwater mapping project in the world.  Ireland is at the forefront of this sphere of activity and we are executing the project in co-operation with the Geological Survey of Ireland.  The European Commission has cited the project as the exemplar of how to map a nation's territory.  Commissioner Damanaki wants this method of mapping of territory to be adopted by other European states.<\/p><p> I could show the committee images from 15 years ago when Ireland was &quot;out-invested&quot; by a ratio of 40:1 in mapping the knowledge and also in the science and information on fish stocks in these territories.  We have moved from that behind-the-ball scenario to the current position where Ireland is conducting nearly 60% of the research in our sovereign territory.  That is a massive turnaround of the equation in Ireland's favour in that time.  The two research vessels operated by the Marine Institute have been fundamental to that achievement.<\/p><p> Members will be aware that the Government has created a horizontal mechanism across government to enable policies to be developed more cohesively.  It is a common problem in all European and international nations that many elements of the marine portfolio are housed in some administrations in up to 12 Departments - across eight in our case.  The horizontal mechanism aims to join these areas as best as possible against the reality of vertical management in Departments.  The quarterly reports on the implementation of this plan are available on our website, <i>www.ouroceanwealth.ie<\/i>.  An annual report will be issued in 2014, with plans for an annual conference, showing the progress achieved by Ireland in this area.  I emphasise that during the Irish Presidency the horizontal mechanism which is supported by the Marine Institute enabled Ireland to present to Europe far-reaching and leading positions in terms of the application of science and knowledge to marine resource development.  During the Presidency it resulted in the Atlantic plan, with integrated maritime policy being agreed to and deemed a success.  It has resulted in significant funding opportunities which will be announced in Horizon 2020 - a funding programme of &euro;72 billion from the European Commission for the next seven years.  The capacities being built in Ireland are very well aligned and targeted to take advantage of these competitive funding opportunities.  We have been investing in capacity-building for the past seven years in order to position ourselves well and we have significantly influenced the direction of Europe's Atlantic policy.  We had a tremendous success at the end of May in having the joint agreement negotiated between the European Union, Canada and the United States on a transatlantic ocean research alliance, signed in Galway and witnessed by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.  This achievement was greatly assisted by Irish diplomacy during the Irish Presidency.  This augurs well for bilateral agreements with both the United States and Canada and also in the context of broader EU collaborations.  The funding package for Horizon 2020 will be voted on this week in the European Parliament and announced in December.  We are confident that it will greatly benefit competitive proposals from Ireland.<\/p><p> I brought with me a three minute clip from National Geographic which I thought would be of great interest to the committee.  I must apologise, but, unfortunately, the system here is unable to run it in the time available.  I guarantee it would be three minutes well spent if the members were to watch the CD.  It shows the Irish national research vessel travelling halfway between Ireland and the United States to a site halfway between the Azores and Iceland.  On that part of the Atlantic sea floor that splits apart by the height of a man in a lifetime new rocks from volcanic activity have been created.  For the first time, in July 2011, a team of scientists from Cork, Galway, the Geological Survey of Ireland and a UK team from Southampton made a discovery of hydro-thermal vents in the area.  This was from the Irish research vessel, which is funded by the Marine Institute, in deploying an Irish unmanned submarine down a mountain face 3 km deep in the middle of the Atlantic to discover these black smokers, which are pillars of rock - new volcanic rock - up to 40 m high.  It has been named the Moytura field which comes from the plain of the pillars in Irish mythology.  These pillars produce black smokers which look, to all intents and purposes, like smoke, but it is actually water at up to 400 degrees centigrade.  It is black and enriched with methane and sulfides that would be toxic to 98% of life on the planet.  However, the area contains a huge life system which survives at these temperatures and toxicities.  The system is very important in understanding how the ocean works and also for new pharmaceutical, medical and biotechnological applications.  This was an Irish team demonstrating its ability, with Irish infrastructure, to conduct world-class ocean research.  This achievement was broadcast globally by National Geographic in late 2012.<\/p><p> I hope I have not exceeded my time allocation in making this presentation.  The Marine Institute is very positive about the potential for Ireland to generate new income, as well as socioeconomic and environmental benefits through understanding the oceans.  I am happy to take questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900003#B00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Heffernan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384870800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Heffernan for his presentation and commend him for his enthusiasm for the work of the staff of the Marine Institute.  Once again, I regret the &euro;1 billion contribution, in the form of free fish, as shown on slide No. 3, which we give to our European partners every year and which is not recognised.  As a member of the European Union for 40 years, we have now made a contribution of &euro;40 billion in today's money.  This is often not recognised when people talk about what we get from the European Union.  It is never too late to recognise that we also make a significant contribution in kind to it.<\/p><p>  Dr. Heffernan has provided some of the answers on what is the issue for the committee.  Relative to how other countries carry out research on the poly-use of ocean energy and marine life and plants, how does our investment rate in this very important sector, taking account of the size of our territory?  What are the most important issues on which the Government could provide assistance for the Marine Institute?  What should we do to help the institute in its work to develop the potential of the oceans?  Would further investment reap long-term dividends in terms of economic development?

The images from the depths are dramatic.  The Marine Institute's vessels are no strangers to my community in Castletownbere and it is a huge source of pride to see the research vessels <i>Celtic Explorer<\/i> and <i>Celtic Voyager<\/i> tied up in the port.  The significant increase in investment in the institute is money well spent, although I am sure Dr. Heffernan will say additional funding is always needed.<\/p><p>  The economic impact of the marine environment is core to the institute's work, which includes its assessment of the Natura 2000 sites along the coast.  I understand up to 80% of our exploitable sites are Natura 2000 sites.  Will Dr. Heffernan indicate whether there is or could possibly be a resource issue in this regard within the Marine Institute?  From the institute's own assessment, as indicated at a recent conference, the most it is getting through is four or five sites per annum.  This should be seen in a context where there are in the region of 50 or 60 bays to get through.  This is a significant inhibiting factor in developing any type of reasonable aquaculture industry.  Certainly, it would be expected from all sides, whether one is for or against aquaculture, that the most up-to-date information on the economic impact of this and other industries which impact on the Natura 2000 sites would be published.  Getting though only four or five per year is perhaps suggestive of an overly cautious approach.  It certainly seems far too slow.  I am not blaming the institute for this, but I do wonder whether it is a resource issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900006#E00400","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384871400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank members for their questions.  With regard to the relative distribution of the share of fisheries resources, the allocation of the shared pie under the Common Fisheries Policy is relatively stable and not generally up for substantial renegotiation.  Having said that, I have made a pledge to every Minister I have served that investing in science will give them a strong suit in the context of the negotiations process.  I have never had a Minister complain about the quality of the sciencific advice and tools they were given as they went in to negotiate.  That is the best answer I can give to that question.<\/p><p>  Several members asked about resources and whether more were required.  It would be a rare chief executive officer who would deny more resources would not be very helpful.  I am cognisant, however, of the reality of the economic crisis the nation is going through.  In the context in which we find ourselves, the commitment to maintain science investments across the board has, relatively speaking, been strong.  We have had reductions in our budget, in common with other relatively similar organisations, and it has challenged us greatly in terms of our ability as an organisation to adapt.  We have maintained our full family of front-line services against the backdrop of a requirement to drive efficiencies.  We have suffered staff losses and budget cuts, but I am confident that we can turn a corner in the period ahead and continue to increase our proportion of earnings from international sources.  It is a matter of pride for us that the vessels Deputy Noel Harrington mentioned not only are of great service to the State but have also assisted us in meeting the challenge of the fiscal crisis by generating solid income for the institute, thus helping to minimise the cost of the economic downturn in recent years.  We have, for instance, developed charter arrangements with governments in Germany, Newfoundland and Labrador that have worked very well for all parties.<\/p><p>  We will in the next quarter be renewing the research plan for the period 2014 to 2020.  Members mentioned ICT, biotechnology and ocean energy as areas that have been prioritised.  We intend to maintain that prioritisation because they are areas in which a sustained effort and cumulative build-up of capacity will have a significant payback for the State.  Where ICT and biotechnology can be applied in the ocean sphere is where we can get a real routing of these multinational capacities in Ireland.  We are not going to helicopter out the resources at the Goban Spur.  There is great potential in that special mix, which is possible on a small island, which sees a cluster effect of large multinationals engaging with small Irish companies.  It is a significant advantage to be able to get all of these people in one room, as we do annually with more than 80 companies.  I am very heartened that the research prioritisation exercise has given a higher priority than ever before in the history of the State to marine areas, something we have advocated for the past 20 years.<\/p><p>  It was particularly encouraging to hear the director general of Science Foundation Ireland state at a recent conference that ocean energy was a potential game changer economically for the country.  The announcement by SFI last week of funding of more than &euro;29 million for a research centre builds on a programme of earlier investments by the Marine Institute and our development of a strategy in this area.  Wave energy will be the most significant element of energy generation in this country in the long term, with offshore wind energy being the main aspect in the near term.<\/p> <p>In Ireland wave energy will be the biggest component in the long term, offshore wind energy will be the biggest in the near term, and a smaller component of tidal energy resources, particularly on the east coast, areas of the Shannon and off the coast of Northern Ireland, are particularly promising.  We must have the confidence and perseverance to sustain the investment in ocean energy to reap the reward.  Uniquely on this planet, Ireland, together with Scotland, has the greatest natural advantage in wave energy anywhere in the world.  A former Secretary of Energy in the US, a Nobel laureate, Dr. Chu, said to me on a recent visit that, for Ireland, ocean energy is a no-brainer while for America, it is one for only a few states.  This is a unique opportunity for us.  It will take a level of scientific endeavour, commitment and investment to make it pay off but I would strongly advocate that we continue with the plan in this area.<\/p><p> With regard to the discovery at the Goban Spur, I do not want in any way to steal the glory from the scientists from NUIG, who made the recent discovery on the ships with partners from other areas.  This finding is very important on two fronts.  It shows that an Irish-led expedition can make such a discovery.  It is a discovery of a new area of intense life on a vertical cliff face and it needs to be further developed.  This was a first expeditionary study and more follow-up work is required to map the extent of that type of life form and its distribution and that will be done.   The area of biotechnology in terms of ocean energy has a medium to long-term economic payback but we have a lot territory and it is well worth our while to sustain the effort in that area.  <\/p><p> Moving on to the shipping and transport area, a study by our IMDO and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland of the service industries and ports' opportunities to service an emerging wind energy and ocean energy offshore component was carried out in the past year and I can provide that to the secretariat.  That work has been done.  There is not currently a study in Ireland on RAS in terms of sea lice as a natural predator but it is one of the areas that has been suggested to us should be examined in the next phase of our research funding, starting in 2014 and beyond.  We will engage in a public consultation process in order that all interested parties can identify from their perspective the areas that should receive a research focus and we will take those into consideration in crafting where we apply the available resources in the years 2014 to 2020.<\/p><p> The explorer and voyager vessels have had many very positive experiences of docking and getting services in Castletownbere.  We have survived economically really okay through the downturn, compensated by our ability to adapt and generate income internationally.  We now have a greater ability to compete in Europe and have the flexibility to employ people based on resources, one of which is from a source that is a very significant element of our business model.  We have been given that sanction in recent months which unlocks one of our hands in competing in European context.  I can complain and advocate for resources but I am mindful of the words of a mentor of mine in America who imparted to me the guiding principle that he never heard anyone whine their way to success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Heffernan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384872000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Deputy Harrington also asked about the Natura sites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900007#F00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1384872000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Can we expect greater effort to be made on the process of evaluating and assessing or completing the designation of those Natura sites?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900007#F00300","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384872000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I apologise for having overlooked that question.

That meant undertaking the most intensive data gathering and surveying and resurveying, as required, over the last three-year period.  To be fair to the Departments involved, even in the economic downturn, they found resources, additional to the voted income to the institute, to fund that work.  We have, through a combination of in-house capacity and outsourced work, executed a three-year intensive roadmap to gather the information.  That data gathering exercise will be completed this year.  To the best of my knowledge, as of the end this year there will be bays with conservation appropriate assessments for up to 200 licences and by the first quarter of next year we will have close to 300 licences in areas with appropriate assessments.  The really hard catch-up work at the outset will be completed this year and that will enable the system to move forward.

During the course of evidence gathering, we visited Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands where there are a number of research sites.  A number of international companies are operating a variety of different technologies.  I understand that this technology is at a very embryonic stage.  The comparison put to us was that they were at the stage the Wright brothers were at in terms of aviation development.  The technology in this respect is that far back.  Two questions arose during that visit, one related to the siting of the research centre in Belmullet and it was pointed out that it was the wrong place because the waves were too high to give a proper assessment and it was suggested that Fenit in Kerry would be a much more acceptable site.  I do not know whether that issue has come up in the course of discussions.<\/p><p>  The other question that arose related to co-operation in this area between the UK and Ireland.  We do not seem to be co-operating as much perhaps as we should be, at least that was a perception.  The assembly is focusing very much on our experience at Kirkwall, where five international companies are involved.  As Dr. Heffernan said, the Irish location is a no-brainer because we have the most sustainable and most potentially lucrative wave energy resource in the world.  I am curious as to what relationship, if any, there is between the Marine Institute and those various bodies and particularly about the UK experience in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900007#F01000","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384872000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>We are working closely with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.<\/p> <p>We seconded one of our leading experts to help develop the ocean energy development plan.  There are three elements involved in going from an idea on a lab bench out to a full-scale device and the infrastructure there has been built up as per the strategy.  We have a world-class centre being fully developed in Ringaskiddy in Cork as part of the collaboration between the Naval Service, Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, and University College Cork, UCC.  That has received a substantial amount of funding through Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, building on a decade of funding from the institute.  There is a full test laboratory for modelling, designing and working with innovators and inventors.  It is world class.  The next step is quarter scale.  The site is up and running in Galway Bay and will be enhanced and improved next year with the deployment of a broadband cable and new sensor technologies all around the devices to do such things as measure sound from the devices and to understand the environmental interplay.<\/p><p> The third key element as part of the strategy designed was to have a full-scale test site available and connected to the grid to really test the devices when they are gone from a lab set up in Cork to a relatively sheltered site.  If I am not mistaken, on that site we have had waves of up to 7 m, 8 m and beyond in Galway Bay so they are getting a pretty good quarter scale test.  Anywhere on the west coast gives one a good test.  Even though I am a Mayo man and there is nothing between Mayo and Fenit in the context of the Belmullet site, a comprehensive study was carried out by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to look at potential sites for the full-scale test site and, all things considered, Belmullet was chosen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900007#F01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Heffernan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384872600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Has Dr. Heffernan heard any criticism of the decision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900008#G00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384872600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I have not heard any.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Heffernan"},{"type":"speech","time":1384872600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>It has been said that the height of the waves is much too high for the type of technology that is currently under way.

The Orkneys have what is still a very remote location and it is up and running but the combined package in Ireland will in time prove itself to be very competitive.  I am impressed with the speed with which the Scottish authorities moved in the early stages.  I compliment them on that.  I see many opportunities for this to become an agenda item for the Irish-UK council because there is tremendous mutual interest in this area.  They have a similar resource capacity.  Both of us have the potential to be exporters of this energy.  If it is captured it is beyond the consumption capacity of this island to take all the renewable energy that could be produced.

Over the next 15 minutes or so, we wish to provide the joint committee with an overview of our business as it is today, to review the highlights of our performance in 2012, to preview the outlook for 2013 and beyond and to provide an insight into our future strategy for the business.  Coillte has been granted stewardship over two valuable resources, namely, 7% of the land area of Ireland and a wood fibre basket of 2.5 million cu. m per annum.  Our aim is to add value to these two resources for the benefit of the State through the five businesses in which we already have a strong competitive position.  Our forestry and panel products businesses are focused on adding value to Coillte's wood fibre resource and our wind, telecommunications and property businesses are focused on adding value to Coillte's land resource.  As members can see from the map on the third slide in our presentation, Coillte has a countrywide presence.  It has plantations in each of the Twenty-six Counties in Ireland and it directly employs approximately 1,000 people.  In broader terms, the forestry and forest products sector in Ireland contributed &euro;2.2 billion to the economy in 2012 and employs approximately 12,000 people, primarily in rural locations.<\/p><p>  Coillte is the principal supplier of logs to a highly efficient export-orientated wood processing sector, comprising sawmills and panel mills.  Our forests are certified as being sustainably managed by the Forest Stewardship Council and have been for more than ten years.  In 2012, we sold 2.3 million cu. m of round wood, primarily to the wood processing sector.  Since the collapse of the construction sector in Ireland, our sawmill customers have transformed their businesses and now export two thirds of their output, primarily into the United Kingdom market while in contrast, in 2007 two thirds of their output was sold in Ireland.  In recent years, Coillte has been working actively with its sawmill customers and Enterprise Ireland to promote Irish timber at the Timber Expo event in the United Kingdom.  Over the past five years, the Irish sawmills have been highly successful, in so far as they have increased their share of United Kingdom market and have almost doubled it to 6.5% of the sizeable market.<\/p><p>  Coillte also is an exporter of innovative and sustainable wood-panel products.  It owns two panel mills, namely, SmartPly in Belview Port, County Kilkenny, and Medite in Clonmel, County Tipperary.  These businesses employ 300 people directly and approximately 400 to 500 indirectly, most of which jobs are located in the south east.  Our panel products are used in construction, packaging, furniture, flooring and a range of other uses.  We export more than 90% of output to more than 32 countries across the globe via our sales teams based in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.  We see significant opportunities for growth in demand for our panel products due to the increasing focus on both the energy efficiency of buildings and the sustainability credentials of building products.  Our panel businesses have a deeply embedded innovation culture and we have developed a strong pipeline of new products.  In 2012, we were the winners of the supreme innovation award at the Timber Expo for our new waterproof medium-density fibreboard, MDF, product, which is called Medite Tricoya.<\/p><p>  We are supporting the achievement of national renewable energy targets.  By 2020, the Government's objective is that 40% of electricity generation will be from renewable sources.  Due to the nature of our land bank - we have elevated sites with strong wind regimes and good road access - Coillte is playing a leading role in supporting the delivery of Ireland's renewable energy targets.  We  have a successful track record in the delivery of wind energy projects.  We have a pipeline of more than 300 MW with full planning consent across Ireland, which has been developed over the past five to ten years.  Moreover, we have been successful by taking a considered and measured approach to wind projects, founded on our strong track record in community relations.  Our strategy is to develop our pipeline of wind projects in partnership with key industry players.<\/p> <p>Three of our leading projects are co-developments with the ESB and a further one is a co-development with SSE.  We are also a provider of sites, rights of way and wayleaves to a range of third-party developers in the wind energy sector.  Over 20% of installed capacity in Ireland is on lands formerly owned by Coillte.<\/p><p> We are also connecting rural communities.  We have been leasing land to telecommunications companies to host mast sites in rural locations for over 15 years.  Our leased rental model reflects the intensity of the usage of a site by a telecommunications company.  Our telecommunications business manages over 400 mast locations on the Coillte estates.  Most of the masts are owned and maintained by the four mobile telephone operators - Vodafone, O2, Meteor and 3.  In recent years, in partnership with BT, we have built over 100 masts in our sites to enable roll-out of rural broadband via the national broadband scheme.  We also recently received planning permission for a new mast on Three Rock in Dublin which will result in the removal of three of the existing masts, which will consolidate onto the new one.  We have also begun delivering fibre-optic capability to key masts in rural locations, the first being in Castlerea, County Roscommon, to enable the roll-out of next generation networks.<\/p><p> Coillte is also actively supporting the provision of infrastructure to enable growth and economic recovery.  For example, in recent times our property business has sold land to Irish Distillers to enable it to increase its whiskey storage facilities near Midleton and to Grant and Sons in Tullamore to enable it to build a new Tullamore Dew distillery there, and we have recently signed an agreement with film and television location specialists, O'Carroll Mulhern Services, to market Coillte properties for film, television and event business.  We also regularly sell small parcels of land to facilitate sporting and local community projects.<\/p><p> We not only deliver economic returns, but are Ireland's leading supplier of outdoor recreation facilities.  We have 80 million visits annually to our 150 recreation sites across the country.  We have ten forest parks, including the successful development in Lough Key in partnership with Roscommon County Council.  We have constructed four national mountain bike trail networks, including a international-class trail in the Ballyhoura Mountains in County Cork.  We support over 1,600 km of dedicated trails on our lands, many of which are leading waymarked routes such as the Wicklow Way.<\/p><p> We are actively supporting the provision of new tourism offerings for Ireland, for example, the Nephin Wilderness Project, which is a joint development with Mayo County Council and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which was launched by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, in May of this year, and the development of an interpretative centre and trail facilities at the Cavan Bureen Geopark, which is a joint development with Cavan County Council that we launched in August 2013.  Some 20% of our estate is managed primarily for biodiversity and nature conservation.  In total, we are providing public goods for the Irish people with a value estimated at &euro;500 million per annum.<\/p><p> We were proud in June of this year to receive external validation for our performance when we overcame tough competition from other exemplars of best business practice across Europe.  In all, there were 15,000 participants across ten different categories and we won the European Business Award for Environmental and Corporate Sustainability.  According to the judges, Coillte shone across the board in its dedication to sustainability, the environment and its local community.  It was seen as an innovator in new products and also demonstrated strong leadership in delivering positive results across its social, economic and environmental objectives.  The judges went on to state that this year's winner has shown an impressive commitment to ensuring that the environment it owns is not only protected and preserved, but open to everyone in the community to enjoy.  We were particularly honoured to be recognised in this category as environmental and corporate sustainability is at the heart of who Coillte is and what we do.  I have worked in Coillte for 21 years.  The people of Coillte, through their behaviour day in, day out, sustain and build on these high standards of environmental and corporate sustainability.  They believe in it and have built it in to the fabric of what we do.<\/p><p> I will turn briefly to the 2012 highlights.  In terms of our financial performance, we delivered an operating profit before exceptional items of &euro;35 million in 2012 on turnover of &euro;262 million.  We believe that it was a good result in the context of the five or six years of recessionary market environment that we have been through.  We paid a dividend of &euro;2 million to the shareholder in 2012.<\/p><p> We exported, as I stated, our wood panel products to over 30 countries.  We launched a number of new products, not only Medite Tricoya but also an OSB product called ToughPly which is a substitute for non-sustainable tropical plywood.  We also celebrated ten years of FSC certification in 2012 and we planted 15 million trees on approximately 6,000 hectares of reforestation in 2012.  In terms of conservation, we won not only the European Business Award but, closer to home, the RDS forestry award for our leadership in nature conservation.<\/p><p> In terms of the outlook for 2013, we are confident that we will deliver an operating profit similar or slightly better than that in 2012.  Markets for our panel products and our customer sawn wood, particularly in the United Kingdom, have shown a marked improvement in the second half of 2013.  The United Kingdom housing sector is showing signs of recovery and this is positive for our business as we look forward into 2014.<\/p><p> During the economic downturn, we have significantly reduced our cost base.  We had to do that in the face of a difficult economic environment.  Our head count has fallen by 25% over the past five years.  Our operating costs have been reduced by &euro;40 million per annum and we have exited a number of businesses that were non-performing and that we could not make profitable.  We have also significantly enhanced our innovation capability over those years and that is now reaping dividends for us.  These achievements combined with our strong Medite and SmartPly brands, and excellent routes to market, means, we believe, that we are well positioned to turn to a strong-growth path as our key markets recover.<\/p><p> We firmly believe that Coillte is an organisation that has never been more relevant.  In a world that is placing ever more value on environmental and corporate sustainability, we believe that Coillte displays good credentials in this space, as evidenced by our recent win in the European Business Awards and our ongoing FSC certification.<\/p><p> We have stewardship of two valuable resources - 7% of the land area of Ireland and a wood-fibre basket of 2.5 million cu. m per annum.  We play an important role in Irish society.  We provide extensive recreation facilities for people to enjoy and deliver a wide range of biodiversity benefits for Ireland, and we are supporting economic recovery via our export driver - exporting to over 30 countries last year.<\/p><p> Turning to the future, the priority for Government is for Coillte to deliver a material financial dividend to the State on an annual basis and our core objective is to implement a restructuring and growth strategy within Coillte over the next five years that will enable us to deliver an annual financial dividend of circa &euro;20 million to the State by 2018.  It is focused on these two overriding objectives of adding value to the wood fibre that we own and adding value to the land bank.<\/p><p> Our strategy is to be building on our key strengths - our impeccable environmental and sustainability credentials, the scale of our land assets and our strong market share in key markets, such as the United Kingdom - but will also demand that we enhance our existing capabilities, particularly in the innovation space, and build new ones such as strategic marketing which we will need for the future.  We will deliver our strategy through five businesses where we already have a strong competitive position: forestry and panel products, in terms of adding value to fibre; and telecommunications, wind and property development sales, in terms of adding value to our land.<\/p><p> The strategy is focused primarily on improving operational performance and adopting new market positions in businesses and in geographies we already know well.  We believe our strategy is credible and we are confident that we can deliver it because we have spent many months on rigorous and comprehensive analysis of the markets, customers and supply chains.  We believe that most of the key drivers of successful implementation are within our control and we have taken a conservative approach to assumptions that are not, and we believe our assumptions are grounded.  We think we have a good track record of having, I suppose, faced adversity for the past five years and taken our cost base down.  We think that we have a good platform for delivering growth in the future.<\/p><p> Following on from the Government decision in June 2013, Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na, together with NewERA and the relevant stakeholder Departments, have been working in recent weeks to evaluate the prospects for a beneficial merger of the two companies.  This work is focused on assessing the financial benefits, costs, risks and issues associated with a full merger of the two companies.  The financial benefits on which we are focusing on identifying derive from overlaps between our businesses, and are over and above those flowing from implementation of the respective companies' business strategies.  Whether a full merger is initiated by Government or not, we believe the delivery of our strategy will remain a key imperative for us in order to optimise the value to the shareholder of the wood fibre and the land in Coillte's stewardship.<\/p> <p> That brings me to the end of our presentation.  I hope the members have found it interesting and informative and now have a better understanding of why we believe trees are just the start of what Coillte has to offer the State.  We will be delighted to take any questions that the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900009#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Britchfield","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384874400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Britchfield.

As he knows, I have much time for the work of Coillte Teoranta.  It is worth recording here that the forestry industry, not only in the form of Coillte, has performed exceptionally well in the context of the downturn of the economy, having turned a 70% home market into a 70% export market.  I do not believe any major timber-processing operation in the country has been lost since the downturn.<\/p><p>  There have been many stories about land and forests being sold by Coillte.  The committee needs information on how much land has been sold.  How much of it has been sold in small parcels?  I am very much in favour of Coillte's policy of facilitating communities with very small parcels of land for community centres, community facilities, playgrounds, etc.  I do not know if any member of the committee would disagree with that, as most people would say the policy represents good neighbourliness.  I am interested in knowing the method by which commercial parcels are sold and how they are valued, because they are State assets.<\/p><p>   How much forestry has been sold as viable forest?  Can the delegates confirm that no forest crop has been sold?  One could sell the land, the forest and the whole lot.  Could the delegates confirm that no forest crop or harvesting rights have been sold in circumstances in which the land was retained?<\/p><p>  Is there research on added value associated with timber products?  On the few occasions I visited timber-producing areas in Germany and elsewhere on the Continent, I noted the forestry authorities seemed to do an awful lot through small logging operations, thus producing smaller products and added value.  While we have really moved ahead with stress testing, kiln drying, and getting good commercial products on the market, which is fantastic in that it results in the very successful production of a bulk product on foot of continuous investment, I noted abroad that there seems to be a lot more timber use generally, including for decking and garden features.  In the main, this does not result in high timber values but it produces an awful lot of added value in terms of employment, etc.  Is there research on how we could make our timber suitable in this regard?<\/p><p>  Much work has taken place on rural recreation.  Over the next three or four years, what will Coillte be developing in this regard?  There was a big drive involving cycleways, mountain bike trails and walkways.  What is the next big drive in regard to rural recreation?  Is there a plan for the period 2014 to 2017?<\/p><p>  Mr. Britchfield stated that the profit was &euro;35 million.  How much of this pertains to sales of land or non-trading profits?<\/p><p>  Are there plans for acquiring more land for planting?  While there seems to be a policy of holding on to what we have, there seems to be no policy to increase the area of State forest.  Achieving this represents the cheapest form of forestry growth, because there is actually no Exchequer input. <\/p><p>  While it is nice for the Government to get a dividend, making maximal use of the lands for the people in every way would result in a better dividend in the longer term if the industry were creating employment and so on.  The dividend is so small that it does not make a significant difference to the Exchequer.  Therefore, if some of the money were reinvested by Coillte, would it be able to create more jobs, generate more activity and develop further?<\/p><p>  How much of an overlap is there between Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na?  Are they two State bodies with two totally different core businesses that happen to have land on which some might wish to locate telecommunications masts or infrastructure for generating renewable energy?  Is this just the opposite to setting up quangos?  Is it a question of getting rid of quangos for the sake of making absolutely nominal savings, perhaps of &euro;100,000 or &euro;200,000 per year, at the risk of losing the focus on the core business?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900011#K00300","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1384874400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentation.

Would it be fair to say that they are in the ownership of the State and will continue to be in the ownership of the State?<\/p><p>  Mr. Britchfield stated that Coillte wishes to build on its key strengths.  He stated that 15 million trees were planted on approximately 6,000 ha. in 2012.  Does Coillte intend to continue to plant at this rate or to increase it?  I assume this planting capacity is one of its strengths.  Could the delegates elaborate on this and other strengths?<\/p><p>  A target of 450 million has been set for 2018.  Is this realisable?

It was stated that much of the energy is generated on land formerly owned by Coillte.  That the land is formerly owned by Coillte is the crux of the issue.  If land is being disposed of in this way, is the policy very short-sighted?

In general, we typically sell a couple of hundred hectares per year, perhaps 200 ha to 300 ha.  In the context of our estate of 450,000 ha., that is a relatively small part.  What we are doing is focusing on areas that can deliver significant value over and above forestry.  Our condition in considering whether to sell land involves our deciding whether it has a value in respect of another use that is significantly greater than the forestry value.  Therefore, it is a question of deciding whether that value could be captured for the State by selling the land.<\/p> <p>Since Coillte was established back in 1989, we have acquired about 60,000 hectares of land.

It is important to set it in the legislative context.  Coillte's founding legislation is the Forestry Act 1998.  Section 14 of that Act requires the company to agree annually with the Minister a programme for the sale and acquisition of land and the sale of timber.  That means that annually we must agree an overall programme, so all timber and land sales - and the acquisition of land that might take place, which is a rare occurrence now - is done within the context of a programme that is overseen by the Department.<\/p><p>  When it comes to individual sales, typically somebody - or it might be a local authority - will approach us to say that they are interested in a particular project.  We will then have the property independently valued.  We have a governance committee within the organisation that confirms the price that is being offered.  It is either sold by tender or through negotiation by a local auctioneer.  The internal governance committee ensures that at least the reserve price, or the independent valuation, is reached.  If sales exceed a certain limit, which is &euro;2 million, the approval of the board is required.  There are some strict forms of governance in place even for small transactions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900012#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Egan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384875000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>The board is made aware of every sale of land we make and it notes that at each monthly board meeting.<br \/><b><\/b>Moving on to the next question, which was about adding value to timber products, some of our own sawmill customers have been quite innovative in recent years.  I am not as familiar with what they are doing, but I know what our panels business is doing.  We are focusing on adding value to the small-diameter fibre we use in those businesses.  We have an active innovation pipeline and, typically, at any particular point we have a dozen products to examine.  We have brought at least three or four to market annually in recent years.  We are looking at opportunities, including the off-site construction sector, which is growing across Europe on the back of a requirement to have much more energy efficiency built into homes and office buildings.  We are designing products that will suit the off-site construction requirement.<\/p><p>  We have an active innovation programme in our panels business which, until recently, was supported by Enterprise Ireland.

People may not fully appreciate that in 2006 we built 90,000 houses and apartments in Ireland.  We did not necessarily finish them all, but 90,000 were built.  Today we are building about 8,000 units per year, yet we are producing more timber now than we were in 2006.  That has all had to go somewhere.<\/p><p>  This committee may often hear from people in the food industry about the huge success of food exports.  Proportionately, however, our customers in the sawmill sector have achieved more than that.  For them to be able to succeed in those markets, huge investments have been made by progressive businesses.  All the timber now exported from Ireland is planed, so there is no rough-sawn timber any more, and it comes in multiple lengths.  I would encourage members of this committee to visit some of these places to see the state-of-the-art machinery installed, as well as product and market developments.  That has happened because those customers have had the security of knowing that the supply is available and will be brought to the market as demand increases. <\/p><p>  It is great for us to have an opportunity to pay tribute to our own customers and their achievements.

Coillte would like to acquire land for future planting, as we did through the 1990s when we acquired 60,000 hectares of which the majority was planted.  However, we are in a weak competitive position in the market because from 1996 we were barred from being eligible for forest premia.  As a result, it is difficult for us to compete for bare land in the marketplace.  We have focused instead on reforesting the land we clear-felled.<\/p><p>  In the recent past, we have entered into partnerships with farmers to plant their land and work with them to bring their crops through the clear-fell cycle.  We have up to 10,000 hectares in farm partnerships.  We are not planting bare land, however, but reforesting what we clear-fell as we are required to do under the Forestry Act 1946.<\/p><p>  In accordance with our strategy, if we can grow our business, we can create and protect jobs in rural areas.  The State, the shareholder, has said it wants a dividend from Coillte.  We have no problem with that as a shareholder is entitled to a return on its investment.  However, I believe we need to grow the business to put the company in a position where it can pay a substantial dividend.  At the moment, it is only paying &euro;2 million.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked if there was an overlap between Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na.  The two companies operate businesses which are significantly different.  Coillte is in forestry, panel products, wind, telecoms and property sales, while Bord na M&oacute;na is in peat extraction, power generation from peat and biomass, peat briquettes, horticultural peat products, oil and coal distribution, waste recovery and wind.  We have worked closely with it and NewERA to identify a small number of overlaps between the companies which could bring benefits for the shareholder.  When one is looking for synergy, one has to have common customers, common routes to market or common products.  We do not have that many of them, so there are a small number of overlaps such as wind energy.  We completed our analysis of the benefits and risks of merging these overlaps by 1 November which we submitted to NewERA.  It will prepare a report for the Government on the matter by 6 December.  <\/p><p>  The State has ownership of all mineral resources such as oil or gold.  Several years ago, Coillte undertook an exercise to review sand and gravel deposits on its lands, particularly at the height of the building boom.  To my knowledge, however, there has been no other extensive review of mineral deposits on our lands.<\/p><p>  When we replant our lands, we manage them in line with Forest Stewardship Council Ireland principles.  We regard forestry as one of our company&rsquo;s key strengths.  We have many talented and experienced and dedicated people working in the forestry part of our business.<\/p><p>  Deputy Martin Ferris asked if the &euro;450 million value uplift by 2018 is achievable.  This figure was calculated by taking today&rsquo;s cash flow and projected cash flow as we grow our business.  We believe it is achievable and is a function of the strategy we want to deploy.  We would not need to dip into the public purse to do this.  It will be financed from our own resources, assets and some bank borrowings.<\/p><p>  We are involved in the biomass sector and have a particular focus on renewable heat.  Coillte entered into several contracts in this regard over the past several years with Astellas, a pharmaceutical company in Killorglin and the Radisson Hotel in Letterkenny.<\/p> <p>We have also been very active in promoting the concept that we need a better incentive for renewable heat in Ireland.  We do not believe the current refit supports for combined heat and power biomass are strong enough.  The fact that there has been very little activity in combined heat and power in Ireland on the back of the State supports under refit is probably proof of that.  When one factors in the cost of building these combined heat and power plants and the operating costs, the reality is that they cannot afford to buy the fibre based on the supports that are there.  We have been working and will make our views known to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources about the need for a better incentive for renewable heat, which is where we see the big value for Ireland.  Renewable heat can give one an efficiency of 80% or 90% in terms of bang for one's buck for the fibre as opposed to pure power generation where one might only get a 40% return efficiency.  We think renewable heat is where it is at because that is where one can really add value to fibre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900013#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Britchfield","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384876200,"counter":77,"content":"<p>To elaborate on that, there is a huge appreciation in the forest product sector of the use of biomass for renewable heat because it is far and away the biggest user and has been for very many years.  All the sawmills that have kiln drying facilities burn their own sawdust to generate heat as part of the drying process.  We would be a big user of biomass in our Medite plant.  We use it in any number of different forms.  We bring in bundles of brash and bundles of branches from our own forests that we use as a fuel.  We use recycled wood and sawdust as boiler fuel so in one sense, the committee is speaking to the converted in terms of the value of wood for biomass.  We have a very clear view that the real value of using wood fibre in the energy sector is for heat applications rather than for electricity general applications where wood is inherently inefficient.<\/p><p>  The other use of renewable heat is firewood.  We have seen an explosion in the demand for firewood over the past number of years where people have moved away from oil, particularly in rural areas where open fires have come back into fashion.  One really good example that is worth talking about relates to one of our customers in the North called Boyd Bedding.  It uses wood fibre in two really innovative ways.  It has a very big export business where it takes relatively low-value pulp wood and makes horse bedding out of it for export to places like Dubai and Qatar for Olympic show jumpers and grade one racehorses.  It has now entered into a significant contract with us to heat its entire processing operation also using relatively low-value pulp wood from Donegal.  Going back to the innovation agenda, there is a considerable amount of activity happening below the radar where people are all the time looking at added-value ways of taking what is a fairly basic commodity and seeing whether they can add value and jobs to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900014#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Egan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384876200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Deputy Pringle referred to the fact that we made a comment that over 20% of the installed wind energy capacity in Ireland is on lands formerly owned by Coillte.

In terms of our past policy, as the committee is probably aware, wind energy sites take a very long time to come to fruition.  In terms of the 20% of installed capacity, our policy in the past would have been to work with people who were expert in this area.  I recall people like SERGAS who would have been in the market at very early stages and would have bought land from us to develop wind farms.  That was a past policy but it still delivers a significant amount of capacity for Ireland in terms of reaching its renewable energy targets.

Why would Coillte do that given that there is a significant amount of opposition, particularly where they are located close to residential and rural areas?  Surely Coillte could have awaited the outcome and not engaged in that process in a piecemeal fashion, which has caused great angst, disturbance and distress to people.  If that is the position and I am led to believe it might be, I totally disagree with it.  That was a poor strategy to adopt, particularly in the face of significant issues arising for people who had expended significant amounts of money purchasing their homes.

Coillte made a significant contribution to the export-led recovery, which we ought to acknowledge, but surely it is unlimited in terms of what it can contribute in the future.  Surely there are opportunities there in that regard.  Coillte has acquired about an average of 2,500 hectares or thereabouts per year over the past 25 years.  Has it become dormant in that position or is there a possibility that Coillte can re-enter that market and continue that process because many of us worked hard to ensure that Coillte was not sold off under the terms of the troika agreement?

That would obviously include areas that have been felled but are largely unproductive or are unsuited to forestry.  I am aware of a number of areas in Slieve Aughty which were planted in good faith in the 1960s but which have not been felled because the growth is too poor.  From an environmental and visual perspective, the areas would be better off had they never been planted.  It is uneconomical for Coillte to fell the trees in these areas and, furthermore, they would have to be replanted.  Is the area of law to which Mr. Britchfield referred something the Government should be considering in the context of forestry legislation?<\/p><p>  He indicated that the supports for CHP plants are insufficient and that it is uneconomical to pay for the fibre.  Correct me if I am wrong but I understand Coillte refuses to enter into long-term supply contracts.  I am referring not only to finished timber which can be used for construction but also to thinnings.  In the absence of guaranteed supply, no investor will establish a CHP plant.  Coillte is supplying bioenergy in some instances.  Are these Coillte's plants or is it providing thinnings and raw material?  Has the company considered signing supply contracts that would enable communities with a significant Coillte presence, such as in County Clare, which is one of the most afforested counties in Ireland, to establish CHP plants?<\/p><p>  Mr. Britchfield skirted around the issue of mergers with Bord na M&oacute;na.

The <i>Sunday Independent<\/i> reported that Coillte's former CEO, Mr. Gunning, claimed to be owed money by the company even though he earned &euro;498,000 per year.  There is a perception that Coillte has been selling land to pay for ongoing expenses, including exorbitant salaries for upper management, for many years but has managed to hide it in its accounting system.  It has been suggested that it is a loss-making operation and that its model is entirely unsustainable and in radical need of overhaul.

The backdrop to the question is that the Government has identified an opportunity to export wind energy and has signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK Government on developing an export opportunity of at least 2 GW, most of which will be located in the midlands.  We have endeavoured to position ourselves in a way that ensures the State will benefit from that opportunity via the lands that we own.  We have an option agreement with one developer in the midlands, Element Power, which is seeking to develop a number of sites as part of this export opportunity.  We are also working closely with Bord na M&oacute;na in respect of 4,000 ha we have leased from the company.  Bord na M&oacute;na also has significant ambitions in terms of being part of the wind export solution.  We are discussing the potential for working together to develop these opportunities.<\/p><p>  On the question of whether we are putting the cart before the horse by entering into the option agreement before the guidelines are specified, our option agreement with Element Power clearly states that the latter has to meet certain performance parameters.  The company will have to go through the process of applying for planning permission under whatever guidelines are in place.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is currently finalising how this will be progressed and his Department will be issuing guidelines on how it wants the project to develop.  Element Power will have to comply with that process.  It will have to go through the normal planning process and if it cannot get planning permission because the planning authority deems its application to be unsuitable, the option agreement will fall over.  There is no longevity in it.  The company has to deliver in the context of the rules set by the Government.  Our objective is to ensure the lands we hold are part of the solution that the Government wants to implement in regard to this export opportunity.<\/p><p>  In regard to whether we have made proposals to retain the current guidelines for wind energy plants, we have made a submission as part of the normal consultation process.  We advocated that the current guidelines, which were published in 2006, are sufficient in taking account of the relevant planning parameters.  However, it is for the Government to determine the planning guidelines it wants to put in place and we will have to comply with them.<\/p><p>  In terms of increasing the levels of planting, we are keen to plant trees.  That is the core of what we do.  We are mainly focused on reforestation because our inability to compete for land means we are effectively locked out of the afforestation market.  We are not entitled to the forest premia which farmers have earned since 1996, with the result that we cannot compete in the agricultural land market in the way we did in the 1990s.  The economics do not make sense for us to buy land at agricultural prices.  We cannot make it work commercially to plant land in the absence of the premia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900015#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Britchfield"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384876800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>The question about Coillte doing more afforestation is interesting in the context of Food Harvest 2020, which aims to increase beef and milk production.  Afforestation is happening at a rate of approximately 7,000 ha per annum, with the support of annual Government funding of &euro;100 million or &euro;110 million.  The thrust of Government policy is that afforestation should be led by the private sector, namely, farmers who already own the land.  While I understand why people expect Coillte, as the State forestry company, to do more afforestation, the policy keeps us out of that area and the incentives are directed towards other actors.<\/p> <p>The clear message we are receiving from our shareholder Ministers is that, rather than necessarily investing money in that way, they would prefer to see proceeds from our business operations going back to the shareholder in the form of an enhanced dividend.

The confidence that has been put in us will be repaid over the next number of years.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about damage to local roads from harvesting and consultation with local authorities.  Local authorities over the years have become stricter in terms of designated access routes for harvesting.  We are in constant consultation with local authorities about what access route we can use to access clear-fell sites.  They lay down strict guidelines on what they expect, and we comply with those.  We do our utmost to ensure we do not damage local roads because we appreciate that it is very disruptive for people living in those areas.  Ultimately, we have to get the timber out, we use the most modern methods possible to do that and we have regard to ensuring we minimise any damage.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about Government guidelines for CEOs.  I am the acting CEO.  Up to this I was the managing director of the panels business.  When the previous CEO left, eight months ago, the chairman asked me to take up this role.  I have done that under the same terms and conditions I was on before that with no improvement and they are consistent with the new Government guidelines for the new CEO of Coillte.<\/p><p>  Deputy Hayden asked about the cost-benefit analysis.  We did a big exercise on this.  As the Deputy may be aware, over the last number of years we have been examining reinvesting in our SmartPly facility in Waterford, and we recently went to the Government seeking approval to do that.  We are hopeful that we will get approval to do that.  The SmartPly business has a great future.  In considering that investment, our board demanded that we examine all the alternatives, such as panels and renewables, to see which would provide the best return for our wood fibre.  We did that, and it is clear that there is a better return for the State from using our wood fibre to manufacture the SmartPly product and export it.<\/p><p>  That business has a great future.  Part of that comparison relates back to the fact that the supports for combined heat and power, CHP, in Ireland are not particularly attractive.  CHP bioenergy cannot match the sort of returns that panels are delivering.  The panel sector is deeply rooted here.  We have great expertise in this country and it employes more than 300 people directly in the south east and approximately 100 in Carrick-on-Shannon, so it is a very important business.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked us about climate change strategy and land use.  We are mindful of the fact that the carbon sequestration benefits of forestry were built into the Government's plan for meeting its Kyoto targets, which took us to 2012.  As part of our business we ensure that we replant areas that we clear-fell.  We are mindful of the fact that carbon sequestration is a key benefit of forests and ensure that we replant forests to avoid diminishing that carbon sequestration benefit.  We seek, through Coillte's forest business, to improve the yield class of what we replant if we can.  The yield class improvement generally gives a better carbon sequestration return.<\/p><p>  Deputy McNamara asked about the areas that are largely unproductive and that we are replanting if and when we clear-fell them.  There is a case for looking at areas that are particularly poor and rather than reforesting those sites with a full stocking level of 2,500 plants per hectare, which is what we tend to do, going for a less intensive stocking level because the economics are very poor.  Many of those areas would not be grant-aided by the forest service if they were bare land today because their yield class would be far lower than what it would regard as a commercial prospect.  We must examine this, but it is a policy issue for the forest service.  Its policy is to encourage people to replant and restock at full stocking levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900016#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Britchfield"},{"type":"speech","time":1384877400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Would it require legislative change to clear-fell them and leave them fallow?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900016#P00300","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384877400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Yes.  The legislation that governs the harvesting and replanting of these areas dates from 1946.  In the post-war era the object of the exercise was to stop the trees from being felled rather than enabling it to be done on a sustainable and commercial basis.  The general proposition in legislation, with some exceptions, is that if any area is felled it must be replanted.  As members will know, there is a new Forestry Bill on Second Stage, and this is an opportunity to introduce a more flexible regime in terms of some of these areas.  Mr. Britchfield referred to the Nephin wilderness area in Mayo, where there are 40,000 hectares which should never have been planted in the first place.  Rather than trying to manage such areas for commercial timber production we are looking to see if there is a tourism, recreation and nature conservation benefit to be had from that.<\/p><p>  We have also had great success with five LIFE projects, under which we have received EU funding for the conversion of woodlands in a similar category which are reverting to peatland over time.  We are trying, within the confines of existing legislation, to be creative in how we address these matters.  We would like to see a situation whereby the management prescription, what one is required to do after the area has been felled, is proportionate to the likely value of the successor crop.  If one has very productive land that has grown very productive trees or is capable of growing broadleaf trees, the landowner should be obliged to restock that at the full level and maximise his or her productivity.  If one has very poor areas that should never have been planted, there must be an incentive for the landowner to manage that land appropriately.  Requiring the landowner to replant it uneconomically makes no sense.  We see the Forestry Bill as an opportunity to introduce a more flexible regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900016#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Egan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384877400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>The next question was on long-term supply contracts for biomass users.<\/p> <p>We are in the business of providing biomass solutions to some customers.

We are happy to talk to people about bioenergy uses or any use of our fibre.  Animal bedding is another area for which we supply pulp wood volume but, ultimately, it must stack up from a commercial perspective.  We have panel businesses that make a good contribution and that can make a strong contribution to the State in the future.  They employ large numbers of people in the south east.  We also want to supply those businesses, as they have an important role to play, as well as the bioenergy sector.<\/p><p>  The solution to this is mobilising private supply.  Over the past 20 years the State has supported large-scale afforestation by farmers, and much of that land is reaching the point at which it needs to be thinned.  According to the COFORD projections for timber supply into the future by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, approximately 500,000 cu. m of additional pulpwood is forecast to be available, and the key for Ireland in growing a bioenergy sector is to mobilise that private supply to make sure the wood-paying capability of the biomass sector is attractive enough to get the farmer to thin his crop, because if he does not do so now the value of the crop will fall substantially and, at clear fell, he simply will not get the value for it and the State will not get the value for the investment it has made in the context of grants and premiums.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Bord na M&oacute;na piece, I will not comment on speculation in the Sunday newspapers.

Why would Coillte be selling land to the trust in the first place?  How much land was sold to it before 2011?<\/p><p> On the environment, reforestation and so on, has Coillte conducted any soil or water analysis, given its obligation to protect the environment?  That relates to the point about acidification, monoculture and so forth.<\/p><p> How much of the &euro;400 million loan facility extended to Coillte under the Forestry (Amendment) Act 2009 has been allocated to the restoration and rehabilitation of the sites identified by Mr. Colm McCarthy as not commercially viable - I believe it was 500,000 acres - and particularly looking at the planting of native broadleaf species?  How much of that money has gone to the development of wind energy?  I am asking for the comparison of how much is going into afforestation with how much is going into the development of wind energy.<\/p><p> I accept what the witnesses have said that much of what is impacting on Coillte's strategy is the 1988 Act and the mandate it gives Coillte to return a dividend to the State, from which a number of things flow.  The witnesses say that because of that commercial mandate or the requirement to return a dividend and also the fact it cannot benefit from premia for afforestation, it cannot do afforestation which should be its main task.  I note this \"trees are just the start of it\" phrase.  I would have thought that trees should be the start, middle and end of it for a semi-State company that is the biggest owner of forests in the State.  On the job of meeting the 17% afforestation target, the Bacon report suggested we should be planting 15,000 ha to 20,000 ha, we are only planting 6,000 ha and the witnesses are saying Coillte cannot do it.  It is a crazy and anomalous situation to have these targets while the biggest owner of forests in the State which is 100% owned by the public cannot plant these forests.  That is a real problem.<\/p><p> If the Forestry Bill that is being discussed required Coillte to do that and gave it specific targets for afforestation as its central mandate, would that change the situation?  I believe that is what should happen.  Similarly, Coillte should be given targets - they should also exist more generally - dealing with climate change, the role afforestation can have in acting as a carbon sink and all those sorts of things.<\/p><p> On employment and the economy, a report suggests that several hundred jobs can be created for every 15,000 ha planted, yet we are not planting those forests.  Would it be fair to suggest there are two approaches to forestry, one of which Coillte is following?  We might it call the austerity and privatisation approach to forestry, which is to cut back on costs and not do anything that might require long-term investment.  As a result, it is not able to increase the level of afforestation and is not generating a significant number of jobs.  As the witnesses rightly admitted, 20% of the jobs have gone in Coillte and this is not a great model for forestry.  We would be better having a model based on the requirement to grow forests.  It should put more emphasis on growing native broadleaf forests and not be just about export orientation but also be about linking in with the development of the economy more widely in this country.  That would require a substantial change in Coillte's mandate.<\/p><p> I was asked to ask Coillte a specific question.  The ESB replacement pole scheme has been ongoing since 2008, requiring potentially 100,000 new poles at, I believe, around &euro;500 per pole.  If I am correct, Coillte is not involved in those replacement poles.  I ask the witnesses to clarify whether Coillte is involved.  I understand the poles being replaced were originally provided by Coillte but the replacement poles are being imported.<\/p> <p>If this is the case why is it the case?<\/p><p> On the issue of the sales of land, Coillte stated recently it is not selling to big pension funds.  I have asked about the Irish Forestry Unit Trust and I hope the witnesses will answer the question.  Is there a reason Coillte could not give us, as part of its annual reporting or regular reporting to the public and to Parliament, details of all these sales, how decisions were made about selling or not and other important decisions relating to the public forest estate, its disposal and use?<\/p><p> With regard to the damaging impact of clear felling, Derrybrien was one of the worst environmental disasters we have ever seen and nearly led to the loss of a village.  Several other similar landslides resulted from clear felling in Leitrim and Kerry.  What does Coillte have to say about the damage clear felling can do given the critical role trees having in holding soil and mountains together?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900017#Q00800","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384879200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The notice we received for this meeting stated its purpose is to discuss the annual report but the document we have is not the annual report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013111900019#S00200","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384879200,"counter":101,"content":"<p>It is this document which is the annual report.

Why is there a shortfall from 3.024 million cu. m to 2.3 million cu. m?  A forecast done in December 2011 for 2012 should be more correct than this.  Why was the volume available to the sawmills short while the volume of pulp sales was higher than forecast?  Is Coillte protecting supplies to its own board mills?  Is it possible that what is known as pulp within the forestry industry can be made available at commercial rates to the sawmillers and no longer can be directed exclusively to Coillte board plants?  Do the witnesses agree there would be a better return to the State if this product were transacted on an open and transparent basis whereby all processors of our forestry, including Coillte, would have to bid for it rather than the current situation whereby Coillte directs pulp to its board plants without any cost to it?  Are the witnesses aware that at a recent forestry industry event held in the UK, an oriented strand board manufacturer, whose name I will not mention, asked participants to sign a petition requesting pulp from Irish forests be made available to all in the industry and not just to Coillte's boards plants?  European awards were mentioned.

SmartPly and Medite pay the market price for pulpwood in Ireland, which is significantly higher than the price their competitors pay for pulpwood in the UK market.  A question was asked about whether re-investment in SmartPly is likely to go ahead.  We have sought approval from the Minister to make this investment of approximately &euro;60 million in SmartPly which will re-invigorate the mill and set it up for the future, allowing us to grow the business and protect the 150 direct jobs and the 150 indirect jobs.

The Irish Forestry Unit Trust is a vehicle that enables pension funds to invest in forestry in Ireland.  It allows pension funds such as the ESB, An Post and Canadian Teachers' pensions funds, an opportunity to invest in productive assets in Ireland.  It was established in 1993 and involved the coming together of two existing forestry investment funds owned by Irish Life and AIB Investment Managers and Coillte.  Coillte got involved because there was a need for immature forests as part of the fund in order that investors could liquidate their investments from time to time, as in the case of any pension fund.  People retire and need to be able to take their money out.  In terms of forests given over by Coillte to the fund, the forest has been sold but the land has been retained.  Even where the harvesting rights of these forests have been sold to the Irish Forestry Unit Trust, the land is retained in the ownership of Coillte.<\/p><p>  There is also a second fund, entitled the prescient Irish Forestry Unit Trust.

The origins of this meeting go back to work that was done by the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising, which many members will know is chaired by Mr. Frank Flannery.  The forum's strategic objective is to increase the amount of private sector investment from the current estimated level of &euro;500 million to &euro;800 million by 2016.  The sector is an indispensable partner to Government in the delivery of a wide range of services.  It is also an important economic actor in its own right.  The not-for-profit sector employs in excess of 100,000 people in Ireland, more than pharma and IT combined.  A subset, social enterprise, employs between 25,000 and 33,000 people.  If we were able to increase the numbers employed in social enterprise to the European average, that figure would be approximately 65,000.  There is significant job creation potential.  Traditionally, this sector as a whole has not been viewed as a source of job creation or economic activity.  For this reason, we wish to speak to the committee.<\/p><p>  I will introduce my two colleagues.  Mr. Coughlan will brief the committee on social enterprise, its potential and some of the steps that are necessary to deliver on same.  Mr. &Oacute; Corrbu&iacute; will discuss shared services.  Dublin is the shared services capital of Europe.  We provide shared services to a large number of entities across the EU, for example, back office operations, IT, etc.  There is significant potential to adopt this approach in the not-for-profit sector, which would have a two-fold effect - it would create jobs in that sector while reducing costs and increasing efficiencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Mulconry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384868100,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mulconry.  I will briefly discuss the concepts of social enterprise and social entrepreneurship.  Often, we view the not-for-profit sector as comprising exclusively charitable organisations, but a strong emerging trend in recent years has been the focus on social enterprise.  Essentially, this is an organisation that provides services or products on a commercial basis but with a social mission at its core.  The distinguishing factor between a social enterprise and a normal business is not whether they operate differently, seeing as how they operate similarly, but that the majority of the surpluses generated - if the organisation makes a profit - is reinvested in the social mission.  In a sense, this creates the economic benefits accrued from any start-up or commercially viable operation as well as a considerable amount of social benefit.  There is no profiteering or money taken out of these companies for private gain.  I would argue that social enterprise and social entrepreneurship provide the best of both worlds.<\/p><p>  However, the sector is notably underdeveloped in Ireland.  As Mr. Mulconry mentioned, the level of social enterprise activity in Europe is much higher than it is in Ireland.  There have been positive developments of late.  Forf&aacute;s was commissioned to publish a report on the potential for social enterprise.  It was published this year.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, has been appointed by the Government to co-ordinate social enterprise activity across Departments.  While this is a positive first step, there is considerable potential to build on this early momentum.<\/p><p>  Social enterprise is a significant job creator and contributor to the economy.  If we achieve just the mean level of social enterprise activity that is found across the EU, our sector could create 65,000 jobs.  This is a major benefit.  However, we will only achieve this through the creation of an enabling environment.  The two go hand in hand.  I stress that this is not a question of money in any sense, but of creating the environment to allow social enterprise to thrive.<\/p><p>  I will provide a couple of practical and important examples of what is necessary to allow the sector to grow.  Local government is in the process of being reconfigured and realigned.  We suggest that the local enterprise offices, LEOs, which will replace county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, will include social enterprise as part of their enterprise strategies.  This could be done simply and would help to create the environment in question.  Local and community development committees should consider social enterprise when developing their plans.<\/p><p>  There is considerable potential for social enterprise in terms of procurement.  European legislation allows for the provision of social clauses in tendering processes.<\/p> <p>If we were to introduce these clauses, not only could we have the services that, as a State, we are seeking to procure, but we could also have direct social benefits accruing from them also. <\/p><p> We would like to see a preferred treatment of social enterprises in local service tenders.  In particular, for contracts or tenders below &euro;25,000 we would like to see social enterprises being on preferred supplier lists.  They should not get exclusive access, but should have to compete with other providers.  They should be able to compete on a value for money basis.  If they are social enterprises rather than private concerns, one will also get the social benefit accruing from that.<\/p><p> I wish to make a last point before handing over to my colleague Mr. &Oacute; Corrbu&iacute;.  The EU sees social enterprise and social entrepreneurship as critical components of its 2020 vision.  Its strategy for the next term of the European Commission, the structural funds and planning, includes social enterprise and social entrepreneurship as major components.  Ireland is in real danger of missing out on the support and benefit that will provide, however, because we do not yet have a policy, strategy or engagement process with Europe.<\/p><p> I will give two particular examples.  First, at the moment there is a draft agreement for the use of structural funds.  All member states will have to produce an agreement with the EU around the use of structural funds from 2014 to 2020.  The draft agreement is out for consultation at the moment from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It comprises 159 pages.  I note that social enterprise is in the programme for Government and in the action plan for jobs.  We have also had a Forf&aacute;s report published.  In those 159 pages there is not one mention of social enterprise, yet there is funding and support from Europe across the Union for the promotion of social enterprise.  I think we are missing out on that opportunity.<\/p><p> Second, there is a two-day conference in Strasbourg in January to promote social entrepreneurship.  To give the committee a sense of the importance that Europe attaches to this particular topic, the conference will be addressed by the President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, as well as by six other European Commissioners.  French President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande will address the conference in addition to Antonis Samaras, the Greek Premier.  This is a very significant initiative by the EU.  Social enterprise organisations will be going but, to date, we have not seen representation from policy makers.  I respectfully suggest that this committee might consider sending a representative to that conference, given its significance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900003#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384868700,"counter":247,"content":"<p>As Mr. Mulconry already mentioned, the sector is quite big when one considers it.  There are about 12,000 not-for-profit organisations in the country, including every parish and county.  However, not-for-profit organisations are struggling with reduced funding, increased compliance requirements and inefficient business processes, which hamper their impact.<\/p><p>  Dublin is one of the shared service capitals of Europe.  We can see huge potential for the development of a top quality, cost-effective national shared services centre for the not-for-profit sector.  This would enable the not-for-profits to focus more attention on their core mission activity which is not administration but delivering valuable social services around the country.<\/p><p>  The successful implementation of a shared services model can deliver significant savings from 15% to 30%, but it comes with a big \"if\".  It requires significant up-front investment and the payback takes time.  The Carmichael Centre for Voluntary Groups is a shared services centre and one of the first in the country.  We have 47 different groups working the model very effectively.  It allows small organisations to be effective without the requirement of having to have their own back-office administration and services. <\/p><p>  We could see this model being leveraged quite usefully around the country and in the capital.  Critical success factors for shared services are economies of scale, efficient deployment of best practice technologies, significant up-front investment - the lack of which causes difficulties for the sector - a clear business case, and a strong incentive to go down the shared services route.  At the moment that incentive is lacking.  The current fragmentation of the not-for-profit sector makes it difficult to take this step on its own.  It will require leadership and support from State funders to help us on that journey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Diarmaid &Oacute; Corrbu&iacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1384868700,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I will now call on members of the committee to put their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900004#D00300","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1384868700,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I welcome the various organisations' representatives.

The first is a national giving campaign, the 1% difference campaign, which is up and running.  We are encouraging everybody in Ireland to give 1% of their time or money to a cause they care about.  We have about 570 charities signed up to that.  The Deputy may have seen the advertising and PR around it in recent weeks.  We are half way through that campaign.  It is difficult at this stage to measure how much impact we are having.  The reception so far has been positive and the charities are engaged.<\/p><p>  The second strategy is a social innovation fund.  The fund is designed to try to address the fact that somewhere between &euro;50 million and &euro;60 million in philanthropic funding will leave the sector in the coming years as the two largest foundations wind down.  The social innovation fund's board is meeting and it is engaging on a fund-raising strategy.  The Government has committed to a &euro;5 million tranche of funding if that sum is matched by philanthropic funding.  They are now busily engaged in sourcing that funding and will hopefully raise much more than that, but it is an uphill struggle.<\/p><p>  The third area is improving fund-raising capacity.  One cannot have good giving without good asking.  Fund-raising Ireland has pioneered both a certificate and diploma in fund-raising to develop the capacity of fund-raisers.<\/p><p>  Fourth, we are looking at changes to tax and regulation.  On the regulatory side, the Irish Charities Tax Reform group, ICTR, is spearheading this part of the strategy.  We have had major progress in that the Department has agreed to implement the 2006 Charities Act.  It is in the process of setting up a register which should be up and running by the end of the year. <\/p><p>  As regards taxation, we are seeking measures to encourage the establishment of more trusts and foundations.  At the moment, some 25 trusts and foundations are operating that we are aware of, although there may be more because some of them operate underneath the radar.  We have one of the lowest proportions of trusts and foundations anywhere in Europe.  We are therefore looking for measures from the Government to encourage that.<\/p><p>  The report on the four elements was published two years ago.  We are well under way on three and a half of them.  The only area in which we have not made progress is in persuading the Government about taxation.  The Government is examining our proposals but we have not made progress yet.<\/p><p>  To put our figure of &euro;800 million in context, every year Irish people dump &euro;1 billion in food.  Every household dumps around &euro;740 worth of food.  If we could get people to check the use-by dates, and take a proportion of that food to a charity, it would have a massive impact.  If we could get men to give as much as women, for example, it would also have an impact.  The average yearly donation in Ireland is &euro;130.  Men give &euro;100 while women give &euro;160.  We are trying to get people to make small differences, which, taken together, can have a huge impact.<\/p><p>  The other area is corporate funding.  There are no really good statistics for the sector, although this is probably the best document we have.  The evidence we have suggests that corporate Ireland gives less than its counterparts in other jurisdictions.  We are working with businesses to encourage growth both in the quantum and quality of giving.  In many cases, money is being handed over in a way which does not maximise efficiency.  We have heard stories - they are purely anecdotal - of a charity entering for \"charity of the year\" to get &euro;10,000 but it costs them &euro;5,000 to put the pitch together.<\/p> <p>We are trying to move away from that towards more longer term relationships between business and the sector.  We are also encouraging CEOs of businesses to become involved in charities and non-for-profits, to which they can bring a huge degree of management, time and ability.  In terms of whether we will hit our targets, the answer is I do not know.  We are doing our best to ensure we do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900004#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Mulconry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384869300,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Mr. Mulconry mentioned the local enterprise offices, LEOs, and social enterprise business programme, SEBP.

I am hugely supportive of the social economy and the notion of social entrepreneurship.  I do not believe it is recognised to the extent it should be in terms of its potential.  We would possibly all accept that.<\/p><p>  Last year, on behalf of the committee I drafted an economic development strategy for the southeast, much of which was based on consultations and meetings with various groups, including community groups.  The issue of social entrepreneurship and the social economy was mentioned by many of the groups and local authority representatives.  An issue of particular concern to me was the lack of understanding among the community and local authority representatives of what the social economy means.  Perhaps with the establishment of the LEOs consideration could be given to holding information sessions across counties to discuss what is meant by the social economy and social entrepreneurship, including the potential and opportunities in this regard.  In terms of social enterprise being part of the remit of the local enterprise offices, property issues may arise.  However, the local authorities linking in with NAMA may be of assistance in this regard.  A number of local authorities also called for social enterprise business training programmes targeted at those involved in this sector.  There is a great deal of work that the local authorities could do through the LEOs, of which I would be supportive.<\/p><p>  In recognising the benefits of this sector, we must also accept there is a cost involved.  It is important to recognise that this cannot be delivered as a cheap alternative to the State.  I would welcome the witnesses view on that.  In the North, a package of &euro;80 million by way of the Social Investment Fund is available to communities to progress social economy projects.  What funding is made available here?  Reference was made by the witnesses in their opening statements to falling revenue from the State and philanthropic organisations.  Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on that shortfall, which would be helpful.  They might also update us on the status of the one per cent difference campaign, including take-up and so on.  <\/p><p>  I am not sure if the witnesses are aware of Communities Creating Jobs and Turning Point are just two of a number of community organisations in the southeast, with whom I have met.  What level of interaction do the organisations present have with the many new groups setting up because of the economic situation in which we find ourselves.  Perhaps consideration could be given to amalgamation of many of these new community based groups to ensure a more joined up approach in this area.  In my view, this would be of benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900005#E00400","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384869300,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I will respond to a number of the questions raised and ask some of my colleagues to respond to the others.  The philanthropic cliff was referred to by the Chairman of the Forum on Philanthropy.  In essence, the two largest foundations in Ireland are The One Foundation and Atlantic Philanthropies, who, between them, account for 86% of philanthropic funding in Ireland.  Both organisations are limited life foundations.  The One Foundation will close this year.  Atlantic Philanthropies has two or three years more remaining.  Following the closure of both in the region of &euro;50 million and &euro;60 million will be removed from the sector.  While that is a sizeable amount, it is important to bear in mind that the sector raises a lot more money than that.  This will impact on approximately 70 organisations and on a given number of fields, including child care, aging policy, dementia and other areas which are heavily funded by both of these organisations.  The social innovation fund is the forum's strategy for dealing with this.  Currently, the Government has committed &euro;5 million, which must be matched by philanthropic funding.  The social innovation fund was set up this year and is engaged in fund-raising as we speak to try to secure the matching funds.<\/p><p>  The One Percent Difference campaign was launched in June, although we had been working on it for a long time prior to that.  As I said earlier, approximately 570 charities have signed up to it.  We will not be in a position to measure it until next year at the earliest.  Like any other public awareness campaign, this is one for the long haul.  There will not be a sudden burst in giving.  In terms of fund-raising in the charity sector, Government funding, in some cases since the recession, has decreased to 40% and the number of people donating to charities has decreased by approximately 70%.  Given the severity of the recession, it is remarkable how the sector has held up.  The amount of income from fund-raising has also decreased.  However, this varies hugely across the sector.  Some charities are raising more funds now than they did prior to the recession but the demands on their services have increased exponentially.<\/p><p>  The three areas of most concern to the public now are suicide, health care, primarily around cancer and heart disease, and the future of our young people.  A charity whose fund-raising is related to any of these areas will get income.  However, all of the issues mentioned are in areas in respect of which demand has risen exponentially.  The charity sector has since about 2007 had a very rough time.  I would expect some charities to fold or merge this year.  Some will not last too much longer.  Others have adapted and are doing reasonably okay but, as I stated earlier, demand on their services has increased.  This One percent Difference campaign is about creating a culture in Ireland of sustained giving.  Irish people are brilliant when a crisis occurs.  They respond magnificently.  They are not as good in between crises.  We are trying to encourage people to find a charity about which they care and commit to it on a sustained basis.  As I said, it will be some time before we are able to measure whether or not we are getting traction.  I think we are but I do not know that yet for sure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Mulconry"},{"type":"speech","time":1384869300,"counter":256,"content":"<p>The crisis is usually an external rather than internal crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900005#E00600","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384869300,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900005#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Mulconry"},{"type":"speech","time":1384869300,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Perhaps we should by way of PR campaign by the organisations turn the focus towards the many Irish crises.

The overseas charities are probably being hardest hit.  What has kept them going is that they probably have the most sophisticated fundraising mechanisms, but they are under severe pressure.

The level of activity on the ground in local communities in social entrepreneurship and social enterprise is quite high in terms of local groups and people taking the initiative in trying to solve some of the challenges their communities face.  We in Social Entrepreneurs Ireland see that in the number and quality of applications that come into us for the awards process we run every year.  The level of expertise demonstrated by the social entrepreneurs who apply has been increasing each year, which is an encouraging sign.<\/p><p>  The second encouraging sign is that in Europe during the recession the number of jobs created by social enterprises has increased rather than decreased.  The potential is there and the real question is how we tap into it.  We need to have a conversation with at least two groups, if not more.  One of those groups is the ordinary citizens.  In those conversations one of the most powerful things we can do is to role model.  People often have ideas and want to contribute but are unsure how best to go about that.  We can give them examples and show them what is possible.  In a sense, organisations such as Social Entrepreneurs Ireland, Philanthropy Ireland, Clann Credo, The Wheel and the Carmichael Centre have a real role to play in showing what is possible.  I am very happy for people to put that challenge to us and we will need to step up to that mark.<\/p><p>  However, we need to have a separate conversation with local government.  That conversation needs to be about social enterprise and social entrepreneurship being not just a nice thing to do but of real and direct impact and benefit to local communities.

We can then sell that to local authorities because some of them do not see the logic.  They are dealing with so much - they are only getting their heads around the LEOs and they will become more involved in economic management and local economic development.

The Senator has raised a very interesting dynamic.  In supporting commercial activity in the local economy we are prepared to take some risk.  We are prepared to invest in early-stage organisations - not necessarily just financially but also with training, mentoring and providing shared services.  In our sector the Carmichael Centre is a leading example of that.  We are prepared to do that because we know that on average we accrue more benefit from the ones that succeed than we expend on early investment to support start-up companies, particularly small local companies.  The county and city enterprise boards as well as other State agencies have been set up for that.<\/p><p>  The Senator is right in what he said.  At the moment everybody claims to be prepared to invest early on.  When a company is a success, those agencies are its new best friends.  However, that does not solve the problem we are trying to solve.  It is not so much a money conversation but a change in mindset conversation.<\/p><p>  The Senator referred to NAMA and empty premises.  If we start to be more creative in how we look at these challenges, there are many solutions out there.  For example, we have invested in and supported a great initiative, called Fumbally Exchange, which has been set up to go into premises that are underutilised or empty.  It builds a vibrant ecosystem of small businesses that are commercially viable within those communities.  Part of its remit, because it is a social enterprise, is to build the community around those companies.  It has gone into premises in Dublin's inner city and created a new commercial hub of activity there and has now moved on to different premises.<\/p><p>  In times of recession people want to give back.  If we can give them those examples, the people will step up to that mark.  They are very interested in solving some challenges they see on their doorstep.  However, we have not created enough examples and a supportive environment.  The knowledge exists in State agencies.  The start-up process for a social enterprise is almost the same as the start-up process for any commercial enterprise.  In Social Entrepreneurs Ireland we spend our time working with our social entrepreneurs on business plans, communication strategies, keeping proper accounts and HR issues.  The State has so much expertise in all those areas but organisations such as Dunhill and other social enterprises continually struggle to get access to that knowledge which the State already has.  We are not looking for new people or new agencies; we are just looking for a door to open so that we can access what we already have.

Before the witnesses came in, during our private session we were discussing the concept of social enterprise.  We need to up our own game in our attitude towards social enterprise.  It is a hidden gem that is just not understood in Ireland.<\/p> <p>I get excited every time I hear about it because I see the real value of it.  I can see the end product and it makes perfect sense.  At the same time - Senator Cullinane referred to this - I genuinely believe that although there are people who understand and know what social enterprise is, there are others who will go to a local enterprise office when they are establishing an enterprise.  They want to set up a business and would probably be more than happy to take the social enterprise route but simply know nothing about it.  We need to do something to ensure people have the option.  People need to see that there is a payback not only for the person who sets up a business but for the people in the community or wider society.  Why would anyone not want that?  It is a no-brainer and work needs to be done in this area.  To a certain extent we come from a culture where, by and large, the model is based on looking after the people who set up the company and own the company.  It is a different alignment to what we are discussing today.  We need to see a change in mindset in this area particularly around how we do business as a country at a political level.  I realise the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, is trying to deal with that.<\/p><p> I have a question for Mr. Coughlan and a question for Mr. &Oacute; Corrbu&iacute; on shared services.  There is an obligation not only on the State but on other people to inform everyone about the idea of establishing a social enterprise as opposed to establishing a traditional business.  Something needs to be done in this area.  As the witnesses have said, there is a part for them to play as well.  There is a frustrating aspect to this.  Although I am interested in the idea, as a Deputy there are only so many things one can hold at a time.  A Deputy cannot give his time to everything.  I have been focusing on youth employment in the past two and half years and although I have been very interested in this, the time constraint has not allowed it to be pursued.<\/p><p> I am unsure how to help people who come to me.  I spoke to a person from DCU who came to me last week.  He wanted to meet to discuss an idea about a social enterprise.  What obstacles do the witnesses see if someone comes to the likes of us?  What pitfalls will they face as opposed to someone else when it comes to establishing a social enterprise in the current environment?  Where is the safest place to direct them to get the necessary support?  I realise they could be pointed to the witnesses but I am referring to beyond that.<\/p><p> The shared services model makes perfect sense but I imagine it is the same in all the communities we represent.  There were issues some time ago around reductions in the amount of funding that community employment schemes were receiving for overheads.  It would have made perfect sense for everyone to use shared services.  However, in the community I represent that would have become a local community political nightmare.  Although we see it here, how did the witnesses manage to get over the pitfalls of getting the groups the witnesses have spoken of, which are identical to the other groups in all communities, to agree that it is worthwhile to buy in to shared services and that an enterprise can have a more direct input into what it seeks to deliver by taking that approach, rather than each enterprise fighting over a building or who does salaries at the end of the month?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900006#F00600","speaker":"1023","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384870500,"counter":267,"content":"<p>The Carmichael Centre grew out of a need.  It was founded in 1998.  A number of what were for the most part community groups ended up having no home.  They lost the space they had and the model proposed that rather than all 18 groups trying to find their own space, why not come together and share simple things like photocopiers, meeting rooms and catering facilities.  Now, we have 46 groups.  The problem is there are other potential communities throughout the country that could benefit from that.  We believe small is beautiful and we deal with the small end because of particular issues.  People at the small end have great passion and dedication.  They may not be the best bookkeepers in the world or may not have the ability to do all the things they need to do.<\/p><p>  It was a simple model.  One possible failing is that it should be replicated, but what we have discovered is that it always needs some sort of spark.  The Carmichael Centre would not have happened in 1990 unless there was someone in Dublin City Council at the time who had the leadership to see the merit in the idea and that it was something we should do more.  Then, the person convinced a colleague of his in the Eastern Health Board to give us a premises.  Dublin City Council gave us a second premises and that gave us the catalyst.  These catalysts are needed to spark something.<\/p><p>  The idea makes sense.  A person can come into the Carmichael Centre and take the view that it is brilliant and that there should be more of them.  We have been trying.  My predecessors have tried to do it but unless there is some big brother or big sister to provide support, it will not happen.  However, once we see it happening we realise there should be far more of it.  We believe in it.<\/p><p>  There is vast potential at the upper end of the scale for shared services but it needs an initial push.  Whether that push comes from someone with a stick or with a nice carrot, either will do, but we need an incentive to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900007#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Diarmaid &Oacute; Corrbu&iacute;"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384870500,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I was asked about the pitfalls facing people who may be looking to set up a social enterprise.  I am making something of a generalisation but I believe when people are setting up, the biggest pitfall is that they believe their greatest need is money.  The view is that the person needs someone to write him a cheque because he has a great idea and only then can he go out and change the world.  The experience in Social Entrepreneurs Ireland has been that this approach is wrong.  If we wrote a cheque for everyone who held that view, there would be many cheques written but the social impact might not be as significant as we would wish.<\/p><p>  There are two answers to the question.  The first answer is from the social entrepreneur side.  A social entrepreneur may believe that the biggest pitfall is money but I contend that the biggest pitfall is getting good robust planning, which involves thinking through the idea first.  Many people have the enthusiasm and the passion but if a venture is to succeed more is required.<\/p><p>  At Social Entrepreneurs Ireland we are interested in more than funding organisations for two years.  Although, we do that as well and we allocated funding of &euro;500,000, all of which was privately raised, last week to eight projects.  That is pointless if our funding finishes and then they fold as organisations.  One could argue that is simply a wasted investment.  How do we stop that from happening?  We need to have an organisation in place that has thought through what it is going to do, how it is going to get to the people it seeks to serve, how it will grow and what it will do in terms of income or funding and related planning.  There are huge resources available for people to take that step.  If someone comes to us with a robust plan, the likelihood of that person getting the money is significantly increased.  I point social entrepreneurs to resources like information from our website.  The Carmichael Centre has information.  The Wheel, a co-ordinating body, has plenty of information on its website.  The social enterprise and entrepreneurship task force has a resources section.  In a way, it is not sexy work but for the people who really want to make this happen, it is possible to see the potential.<\/p><p>  Not everyone is going to be a leader.  Everyone has a role to play but not everyone will be in start-up mode.  I am referring to people who drive the enterprise forward.  Other people need to come behind them.  We need to get behind the leaders and, for the other people, we need to point them towards different opportunities for engagement.<\/p><p>  The second answer to the question is how to encourage people to take the step of thinking through and planning first, before they go looking for a cheque.  There is an analogy with investment in the commercial sector.  In the commercial sector there are investors at all stages of the development of a company.  There are friends and family when a business is starting out first.  There are angels who, typically, put a small amount of money behind a person because they believe the person has potential.  There are early-stage venture capital firms, private equity firms and banks to provide financing.  As a company grows there is money and there are investors who are prepared to have those conversations across all stages of development.<\/p><p>  One of the greatest challenges we face as a sector is that we do not have investors or funders at all stages of development.  That dynamic means it is possible to have the hard conversations and that the people involved realise they have to get their planning and structure together to have a chance of getting support from a particular class of investor.  That is why the Social Innovation Fund is critical.  Social Entrepreneurs Ireland plays a role at early stages.  There are other types of funding from well-established trusts and foundations and various philanthropic sources at later stages.  However, there are gaps.<\/p> <p>That means that we do not have conversations with social entrepreneurs, they do not put in place robust plans and their chances of success are somewhat diminished.  It does not cost a lot of money to develop a structure.  If funders are concentrated on each stage of the journey then social entrepreneurs will have a much more robust organisations.  I would point them towards the resources needed to come up with plans because that is where they will get the money.  The money will follow; it is not the other way around.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384871100,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coughlan for his comments and call Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900008#H00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1384871100,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late but I was delayed coming from Cork.  Having listened to others talk I have realised that the sector has great potential.<\/p><p>  Last Thursday I attended a conference held at the European Parliament Office on Molesworth Street organised by a European social enterprise group.  I heard part of the conversation that took place.  I wish to draw on the interesting analogy made by Mr. Coughlan that most small companies are social enterprises because they invest money into either paying themselves a wage, fund capital or whatever.  He spoke passionately about growing a business, the various funding mechanisms available along the way and that there are great gaps in funding when one goes into the workplace.  I agree with him that there are many similarities between social enterprise and normal entrepreneurship and that there are great gaps in the funding available for social entrepreneurship.   We have a great opportunity to get some money for social entrepreneurship from Europe because this is a new conversation.  At the conference last week I heard that a conference has been arranged for January in Strasbourg and I think somebody from the committee should attend.<\/p><p>  Social entrepreneurship is an interesting new area.  As some members will be aware, I have been involved in the area through the establishment of the Cork Foundation last March.  It was established in order to match funding provided by the diaspora and invest in Cork by funding enterprise, entrepreneurship, businesses and social entrepreneurship.  We held our founders' dinner last Friday night and funded our first entrepreneur, which is based at the Rubicon business centre, and a further &euro;15,000 was given to a cr&egrave;che in the North Lee area.  There is great financial starvation at present and people cannot find money.<\/p><p>  Mr. Coughlan is right that one needs soft support and people who specialise in sustainability, leadership and mentoring.  Everything should be interlinked but it seems that we are dealing with social enterprise and the SME sector separately.  We have a great opportunity to merge both types of entrepreneur because we are all trying to treat the same issues.  Any community in a rural part of Ireland that wants to survive needs a co-op or social enterprise scheme that will bring businesses together so that they can afford to pay an accountant, the rates bill and other bills.  They could all work together in a shared fashion.  The day of setting up a business on one's own and surviving in a small town is gone.  A lot of conversation needs to take place.  There is not much difference between social enterprise and businesses.  <\/p><p>  I missed what Mr. Mulconry said on taxation and I ask him to repeat his comments.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900008#H00300","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384871100,"counter":272,"content":"<p>The form of grant conforms with a proposal that would allow anybody who wishes to set up a trust or foundation to retain the taxable benefit for themselves rather than the entity that they donate into.  At present, if one donates to charity the taxable benefit goes to the charity rather than the individual.  If one is chasing large donations and going after very large amounts of money, it is very difficult to get to those people.  The only people who get to them on a regular basis are tax advisers.  We seek a hoop that will allow us to reach the tax adviser and then reach the individual for very large donations or to set up a foundation themselves.  We need to create some organisations or entities that can deal in very large amounts of money so that the game changer idea can be funded.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy mentioned, there are gaps in the entire life cycle of social enterprises.  Some ideas or organisations reach a certain scale where they can provide a national benefit but they need access to large funds.  That is why we are trying to have more trusts and foundations so that we can fund such an initiative.<\/p><p>  I shall outline one of the must frustrating elements of my job.  People assume that I am a grant giver because I am an executive director of Philanthropy Ireland and all kinds of people with brilliant ideas arrive at my office.  To be honest, of the 60 ideas that I have received since I joined Philanthropy Ireland I would recommend three of them for a serious conversation and only one for funding.  <\/p><p>  I will outline some of the ideas that I have received.  Recently I spoke to somebody who has an idea and the technology to create a food bank for the greater Dublin area.  A food bank is not about waste food being redistributed to the poor; it is about surplus food in the system not being wasted.  The initiative would save thousands of euro for the  charities who distribute food and solve a waste problem for companies.  There are protocols in place that would ensure that the food bank can be done in such as way that it does not involve second rate food being given to people or a brand problem for a company later on.  There are some game changer ideas.  I refer to times when one looks across the table at a person and thinks their idea could make a difference.  At present we do not have entities that can fund such activity but we need them.  That is why we are so anxious to get increased funding into the philanthropic sector.  It would mean that we could fund such initiatives and things that are unpopular.<\/p><p>  If one asks most people on the street one will discover that they will not give money to fund ex-prisoners.  If one can get a person not to return to jail then one will save a fortune.  It costs more to keep an individual in jail for one year than it costs for all of his or her education up to and including degree level.  We spend a lot of money keeping people in poverty.  A smarter use of money would save ourselves a lot but that depends on a vibrant philanthropic sector.  As I said earlier, Irish people are very generous but we need to get them to add a little bit of thought to their generosity thus ensuring more effective spending.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900008#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Mulconry"},{"type":"speech","time":1384871100,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Was taxation changed in 2011?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900008#H00500","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384871100,"counter":274,"content":"<p>It was.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900008#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Mulconry"},{"type":"speech","time":1384871100,"counter":275,"content":"<p>That was done at the request of the charity sector which is something that I could never understand.

I agree with Deputy Collins that social enterprises and enterprises are the same.  I find it interesting that we tend to draw a divide between them.  What is the divide between a social enterprise and a commercial business?  Functionally they operate in the marketplace, they compete on quality of product, service and value for money.  When one drills it down the only difference is where the profits go when a company is successful and profitable, either it goes to a set of individuals comprising shareholders or owners or it goes back into making a bit of a difference in the world.  That is the fundamental difference between the two.  Why would we, as a State or country, show bias towards one rather than the other?  Why would we be biased towards supporting, in a very substantial manner, the companies where profits go towards benefitting a select number of individuals?  I mean biased in the sense of not having supports in place, equal support and parity of support and access.  I mean biased against companies where profits go to the general community.  Other than that both types of enterprise are the same.  Therefore, I endorse and fully concur with the perspective outlined by Deputy Collins.  It seems to me that the economic benefits are the same because both create jobs and contribute to the local economy.  Social enterprise provides a higher amount of social benefits.

Other jurisdictions have definitely looked at this and put in place structures that are either limited by guarantee with no share capital, which allows no profits to be distributed out to owners, or limited companies with share capital.  For example, in the UK there CICs - community interest companies - which allow ownership of a company, which is a legal structure, but they limit the amount of profits that can be returned to the owners.  If the company is not profitable, there is nothing to give out, but if the company is profitable, there is a cap on how much of those profits can be returned to owners or shareholders.  Anything in excess of that has to be reinvested back into the social mission.<\/p><p>  What this does, interestingly, is open up investment in capital markets to those companies to which they would not otherwise have access.  Commercial investors may want to get some return on their investment.  As a result of the social mission, they may be prepared to take below-market rate returns on their investment but they do not want to give the money and get nothing back for it.  Therefore, one opens up a whole new class of capital for investment, which is a good thing.<\/p><p>  In the US, another take on this is that companies that had a social mission built into them were very reluctant to invest a substantial part of their profits back into that social mission because, essentially, they could get sued by their shareholders for not fulfilling their fiduciary responsibility, which is to maximise shareholder profit and value.  Therefore, there is a new company entity in the US, called the B Corp or benefit corporation.  This allows a company to legally insert a social mission into a for-profit company.  The company is still profitable but it protects the company from litigation in the event that it actually grows and wants to give something back to society.  California was one of the first states in the US to introduce this legislation and many of the US states are starting to introduce this structure, on a state-by-state basis.<\/p><p>  In answer to the Deputy's question, we do not have anything like that here.  There are either two options.  It is either a company with share capital or a company limited by guarantee.

Among the industries we attract into Ireland, we can attract them into specific locations.  When Accenture set up its shared services centre in Dublin, it was told it would need to set up the centre between the canals and that if it tried to do it on a site outside the main centre of town, it would not be able to do it because it could not recruit the right people for it.  If one is now doing something in the digital space, one is also going for Dublin's inner city.<\/p><p>  Technically, everybody says that, with modern technology, you can run a business from anywhere.  Guess what?  You cannot.  Most of these businesses run on people and the people need to be in a central location.  If one wants to recruit for the high-tech sector, it will be recruiting people those who are in the city centre and down on the digital alley.  The beauty of social enterprises is that they tend to be small local businesses dealing with local needs, so they can be encouraged anywhere throughout the country.  There is a real problem for policymakers at the moment.  If one goes down the high street of any medium-sized town in Ireland, one will see shops closing like there was no tomorrow.  A lot of that business is migrating to very large supermarkets.  What happens to those towns?  What are people going to do if there are not small local businesses?  There really is an onus on policymakers to start thinking how we can replace with other enterprises some of those small local businesses and shops which are not going to survive.  I believe social enterprise can play a role.

Forf&aacute;s was commissioned to publish a report on the potential for social enterprise in this country.  That report was published in June of this year.  I emphasise that we are very encouraged by the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, to co-ordinate social enterprise across Government.  The Forf&aacute;s report contains a number of recommendations around leadership development, procurement, financing and funding, and policy development.  Essentially, that is a blueprint for how this sector can be developed and reach its potential in Ireland.<\/p> <p>We are asking the Government to act as soon as it can to implement the report's recommendations.<\/p><p> In terms of European funding, the social business initiative launched by the EU two years ago is specifically tasked with encouraging social entrepreneurship and social enterprise across the Union.  Its remit extends to the end of this decade as part of the broad Europe 2020 strategy.  The conference in Strasbourg that was mentioned several times during this session is being driven by the social business initiative.  A fund of &euro;90 million has been developed under the initiative for investment in social enterprise.  In fact, that is a seed allocation, the intention being to leverage it tenfold using the European Investment Bank.  In other words, we are potentially looking at a fund of &euro;900 million for social enterprise projects.  These moneys will be distributed to agencies which will then select local social enterprises in which to invest.<\/p><p> This initiative is indicative of the substantial commitment to social enterprise at EU level.  I would strongly encourage both the Government and the committee to support it.  An expert group has been established whose function is essentially to determine policy under the initiative.  Its membership includes representatives of the sector, that is, individuals involved in social enterprises and in agencies that support social enterprise.  Paul O'Sullivan, chief executive officer of Clann Credo, is the Irish representative.  The expert group reserves a majority of its membership slots for nominees from member state Governments.

As such, there is no reason that social enterprises cannot tap into the infrastructure.  We certainly can work to achieve progress in this area.  Would it be useful to classify enterprise centres with incubator units as social enterprises?  Should start-up courses for businesses include a specific aspect on social enterprises?

Government funding has been cut in many areas, but we continue to grant aid many of the organisations we are discussing here without, unfortunately, effectively encouraging and rewarding those which work the hardest, engage with shared services and so on.

There are somewhere between 8,000 and 12,000 charities in Ireland, more than half of which are local, community-based organisations which are volunteer only and employ no staff.  Another 20% employ fewer than five people, with only 2% having more than 50 staff.  The sector is very fragmented but I would not say there are too many charities.  In fact, we probably have fewer per head of population than is the case in the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>  The problem is that we do not provide sufficient support to those charities that need to go to a certain scale.  The market signals are not strong enough and there is not the degree of openness and transparency one would require.  Those charities which move on and expand need to look at the best way of delivering their services.  They do not have the same profit motives as private sector enterprises and, therefore, are less inclined to engage with shared services.  These organisations may need incentives to examine their cost base.  When they grow to a certain size, they should be examining whether, for example, there is a need to replicate all their back office functions.  This is an issue applying to only a small segment of the sector.<\/p><p>  The main difficulty is that the social enterprise sector is neither recognised nor understood.  We do a lot of work around the country providing social and enterprise training.  If one goes to the county enterprise board and mentions social enterprise, one is met with blank faces.

I now have the good fortune of being nominated by the current Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, for a further period of three years.  I consider both nominations an honour and privilege.<\/p><p>  Committee members will have read my biographical document.  The majority of my professional life was spent in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  I was deputy chief executive for eight years and chief executive for just over five years.  I hold a degree in computer science from Trinity College Dublin and a masters degree in industrial engineering from University College Dublin, UCD.  I also have the good fortune of holding a number of honorary degrees.  I completed the Institute of Directors company direction examinations in 2010 and I am currently in the process of completing the chartered director programme.  That is a qualification relating to corporate governance.<\/p><p>  I will tell the committee a little about my time as chairperson of the Health and Safety Authority over the last three years, but I will first remind it of some of the background of the authority.  Its mandate, as set out in over 200 legislative measures, is: to regulate the safety, health and welfare of people at work and those affected by work activities; to promote improvement in the safety, health and welfare of people at work; to regulate and promote the safe manufacture, use, placing on the market, trade and transport of chemicals, while enhancing innovation and competitiveness; to act as surveillance authority in respect of relevant European Single Market legislation.<\/p><p>  The authority has a number of major roles.  It is the national statutory body with responsibility for ensuring workers, both employed and self-employed, and those affected by work activity are protected from work related injury and ill health.  We do this by enforcing occupational health and safety<b><\/b>law, promoting accident prevention and providing information and advice across all sectors, including agriculture.  The authority is the lead national competent authority for a number of chemicals<b><\/b>regulations.  Our responsibility in this area is to protect human health and the environment, to enhance competitiveness and innovation and ensure free movement of chemicals in the EU market.  In this role we provide protection to all of the citizens of Ireland.  We are a key agency involved in market surveillance<b><\/b>and ensuring the safety of products used in workplaces and consumer applications.<\/p><p>  Our remit is very wide.  We cover every workplace in the State and, through our responsibility for chemicals, every person in the State is affected by our work in one way or another.  The breadth of our remit is such that it touches on that of a number of other regulators, Government Departments, their offices and other agencies.  To ensure the most effective and efficient operation and deployment of valuable State resources we enter into memoranda of understanding, MOU, and bilateral and multilateral working arrangements with these other organisations.  These include an MOU with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA; Commission for Energy Regulation, CER; Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Railway Safety Commission; Teagasc; Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA; Revenue Commissioners; Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, and many more.  We have more than 25 such collaborative arrangements in place.<\/p><p>  I was fortunate that my predecessor Jim Lyons and his board, as well as previous chairpersons and boards, had left a well run and effective organisation in place.  Like all public sector bodies we have had to reduce staffing and expenditure and this has been achieved while doing our best to maintain our success in reducing workplace deaths and serious injuries.  Ireland still has one of the lowest non-fatal injury rates in the EU and the rate of worker fatalities is about average, even though staffing in the Health and Safety Authority is lower than in comparable organisations across the EU.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding that performance when compared with the EU peer group, I am acutely aware of the trauma arising for people on a daily and weekly basis when there is a fatality or serious workplace accident.  Such events have a huge impact on family, friends, work colleagues and communities.  One of the most upsetting things for me since accepting the post of chairperson is the e-mail I receive, at random times, informing me that a fatality has occurred.  Almost every week and sometimes twice or more in the same week I get an e-mail alerting me to another fatality in the workplace.  No international comparisons can make this acceptable.  There is no acceptable minimum number of fatalities.  Despite our progress, we still have nearly 50 workplace fatalities each year and more than 6,600 reported accidents requiring a person to be absent from work for more than three days.  Based on Central Statistics Office, CSO, data, it is estimated that there are more than 1.18 million days lost to the economy due to work related illness and accidents.  If this occurred due to any other cause, it is likely that we would be addressing it as a national priority, but these events are distributed geographically and in time, so they do not create a major national consciousness.<\/p> <p>As part of the transformation of the public service, we have seen our budget and our head count reduced by over 20%, while demand for our service has continued to increase and our remit has been extended through legislation.<\/p><p> It was apparent at an early stage that the changed economic circumstances needed a change in emphasis.  We had an early and continuing win in the area of reducing the cost of compliance for small and medium-sized employers.  In a very short amount of time, the staff of the authority put together an innovative online tool, known as BeSMART, to enable small enterprises to protect the safety of their employees without having to employ expensive outside consultants.  Thousands of employers have enrolled and the cost savings have been substantial.  A major disappointment for us is the diminished level of support we are now obliged to provide to the pharmachem, ICT and medical devices sectors due to the loss of specialist scientists and engineers.  This is a major challenge to the authority.  It requires leadership and smart thinking on the part of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have lost a number of specialist staff to the private sector in the past three years.  We have not been able to replace them due to lack of support from the Department.<\/p><p> The authority has used technology widely to improve efficiency and effectiveness in its operations.  We have also used our website and social media to communicate our message.  We have developed an e-learning service which we use as a tool to change the culture in the workplace.  We have changed the manner in which we conduct workplace inspections and visits.  We now focus on achieving voluntary compliance through a risk-based approach and on giving advice.  More than 90% of all inspections result in verbal or written advice.  Where there are serious breaches or failures in duty of care or an unwillingness to take corrective measures on a voluntary basis, we use the enforcement tools available and we pursue non-compliant duty holders through the courts.<\/p><p> In recent years, the authority has invested a great deal of effort in assisting with the consolidation of legislation and ensuring guidance is available as soon as regulations are made.  This has made it much easier for employers and employees to find out what they need to do.  I think the authority&rsquo;s consultative process in the development of legislative proposals is second to none.  It helps to ensure the fitness for purpose and proportionality of health and safety regulation.  We will not maintain our successes unless we find ways of increasing the authority&rsquo;s reach to counterbalance the smaller number of staff.  I have initiated a project to review the way the authority performs its business activities with a view to identifying more effective ways of working, for example, by making more use of mobile technology and technology in general.<\/p><p> My earnest hope and that of the authority is that the figures with regard to accident and fatality rates in the workplace, ill health and the safe use of chemicals will continue to go in the right direction.  I assure the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and this committee that any failure in this regard will not be due to a lack of effort on my part.  I would like to conclude by complimenting the executive and the staff of the Health and Safety Authority for their outstanding commitment to such a noble cause.  Because of their efforts, more and more workers go to work and return safely every day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900011#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Horgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384873500,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Horgan and Mr. O'Halloran.

We are trying to encourage more and more companies to use this service as it develops.  We believe BeSMART can be used as a tool to enable a different kind of approach to workplace inspections to be taken.<\/p><p>  The point I was making in my initial statement about the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was that we have lost specialist staff - engineers and toxicologists - to the private sector.  Although we have done everything that has been asked of us in terms of numbers, etc., under the employment control framework, we have not been able to get permission to replace those people or train others to take up those positions.  I referred to the need for \"leadership and smart thinking\" because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been doing a great job on the macroeconomic issues but, in my opinion, needs to make difficult decisions on certain micro issues.  Public service organisations that need particular resources which are not available elsewhere in the system are falling through the cracks because of the specialist nature of their work.<\/p><p>  I will give some examples of areas in which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform needs to show leadership and make difficult decisions, even if it might be criticised in some quarters for doing so.  Additional resources might be needed for a number of projects in areas like information and communications technology and nanotechnology.  To give an example that does not relate to technology, Dublin City Council is planning to build a long sea outfall tunnel, but we do not have the in-house expertise to provide services in that regard.  That is an example of an issue in respect of which we need the Department to show \"leadership and smart thinking\".<\/p><p>  The number of inspections carried out by the authority this year is likely to be approximately 10,000.  There has been a significant decrease over the years.  The figure probably exceeded 15,000 in 2008 and 2009.  The number of inspections has decreased because our numbers have dropped by approximately 20%.  Our people numbers have probably dropped by approximately 30%.  There continues to be a risk basis to our inspections.  The algorithm we use internally to identify areas for inspection focuses on high-risk areas.  Low-risk areas tend not to be inspected, or are inspected on foot of a random audit.<\/p> <p>While the number is important, most of our inspections at this stage result in advice and guidance.  It is almost a consultancy-type meeting.  We would like to look at smarter ways of doing that.  We have started to look at whether there are other ways we can change the culture within enterprises and agriculture to get those numbers down.  The number of fatalities seem to be stuck at about the 45% to 50% mark no matter how much effort we put into them.  It is not acceptable that we resign ourselves to that.  We need to come up with smarter ways to get the culture to change and to get people to realise the risks they are taking.  Yes, we are down but we think we are still making the impact we have always made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900012#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Horgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384874100,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions.

We have concentrated more on internal issues relating to Ireland and have done so with the level of staffing we have.  We are no different to any other public body in that we are challenged with the reduced level of funding available to us.  At all times, we have endeavoured to meet that challenge and come up with solutions by either moving staff or reducing things we would consider less important than the critical issues we must address.

Bullying is part of an issue within employment and should be part of employers' risk assessment and policy documents on health and safety in the workplace.  It is something that comes up fairly regularly and is usually dealt with at a local level.  The part that will become of greater interest will be stress in the workplace, which is linked to bullying.  How we deal with stress in the workplace as part of health and safety is the part that will be a challenge in the future because sometimes it is not considered to be part of general health and safety issues.  Mr. O'Halloran can add to that if he wishes when he is dealing with the first question.  <\/p><p>  The board of the authority discussed the issue of corporate manslaughter at about the middle of this year.  As members know, the offence of corporate manslaughter has been introduced in the UK and there have been two cases in Northern Ireland since its introduction.  We discussed it to form a view in case it came back to us.  I could not say there was a general consensus within the authority in terms of recommending the introduction of such a charge.  My guess is that it would be something the authority would support.  We did not and were not asked to reach a decision.

As Mr. Horgan said, at that stage, it was considered by the board but no definitive position was concluded.  To put it into context, while we do not have the offence of corporate manslaughter, the courts treat breaches of health and safety very seriously and even in the past year, have handed down fines of &euro;1 million, &euro;500,000 and &euro;350,000 and custodial sentences with the latest one about three weeks' ago being a two-year custodial sentence suspended.  The courts treat the breaches very seriously.<\/p> <p>Section 80 of the 2005 Act provides that charges may be preferred against an individual in respect of his or her failures.  That has been a very significant provision and has led to significant cases being brought forward in the courts.  On the question about the construction sector, the authority commissioned a research study carried out by the employment organisation.  It specifically assessed if the attitudes, behaviours and the outcomes for non-Irish workers were different from those relating to Irish workers.  The study looked at 200 construction companies and 600 people, 300 of whom were non-Irish nationals.  There were no stark differences.  Some of the notable findings were that the perception among non-Irish national workers interviewed was that the awareness and sense of responsibility demonstrated by employers in Ireland was at least equivalent to or better than in their home country.  This was not a homogenous finding because experiences differed, depending on the country of origin of the workers.  In general, the level of awareness of occupational safety and health in Ireland, based on a study carried out by the European agency in Bilbao, ranks us as varying between first and second, depending on the country.  That study has informed our construction sector policy.  We will carry out 2,500 planned inspections in 2014.  We are finding that one of the biggest issues is working at heights, very often on small construction sites.  When inspectors visit workplaces they will always be cognisant of the duty of the employer to ensure that staff are briefed and communicated with and this must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the legislation, which means, in a language accessible to them, which could mean in their own language.  We translated many of our leading information documents into the main foreign languages spoken, including Polish, Mandarin and others.  When an inspector visits a site, he or she will invariably seek to speak with the safety representative.  We are very attuned to the particular and specific needs of workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013111900013#N00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin O'Halloran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384874700,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I understand a code of practice to deal with bullying is in place but it is not enforceable.

He gave an undertaking to the Houses of the Oireachtas during the passage of the Act.  The report was done by Indecon.  It estimated that the economic cost of failures was in the region of 2.1% of GNP.  The report also studied a number of costs to the economy and to business.  A later analysis was based on the BeSMART tool.  It was estimated that the savings to business based on a departmental analysis using a standardised cost model was in excess of &euro;40 million as a result of a reduction in the regulatory burden.  We have received testimonials from individual small firms who quote savings between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000 from the use of this tool.  The feedback continues to be very positive.

We represent all of the wave and tidal energy interests on the island of Ireland.  We are a very unusual body because we represent North and South; the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive are represented on our council in an observer capacity.<\/p><p>  The first thing for us to appreciate is the extraordinary gift given to us by nature with the world's most energy intensive waves occurring off the west coast.  We also have extensive wind resources on land and offshore but we do not deal with that industry.  The bulk of our tidal resource is off the north east coast, County Antrim, where 400 MW, which represents 7% of the total installed capacity in the Republic of Ireland, to generate electricity has been consented by the Crown estate in two separate projects.  Three of the four promoters involved transact from the Republic, including Bord G&aacute;is.  These potentially job rich developments would not be possible in this jurisdiction because the enabling legal framework has not existed.  What is there is totally unsuitable and the framework will not exist until this Bill becomes law.<\/p><p>  A study commissioned by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland in the Republic, and Invest Northern Ireland in the North, suggested that as many as 60,000 new jobs could be created in this industry by 2030.  Even at this early stage of the industry's emergence 250 people are employed on the island of Orkney in Scotland, where the European marine energy test centre is located.  There is effectively full employment there between oil, gas and particularly ocean energy in recent times.<\/p><p>  We welcome the Bill because we see it as one key to unlocking the job potential of ocean energy.  One of our key messages is that, following due parliamentary process and scrutiny, it is vital that this Bill be given priority and pass into law in 2014.  This is so for all sorts of reasons, first, to give the world a positive signal that Ireland is open for business in this industry.  It has been regarded as closed for business because of the lack of enabling legislation and other factors.  Various projects are waiting in the wings to go ahead once the Bill becomes law.  Timescales in the energy industry are very long so delays have a huge effect.<\/p><p>  What does all of this mean for the environment?  We support a plan-led approach in this area.  We do not want to see random developments.  The approach taken by this Bill, and the view of our association, is that everything should progress in keeping with Our Ocean Wealth, the policy document published by the Government a year or so ago.  This provides an overarching policy document and framework for the marine.  There has been no significant environmental impact arising from wave and tidal experimental devices in the water in Scotland, which is the leading wave and tidal location even though it has a lesser wave resource than Ireland because it has given top political priority to winning the jobs prize, and it is an enormous prize, in ocean energy.  Numerous devices have been in use for many years off Scotland.<\/p><p>  Several array projects have been given consent after thorough investigation but we are not complacent.  This is a new technology.  It is in the sea and the environment is a very sensitive issue so every project must be thoroughly investigated.  The purpose of a robust consenting system is to allow the most rigorous investigations to be made in a consistent manner, overseen by an appropriate authority.  We believe that this bill provides that.  To give a practical example of environmental impact, the first ocean energy device to be connected to the grid three years ago was SeaGen in Strangford Lough.  If any of the committee members have visited Strangford they will have seen it sitting out there in the middle of the Lough.  It is not the prettiest sight in the world but it is an early experimental device.  Almost all modern tidal devices are beneath the surface.  One cannot actually see them.  This device is monitored morning, noon and night, 365 days a year, by independent observers and there is no known impact on wildlife although there is quite a large seal population in the area.  In visual terms, most wave energy devices could be located 10 km offshore, over the horizon, while those located near the shore will be either at the surface or beneath the surface and will not be visible.<\/p><p>  We are very encouraged by the detail revealed so far in the Bill about the criteria which would enable, or not, applicants to proceed and put developments for ocean energy into the sea, for example, it requires that applicants must demonstrate their financial strength and their technical capacity to deliver projects, and so on, all of which is important to avoid land grabs.  We have strongly advocated that marine renewables projects should be treated as strategic infrastructure and this is addressed in the Bill.  Wave and tidal energy is capital intensive.  It meets consumer needs from sustainable resources.  It is in line with EU policy and will give us energy security.  Ireland is one of the least energy secure countries in western Europe despite her extraordinary natural resources.  The MRIA believes that the only practical and appropriate way forward is to treat all marine renewables projects as strategic and that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the only body with the authority and ability to develop and attract appropriate resources and to act as the consenting authority.  Overall, we think this is a vital bill and urge upon the Oireachtas the need to give it priority.  I know that it is very dry and technical legislation but it is of critical importance to developing this industry and to job creation.  We believe that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has done a good job on this Bill so far and commend it to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900003#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Coyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1384862700,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coyle.

We have so much wealth in our resources that how we keep and use them is very important.  Five years ago I was very excited about marine technology but my excitement has waned somewhat because it is taking so long.  I would like to hear from Mr. Coyle about a company called Wavebob.  I do not know the company but because I am from the west I kept an eye on it.  Is it in Scotland now?  I have lost track.  We need to learn more.

That will be a small demonstration project but is very important for the industry to take off in Ireland.  It is intended to prove that the technology works in the Atlantic environment and will demonstrate to the public the environmental credentials of the devices and their limited impacts, which is very important.<\/p><p>  In terms of projects such as the WestWave project, this Bill is very important because those projects do not make any sense to investors like the ESB or other utilities unless they see a bigger commercial market further down the road.  This Bill is putting the infrastructure in place to allow that to happen, so we can have visibility of how the marine leasing will be done and know there will be an efficient consenting system.

We have developed a technology called Oyster, which is a near-shore device that is essentially a flap that moves backwards and forwards in the near-shore wave.  We are a Scottish company but we have a very large amount of Irish DNA within the company, from chief executive down.<\/p><p>  It was said there are small amounts of development, which is correct, but we have definitely moved out of the test tank to the stage where, as Mr. Appelbe said, 11 full-scale devices are being tested in Orkney.  To give an idea of the economic impact that can make, our company has spent more than &pound;5 million directly in the Orkney economy, which is an economy of 20,000 people as it is quite a remote island.  We work with more than 40 local businesses on the island, upskilling dive teams and so on.  There is a very strong economic jobs story for local communities, even at the prototype stage.<\/p><p>  The importance of this Bill is the opportunity for Ireland.  As we move from single devices to first projects, such as WestWave, the one thing Scotland does not have, which Ireland does have, is grid connections.  Some 90% of the wave projects in Scotland are based on Scottish islands and none of those islands has sufficient grid connections and may not have them until much later on in this decade.  The WestWave project may, in fact, be Europe's first pre-commercial wave project, so there is a real opportunity here for Ireland to leapfrog what has happened in Scotland, given that Scotland does not have the grid connectivity.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Appelbe and Mr. Coyle said, one of the most important foundations of that is a clear consenting and licensing process.  Without the consenting and licensing process, companies do not have the ability to invest in EIAs and all of that kind of thing in order to develop the first devices.

This is only possible in very constrained areas.  In the case of Ireland, there are masses and masses of wave energy all the way down the west.  This is because of the massive reach all the way across the Atlantic, where hundreds of miles of wind have been blowing to the point where huge waves are arriving on the west coast.  There is also a lot of area, so there is very little constraint.<\/p><p>  It is possible - we would certainly say it is theoretically possible - to produce more energy from Ireland's wave energy than Ireland consumes.  However, that is not practical because wave energy is not available all of the time and it would also take an awful lot of investment and infrastructure.  Therefore, we do not know how much wave energy could be commercially included in the energy mix but it would certainly be a very significant commercial component and would certainly make a very large contribution to the energy security of Ireland if it were commercialised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900004#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harvey Appelbe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384863300,"counter":372,"content":"<p>There is going to be no single solution, no silver bullet.  The EU policy target of 2050 for decarbonisation will probably require a mix of onshore wind, offshore wind, some solar PV and some ocean, that is, wave and tidal.  It is a mix of all of those.  The challenges with some of those technologies is that they are intermittent and weather dependent.  There are benefits in having a mix of those in a portfolio of renewables.  When one is strong, for example, the sun, others might not be, but on balance they can complement one another.  We would expect to see a mix in the portfolio.  As soon as ocean energy is competitive with those other renewable technologies, it will take its share of that, although what that share is depends on how economic it is.<\/p><p>  The point about constraints is important in that some of the other technologies are constrained.  For example, there is only so much onshore wind one can have, there are only so many suitable locations where the water is shallow enough for offshore wind and solar PV would be constrained by the number of land options, whereas ocean energy gives a much less constrained potential option in the mix.  It has very good prospects.

There could be a little more of that.  However, we are moving beyond that to the customer playing a more active role in the market.  In other words, focusing on the demand and having more flexible demand will have to be a feature, with the customer playing a more active role in how and when they use electricity.  It could be things such as the use of electric vehicles and picking the right times to charge those vehicles and so forth.  That will be a feature.  Storage will also be a part of the mix.  I do not think there is any single solution.  It is a mixture of those types of solutions that will allow this level of renewables.  Our 2020 target is to reach 40% from renewables.

We welcome the broad aim of the proposed legislation to rationalise and streamline the consent and planning process in regard to marine development.  The OPW's main interest in the proposed legislation concerns the possible implications it may have for our work in the construction of flood relief schemes in coastal towns and cities where defences against tidal influences on rivers are generally necessary and where issues of foreshore consent may arise.<\/p><p>  We set out briefly in our submission the OPW's involvement in coastal protection measures and flood relief scheme development which may impact on foreshores where they comprise reaches of rivers that are subject to tidal influence.  I do not propose to read that submission into the committee record except to stress the role of local authorities in the Coast Protection Act as the initiating authority.<\/p><p>  As I indicated, the main interest of the OPW with regard to the new proposals concerns the possible impact they may have on the progression of major flood relief projects in coastal areas and, in particular, any potential for duplication or delays that may arise out of the consent process set out in the Bill.  As we outlined in our submission, while flood relief works carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act are classified as exempt development for planning purposes, the OPW is required under those Acts to follow a comprehensive public consultation process as well as statutory consultation with all relevant Departments and bodies prior to seeking the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for the works.  Also, under the Arterial Drainage Acts, the OPW is the competent authority for the environmental impact assessments and appropriate assessments, and any proposals for development or works under those Acts require screening and, if necessary, a full assessment.<\/p><p>  The proposed foreshore (amendment) Bill would appear to require that any development on the foreshore which would require an environmental impact assessment, EIA, or an appropriate assessment, AA, would be subject to approval by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is noted that the procedure for such an application will be similar to that which operates in regard to the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.  However, the terrestrial elements of a flood relief scheme development could not be examined in isolation from the aquatic elements, and <i>vice versa<\/i>, and therefore the work involved in the AA or the EIA would necessary be duplicated.  Such duplication would run counter to the objective of the Bill which is to achieve a more streamlined and efficient consent system.  The OPW would have a concern therefore that the operation of the new consent process for the foreshore developments involving an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la would not result in unnecessary duplication of work in regard to the EIA and AA requirements or in delays to the progression of flood relief works.<\/p><p>  Having regard to the exempt status of the flood relief works, the detailed and substantial consultation process to which the works are subjected under the Arterial Drainage Acts and the OPW's designation as competent authority for EIAs and AAs under those Acts, it would be the OPW's expectation that the proposed new consent process will not operate in such a way as to create any unintended obstacles to the efficient progression of such works.  The OPW will be consulting the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in regard to this matter over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  The OPW has less concern in regard to the impact of the proposed new legislation on coastal or erosion protection works, which, as explained in our submission, are generally carried out by local authorities.  It is noted in this regard that, under head 19 of the general scheme, it is proposed that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will have powers to make regulations to exempt certain activities from the requirements to obtain consent.  One of those listed activities is emergency works related to sea defences and it will be expected that most coastal or erosion protection works carried out by local authorities might fall into that category.<\/p><p>  In summary, the OPW welcomes the broad thrust of the aims proposed in the new legislation but has some concerns in regard to the potential for duplication or delay in how the new consent process will operate in regard to flood relief works carried out under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  As I said, we will consult the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on ways to minimise and, if possible, eliminate such potential delays or disruption.<\/p><p>  I would be happy to answer any questions members may have and to help the committee in any way we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900007#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1384865100,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900007#H00600","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1384865100,"counter":408,"content":"<p>In terms of coastal erosion, how is the OPW measuring the erosion levels and the rate at which erosion is occurring year on year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900007#H00700","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384865100,"counter":409,"content":"<p>We have a comprehensive Irish coastal protection strategy study that is nearing completion, as set out in our submission.

We also thought our presentation was to be at 2.30 p.m., so one of our members will come in later with some material for the committee.<\/p><p>  The Bill is comprehensive in that it covers many aspects.  However, it is standing on its own without the framework of coastal zone management.  In our view it is time to do the impossible.  If a coastal zone management framework is not in place, the demands on local authorities, in particular, will be very great.  Many of the functions which are with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, will be transferred to local authorities, in particular, the functions relating to the inter-tidal, nearshore area.  I work a lot with local authorities which are the regional co-ordinators for the coastwatch survey.  I know the capabilities and in-house expertise of the local authorities.  I fear they are being given a very great amount of extra responsibility.  To do this work well requires extra staff.  Will it be possible for them to get expert staff who are qualified in marine matters?  So far as I am aware, only one local authority has a person with good marine knowledge.<\/p><p>  Coastwatch Europe has one over-arching request.  This Bill has two aims: first, to align the foreshore consensus into the planning system, and second, to provide a coherent mechanism to facilitate and manage development activity in the exclusive economic zone, EEZ.  Coastwatch Europe urges the committee to add a third aim, to ensure the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation and decision-making will be fully integrated into the foreshore area.  At present, Ireland has made significant strides in implementing the Aarhus Convention.  We were very late but we took it on board in the environmental area.  However, it peters out at the shore, as it were.  Coastwatch Europe has scrutinised the Bill for its compliance with the Aarhus Convention and we believe the Bill as drafted will still be seriously lacking in several areas with regard to access to information, public participation and access to justice, mainly because it omits the fisheries and agriculture sectors.  That omission means Ireland will not be compliant with the Aarhus Convention.  That is the main reason and there are other areas, in particular with regard to erosion control.  Coastwatch Europe urges the committee to consider that the marine environment is ten times bigger than our land area.  It is our commons in that it belongs to all of us.  If Ireland could present a new foreshore Act which is a model of public participation and access to justice, this will be noticed abroad.<\/p><p>  There are two other areas where we believe something could be done and which are detailed in our written submission.  The first area is ownership.  There is a morass of contradictory information or none at all about who owns what on the foreshore.  This new Bill should be the means of providing clarity about the estimated several thousand bits of foreshore which belong to individuals.  Otherwise it will be very difficult to have coherent management.  We know from experience that whenever anything unforeseen happens on the shore, everyone scurries to their books to try to find out whether anybody owns anything.  Days can be lost in this search and if the activity on the foreshore is illegal, this delay is serious.<\/p><p>  The Bill contains some key proposals which should be explored in more detail to ascertain the cost implications and the need to amend other legislation.  For example, environmental impact statements and appropriate assessments are to be carried out by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  If a local authority with a coastal zone like that of my county of Wexford or like Donegal, with a lot of Natura 2000 sites, is asked to extend its five year development plan to include the low water mark, it will not have control over the Natura 2000 sites - anything to do with planning must go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la - and also no control over anything with regard to aquaculture.  The local authorities are in a very difficult position because they can only control so much.  All of the activities they do not control will need access to shore.  Somebody needs to drive to shore or to walk to shore and this will have an impact on the shore.  It would be extremely useful to have a collaboration framework - coastal zone management - or some form of management unit to bring everything together.  It could be established as a new task force.  The Minister has set up two task forces to deal with the marine and with Food Harvest 2020 and our ocean wealth.  If he were to set up a third task force on coastal zone management and coherent protection and management of the coastal zone between the different actors, that could be a way of having the Bill within that framework. <\/p><p>  I wish to make some brief points on climate change.  The foreshore Bill should take climate change much more into account than it does.  I was in Belfast where the Northern Irish authorities are looking at their shoreline management adjustments for climate change.  We might be able to do quite a lot of work on a cross-Border basis.<\/p> <p> I also wish to highlight that the foreshore end of the cross-Border issues is a hairy area.  Quarries are operating North and South without licences.  Aquaculture companies are also operating without licences.  Donegal County Council has applied for a compulsory purchase order, CPO - perhaps it has gone through - regarding the Lough Foyle foreshore, which the North believes belongs to it.  However, the application went to our Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The cross-Border area needs particular attention.<\/p><p> I will leave it there.  My comments were meant to give members an idea of the overall scope.  We also performed an audit, as there were a few small, unintentional errors in the Bill.  They can be examined easily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900009#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karin Dubsky","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384866900,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dubsky.

My colleague, Mr. John Wilde Crosbie, is a barrister and has taken a court case on this matter.  Perhaps he will be able to elaborate on the details of this situation.  Basically, people are functioning without licences but as though they had licences.  This means that there is no democracy.  For several years, they have continued to operate on the foreshore.  One cannot control anything because they do not have licences.  One cannot refer to a breach of a licence.  Under a change in the fisheries Act, they are allowed to operate in Natura 2000 sites as though they had licences.  This is an example of where there is no access to justice or public information.<\/p><p>  The Department is trying to improve this situation.  In recent months, it considered Castlemaine Harbour and the Minister supplied more than 40 licences in one go.  We examined the cumulative impact of these.  Each licence was checked separately by the Marine Licence Vetting Committee, MLVC, which has never published a report of any kind and the members of which are selected by the Minister.  We were told that cumulative impacts had not been taken into account.  This was in breach of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive and we appealed to the Aquaculture Licensing Appeals Board, ALAB.  When we asked for the conditions applying to the licences that the Minister had just granted, we were told that we could not get them.  An ALAB appeal is costly and we can only afford one or two.

It expired, but the operation continued for three years without any licence.  In 2006, the then Minister amended the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 to provide that, if one had an application for a licence pending, one could continue to fish under one's older licence.  This is what happened in Lough Swilly.  The people who are seeding and dredging implanted oysters, which displace the natural oysters that local fishermen used to dredge, have been operating without a licence for longer than they did with their original licence.<\/p><p>  Under a provision in the 1997 Act, the Minister would determine an application for a licence within four months.  If that was not possible, the Minister would give reasons and extend the period.  However, this section was never brought into force.  Instead, the then Minister introduced an amendment to the Act in 2006 allowing the applicant for a licence renewal to operate as if he or she possessed a licence.  The judge in the case referred to the possibility that the Statute of Limitations would allow the person to gain permanent rights in the area after a period of 20 years or so on, given the fact that his or her activity was currently unlicensed.<\/p><p>  For this reason, Ms Dubsky suggests in her written submission that, when the new legislation is enacted as opposed to brought into force, time limits should be applied to commencement sections, which allow the Minister to approach Acts in a piecemeal fashion.

The Oireachtas passes an Act that must be used in its entirety to make sense, yet the Minister may pick and choose what he wants to use.

We are concerned that the role of the county council under this legislation is somewhat restricted as compared with what is provided under the previous Act.  Under that Act, a development which adjoins a county council's functional area requires planning permission.  This area has been extended by the definition of the &quot;inshore zone&quot;.  We do not know the reason the inshore zone definition is restricted to bays and estuaries.  For example, if one is in Dublin Bay approaching Dalkey Island the inshore zone comes within the remit of the county council but when one turns the corner one approaches the common law foreshore which is no longer an inshore zone because the definition does not take into account the two watermarks once one leaves the bay.<\/p><p>  It would be much better perhaps if the county councils' functional area were not defined in terms of tides.  We are now entering a time of rising sea levels, which means the tide limits will change dramatically not only in terms of ownership of the land but in terms of the functional area of the county council, which is defined by reference to the inshore zone, which is tied entirely to tides which are going to change.  It would be worthwhile doing something in this area.  I regret I have not had time to read the Bill in great detail.  It seems to me our planning laws generally are tied too much to the concept of land, its use and development.  This Bill provides an opportunity to move away from this and to define the use of water.  While the Bill refers to &quot;on or over the seabed&quot;, it does not state, &quot;in the water on or over sea beds&quot;.<\/p><p>  An issue arose recently in London in a case entitled Tower Hamlets <i>v.<\/i> CityJet, which indicates that the technology of ships now plays a big part in terms of how issues need to be addressed.  CityJet have large ships which contain helicopter decks and are self-positioning, with engines pointing in all directions.  They brought these ships up into the middle of the Thames River and allowed helicopters, which had picked up people from CityJet flights wishing to travel up town, to land on them, in respect of which Tower Hamlets said it needed planning permission.  CityJet's response was that it did not because it was not using land, which it was not.  The House of Lords then twisted the words of the relevant legislation in terms of the meaning of &quot;land&quot;, which meant CityJet required planning permission to continue what it was doing.  This draws attention to the fact that the technology of ships now is such that one no longer needs to tether them to the sea bed.  Currently, one can place a ship in the exclusive economic zone, where it can remain in place with engines running, thus not making use of land anywhere.  For this reason, there is a need to consider inclusion of a definition of &quot;water&quot; as well as of &quot;land&quot;.<\/p><p>  An issue that has come to light and is the subject of a case before the Supreme Court in relation to Balbriggan Harbour, which comes under the remit of Fingal County Council, is the use of estuaries for house boats.  Because of the manner in which the functional area of the county council is defined in this Bill, a connection is required in terms of what is defined as an inshore zone.  It is possible for anyone wishing to do so to anchor in the mud a house boat or a boat which one declares is a house boat but is not but in which one proposes to live as such.  Provided that boat stays afloat at all times, it can remain anchored there without planning permission.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900012#N00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Wilde Crosbie"},{"type":"speech","time":1384868100,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I note that the name of the organisation which the witnesses represent is Coastwatch Europe.

I thank the committee for its kind invitation to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to contribute to its work on the proposed maritime area and foreshore (amendment) Bill.  My name is Peter Carvill and I am from the legislation and EU compliance unit in the national parks and wildlife area of the Department.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Dr. Eamonn Kelly, who advises on science and biodiversity matters, including nature, and also by my colleague Mr. Johnny Gorman.<\/p><p>  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has engaged with our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in the preparation of these heads and will continue to do so as the drafting process advances.  The principal focus of our engagement is helping to ensure that the proposed legislation is consistent with obligations under the EU and national law relating to nature protection sites and to certain vulnerable species of animals and birds that occur in marine areas.  <\/p><p>  The birds directive and the habitats directive oblige Ireland to protect endangered habitats and species.  This is achieved through the designation and conservation of specific sites.<\/p> <p>Ireland has 153 special protection areas, SPAs, for the protection of birds and 429 special areas of conservation, SACs, for the protection of endangered habitats and species of animals.  Some 100 SPAs and 150 SACs are either totally or partially within the marine area.<\/p><p> As members of the committee can see from the maps provided, considerable stretches of Ireland&rsquo;s coastline are included within such sites.  Development is not prohibited within these sites and many of them host multiple activities.  Any public authority considering whether to adopt or give consent to a plan or project affecting such areas is, however, bound by the requirements of the habitats directive, in particular Article 6.  These requirements include that proposals for development or for activities that could have a significant effect on the site be subject of a detailed ecological assessment called an appropriate assessment.  The outcome of such an assessment prescribes whether the project may proceed.  A project that could have an &ldquo;adverse impact on the integrity of a site&rdquo;, to use the words of the directive, cannot be consented to unless strict criteria allowing derogation can be met.<\/p><p> Responsibility for compliance with the habitats and birds directives devolves on all agencies of the State in the development and implementation of their policies as well as in the exercise of their statutory powers and functions.  Our discussions with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will focus on how these requirements of EU law will be met in regard to consents to be given under this legislative scheme.<\/p><p> Certain species, such as cetaceans, namely, whales, dolphins and porpoises, and otters are also afforded strict protection by EU law wherever they occur.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is responsible for the administration of this system of strict protection, but the impact of proposals for development in the marine environment which could affect these marine species is also considered in environmental impact assessments, under the EIA directive.<\/p><p> Ireland has been found to have fallen short of the requirements of the habitats and birds directives in a number of cases brought by the European Commission to the European Court of Justice.  Most recently, in 2007, two separate cases found failures in transposition and implementation of both directives, including how the State dealt with consents affecting protected areas.  As a result of those judgments, the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 and changes to the planning and development Acts were made.  The Irish Authorities and the European Commission are continuing to work together to address all aspects of these cases to allow for their closure.<\/p><p> A lack of compliance with EU legal requirements can lead to infringement cases against the State and can also provide an avenue for judicial review of consents.  Such litigation can result in great cost and delay, that may arise for a plan or project before the legal process is completed.  This can also impact entire sectors and undermine confidence in consent regimes.<\/p><p> Arising from those experiences, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is eager to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s legislative framework will facilitate informed policy and decision-making processes that will give certainty to all parties.  Robust legislation will help to avoid litigation and economic constraint.  We are actively engaged with our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to assist them in ensuring this legislation will meet those requirements.<\/p><p> Dr Kelly and I are happy to take any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900014#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Carvill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384869300,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carvill for his presentation.

It is one of the reasons we have worked on framing new regulations.  We revoked the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997, which were in a number of respects found to be inadequate.  Rather than trying to amend the regulations, we started from scratch and did a completely new set of regulations without undoing the work that had been done under previous regulations.  That gives a degree of legal clarity which I think is helpful.  One could say we have all been on a learning curve, and from our contacts with other member states regarding these particular directives, I do not think we are unique in that respect.  Other member states have had difficulties with these directives because they are stretching in terms of protecting nature.

I wish to give a short introduction on the Costal Concern Alliance.  Coastal Concern Alliance is a voluntary citizens' group set up in 2006 to campaign for reform of the Foreshore Act 1933 and the introduction of a system of maritime and coastal planning to ensure that development in the coastal zone is in the public interest.<\/p><p>  We welcome the recognition that the Foreshore Act 1933 must be reformed urgently and we recognise the considerable work which has gone into the preparation of the general scheme for a new Bill.  Our comments relate to development on the foreshore, mainly to offshore wind, as we have deep concerns about the undemocratic and inappropriate manner in which large-scale developments have been permitted and progressed close to Ireland's east coast under the outdated Foreshore Act 1933, without the knowledge of the vast majority of Irish citizens.  This legacy must be openly acknowledged and addressed by the Government to ensure the coastal zone is managed sustainably in the public interest into the future.  <\/p><p>  In this brief overview, I will touch on the need for reform and on how the content of the legislation addresses our key concerns.  My colleague, Ms Valerie Freeman, will address the context in which the new Bill will operate and outline a few short recommendations.  <\/p><p>  The need for reform is clear.  During the Celtic tiger era the speculation and inadequate regulation well documented on land was also very evident at sea.  Developers took advantage of the outdated foreshore legislation, drawn up in 1933 before offshore wind farms were envisaged, and of the planning vacuum in our coastal waters to obtain foreshore leases for construction of two of the biggest offshore wind farms in the world close to the coast of south Dublin and Wicklow.  The leases were awarded on the sole authority of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine with no statutory involvement of local authorities and no public right of appeal.  Other EU countries have carefully controlled offshore wind development.  However, in Ireland developers were allowed to pick out extensive near shore sites, on a first come first served basis, apply for a foreshore lease with no restriction on size or scale of development and, in some cases, sell on the leases before construction at a price reflecting the size of development permitted, netting very substantial profit. <\/p><p>  At end of 2006, some 1,620 MW of offshore wind power involving 420 huge turbines had been approved 10 km to 12 km off the coast of Wicklow, more than double the amount of offshore wind then installed worldwide which was 700 MW.  This raises very serious questions about the rigour of the Irish permitting process.  In 2008, the Minister announced significant price support for offshore wind.  This was followed by a rush of applications for foreshore development, mostly on shallow sandbanks, a protected marine habitat close to the east coast.<\/p> <p>In 2008 the Minister announced significant price support for offshore wind.  This was followed by a rush of applications for foreshore development, mostly on shallow sandbanks, a protected marine habitat close to the east coast.<\/p><p> In summary, the concerns of Coastal Concern Alliance centre on the lack of strategic planning for our seas, the inappropriate manner in which large-scale developments have been, and continue to be assessed.  The lack of importance attached to preservation of Ireland's marine habitat wildlife and coastal landscapes.  We are also very concerned about plans to export to the UK offshore wind energy generated at the expense of the Irish coastal environment.<\/p><p> I will refer briefly to the points we made with regard to the proposed legislation.  My colleague, Ms Valerie Freeman, will address the context of the legislation, which is very important in this instance, and will give some short recommendations.<\/p><p> A key provision in the Bill is the involvement of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We welcome the move to align the foreshore consent system with the land-based planning system.  Under the Foreshore Act 1933, one Minister had total control over development in the coastal zone.  Giving authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will mean that for the first time developments must be assessed by professional planners within an overall policy and planning framework.  We welcome the provision for plan-led leasing rounds and a tender process.  This should address the<b><i><\/i><\/b><i>ad hoc<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b>manner in which large sites in our nearshore zone have been allocated to offshore wind developers on a first come, first served basis, with no plan and no public tender.<\/p><p> We question whether the development of offshore winds for export can be viewed as a strategic infrastructure.  We would ask if Ireland's inshore zone should in fact be used for energy export.  This needs to be debated and agreed at national level.  We also draw attention to the commitment in the programme for Government that a cost benefit analysis should be carried out for all major infrastructure projects.  In the case of large offshore wind in our nearshore zone, important national costs would include the impact on protected scenic views and on marine wildlife.  With regard to public participation, the enhanced public participation provisions in the Aarhus Convention must be embodied in the decision-making framework.  Particular attention must be devoted to ensuring the public concerned is fully informed about proposals for major development in the inshore zone.  We recommend a 12 week public consultation and a mandatory oral hearing for major projects on the foreshore.

All EU environmental law is based on the precautionary principle.  We believe our new maritime legislation must be progressed with reference to that principle.  It must also be progressed in the public interest.  There was always a responsibility on whoever was granting permission for leases to do it in the public interest, and this was something that was emphasised in the consultation period on the Bill.  That is a really important point.<\/p><p>  A directive on a framework for maritime spatial planning, MSP, and integrated coastal zone management, ICZM, proposed by the European Commission in March of this year reads:<blockquote>In order to ensure the appropriate apportionment of maritime space among relevant uses and the coordinated management of coastal zones, a framework should be put in place that consists at least in the establishment and implementation by member states of Maritime Spatial Plans and integrated coastal zone management.<\/blockquote>Article 8 sets out &quot;Conservation, restoration and management of coastal ecosystems and coastal landscapes&quot; as a minimum requirement for integrated coastal zone management.  In line with this recommendation, Coastal Concern Alliance recommends that a buffer zone of at least 12 nautical miles be adopted in this country, as has been done in other European counties, for all significant developments in our coastal zone.<\/p><p>  In 2012, according to the European Wind Energy Association, the average distance from shore of wind farms under construction in Europe was 26 km, which contrasts with the average of 12 km in Ireland.  Applications are in the pipeline for the development of turbines that are approximately 185 m tall some 5 km from the shore in two locations, Dundalk Bay and Galway Bay.<\/p><p>  We do not believe the framework to support the Bill should be based on the draft offshore renewable energy development plan, which is a clear example of retrospective planning and should not be adopted.  In 2010, after a decade of unfettered speculative activity in Irish waters, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government moved to comply with the EU strategic environmental assessment directive by producing this plan and commissioning the strategic environmental assessment of its impacts.  With regard to wind, the plan served to rubber-stamp the extensive offshore development permitted and progressed with no plan, no strategic environmental assessment and no cost benefit analysis during the period from 2002 to 2009.  We have provided the secretariat with copies of the submission we made on that, which will provide more detail.  The strategic environmental assessment is done for this kind of plan to inform leasing decisions.<\/p><p>  We draw attention to the inclusion in the strategic environmental assessment and environmental report of a statement by the Minister stating that the EU strategic environmental assessment directive should not influence leasing or licensing applications which were in the pipeline.  This is clearly in direct contravention of the objective of the Bill and undermines the integrity of the strategic environmental assessment and the environmental report.  The result of this is that developments that were in the pipeline are inexplicably classed in the environmental report as existing renewable infrastructure.  I am not sure how familiar members are with the offshore renewable energy development plan but three scenarios are considered: high, medium and low development.  The high development scenario refers to the development of 4,500 MW of offshore wind along Ireland's coastline.  If this plan were to go ahead and form the basis for the maritime area and foreshore (amendment) Bill 2013, the outline heads of which we are discussing, it would effectively mean that 4,500 MW equates to 900 turbines of 5 MW.  Under this draft offshore renewable energy development plan, 840 of those 900 turbines would be deemed to exist and would not be subject to any strategic environmental assessment.  That is the extent to which this is really important.<\/p><p>  The second statement in the EU strategic environment assessment directive to which I wish to draw attention is that member states should ensure environmental reports are of sufficient quality to meet the requirements of the directive.  We do not believe the environmental report for this offshore renewable energy development plan is of a sufficient standard.  The environmental report itself states that data information and knowledge gaps have been identified as a key limitation to this SEA.  They can affect the level of confidence with which potential effects on the environment are identified and evaluated.<\/p> <p>In addition, the assessment itself is based on a plan that focuses on the development of a relatively new and emerging industry where longer-term environmental effects are little understood.<\/p><p> I wish to quote from the submission of the Heritage Council, which is a statutory body that reports to and advises the Government.  As regards this SEA, it stated:<blockquote>The council believes that the SEA's findings, and as a result the conclusions of the draft plan, fall short of the required level of confidence and detail.  Its conclusion as currently articulated is premature.  The report and plan, as currently drafted, do not outline the potential impacts of a &quot;do nothing&quot; scenario, which is one of the things they are required to do under the SEA directive.<\/blockquote>The Heritage Council expressed serious concerns about the inadequacy of the landscape and seascape assessments presented in the report.  It asked whether the baseline data were credible, reliable or fit for purpose.  The council said the landscape character assessments used in the SEA to provide the baseline for the seascape assessments are out of date.  Therefore, the observations of the Heritage Council are in line with serious concerns expressed by our group and others.  We believe they provide ample evidence against the adoption of this draft plan as any kind of framework for the new maritime legislation.<\/p><p> I will conclude with a few short recommendations.  We believe that an investigation should be initiated into the manner in which foreshore leases for extensive offshore developments on the Codling and Arklow Banks covering 120 sq. km. of the Wicklow coastline were awarded to private developers during the Celtic tiger years, without any strategic plan, and under regulations and legislation officially acknowledged to be inadequate.  None of this has been built, apart from seven turbines, so it is still not too late to do something about it.<\/p><p> No large-scale developments should be permitted on the foreshore until a proper system of maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal zone management based on the ecosystem approach is put in place.  The draft offshore renewable energy development plan, OREDP, should not be adopted by the current Government.  A full cost benefit analysis for any projects deemed to be strategic infrastructure, with landscape and wildlife impacts considered, should be carried out.<\/p><p> The proposed Bill should be amended to ensure proper weight is given to the protection of Ireland's coastal landscapes and seascapes, and the conservation of coastal views listed in county development plans.  To this end, a 12 nautical mile buffer zone should be adopted in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900018#T00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Valerie Freeman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384871700,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Freeman.

They could probably have provided us with more information but the way they outlined it has made it simple for us to understand.  It is helpful as we consider all the information before us.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the concerns raised about the management of coastal zones, the policies involved and the planning process.  Ireland not only comprises the land mass but also the surrounding maritime areas.  As elected representatives, we face conflicting challenges in developing national policy.  As regards climate change, many NGOs are putting pressure on politicians to set targets to reduce carbon emissions in energy production.  There will be consequences if we do not address that matter.<\/p><p>  Coastal Concern Alliance is concerned about the targets that have been set for Ireland.  Perhaps the witnesses can expand further on that point.  Why do they believe our targets should not be as ambitious as they are, which is to have renewable energy at 40% by 2020?<\/p><p>  We need to reduce our carbon footprint and face climate change challenges, yet on the other hand our generating stations are over-dependent on fossil fuels.  Our island is on the periphery of the main Euro zone, which means we are exposed from an energy security viewpoint.  We must develop alternative energy sources, including wind energy.  I am not saying that such project developments should be uncontrolled, far from it.  Coastal Concern Alliance's feedback is welcome.  The witnesses said we should have maritime spatial planning as well as a transparent system whereby applications are thoroughly assessed.<\/p><p>  There is a debate currently about wind farms in the midlands where there is severe opposition to them.  There is also strong opposition to EirGrid's network proposals and offshore wind farms.  It is difficult to find a system that is acceptable to the public because no matter what is proposed, everything is objected to.  Coastal Concern Alliance is a responsible body with genuine concerns and is not just objecting for the sake of it.  We need to hear from such groups why offshore wind farms are not acceptable.  A buffer zone of 12 nautical miles was mentioned, so I presume the alliance would have no objection if it was beyond that, providing that the proper assessments, including feasibility and cost benefit analyses, are made.<\/p><p>  I have listened carefully to what the Coastal Concern Alliance's representatives said.  We face challenges and are currently importing 800 MW of power, at peak, per day from the United Kingdom.  If there was another oil or gas crisis, I do not know how our economy would survive.  Decisions will have to be made regarding energy security and how best we can survive as an economy while reducing carbon emissions at the same time.  It is a challenge for us all.

The considerably lower efficiency of the back up thermal plant running at part loads, together with the additional losses from frequent deloading and reloading as the wind strength varies, all consume additional fuel.  The jury is still out on the exact implications of this but there is accumulating evidence from an analysis of actual system operations both in the USA and more recently for the Irish Grid that high wind penetrations save little or negligible emissions of CO<sub>2<\/sub> and can in some circumstances actually lead to increases.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900019#U01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Valerie Freeman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384872300,"counter":552,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's point in regard to meeting our targets, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, stated in the D&aacute;il on 12 December that Ireland will meet its targets for renewable energy from wind farms on land without recourse to offshore wind, which he described as \"more than twice as expensive\".

In terms of the photograph provided, while I presume the witnesses would say it is spoiled by the wind farms, others might see it as a therapeutic analysis of the wind moving in the sea.<\/p><p>  There is no comparison between what was envisaged during drafting of the Foreshore Act 1933 and what is envisaged now given the rapid movement of science and technology.  The need for update of this legislation is acknowledged.  The witnesses are saying that the almost 1,620 MW already developed has been developed on an <i>ad hoc<\/i> basis.  They also say that this was done because of the rigour of the Irish planning process.  The witnesses who appeared before the committee prior to Coastal Concern Alliance were critical of the lack of progress in respect of marine tidal and wave energy.  In their view, as wind farms are taking precedence, tidal wave generation is not being advanced.  While one group said progress had been made in this area another said none had been made.  <\/p><p>  It will be necessary to look at the cumulative impact of tidal, wave and wind energy taking into account land conservation and wildlife.  The 40% target has been set.  The witnesses have asked that in this regard an analysis be done with other EU countries, which is not a bad idea.  While we have much data in this area we do not have baseline data of the marine, which the witnesses and other people, including myself, have asked for.  While there is much expertise in this area, it is spread throughout many universities.  While we do have maps, we do not have baseline data of the marine base.  The facilities required to gather this data from the bottom of the sea are available and can often be seen on trawlers.  I do not think there is any excuse for our not having that data, although finance is clearly an issue.  Given that the environment is of such importance, this type of baseline data should be available at the click of a button.  We should also ensure that commercial sector operatives also play a part in the provision of this data.<\/p><p>  Reference was made earlier by the witnesses to non-compliance with an EU directive.  If it is a mandatory directive, Ireland will have to comply with it and provide for it in legislation.  One of the recommendations of Coastal Concern Alliance is that Ireland do so immediately.  I will undertake to do some research on that directive.  Currently, once the Minister under the 1933 Act grants the licence that is the end of the matter.

In July, the Government approved the heads of the maritime area and foreshore (amendment) Bill, which were recently published.  Drafting of the Bill will get under way shortly.  The Bill has three main aims: to align the foreshore consent system with the planning system; to provide for a single environmental impact assessment for projects; and to provide a coherent mechanism to facilitate and manage development in the exclusive economic zone, EEZ, and on the continental shelf, such as oil and gas projects and offshore renewable energy.<\/p><p>  It is proposed to define in law an Irish maritime area, which would encompass the foreshore, the EEZ and the continental shelf.  It is intended that the maritime area will be established for assessment, licensing and forward planning purposes.  As I understand there was some discussion of it earlier, I wish to confirm that there is no intention to redefine the foreshore as it stands at the moment.<\/p><p>  Within that maritime area, in broad terms, it is intended to provide for a streamlined development consent process to include both the onshore and offshore elements of strategic infrastructure projects.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be the consent authority.  This change will reduce duplication in the consent process and involve a single environmental impact assessment, EIA, thereby reducing the cost for applicants.<\/p><p>  It is proposed to newly define the nearshore area as the area between the high and low water marks, which is sometimes referred to as the intertidal zone.  Responsibility for consenting to development in the nearshore area will be assigned to coastal local authorities, apart from developments requiring either an EIA or appropriate assessment, which will remain under the direct competency of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p><p>  It is proposed to include provisions in the Bill to enable project proponents to seek a maritime option at an early stage, subject to certain qualifying criteria, depending on the nature and location of the proposal.  Obtaining such an option will in effect allow project proponents to reserve a portion of the maritime area for a limited period while they apply for the necessary development consents.  The legislation will be framed in such a way as to ensure no additional rights, such as property rights or other rights, for example to the seabed, are conveyed on holders of options.  This provision is important to give certainty to project promoters that if they secure the necessary financial backing and development consents, they will be able to proceed with their projects.<\/p> <p>Currently, the State does not have a statutory basis to regulate stand-alone offshore gas storage activities, irrespective of whether such activities are located at depleted gas wells or offshore geological features.  The legislative proposals will provide a licensing regime to remedy this which will be administered by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.<\/p><p> It is also proposed to bring forward several amendments to the Dumping at Sea Acts to provide for a more efficient permit system under the Environmental Protection Agency.  Most of the proposed amendments are administrative and technical in nature.  What is more significant is that the proposed changes will remove the duplication that exists in the licensing of dredging and dumping operations.  Maintenance dredging, required to maintain navigation channels, will be exempted from the requirement to secure a foreshore licence.  This means only a single consent from the EPA, the dumping at sea permit, will be required.  This change, while sensible from an administrative point of view in terms of efficiencies, will be of particular benefit to the national ports.<\/p><p> That is an overview of the proposals.  We will be happy to take questions, but before I move on I wish to address some of the issues discussed earlier today and last week.<\/p><p> A number of calls have been made for a plan-led approach to consenting in the maritime area.  It is difficult to disagree with these calls, and the desirability of such an approach is something of which the Department is acutely aware.  In parallel to the work taking place on the legislation under discussion, the issue of marine spatial planning from a national perspective has been under active consideration by a task force chaired by the Marine Institute, under the auspices of the marine co-ordination group, which, in turn, is chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The report of the task force will be presented to Government for consideration in the short term but the reality is that the development of a marine spatial planning, MSP, framework in Ireland will take some time.<\/p><p> The Department is also mindful of developments at European level.  A draft directive on maritime spatial planning and coastal zone management was published earlier this year and has been under discussion among EU member states ever since.  As things stand, the draft directive takes the form of a framework directive and, therefore, is not overly prescriptive on how maritime spatial planning should be undertaken, save to say that it should be undertaken.  The intention is to future-proof the legislation in order that it will recognise future MSP and in order that the consent system should have regard to any plan when it is put in place.  Several elements of an MSP framework are in place.  The national ports policy and the draft offshore renewable energy development plan are two such elements.<\/p><p> Some of the witnesses who have appeared before the committee in recent times have noted that the mainstay of the foreshore consent process dates from 1933.  I emphasise that the process has been updated and revised several times, mainly to take account of developments in European environmental legislation.  The consent process requires modernisation in the short term to boost activity in the marine economy.<\/p><p> While I do not accept that the foreshore process is an insurmountable barrier to projects, it is often regarded as a barrier and it can be a lengthy process for certain projects.  In this regard I wish to highlight the prioritisation system that is operated in the Department.  Essentially, applications for strategic infrastructure and projects with potential to create employment are prioritised within the system, as are time-bound applications, for example, in circumstances where a lease or licence is needed to avail of funding.  Smaller-scale developments such as those involving slipway construction or storm water pipes are second tier priorities.  Second and lower tier priorities can take longer to deal with and, regrettably, delays in the process can occur.  The issuing of leases and licences for the types of activities and developments undertaken is a serious matter.  Let us remember that the foreshore as currently defined is a valuable State resource that requires careful management and is worth, on average, &euro;2 million to the Exchequer annually.<\/p><p> As part of the process of developing the general scheme of the Bill, my colleagues and I have consulted a wide range of interested parties.  At the moment, we are in the middle of a series of engagements with coastal local authorities.  We are carrying out these on a regional basis and discussing with them how the new system will operate in practice.  We are also in regular contact with other Departments which have a particular interest in this legislation.  As the detailed drafting of the Bill proceeds, I expect that the proposals will be finessed.  We will be happy to take any comments or questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900021#W00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384873200,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Donoghue for the presentation, which was informative and which will help the committee as we consider the Bill.  I can speak from experience with regard to local authorities trying to acquire a foreshore licence where a sewerage scheme was being developed.  I come from Waterford and Ms O'Donoghue is probably aware of the seven villages sewerage scheme.  I was a member of the local authority at the time.  Ms O'Donoghue can correct me if I am wrong but the amount of bureaucracy and the difficulty in acquiring a foreshore licence for what seemed to be a logical development to improve water quality in towns and villages throughout County Waterford was extraordinary.  The difficulties in acquiring the foreshore licence stalled much of the development for many years.  Will the new Bill address many of the problems that may have been faced in that scenario?  For example, for the foreshore licence to be acquired, approval was required from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There was cross-cutting bureaucracy between Departments.  Perhaps I am being somewhat unfair - Ms O'Donoghue can correct me if I am wrong - but that is how it seemed to me as a local authority member at the time.  Will the new Bill address that type of scenario and allow developments that are in the public interest to proceed at a more logical rate?<\/p><p>  Ms O'Donoghue referred to dredging exemptions and navigational channels and suggested it would be good for ports.  Are the larger harbours in the country included?  Are there any exemptions for them?  I know Dunmore East in Waterford rather well.  It badly needs to be dredged and that has been acknowledged by everyone, including the Government.  It is simply a matter of finding the funding.  Would Dunmore East be exempt if dredging in the harbour area has to be carried out?<\/p><p>  Ms O'Donoghue referred to the delays with maritime spatial planning.  Concern has been voiced at the committee by various groups that there is no maritime spatial planning for the water surrounding Ireland.  There has been criticism that some development has taken place offshore unbridled or without proper oversight because we do not have a plan.  The point has been made that the Department maintains environmental impact assessments will have to be considered and strategic environmental assessments carried out, but if there is no plan to which to refer, how relevant are they or how can they be assessed?  Are we, in effect, putting the cart before the horse?<\/p><p>  Ms O'Donoghue stated it would take some time for the plan to be developed.  We are all reasonable people and we realise the work involved in a maritime spatial plan in particular will necessarily take time.  Can Ms O'Donoghue explain why it would take a considerable amount of time, especially since we have at our disposal the various institutes and agencies of the State?  I would have thought it should be a priority and that it should not take that long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900022#X00200","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1384873200,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I welcome everyone and I thank Ms O'Donoghue for the presentation.  As a former local authority member, I agree with much of what Deputy Coffey has had to say.  Any time a foreshore licence was mentioned relating to a development we were pursuing, I felt like pulling out my hair.  In the case of an inland river that is tidal, a local authority must get a foreshore licence.  My town tried to get a sewerage scheme but there seemed to be inordinate delay to install a tertiary treatment plant which would have improved discharges into the river.  It seemed crazy and at times there seemed to be years of delay.  I hope that will be addressed.<\/p><p>  As far as I can see we need to put in place a maritime spatial plan.  It makes no sense that <i>ad hoc<\/i> decisions are being made, whether it is to the local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and that these decisions can be made without a schematic approach.  Earlier, Senator Keane remarked that we have not assessed our maritime environment properly.  This points to a great deal of work that needs to be done to assess our territory from an environmental point of view and from the point of view of the asset.<\/p><p>  Something else is more particularly of concern to me.  There is a proposal that decision-making in respect of development of the nearshore, which the Department has defined as between low tide and high tide, would go to the local coastal authority.  I am from County Mayo.  We have a massive coastline.  Our coastline is predominantly made up of special areas of conservation or special protection areas.  Therefore, the Department is suggesting to the local planning authority in County Mayo that because an environmental assessment or an appropriate assessment would be required to carry out development along the shoreline, it must go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la anyway.<\/p> <p>Therefore, it has to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I do not think this is right.  The development, under the umbrella of a maritime spatial plan off the coastal areas, should be with the local authority.  Local authorities have local knowledge and plans that do not just consider the environment, but into which local democracy and the local authority feeds.  The idea that this will all be done remotely by An Bord Plean&aacute;la is anti democratic and that centralisation is not in the vein of local development that should be happening.  That issue needs to be addressed.  I suggest, as my local county council has suggested, that responsibility for that development and the decision making in respect of development proposals on the nearshore and foreshore should lie with the local authority, regardless of whether it is an SAC or an SPA.  Of course, it must have due regard to environmental constraints and the obligation to carry out appropriate assessments.  Other than that, it is by a sleight of hand that in Mayo this section will be meaningless because most of the developments will mean it must have this particular environmental consideration.  Perhaps the witnesses would address that issue because this will mean something on the ground for us.  The local authority there knows about the coastline.  I am aware there has never been a great amount of funding whether for a harbour, pier or sewerage scheme, but it knows what it is about and it has a development plan.  The power is being removed from the local authority and I do not agree with it.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900022#X00300","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384873800,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Mulherin and invite Ms O'Donoghue to respond and other panel members if they wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900023#Y00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384873800,"counter":577,"content":"<p>In regard to speeding up the process, that is certainly the aim of the Bill.

Marine spatial planning, as I said in my opening statement, is something of which we are acutely aware.  MSP as a concept is relatively new.  Much work has been undertaken by a number of Departments on the task force mentioned, of which I am a member.  I am not the authority on marine spatial planning but I have learned much about it in the past year or so.  It is extremely complex and if we are to do it, there is a need to get it right.  At a minimum, two years would be required to develop a national plan with a view to regional plans being developed at regional level thereafter.  That is a best estimate.  Again, it is an area that Ireland is new to and we will have to continue seeking extra expertise and looking at what is happening elsewhere in the EU before those timelines become clearer.<\/p><p>  In regard to the concept of the nearshore area and the division of the function between local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, some 80% of applications on hand relate to the nearshore area.  That is just a snapshot of the applications on hand.  We are in the process of meeting the local authorities on a regional basis.  We were in Carrick-on-Shannon a couple of weeks ago and met Mayo, Leitrim and other local authorities in the area.  More recently, we met local authorities in the southern region and a meeting is scheduled for local authorities on the eastern side of the country.  The consistent message we are getting is that they are willing and have the full capacity to take on developments more so than is proposed in the general scheme.

We heard from the representatives of the Marine Renewables Industry Association this morning and the impact it made.  They stated what was going out of Ireland and what could remain in Ireland if legislation was in place and certainty is necessary.  In respect of companies, Ireland is losing out to Scotland at the moment.  I have mentioned companies that have moved from the west to Scotland because of greater certainty in its legislation.  He said that Ireland has the grid element on our side and is much stronger.  They will have the wherewithal and the science but they will not be able to pass it around.  I will allow Deputy Michelle Mulherin to speak on the grid element.<\/p><p>  The planning process is old and has been updated but obviously not updated fast enough.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be the consent authority for the structural element while the Minister will still be the licensing authority.  Is that a correct interpretation?  A couple of the speakers, particularly on EU legislation, said that an appeals process is not in place and obviously we will have to look at that issue.  I do not know if the witnesses have an answer for me, but it must be taken note of given that it has been raised a couple of times.<\/p><p>  In respect property rights, if one is giving away a 99-year lease on Grafton Street for a licence, will the property rights lease and term have to be written into the Bill?  Much has been said about marine spatial planning and the necessity for it.  That should be speeded up big time because of the fear of the unknown - I agree with Deputy Michelle Mulherin on this - regarding local area planning.  Local planners will not do anything if they think it will harm the environment.  If they do not know what is out there and if it is not spatially planned for them, they will take the precautionary principle and do nothing.  We do not have the option of doing nothing; we have to do something and do it fast and right.  The national spatial strategy planning should be done.  I said at the first presentation that local councillors are always seeking to rezone land.  I think every bit of the sea should be rezoned for its maritime use purpose.  We should have a map to guide local planners without the necessity to have everything going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  If it was rezoned for a particular use, and taking into consideration the environment, fishermen and the commercial aspects dealing in all types of wave wind and tidal energy people could be told that this is where they go if they want to do certain things.  They have the wherewithal to do it, but we have the site and this is how it is done.  If local authorities had that guidance, the technology is in place to do it.

Every foreshore has a right of way.  How will the planning process deal with a right of way established over a 12 year or 21 year process?

Will it be continuous around the country or will it be in pockets?  The Aarhus Convention was mentioned earlier.  Has the Department put in place a mechanism for the public to make contributions on anything effectively under that convention?  If that is the case, where can we get information on it?  We also learned earlier about the fact that approximately 500 aquaculture licences exist that have not been renewed, so companies are operating but are effectively unregulated.

It has nothing to do with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, so I will not comment further on it.<\/p><p>  The role of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will fundamentally change and will in future be a \"landlord type role\".  The only reason we are retaining a function is that one body will have a coherent sense of what is happening on a national level.  The foreshore and the exclusive economic zone, EEZ, are effectively State property.  There is a premium attached to using it, and somebody has to oversee and regulate it and collect any rents that might be due.  That will be the role of the Minister in the future.  In terms of property rights, this will be covered by leases and licences.  We will be framing the legislation in such a way and the issue has been flagged by the Office of the Attorney General so that permanent property rights do not accrue to somebody who has a five year foreshore licence.  Obviously, with a very large-scale project with a long-term foreshore lease up to 35 or in some cases 99 years, it is a slightly different scenario.  Although they may have a very long-term lease, they only hold the property as a leasehold and are not buying a freehold and the property ultimately remains in the ownership of the State.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the Lissadell judgment, which is quite timely in terms of the Bill and we are actively considering it at present before we move into the detailed drafting.  Obviously, the Office of the Attorney General is looking at it also in terms of possible implications for access to the foreshore.  <\/p><p>  The exclusive economic zone was raised as well.  I should have brought a copy of the real map of Ireland as it shows our designated continental shelf and our exclusive economic zone, which I think stretches to approximately 200 km off the west coast.  Obviously, it would be a great deal narrower on the east coast but there is an agreed boundary between Ireland and the UK.  That is set out under international law and is regulated at international level and negotiated under one of the UN conventions.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a very active role in terms of that.  In some parts of the country it stretches out to 200 km.  We do not think it is appropriate that local authorities would have a role out to 200 km and we will not be buying any boats for them to go out and assess at that distance.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be the single authority with the competence and people in place to consider applications out in that space.<\/p><p>  Out at that distance from shore is a very challenging environment so there are limits as to what kind of activity can take place.  In terms of nearer to the shore and within the traditional foreshore, we are leaving that as it is because the outer boundary of the foreshore coincides with the outer boundary of our territorial seas, where we have full territorial rights.  Beyond the 12 nautical miles in the exclusive economic zone, while we have sovereign rights, they are more limited.  We cannot impede navigation, for example, and fishery rights are regulated by the European Union.  There are various other elements as well.<\/p><p>  Coming back to the issue of the level of activity that will be devolved to the local authority, it is worth bearing in mind that at present we receive 50 to 60 applications a year, so if one averages that out among the coastal local authorities, it is really only three to four applications per year.  When we are considering those issue, we will have to consider how efficient it is that every local authority would require a new foreshore unit to consider matters at sea, and from where they would draw the expertise in terms of marine ecology.  At present, we draw them from the marine licence vetting committee.  We are also looking at whether that should remain in place.  There are mixed views on that matter.<\/p><p>  The Aarhus Convention was raised in the context of an appeals process.  I know some witnesses who appeared before the committee earlier today raised it.  The foreshore consent system as it stands and as it will stand is fully compliant with the Aarhus Convention.  I am intimately familiar with it, having worked on it for four years before I joined the section dealing with the marine area.  It is not necessarily recognised in sectoral legislation; the access to information pillar is dealt with by a particular set of regulations.  The public participation pillar has been integrated into the foreshore planning and other consent systems, while the access to justice elements have been implemented by section 50, 50A, 50B of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010.  We have a robust system in place to implement the Aarhus Convention.  We were late in doing it but I would argue very strongly that we are fully compliant with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013111900024#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1384874400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I asked about the appeal under the EU directive .

Much progress has been made in the area of child protection over recent years and we have been made aware of other positive changes that are to come.  The adoption by the people of a new Article 42A of the Constitution concerning children and children&rsquo;s rights is a development I hope will remove several roadblocks that remain in the legal system that stand in the way of children having the best possible family life.  It is one for which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, deserves particular credit.  In April 2012, the Government announced its decision to end the practice of detaining 16 and 17 year olds in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution which is also to be welcomed.  I reassure members that it is not my intention to read my entire script that I have prepared.  It is a roadmap on the key issues.  Given the length of my report, I felt my script might be a resource and might prove helpful.  I will ensure ample time is set aside for questions.<\/p><p>  One of the biggest challenges facing society is the adverse consequences for the welfare of many children posed by alcohol.  Recent reports have identified alcohol as a contributing factor to children being exposed from their earliest years to poor parenting, neglect, abuse and psychological trauma.  The failure on the part of society to address the alcohol problem comprehensively leaves the child protection system to deal with insurmountable consequences.  In this regard, it is my opinion that we should impose a complete ban on alcohol sponsorship of sporting events.  It is incumbent on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to show leadership.  As the person who chaired with my colleague and good friend, Ms Norah Gibbons, the child death report, one of its striking features was a prevalence of alcohol and alcohol abuse.  We need to send out a strong message to society that alcohol can have profound implications and can place very significant burdens on the child protection system.  It is an issue to which I hope the committee will give serious consideration.<\/p><p>  Inter-agency communication and co-operation continues to be an obstacle in ensuring care is provided to children at risk.  I hope the Children First Bill will resolve the issue and provide a much-needed framework for the identification and reporting of child abuse.  The Bill is to be welcomed because it reflects a commitment by Ireland to comply with its international child protection obligations.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated recently that the issue of the disclosure of counselling records of child complainants in sexual abuse cases will be incorporated into the forthcoming sexual offences Bill.  I hope the Bill will provide a legislative basis upon which judges, in limited and defined situations, may order counselling records of child complainants to be disclosed.<\/p><p>  The establishment of Ireland&rsquo;s first child and family agency is to be commended.  I hope it will serve to harmonise the sometimes disparate aspects of the child protection service here.  It should be used as an opportunity to review current practice, think imaginatively and question whether existing practice serves the best interests of a child.  For example, should we consider other models of support for the large number of foster parents caring for children in long-term foster care?  Should we consider whether it is necessary, given resource constraints, to allocate a social worker to every foster family where a child has an allocated social worker.  The issue is whether we should have multiple professionals involved.  I think we need to stand back and examine the objective of having multiple professionals involved given that we are in a period of a decreasing availability of resources.  I suggest the establishment of the agency is an opportunity to review these practices.  I am a person who has a long history of working with the Irish Foster Care Association and has been involved with IFCA for more than two decades.  I know we have foster parents who are ordinary people who do extraordinary work on behalf of the State.  I would prefer if we re-imagined how we provide the service and ensure the people who benefit from the service are the foster children and foster parents.<\/p><p>  As a society we have a mandatory positive obligation to prevent harm to the most vulnerable sector of our society - children.  Prevention, as always, is better than cure.  It is imperative in all child protection and welfare situations to intervene at the earliest possible opportunity.  The right service at the right time is crucial and we must get it right for every family and every child.  For example, the provision of a public health nursing service to all families provides immeasurable support by working upstream with families experiencing difficulties to prevent serious problems emerging later.  We sometimes forget the role of the public health nurse.  If we want early intervention, we must invest in the public health nursing service because if we manage to identify problems at that stage, we will save the Exchequer a significant amount of money downstream.  When problems occur later, invariably they are more entrenched and more difficult to solve.  Investment not only makes sense in terms of the right thing to do but, in my opinion, it makes financial sense that we continue to invest in the service.<\/p><p>  When we look at the new child and family agency, we should not lose sight of the fact that the public health nursing service performs extraordinary work on behalf of every family in the State.  Links between extremely vulnerable individuals and the appropriate professionals, forged at the earliest possible opportunity, provide invaluable support.  Adequate housing for families in difficulty goes a long way to ameliorating or preventing other difficulties that may arise when accommodation is uncertain or in some cases non-existent.<\/p><p>  The early identification by teachers in schools of difficulties facing children is vital.  In many cases, teachers may be better placed to identify problems than family members, friends or neighbours.  Inter-agency communication and co-operation is essential to ensure children do not slip through the cracks.  What I mean by early intervention and inter-agency co-operation is a broad-based multi-agency response involving social services, health and education.  They all play a vital role in ensuring the welfare of children.<br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The failure to recognise mental health issues at an early stage can have a profound impact on a child.  Warning signs need to be treated with sufficient seriousness and referrals need to be timely and appropriate.<\/font><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> Greater links between child welfare and protection services and child and adolescent mental health services are required.  Proactively supporting parents is key to the vindication of the rights of the child.  If we support parents, we support children.  Parents are the best advocates for their children and that is why I am a strong supporter of family support.  It is my view that for too long family support has ranked as a poor third to child protection and alternative care in the battle for resources and professional time.  I hope the new agency will provide us with an opportunity to invest strongly in family support.  The hope for the future is for a robust family support service.  It is my view that when we talk about early intervention in this country, we are really talking about crisis intervention.  We need to re-examine and re-imagine what early intervention is about, and that is why I have talked about public health nursing services and identifying mental health issues at an early stage.  It is not just the mental health issues that affect children but more profoundly the mental health issues that affect parents.  That is why the agency has a key role to play in ensuring we tackle these problems.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  I <\/font>turn to the problem of homelessness.  Progress has been made in the area and it would be disingenuous to suggest it has not.  Further work remains to be undertaken to ensure young people do not get trapped in a downward spiral from which they cannot be released.  Many young people leaving the care system do so equipped to live as independent adults.  A small number of young people emerging from the care system, however, represent a particularly acute sector of homeless people.  These are young people who may have spent their whole life, or part of it, in care and are ageing out, so to speak.<\/p><p>  When a child reaches 18, he or she is no longer technically deemed to be in care.  The Health Service Executive is empowered, should it see fit, to make continuing provision for persons formally in its care.  Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 allows the HSE to assist such persons until they have reached the age of 21 or until they have completed a course of education, should it be satisfied that such assistance is needed.  The provision is discretionary and not mandatory.<\/p><p>  Young people who have spent time in care, be it voluntary or court ordered, are by nature extremely vulnerable and in need of support and protection.  When those same young people reach the age of 18, they are sometimes faced with an often daunting and isolated future.  Evidence has shown that young people need information and support in advance of independent living.<\/p><p>  Recently the Government approved a policy proposal to strengthen legislative provisions for aftercare.  The Child Care Act 1991 will be amended to incorporate a statutory right to the preparation of an aftercare plan.  In my opinion, the development is to be welcomed and should be met with action.<\/p> <p> The Child Care Act 1991 will be amended to incorporate a statutory right to the preparation of an aftercare plan.  This development is to be welcomed and should be met with action.  The right to aftercare needs to be put on a legislative footing.  In so doing, Ireland should take the opportunity to incorporate the right to housing into domestic law and place special emphasis on this right for children because it is about joined up thinking.  When we talk about child protection, we look at it in isolation but family support, proper housing and child protection are all linked and need to be reviewed together.<\/p><p> Article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child sets out the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development.  Although the Convention on the Rights of the Child has been ratified by Ireland, mechanisms should be put in place to ensure this right housing implemented in practice.  A holistic reappraisal of the causes of homelessness is required.  Services need to be put in place or expanded on to support very poor or homeless families so as to avoid the need to take children into care in the first place.  A targeted response is required to deal with those who are highly represented among the homeless - for example, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, young people and migrant children.  Services need to be put in place to support young people emerging from the mental health system or care system to ensure that the necessary help is available to these particularly vulnerable young people.<\/p><p> A study should be undertaken by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government of the approach of other jurisdictions to the problem of homelessness.  I was particularly struck by the experience of the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994 in Australia which legislates for the provision of transitional supported accommodation and related support services to help homeless people achieve the maximum possible degree of self-reliance and independence.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government should examine the feasibility of introducing a similar system in this country.<\/p><p> Prevention services must be examined and implemented to address the root causes of homelessness.  Supports such as mediation, family support and financial assistance can alleviate certain difficulties at an early enough stage to prevent homelessness occurring.  An early intervention and preventative spending approach has as its objective the finding of long-term solutions.<br \/><b><\/b>I now draw members' attention to the issue of the disclosure of confidential records concerning children, an issue I highlighted in several of my reports.  Each person who confides in a counsellor or therapist about a certain issue does just that - confides.  It would, without doubt, discourage many people from engaging in such a service if they thought that their utterances would be disclosed to a third party.  A difficulty, however, arises when it comes to children who have made allegations of sexual abuse and have confided in a counsellor or therapist.  Ireland urgently requires legislation to address the worrying gap in the law governing the issue of non-party disclosure regarding confidential records concerning children.<\/p><p> The disclosure of confidential records concerning children is sometimes required to ensure the effective reporting of incidents of child abuse.  Equally, however, there is a need to ensure that such disclosure does not cause a chilling effect on the reporting of incidents by victims of child abuse and that such a disclosure is a proportionate interference with the child&rsquo;s right to privacy.<\/p><p> The disclosure of therapy notes for the purpose of a criminal investigation or trial needs to be regulated by way of legislation and it should be judges alone who decide whether or not it is necessary to do so.  The legislation should further specify the criteria or factors which the judge should take into account in reaching a determination and I understand that these issues are to be addressed in legislation proposed by the Minister for Justice and Equality in the Seanad, which is to be welcomed. <\/p><p> Further measures also need to be put in place.  For example, a national protocol for the exchange of information in regard to the investigation and prosecution of cases of abuse would be an important development in child protection.  This approach has been taken in Canada and the Canadian experience is worth noting.  It provides for the appointment of a children's advocate is permitted which can assist the court in balancing the competing privacy rights and public interest inherent in this issue. <\/p><p> When making their determination, judges need to understand the nature of a therapy record together with the fact that, because it may contain hypothetical thinking on the part of the therapist, it is of limited probative value.  Accessing therapy notes should be the exception rather than the norm and should only be requested in those situations wherein it is considered that their production is essential to ensure a fair trial of the accused.  <\/p><p> The potential negative impact on the child needs to be considered.  Disclosure of children's therapy records should never be sought for the purpose of assessing the strength of a case.  Such an approach conveys a mind-set that children's therapy notes are regarded as cannon-fodder in the criminal justice system and stems from a wilful lack of understanding of the nature of such notes and the impact on the child if his or her very private material talked about in therapy cannot be afforded the protection it deserves.<\/p><p> The unintended consequences of the disclosure of therapy records need to be considered.  Will clinicians be more cautious regarding what they write in notes?  Moreover, will children be more cautious regarding what they confide in their therapist?  There then results a fundamental erosion of the therapeutic process.<\/p><p> Enough has been done to children who have been sexually abused.  If we cannot create a set of responses in all agencies to deal with child sexual abuse victims in a manner that is sensitive to their developmental stages or needs, then, as a society, we are failing them.  When child sexual abuse emerged as an issue in the 1980s adult survivors spoke most poignantly about how they were unable to tell about it at the time it was happening.  Thankfully, we have now created a climate wherein we actively encourage children to report their abuse.  Would it not be a sad indictment of our society if, in another 30 years hence, an adult survivor were to say &quot;I told about it at the time and I am sorry I did&quot;? The current lacuna in Irish law must be addressed as a matter of priority. <\/p><p> I turn now to the issue of bullying.  Bullying has always been an unfortunate aspect of our society and cyber-bullying has grown exponentially in recent years.  Cyber-bullying has created a readily accessible forum for bullies to target children and young people with little or no regulation or sanction.  While there are some legislative provisions in being that could potentially be used to tackle this problem, a focused response is required.<\/p><p> The Law Reform Commission has been tasked with examining this issue.  A clear system of legal recourse is required to provide for an offence of cyber-bullying and to encourage victims to come forward, anonymously if needs be, without fear of retribution.  The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, in 2011, called homophobic bullying &quot;a moral outrage, a grave violation of human rights and a public health crisis&quot;.  The programme for Government 2011 tackled this issue and the report of the anti-bullying working group published in January 2013 emerged from that.  The working group recommends that the definition of bullying in the new national procedures for schools should include identity-based bullying, such as homophobic and transphobic bullying.  Homophobic attitudes begin among children at primary school going age.  If we are to fundamentally change these attitudes, which in turn, can lead to homophobic bullying that is a profound child protection issue and can have devastating effects on LGBT young people, we need to start working with primary school children.  LGBT young people are realising their identities and coming out at an ever earlier age - on average at 12 years old but often younger.  This means that supports should be put in place to support these young people and their families.  <\/p><p> There is a very important role here for the Child and Family Agency to work in partnership with BeLonG To, an NGO which does extraordinary work on behalf of young people and I salute its work.  I suggest the Child and Family Agency works with BeLonG To to provide vital supports to LGBT young people and their families.<\/p><p> In the context of homophobic bullying, I draw members' attention to section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998.  In summary, section 37(1) contributes to the invisibility, bullying, and mental health difficulties experienced by LGBT young people and students and, as such, urgently requires  to be removed.  <\/p><p> The extent of the liability of schools must be examined in order to tackle the problem of cyber-bullying.  The most effective means of preventing bullying may be to adopt a whole-school approach.  It is not just about the law; it is about everything that surrounds the law.  Legislation should be introduced compelling schools to have a strong disciplinary code.  <\/p><p> A review of the law on harassment under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 must be undertaken to ensure it unequivocally provides for the offence of bullying and cyber-bullying.  Currently, there appears to be very few criminal prosecutions under the 1997 Act despite the apparent suitability of that Act. <\/p><p> While issues relating to cyber-bullying may potentially be captured within existing legislative provisions, the fact there is at the very least uncertainty as to whether prosecutions would be successful under these statutes is reason enough to bring clarity to the area and unequivocally provide for an offence of cyber-bullying.  In the past number of years, we have seen some very tragic cases.  The time is right to look at putting in place robust legislation providing very clearly for the offence  of cyber-bullying because the law must keep pace with technology, protect vulnerable young children and must exist as an accessible recourse for those who are victims of abuses such as cyber-bullying.<\/p> <p> The law on guardianship is another area I touch on in my report and that has not kept up with societal changes in recent years.  Current guardianship law ignores the social reality of modern family life.  Even in circumstances where biological parents or guardians are in favour of conferring guardianship on a step-parent or a civil partner, there is no provision for the appointment or recognition of such rights and obligations.  Special guardianship rights for step-parents are particularly important.  As somebody who has been involved in this area, also in the adoption context, it provides another tool in the child protection tool kit and another option for a child.  It should be provided as it offers an alternative to adoption as a child care option where a birth father has an ongoing role in the life of a child.  The Government recently committed to holding a referendum on same-sex marriage, which I warmly welcome.  A referendum is not necessary to provide for the extension of guardianship rights for step-parents and civil partners.  I welcome the decision by the Minister for Justice and Equality to introduce amending legislation in this area later this year or early next year.<\/p><p> I hope the Minister also considers extending certain rights and obligations to members of a child&rsquo;s extended family in circumstances where that person is <i>in loco parentis<\/i>in respect of that child.  I cite, for example, a situation where a grandparent is looking after a child over a lengthy period of time.  That grandparent, apart from getting access rights, effectively is treated as a legal stranger.  The family relationships Bill provides an ideal opportunity to update not only our guardianship laws, but also our laws in respect of custody and access.<br \/><b><\/b>I have made some public comments on the area of surrogacy, an area that causes me great concern.  Currently, surrogacy is unregulated in Ireland and has been the focus of case law and of substantial media attention.  The rights and obligations attaching to surrogacy present us with serious challenges in respect of how to adequately protect the human rights of all the parties involved, primarily those of the children born as a result of such arrangements.  The challenges are all-encompassing as they involve profound social, legal and ethical issues.  The debate to date has focused on the adults.  There has been very little discussion on the rights of children and consequences for children involved.<\/p><p> I note the Minister for Justice and Equality has said he intends to develop legislative proposals in the area of surrogacy.  Any legislation must address the best interests of the child and the right of a child born through a surrogacy arrangement to obtain information in respect of his or her genetic parents.  <\/p><p> If we look at adoption information and tracing rights in that area, there are powerful lessons to be learned.  The courtroom should not become the battleground for the vindication of rights for new family law.  I hate to say it but the failure to legislate in the assisted human reproduction area is a failure on the part of the Oireachtas to ensure that the law keeps pace with advances in medicine and science.<\/p><p> The right of children to be heard has been incorporated as part of our Constitution as a result of the recent amendment.  There are multiple mechanisms by which the voice of the child can be heard in the judicial process.  We need to develop these mechanisms to ensure we have a streamlined procedure that works across the board.  The current system for hearing the voice of the child is unsatisfactory, with significant variations as to the operation of the provision throughout the country.  There is a type of geographical injustice because the outcome for a child will depend on the District Court in which the case is heard.  That must be remedied, and we need greater uniformity to ensure that every child gets the same chance, regardless of where the child lives.<\/p><p> Children with disabilities are among the most vulnerable young people in society.  EU Directive 2011\/93\/EU prescribes minimum sentence lengths for certain sexual offences against particularly vulnerable children such as those with a disability.  It should be transposed into Irish law without delay.  I draw the members' attention to General Comment No. 13 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the right of the child to freedom from all forms of violence, which should be implemented also.  A national co-ordinating framework on violence against children should be formed in Ireland to tackle adequately the matter of violence against children.<\/p><p> Ireland should ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities without delay.  There is a real opportunity for the Government to make explicit in the next budget the way the needs and rights of children were taken into account, in particular, children with disabilities.<\/p><p> The need to ensure that children attend school on a consistent basis throughout their primary and post-primary education is of perpetual importance.  Absence from school at early stages of a child&rsquo;s education has been shown to have significant effects in later years in terms of literacy and numeracy levels of competence.  <\/p><p> As the person who chaired the child death report, one of my abiding memories was reading over 500 case files of children who died in State care, many of whom experienced difficulties attending school.  School attendance is sometimes linked to mental health issues.  Many of those children had problems such as dyslexia or dyspraxia, therefore, we must examine how we can keep children with emotional or behavioural problems engaged in our education system.  <\/p><p> I suggest that the ultimate sanction should only be bringing forth criminal proceedings against parents.  I advance in the report that there should be an intermediate step of enforcement such as education supervision orders, which have worked very effectively in the United Kingdom, and I believe would have a positive impact in this jurisdiction.  We should use the court only as a measure of last resort when all other avenues have been explored.  I urge the Oireachtas to consider introducing an intermediate step such as the education supervision order, which would direct parents and the child to co-operate with plans to ensure the child is appropriately educated.<\/p><p> In recent weeks we have seen an increasing focus within the media on cross-border cases.  Our increasingly mobile and multicultural society has resulted in a considerable increase in applications for relocation coming before the courts.  Nowadays, 13% of marriages across the European Union are bi-national.  Where one parent seeks to relocate from Ireland to another country with a child, that can only occur with the consent of both parents.  If both parents do not consent, it requires a court application.  However, there is no legislative guidance on the manner in which such applications are to be determined save for the guiding principle that the welfare of the child is paramount.  Greater clarity would be welcome in the form of legislation which would regulate applications for relocation.  Legislation should be enacted, which would include the factors that the court should consider when determining the best interests of the child.  <\/p><p> The Minister for Justice and Equality has raised the possibility of establishing a specialised family courts structure.  As far as children are concerned, we must consider how we can keep child care cases out of court for as long as possible, and the initiative by the Minister for Justice and Equality provides a real opportunity to do that.  There is a need to create an alternative to a formal court hearing, otherwise known as alternative dispute resolution, that can be embedded into the Irish family justice system.  The advantages of embedding alternative dispute resolution into the Irish family justice system are very considerable and the savings to clients in terms of cost, time and emotional expense are immeasurable.<\/p><p> The protection of children in the context of business and industry is an enduring requirement.  A number of recent publications stress the need to verify the source of goods imported into Ireland to ensure that improper child labour has not been utilised in the production process.  By December of this year, Ireland is required to transpose into domestic law EU Directive 2011\/93\/EU dealing with child sexual abuse, exploitation and pornography.  It should do this without delay.  I have outlined on page 19 of my presentation the key aspects of that directive which I will leave for the members to consider.<br \/><b><\/b>Regarding victims' rights, over the weekend the Minister for Justice and Equality announced the setting up of a victims rights alliance.  I warmly welcome that but it must be followed up with legislation to transpose the directive into domestic law.  As well as having the victims rights alliance, we need the necessary legislation to implement the EU directive.<\/p><p> The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child has been a core standard setter in the area of children's rights, yet there remains no formal mechanism for overseeing its operation and functioning.  An institutional oversight mechanism should be established in Ireland to take responsibility for monitoring the implementation of recommendations of treaty bodies such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child.<\/p><p> There have been very significant developments in recent years, which I warmly welcome.  However, many challenges remain that must be identified and resolved before we can say that we live in a society where our children&rsquo;s rights are fully vindicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900003#B00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384882200,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Shannon for concluding well within the 30 minutes allocated.

One can see his dedication to the cause.  We are fortunate to have someone in his position with his experience and of his calibre.  I also compliment Senator van Turnhout on suggesting that we invite Dr. Shannon to discuss his most recent report with us.  My understanding is that this is the first time his report has come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  It is a very positive development.  When someone of Dr. Shannon's experience and calibre makes the effort to put together a report it is important that the Oireachtas debate it.<\/p><p>  It is even more important to have a mechanism to implement the proposals brought forward because it makes no sense whatsoever for a report to gather dust.  Unfortunately, key recommendations of previous reports have not been implemented.  We should learn from that experience.  I call on Government to put in place a mechanism to implement recommendations.  It is a very comprehensive report which goes into many areas in great detail.  In light of the recent incidents involving Roma children, does Dr. Shannon feel that the Child Care Act 1991 needs to be amended?  Has the Department or any agency consulted Dr. Shannon about that?  He spoke of the important role of public health nurses and of mental health.  These are extremely important issues.  Does he have reservations about the fact that they will not fall within the remit of the new child and family support agency, the legislation for which is being debated in the Oireachtas now?<\/p><p>  I brought forward a proposal for legislation on cyberbullying, based on Dr. Shannon's previous report.  As he says, our legislation has not kept pace with advances in technology and cyberbullying is having an awful impact on the psychological well-being of our children and teenagers.  We have seen horrific examples of teenagers taking their own lives.  Has Dr. Shannon had a chance to read that legislation?  If not, we can forward a copy of it to him.<\/p><p>  Some months ago there was a report in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i> to the effect that the HSE, at a time when resources where at a premium, was spending in the region of &euro;30 million per annum for the guardians <i>ad litem<\/i> to ensure the right of the child to be heard.  Would Dr. Shannon comment on that and advise how resources might better be spent or how we could do this better?<\/p><p>  A fundamental principle of law is that court proceedings should be held in public.  That does not apply to family law, in order to protect the identity of the child.  In fact, however, it not only protects the identity of the child, it also protects poor practice and inconsistency.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is bringing forward proposals in the Courts Bill 2013 to open that out.  Dr. Shannon might make some suggestions about that.  The Government should make explicit in the next budget how the needs and the rights of the child are taken into account, in particular those of children with disabilities.  Unfortunately the past few budgets have targeted children, if one considers the cuts to child benefit and the abolition of the career guidance counsellor post, a service that is critically important to teenagers.  I would like to hear how Dr. Shannon believes children&rsquo;s rights could be taken into account in the budget.  I do have other questions and hope that I will have an opportunity to speak later on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900006#E00100","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1384882800,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I join my colleagues in once again welcoming Dr. Shannon for appearing before the committee.  I thank him sincerely for the publication of his sixth report.  His presentation here this afternoon was significant in itself, apart from the report.  At the end one is moved to say &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;.  There is so much here.  I will not try to deal with all the points I will simply try to tease out a few.  Dr. Shannon poses a question about social workers which is very interesting in the current circumstances, namely, whether it is necessary to have a social worker appointed to every foster family while the child also has a social worker.  Would Dr. Shannon like to elaborate a little on that?  Does he think that would stand up?  He puts it in the context of the resource constraints but would that have been his view, irrespective of these economically challenging times?<\/p><p>  Deputy McLellan and I have just come from a meeting with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs about the Child and Family Agency Bill 2013 which will reach Report and Final Stages this week.  We dealt with Committee Stage over the past couple of weeks here in this room.  I tabled a few amendments, all of which were ruled out of order, because as a lowly Opposition Deputy I should not dare to suggest anything that might be a charge on the Exchequer.  I am happy to note, however, that since Committee Stage, Cabinet has approved the introduction of legislation to provide for the statutory right to the preparation of an after-care plan.<\/p><p>  Would Dr. Shannon view the phraseology of the Minister's statement on the Cabinet decision as indicative of fulfilling the case for which several of us have consistently argued, year on year?  Can I read a statutory right to the preparation of a plan to mean a statutory right to after-care, where the need exists or where the child, now a young adult to be, over the age of 18, wishes?  I would appreciate if Dr. Shannon could tease that out with me because we will engage with the Minister on this next Thursday.  I want to be able to welcome it if it is exactly what I understand it is and I want to be able to withdraw my amendment, even though it will be disallowed but that is technical.  I want to be positive.  It is very important that Opposition voices are positive when the right decisions are being made.  That is responsible politics and I want to be a party to that.<\/p><p>  I commend the Vice Chairman of the committee for organising an event on cyberbullying, in the audio-visual room, which is no longer open to us for such events, but I am sure that collectively we will open that door too.  Young people from Waterford presented such an impressive case that I want to commend them again here.  I have raised the issue of bullying, not just cyberbullying, with schools and colleges.<\/p> <p>There is an automatic defence immediately that is so obvious.  Dr. Shannon rightly commended teachers earlier in his presentation as perhaps being even more important in identifying issues than a range of other people who engage in the life of a child but there is an almost automatic defence mechanism - it is not applicable across the board but it is still there - that in some way it is a reflection on the school.  It is no such thing, and it requires a change on the part of people in education.  I would like Mr. Shannon to comment on that.<\/p><p> I have a final brief question on Dr. Shannon's point about the voice of the child.  We do not have a uniform system operating across this State.  It is sporadic where it is being accepted, and there are other situations where the voice of the child is not considered at all.  What is Dr. Shannon's view on how to get uniformity and ensure that the voice of the child is respected and taken on board in every situation across the land?  I thank the Chairman for his forbearance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900006#E00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384883400,"counter":610,"content":"<p>A vote has been called in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900007#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1384883400,"counter":611,"content":"<p>Do I start or do I-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900007#F00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1384883400,"counter":612,"content":"<p>We will suspend and I will call the Senator when we return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900007#F00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1384883400,"counter":613,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 6.02 p.m. and resumed at 6.18 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1384883700,"counter":614,"content":"<p>We all concur with the Senator on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900008#H00100","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1384883700,"counter":615,"content":"<p>We all have a very strong opinion on the alcohol sponsorship.<\/p><p>  I fully agree with Dr. Shannon on the aftercare issue.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has asked those questions.  I will move to the child and family agency.  The main issues that Dr. Shannon raised were alcohol, child and adolescent mental health, the role of the public health nurses and children with disabilities but none of those is foreseen in the first phase of the agency.  How will we ensure that those essential services will be connected?  Dr. Shannon talked about re-imagining.  I remain concerned about the referral pathways for families.  Given Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s experience of child death reports does he have any advice?  I do not see all families entering this new agency through social workers because the upstream role of public health nurses that Dr. Shannon mentioned is essential.<\/p><p>  Given his legal background Dr. Shannon understands well the difference between &ldquo;in care of the State&rdquo; and &ldquo;cared for by the State&rdquo; but I choose to not fully comprehend it because I believe that children in direct provision are not living in a standard, normal family environment.  I am very concerned about them.  In his reports Dr. Shannon has written about its detrimental impact on children and has called for a report to examine that.  I also wish to raise the problem of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender, LGBT, asylum-seeking children.  I know that BeLonG To Youth Services, which Dr. Shannon mentioned, is doing excellent work in that area but I remain concerned about it.<\/p><p>  Dr. Shannon spoke about transposing the EU directive on the child abuse material, which I wholeheartedly endorse.  I have produced a report on the issue that Dr. Shannon supports.  Ireland should have a system of filtering websites containing child abuse material.<\/p><p>  Dr. Shannon talked about courts not being the battleground, about surrogacy and adoption.  Has he been consulted on the Children and Family Relationships Bill that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence is drafting?  The Minister made quite a good statement on the Bill.  Dr. Shannon also mentioned the alternative dispute resolution.  These will be very critical areas for our development.  I endorse everything that Dr. Shannon said.  In discussions on adoption all too often we hear only from the perspective of the parents.  We hear about Irish parents bonding with children of foreign adoptions but these children have a right to an identity and we very often lose sight of that right.  I am concerned that in drafting this legislation there should be no confusion with the rights of the adults.  The rights of the children must be got right first and foremost then the rest will fit in soundly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900008#H00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1384883700,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Geoffrey Shannon for taking the time to speak to the committee today.  More important, I thank him for giving voice to things that have been unspoken for so many years.  Some of the issues that he has highlighted are systemic ones on which we can put new tags or names.  As Deputy  &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, bullying has been around for a long time and we know that it has a detrimental impact on children&rsquo;s well-being.  Unfortunately, cyberbullying is only another platform for bullies.  The issue is the same.<\/p><p>  The most salient matter raised by Dr. Shannon is one that never gets enough attention or recognition, alcohol.  This is by far the most serious social issue facing Ireland on many fronts, health, family relationships, mental and physical well-being.  It costs the Exchequer billions of euro each year, yet our Ministers find it difficult to stand up to sporting organisations on alcohol.  This committee produced a very strong report on alcohol and spoke about an outright ban on sponsorship.  I concur with Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s comments because even in media reporting we hear about heroin which is a difficult drug and has major social consequences for communities and families, and we hear about the misuse of hash and crack cocaine but we never really face up to the problem that alcohol poses, particularly for children.  I worked as a child protection social worker and the underlying issue in 95% of cases was alcohol abuse.  It is used as an excuse for domestic violence and for child abuse, and as an excuse for physical or criminal damage but the issue is the abuse of alcohol and people&rsquo;s access to it.  Unless we really start to face up to that we are at nought because the issues are all the same when it comes to trying to protect our children.  If Dr. Shannon analysed child protection cases that come before the courts, as I am sure he has done at some stage in his career, he would find that alcohol is prevalent in the majority of cases.  We talk about prevention and support but we do not talk about tackling alcohol.  Dr. Shannon is right, it is not just up to this committee or to him, or to the authors of reports, there has to be a whole Government approach to it.  We need to decide for once and for all that this is something we have to face up to.<\/p><p>  I have a brother training to be a doctor in Galway and we talked about this over the weekend.  He has the pleasure of the company of people from many countries in his class so his experience of college is very different from mine because now there are many alternatives to alcohol for young people but the Irish do not see them.  Until we face up to that all these issues will remain the same for adults and children. <\/p><p>  Even more harrowing is the fact that alcohol is prevalent in all of the child death reports by Dr. Shannon and Norah Gibbons.  Is it really worth losing children&rsquo;s lives for the sake of alcohol abuse?  I have been saying this for years and I am so glad that somebody else is saying it.  I hope people will listen to Dr. Shannon if they will not listen to us.  I hope that people outside this room will take on board the fact that somebody of Dr. Shannon&rsquo;s calibre and experience has seen this and highlighted the issue.  We can have all the child and family support agencies in the world but until we face up to alcohol issue we are at nought.  I thank Dr. Shannon very sincerely for highlighting this because it is a problem for so many children and families up and down this country.  Until we take it seriously we will back here again and again talking about the failings of systems because we have not lived up to our responsibilities in respect of what is a social and a public health problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900008#H00300","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1384883700,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I also join with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in thanking Dr. Shannon for his briefing and raising these issues today in the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900008#H00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1384883700,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Shannon here today and thank him for the report, which is so comprehensive.

I will not go into it because Deputy Conway has aired it pretty well.<\/p><p>  We do not have any legislation on surrogacy but every day people go out of the country for this service and we need to implement legislation soon.  Dr. Shannon stated that 13% of marriages across the European Union are bi-national and child custody battles between an Irish parent and one from another country, be it in Europe or elsewhere, come to our attention regularly.  This is becoming a major issue.  The Hague Convention comes into play quite often but people say it does not apply, decisions are overturned.

My key recommendation revolves around the imposition of an absolute ban on alcohol sponsorship of sports events.  I share Deputy Conway's views, as I do those of Deputy Troy and Senator van Turnhout, on the issue of alcohol.<\/p><p>  In the context of chairing the child death review with my colleague, Ms Norah Gibbons, a key concern is that alcohol was not seen as a risk indicator.  Children were left in highly vulnerable environments because social workers failed to act.  What I found most troubling about the child death review was that, at the outset, I thought the most troubling cases were going to be the children in the care system, but it was not them but the children who were known to child protection services.  It was the failure of the State to act.<\/p><p>  This ties in to Deputy Troy's first question on the Roma case.  I publicly defended the role of the Garda and the HSE at the time, and I was unapologetic about it in that I feel our history is a chequered one in terms of the failure of the State to act.  What I thought was the major shortcoming following the review of in excess of 500 files was a failure on a part of social workers to act.  Deputy Conway mentioned the word \"systemic\" and I think this is systemic.  It comes back to social work training.  Social workers need to be told that alcohol is perhaps an even more corrosive substance than heroin.<\/p><p>  I accept the Chairman's remarks not just on alcohol but on general substance abuse, which we need to tackle.  It is easy to blame Government when, in fact, it is a society-wide problem that needs to be addressed.  My experience is not just in this jurisdiction but also in the UK.  If we look at the difference in approach in this jurisdiction versus the UK, and Deputy Conway will have seen this, alcohol would immediately be perceived to be a risk indicator in the local authority system in the UK.  I hope this new agency will prioritise education because, when we try to change practice, education is the gateway to achieving that change of practice.  I hope that, if there is anything the committee members listen to today, it will be the clear message that, having reviewed in excess of 500 files, there has been a failure to tackle alcohol at an early stage.  That will remain with me as the abiding message from all those reports.<\/p><p>  To come back to the questions, I will begin with those of Deputy Troy on the Roma children.  His first question touched on whether there was a need to change the legislation.  I often feel that, as a society, there is a knee-jerk response and, in any case, the immediate response is that we must change the legislation.  Sometimes the problem is more nuanced.  In this case, we do not know.  Rushing to judgment or to blame the Garda and the HSE would be a mistake.  What I will say on the record is that there are 700 notifications under section 12 of the Child Care Act.  To explain briefly the pathway of a child coming into the care system, the Garda has the power in exceptional circumstances to take a child to a place of safety where there is an immediate threat to the safety or welfare of the child.  That power is absolutely necessary.  To come back again to the child death report, there are many instances of cases where I felt garda&iacute; should have acted and did not act.  There is nothing to suggest we should remove that power in the context of two cases, when there are 700 cases a year, which is 7,000 notifications over ten years and 14,000 notifications over 20 years.  We have yet to receive a report from the Ombudsman for Children on the matter and I have absolute confidence that she will be in a position to identify these issues.<\/p><p>  I am not suggesting that everything was done in the correct fashion but that there is a process.   I am not privy to all the facts of the Roma cases.  In general, the next stage in the process of a child coming into the care system is that the case is brought before the District Court within three days.  In terms of checks and balances, a further check is that, under section 13 of the Child Care Act, it is up to the District Court to determine whether an emergency care order should be granted.  It is my experience that District Court judges frequently grant an emergency care order for much less than eight days and in some cases for a matter of hours.  It is a power that is used very sparingly and the checks and balances exist.  One has to bring a case before the District Court and prove to that court there is an immediate and serious threat to the safety or welfare of the child.  The District Court judge will then make a determination whether to grant that order where the threshold has been reached.  It is not just the Garda and the HSE as one must present the case to the court, which is a further check.<\/p><p>  If I am being asked what this and other cases might highlight, while I do not want to pre-empt what the ombudsman might find, it is the issue of inter-agency co-operation.  This is why I feel the Children First legislation will be key, and we have to ensure it works properly.  It is very important that the Garda and the HSE work together in a timely fashion.  To suggest the problem is in the legislation is a failure to understand the nuances of the child protection system.  I would like to put on the record that I think the Garda does a great job, as do social workers in the system.  What we have failed consistently to do in this country is to bring ourselves to a position where professions work together.  What we have seen is professions operating in silos, without regard to the best interests of children.  Nobody has an exclusive preserve in respect of determining a matter for children.  The real challenge for the child protection system is to ensure the agencies work together and the real challenge for this new agency will be that case-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900009#J01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1384884300,"counter":629,"content":"<p>Has the penny dropped that this must happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900009#J01100","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1384884300,"counter":630,"content":"<p>To be honest, I am not sure it has.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900009#J01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1384884300,"counter":631,"content":"<p>After all we have gone through, including the referendum and the fallout from other issues, are we saying this professionalism gets abandoned for the sake of building an empire or operating in a silo?

One of the key recommendations in the Ryan report was around inter-agency co-operation.<\/p> <p>What I have seen is an abject failure on the part of agencies to work together in a consistent way.  That failure must be tackled.  I commend the Minister on the introduction of the legislation.  The task is to ensure it is implemented at the earliest possible date.  The problem is that this is still not happening, which is a source of much regret.<\/p><p> Deputy Troy asked whether I had been consulted by the Department on the particular case to which he referred.  I received a letter from the Ombudsman for Children seeking my views on the operation of the Child Care Act in contextualising that case.  The ombudsman is very clear in her letter that she is not asking me to discuss the individual case but rather the general issue around sections 12 and 13 of the Act, which I am very happy to do.<\/p><p> Public health nursing and child and adolescent mental health services are two key aspects of child protection.  Protecting the welfare of children is not just about the activities of social workers; it is about the endeavours of all relevant professionals.  Again, the success of the legislation will depend on all the agencies working together, which calls to mind Deputy Conway's reference to alcohol abuse.  What I have found in my work is that mental health issues feature prominently in the majority of child protection cases.  As such, there needs to be a clear bridge between the new agency and mental health services.  Without such a linkage, there is a real danger of our failing children into the future.  It is a significant challenge.  I have highlighted on several occasions the need for mental health issues to be mainstreamed within the new structure.  How that is achieved is a matter for the Minister, but the evidence is quite compelling in terms of the requirement for child and adolescent mental health services to be part of the main child protection systems.  It is vital for the success of our child protection efforts.<\/p><p> The same is true of the contribution made by public health nurses.  I do not know why the latter have not been included; I am not privy to that information.  Once again, it comes back to the imperative of ensuring all the various agencies work together.  Whether that co-operation will take place within the remit of the new agency or outside of it is not something I will dwell on at this stage.  The point to emphasise is that such co-operation must happen and is particularly vital in the case of public health nurses and child and adolescent mental health services.<\/p><p> Deputy Troy raised the issue of cyberbullying.  I am aware he has published a Bill on this issue and I am on record as welcoming that initiative.  My view is that where there is any doubt under the law in this area, we should clear it up by bringing forward legislation.  I also accept Deputy Conway's point on this issue.  It is a cause for concern that there have been so few prosecutions in regard to this issue.  I am also concerned about the number of cases that have entered the public domain.  The bottom line is that a clear legislative framework acts as a strong deterrent.<\/p><p> I referred to the work being done by BeLonG To in regard to homophobic bullying.  I have had the pleasure of meeting Michael Barron, BeLonG To's director, to discuss this issue.  Many of my recommendations are informed by that type of engagement.  Before compiling a report I meet all the stakeholders and community representatives locally.  For example, I travelled recently to Moyross to meet the local school principal and parish priest as part of my research on the area of disadvantage, in respect of which I intend to issue recommendations next year.  We have made significant strides on that issue.  My recommendations in general are, in many respects, reflective of meetings with key stakeholders and with communities locally.<\/p><p> Deputy Troy referred to the role of guardians <i>ad litem<\/i>.  I have expressed concerns on several occasions in recent years regarding the lack of regulation in this area.  Section 26 of the Child Care Act provides for the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>in public law proceedings, but the legislation does not provide details as to the role and function of such persons or the manner in which they are to perform their duties.  The uncertainty continues when considering who should be appointed as a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.  Again, the Act fails to give any details.<\/p><p> I share the Deputy's concern regarding the significant expenditure in this area.  I wonder whether it is necessary.  In the case of any child care service, our main concern must be to ensure the beneficiary of that service is the child.  What has happened, however, is that in the absence of regulation, an entire industry has grown up.  Several providers have done a great job, with Barnardos being an example of an organisation offering and giving a world-class service.  Regrettably, however, we simply do not know who the guardians should be, and there are huge variations as to the persons appointed by the courts.  My view is that it is inappropriate for a lawyer to be appointed to that role because he or she does not have the skill set necessary to advise a court on the welfare of a child, yet that is exactly what is happening in a number of cases before the courts.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, has undertaken to deal with this issue as part of the family relationships and children Bill, which is welcome.  I hope he and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, will provide a definition of the role of guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.<\/p><p> This issue relates to the question raised by Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in about how we represent the voice of the child.  My view is that we should hear the voice of the child directly where that is possible.  As a society, we have created a range of intermediaries to the child, whether that is by way of video links, social worker intervention or obtaining an independent report.  The evidence suggests, however, that in the majority of cases children are in a position to be heard directly in a court type setting. That should be accommodated whenever possible, with support provided to the child where it is necessary.  Where direct representation cannot occur, we need a clear legislative framework to define what should happen.  As it stands, in most private family law cases, there will be a social worker report.  The problem with such reports is that they concentrate on the adults in terms of how they relate to the children rather than focusing on the children's interests <i>per se<\/i>.  We need to step back and consider how best we can hear the voice of the child.  Where we have a child with a disability, there will be a necessity to provide support, and the shape of that support can be easily framed.  Outside of that, the approach should be to hear the voice of the child directly.<\/p><p> The Deputy also raised the issue of the <i>in camera<\/i>rule, which is addressed by section 5 of the Courts Act.  The <i>in camera<\/i>rule represents a sensitive balancing act between the right to privacy, on the one hand, and, on the other, the right to a fair, transparent and accountable system of justice.  I acknowledge the Deputy's point that it is sometimes used to cloak bad practice.  However, it also shields the public from good practice.  We need a system that conveys to the public what is happening within the courts system.  We will have to see how section 5 operates in that regard.  Where there is secrecy there is also suspicion.  The most important consideration is that the public has confidence in our child protection and family justice systems.  That is what we should be striving for in terms of the <i>in camera<\/i>rule.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked why I recommended that we reimagine our engagement in the area of foster care.  I speak on that issue from a wealth of experience over the two decades in which I have been involved with the Irish Foster Care Association.  Many foster parents have very little contact generally with their social worker.  If a named social worker is allocated to foster parents, particularly where the child is in long-term foster care, I wonder whether that is money well spent or whether the allocation of a link social worker would be more useful.  It is not about removing that support.  To the question of whether I would make the same recommendation were we not in such difficult economic times, the answer would probably be &quot;yes&quot;.  The allocation of a named social worker can be intrusive in situations where the foster parent is the only parent the child has ever known.  We need to support foster parents and change the way we do things.  Just because something was done in a certain way in the past should not mean we have to carry on that practice into the future.<\/p> <p> I warmly welcome the Minister's announcement on aftercare.  It is a huge step forward.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Focus Ireland, Senator van Turnhout and other Deputies and Senators, I have long agitated on this issue, so it is a great day in terms of child protection.  I can reassure Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that I believe what the Minister is proposing meets our international obligations.  Last week, I was asked to speak at the European conference on homelessness.  The conference discussed young homeless people being the lost generation and I was struck by some of the stories I heard.  News of the Minister's announcement had certainly reached Prague, which was the venue for the conference.  It was heralded as the way forward to the newer member states, which shows that Ireland can play a strong role in child protection.  In that regard, this is something we should warmly welcome.  It will be really important for those marginalised young people.<\/p><p> With regard to the children who died in aftercare, when I am writing on this issue I think of them.  I do not wish to detain the members for long but given that the question was raised and I have the child death report with me, I will share with them why I think this is really important for those children.  It is certainly the bleak stories that Norah Gibbons and I heard about those children and the shattered lives of their families.  In some cases a social worker had not been appointed until five years after the child had been received, and when the child reached 18 years of age nothing happened.  Again, we recorded in the report that it is worrying that a young person was offered care for only a few days after his 18th birthday.  This type of practice really concerns me.<\/p><p> I will refer to one thing which has stayed with me since we wrote the report.  It relates to one of the children who died in care.  Just prior to his death he had asked his social worker to get him a pair of black pants.  They agreed to organise the purchase but the hostel telephoned her to tell her that he had been found dead shortly after his 18th birthday.  These are very vulnerable children.  I can give the committee several examples.  This report documents the lives of children who died.  I am not saying they would not have died but the circumstances in which they died without any support left me with the sense that we were hugely failing these children.  I believe this announcement is significant and is clearly welcome.<\/p><p> On Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's point on cyber-bullying, I share his view.  My sense has been the same, that when one talks to schools there is a standing back.  This requires a whole-school approach and I recommend that in the report I have given the committee today.  It not just about having policies in place.  It is about saying to schools that they must engage parents and children.  To refer back to the homophobic bullying I mentioned earlier, BeLonGTo and other such organisations will tell one about the isolation felt by children who are subjected to homophobic bullying.  We owe it to them to have much stronger policies.  I believe this should be put on a legislative footing.  We must mandate it and tell schools they must do this, because there is a reluctance.  The reason I suggested amending section 37 of the Employment Equality Act is that sometimes we use religious ethos to conceal a very ugly side of prejudice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900009#J01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384885500,"counter":635,"content":"<p>Is there not a commitment by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to tackle section 37?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900011#L00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1384885500,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Some of my colleagues and I have published an amendment to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900011#L00300","speaker":"1093"},{"type":"speech","time":1384885500,"counter":637,"content":"<p>There was a closing date for submissions on that last week.

Where there is a discretion, there is room for schools to absolve themselves.  There is good international practice in this area.  In the Massachusetts example, there was a clear, proactive stance on the part of the legislature to tackle both homophobic and transphobic bullying and that was put in legislative terms.  That is what I have in mind.

The publication of that report is a very important first step, along with the fact that we are identifying homophobic and transphobic bullying as a form of bullying that must be tackled and addressed.  We sometimes talk about living in a democracy but we must create a culture of genuine equality and acceptance.  There is, and continues to be, an undercurrent of bias and hostility.  Until we tackle that robustly at legislative level, we leave a certain degree of room for bad practice to creep in.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also referred to the voice of the child.  I have covered that.  It is patchy and sporadic and various practices have evolved.  We must have a clear vision of what amounts to the voice of the child.<\/p><p>  Coming to Senator van Turnhout's intervention and questions, I do not intend to get into a political discussion on implementation.  I produced a report and I hope it is helpful in terms of providing a roadmap.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to present it to the committee.  The recommendations I bring forward have come from lengthy discussions with key stakeholders in various communities.  In many respects I try to frame the recommendations around their experience.  These recommendations are rooted not only in my own experience, but also in the experience of communities and key stakeholders.<\/p><p>  With regard to the disclosure of records, I made it clear in my presentation that I am concerned about this issue.  I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter's legislation in this area.  It appears from talking to those at the coalface that there is an increasing pressure for the disclosure of confidential records.  It is a worrying trend and must be addressed.  I share Senator van Turnhout's view.  My concern is that there would be a reluctance on the part of victims of child sexual abuse to seek therapy.  Even if that therapy is accessed, the question I raise in the presentation is whether, if one is a psychiatrist, one is practising in the shadow of those records being accessed and whether, if one is a child, one will be as forthcoming.  It must also be distressing for parents.  They will have gone through the mill of their child suffering abuse, which must a parent's worst nightmare, and then there will be the added trauma that somebody could have access to the therapy records.  It must be tackled.  It is not a problem without a solution.  Canada has dealt with it very effectively, as have the Australian jurisdictions.  We must deal with it.<\/p><p>  My key recommendation today is on alcohol sponsorship.  It is putting increased pressure on our child protection system.  If we wish to deal with the entry points to our child protection system, one of the key triggers of a child coming into the care system is alcohol and, to a certain extent, poverty.  That is where I talk about family support as well.  Let us support families and do everything possible to support families who are in crisis before there is a need to take a child into the care system.<\/p><p>  In respect of direct provision, I am conscious of the fact that the Department of Justice and Equality might have a different view from mine on this issue, but I see it as a profound child protection issue and I am unapologetic about that.  We must look at what happens.  I refer the committee to Dr. Carol Coulter's report.  I sit on the oversight committee for Dr. Coulter's project.  Her recent survey of cases before the District Court is very interesting.  Page 27 of that report states that mental illness featured significantly in a number of African cases and in a number of these cases the mother, often parenting alone, was referred from a direct provision centre for asylum seekers to psychiatric services and her children were taken into care.<\/p> <p>Are we surprised, in light of the conditions in which these families have to live?  I am conscious that we are in difficult times.  We must not forget that we have a chequered history.  I refer to what happened when we went abroad.  That is my passion.  I know there are people who disagree with me on this.  My view is that if one examines this clearly as a child protection issue, one will say this is not a normal family environment.  I am not saying the State is <i>in loco parentis<\/i>.  I am saying this could not by any standards be regarded as a normal family environment.  I think we need to do better for these children.  We should look at what we are paying them.  I think we pay &euro;19.10 in respect of an adult and &euro;9.60 in respect of a child.  My recollection is that approximately 4,600 adults and approximately 1,700 children are living in 34 centres.  Most of those children will become Irish citizens.  How are we treating these future adults?  That is a question we need to answer.  I think my role must sometimes involve saying what people do not want to hear.  We need to do better for these voiceless people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900011#L00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384886100,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I know there are diverging views on how we can move forward.

Would it not be a great thing if our society was to go the extra mile and say that we care for these people?  I include the parents in this regard but I am primarily concerned about the 1,700 children who have to live in this type of environment.  That is why I have suggested we should examine what we are spending on the system.  I do not deny that the Department of Justice and Equality has a difficult job in terms of maintaining borders and all of that.  I am conscious that there are competing interests.  I wonder whether there is a better way of dealing with this.  When one reads the summaries of the cases of children who happened to arrive into the care system as a result of one of their parents being unable to parent properly, one wonders whether we should be doing better for these children.

It is only when one examines case scenarios to ascertain the root causes and the common denominators that one appreciates this.

I am suggesting we start by targeting alcohol sponsorship of sporting events in order to send a message from a very senior level of Government that this problem is having a corrosive and devastating impact on families and is costing the State substantial sums of money.  I sympathise with the Minister for Health as he tries to find money to fund all of the various services.  We have spoken about early intervention.  I suggest that my proposal would be an early intervention strategy.  The Government would be saying \"we are not willing to take your money\".  When society abuses alcohol, the pressure placed on our child protection system is insufferable.  We end up paying for it in our child protection system.

We are talking about very vulnerable people who have access to a very powerful drug for very little money.<\/p> <p>This time of year, I always remember a family with whom I worked where the children were removed because the mother had a chronic problem with alcohol.  She loved her children very much and really wanted to get better and be a good mother.  I remember bringing her on an access visit which went really well.  It was coming up to Christmas and the tree was up in the foster parents' home.  We had a really lovely visit but she was really upset leaving her children.  She got back into the car and she knew the reason I took her children was because of her alcohol abuse.  She asked me to stop at the shop to get a tag for her bin but she went in, bought six cans of beer and got into the car beside me knowing that I would see it and have to make a report.  That is the kind of grip that alcohol has on families.  I am not saying everybody has to be punished because some people cannot cope with it but there is a prevailing attitude where social workers, garda&iacute; and everybody else is afraid to talk about it because they are afraid people will say \"but sure you go to the pub every Saturday night.\"  It is not about that.  It is about the corrosive grip that it exerts on very vulnerable people for very little money but at huge cost.  Cocaine, heroin and hash get all the headlines.  It is just a convenience for us to ignore alcohol.  I again thank Dr. Shannon for his No. 1 message from his report.  The cost has been huge.  It has resulted in the death of children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900012#M01700","speaker":"1093","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1384886700,"counter":659,"content":"<p>What the Deputy said is correct.

One of the real problems in the area of family law is the fact that children and families move across borders.  My mantra would be \"Apply to the court, don't fly\".  The Hague Convention operates where someone wrongfully removes or retains a child out of the jurisdiction.  However, we do not have a set of rules in this jurisdiction governing a person's application to the court to legitimately apply to move across a border.  I am saying we need to put legislation in place for that to occur because there is a compelling need.  We have this general principle that it would be in the best interest of the child and we now need to define that.  In my report, I have given considerable thought to this and suggested that we follow the principles in the Washington declaration, which sets out a clear roadmap as to how one would deal with such cases.  I think that brings me to the end of all of the questions I have been asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013111900013#N00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1384886700,"counter":664,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Shannon most sincerely on behalf of everybody on the committee for a most challenging and informative presentation.

It was stated by some members here that there is nothing in the report with which we do not agree but it is a matter of trying to articulate that further and increase awareness among people and key decision and policy makers.
