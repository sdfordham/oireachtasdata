It is very difficult to know, therefore, the level of detail that the committee requires to make a decision.  However, as one can see from its letter, the committee wishes us to be far more explicit.  I kept the application general.  The legislation provides that one can either make a general application or seek compellability in respect of specific individuals.  If the Deputy recalls, when the committee was dealing with the section 39 bodies, there was an issue about Government bodies releasing information to us, as well as Rehab and specific individuals.  We kept the application general in order to encompass this in order that if a Government body such as the HSE wished to give us information but felt it could not do so unless it was compelled to do so, we would spread the net of compellability over the Government bodies, as well as persons in Rehab.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200003#B00700","nonspeaker":"Clerk to the Committee"},{"type":"speech","time":1402563600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I understand that.

They make specific reference to funding from a specific Department for Rehab that falls to be examined and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If the committee proceeds with the matter, it is important that any correspondence with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be written in the framework of work we have been doing, that is, work based on the foundations provided for us by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

The relevant paragraph is No. 4 on page 2 where it states the Committee on Procedure and Privileges wishes to know the proceedings and under which Standing Order we intend to pursue the issue, having regard to the fact that Rehab is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This appears to be camouflage.  What is intended is giving us a refusal by another name.  The requirement for more detail is simply a challenge to us to provide more stuff and, in due course, it will refuse on either legal or spurious grounds.  This is a very strong challenge to the Committee of Public Accounts.  In fact, it is probably an attempt to nobble it and see to it that we do not seek or have compellability under any circumstance.<\/p> <p>The clerk will correct me, but we first looked for this in February with SIPTU.  It is now June but we have got absolutely nowhere and there has been delay after delay.<\/p><p> I think the Committee on Procedure and Privileges got a legal opinion on this matter, but I am not sure, which it has not shared with us.  In fact it has not even given us an indication that it got a legal opinion.  It appears that it has been legally advised and is coming back now with demands for more detail, which are not necessarily required as far as I can see under Standing Orders or the Act.<\/p><p> I do not know when the CPP will hold its next meeting but it does not hold them very frequently.  However, the CPP is politically controlled and I think this is a challenge to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It looks like we are going to be refused compellability under any circumstances whatsoever, which is a serious situation for us.  We are not looking like we are going to get compellability any time in the near future.  It is to be presumed the CPP is being advised by lawyers and we are not having that advice shared with us.  We are being deliberately frustrated and I suggest that we, in turn, get legal advice, and I think we have a budget for that, to see what we are entitled to and what are our rights under Standing Orders and legislation to push for compellability.  Otherwise we are going to be frustrated by the CPP.  We were frustrated when we wanted to get a tape of the whistleblowers and we are now in a situation where our investigations are being frustrated again.  We need to get independent legal advice to see whether the CPP or we are on the right track.  We should make it quite clear that we do not intend simply to buckle under and say we have a challenge and we are not going to pursue it any further.  It is imperative we get the information that we are entitled to compellability and that we do not meet a brick wall every time we look to investigate matters like this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200003#B01300","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402564200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>In case my previous comments are misinterpreted, I do not think this is an attempt by the CPP to nobble us.  I do not think it is trying to challenge us.  It is just an indication of a central fact that we are outside our remit so the problem is to change the remit.  So long as we operate under the current remit, operated under the Standing Orders, I do not think we can pursue this matter.  We must, therefore, look at the bigger picture rather than continue down this path with Rehab which I think is only going to damage the committee in the future.  I have no problem with independent legal advice, as Deputy Ross asked for and think it might be helpful.  We had a previous discussion in private on the legal advice available to the Oireachtas and the legal advice that we had before.  If a second voice would help in the matter, that would be useful.  The bigger problem is changing the remit which is something that would bring benefit, not just in the Rehab case, but also in relation to local authorities where we want to look at the Welsh model of a public accounts committee.  We have discussed those things here before in private.  That is the central thing that has been told to us in this letter and I do not think that will change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200004#C00200","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speech","time":1402564200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>It is most essential that we have compellability in terms of anything that relates to the spending of public moneys.

That is the politics of it.  I am very unhappy with the situation and suggest the following course of action.  We have received a request for specific information so we should furnish the CPP with responses to each of those challenges.  In the course of doing so I strongly support Deputy Ross's proposition that we seek outside legal advice.  To my mind I would like to see it truly independent.

The CPP did not mention the fact that Mr. O'Brien tried to give the information to the committee but, on re-reading the Act, it was found to be the case that we needed to be in compellability mode.  It was the HSE which desired to give the information to the committee.  However, we should not jump to conclusions.

The CPP met yesterday at 6 o'clock and 25 minutes later a two page letter was issued, or at least made available to its members, that detailed the request for further information.  I want to separate both issues.<\/p><p>  The issue in relation to the SIPTU fund, as it is known, is clear cut.  The Comptroller and Auditor General gave a report and we have had hearings on it.  We cannot conclude those hearings and bring about our report without seeking to determine what is in the Grant Thornton report and interview, as witnesses, the individuals who are central to the administration of that fund.  They know all about it but others do not so we cannot get to the truth without hearing from them.  To my mind, that is clear cut.  There is no question of remit and it is simply on the basis of the work that this committee has been asked to do.  Therefore, I have no difficult with that matter.<\/p><p>  In terms of section 39 bodies and Rehab as part of the section 39 issue, every single Department we interviewed regarding the funding of Rehab has an Accounting Officer responsible to the Comptroller and Auditor General and, in turn, responsible to us.<\/p> <p>Some &euro;95.6 million in one year is being questioned.  The Departments concerned could not give us all of the information they have because we were not in compellability mode and they had to withdraw that information.  The audited accounts produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the reporting to this committee is standard and is within the remit of the committee.  It is nonsense to consider that it is not.  We are being asked about the first two applications for compellability from the committee.  Undoubtedly, there will be questions over the content of the applications.  One of the questions in the letters concerns how witnesses will be treated.  Before 6 p.m yesterday, we had passed a Standing Order in the House stating how witnesses would be treated.  Do these people not read the motions?<\/p><p> My position, and I think it is the position of the committee, is that we seek outside legal advice of a senior counsel to determine the background to our application and to determine the types of responses required to the questions asked and how we should focus the response in terms of the overall legal position on the legislation.  That is essential because there is only one in-house legal section in the Oireachtas.  We have had their advice and, while it is no reflection on them, that section also gives advice to other committees.  This is so serious that we must look beyond that to satisfy ourselves.  We may be told that we should not proceed but it is up to us as members of the Committee of Public Accounts, who act with the taxpayers' interests in mind, that we take this step to press for clarification.  Clarification can only be brought about by making the response in a professional way by relying on senior legal advice.  I take it that is the proposition from the meeting and that is how we will proceed.  Are there are dissenting voices?  That is agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200004#C01600","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402564800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Standing Order 163 is not clear and we should seek to have it widened and clarified so that these obstacles do not arise in the future.

A saving of &euro;86 million was achieved on the &euro;326 million net expenditure provided for in the Estimate.  The outturn was around 74% of the net amount provided.  The outturn relative to budgeted expenditure amounts included a 43% underspend in the National Treatment Purchase Fund provision, a 41% underspend on hepatitis C and HIV compensation, a 20% saving in agency funding and a 52% underspend in the provision for inquiries, legal fees and settlements.  The 2012 appropriation account for the HSE indicates that its gross expenditure for the year amounted to just under &euro;14 billion.  The outturn was marginally higher than the 2011 gross expenditure level but 7% below the HSE's peak expenditure in 2009.  Appropriations in aid in 2012 amounted to &euro;1.49 billion.  <\/p><p>  The outturn for the HSE's Vote for 2012 was close to the amount provided by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the Appropriation Act, resulting in a surrender of just under &euro;23 million.  However, this was achieved after provision of an additional &euro;360 million by way of a Supplementary Estimate in December 2012.  This represented an increase of 3% on the original overall Voted Exchequer provision for the year.<\/p><p>  Estimates of Voted expenditure presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for approval should reasonably accurately represent the amount expected to be spent on each of the related services.  In effect, the Estimates serve both as annual budget allocations by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for individual services and as cash limits which Departments and offices are not permitted to exceed.  In each of the last five years the HSE has sought a Supplementary Estimate as a result of emerging budget overruns.  This raises concerns about the effectiveness of its budget planning and budget management.  Chapter 21 examines the budget outturn in 2012 by category of expenditure and income and the main factors that gave rise to the budget overruns. <\/p><p>  Two thirds of the supplementary provision in 2012 was for increased spending on medical card and community services.  The outturn for these services was &euro;2.76 billion, &euro;238 million or 9.5% above the original Estimate for the year.  <\/p><p>  The original budget for hospital and community services was exceeded by &euro;147 million and there was a shortfall of over &euro;100 million on the receipts side owing to the delay in the enactment of legislation to amend the basis for charging private patients and the failure to achieve targeted improvements in the timeliness of collection of payments for the treatment of private patients from the health insurance companies.<\/p><p>  The Estimates for the HSE for 2012 do not appear to have taken sufficient account of the underlying cost drivers in some key expenditure areas.  Budgeting for future periods is inevitably subject to error because of inherent uncertainty and factors that may be outside the budget holders' control.  Nevertheless, as a general rule, Estimates presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for Voted services should be underpinned by an analysis of relevant trends and realistic assumptions about likely outcomes for the budget period.  Key budgeting assumptions should be stated.  For example, the budgeted medical card expenditure should be based on the projected number of medical card holders in each category and the projected average annual cost for such card holders.  These would be used as benchmark values in monitoring the outturns which should help to improve subsequent budgeting.<\/p><p>  Chapter 22 which deals with eligibility for medical cards was previously considered by the committee at its meeting on 14 November 2013.<\/p> <p>At the end of 2012 the scheme was helping in providing medical support for an estimated 43% of the population.  The cost of the scheme in 2012 was &euro;1.7 billion, accounting for approximately one euro in every eight spent by the HSE.<\/p><p> Eligibility for a medical card is, in the main, determined by a means test based on the applicant&rsquo;s income and certain relevant household outgoings.  The HSE also has discretion to award a medical card if not doing so would result in undue hardship.  Medical cards have a fixed period of validity, normally three or four years.  Subject to continuing eligibility, medical cards are renewed on expiration.<\/p><p> The examination identified shortcomings in the HSE&rsquo;s application of controls in 8% of a sample of medical card applications approved in 2012.  In 4% of cases medical cards had been approved in circumstances where the evidence on file suggested the applicant had not, in fact, satisfied the means test eligibility criteria.  In the other 4% of cases no documentation or inadequate documentation of outgoings had been provided.  Additional guidance and staff training, as well as a more formal process for supervisory review of medical card approvals, should ensure specified controls are applied.<\/p><p> Around 5% of new medical cards in 2012 were awarded on discretionary or hardship grounds, taking account of the individual&rsquo;s economic and social circumstances and the level of illness and related costs.  Our review of a sample of medical cards awarded on a discretionary basis found that in a majority of cases the medical cards had been awarded on the basis of significant expenditure in relation to medical costs.  The audit found that, while letters from the GP provided details of the illnesses of household members, there had generally been no attempt to quantify the medical costs involved or otherwise provide evidence that these costs would cause financial hardship for the applicant or his or her family.  In 2013 the HSE introduced a new form for completion by GPs which required the GP to specify the normal number of GP visits and the type of medication required.  This should provide a better basis for identifying the medical costs burden on applicants.<\/p><p> In 2012 the HSE issued around 366,000 renewal notices to medical card holders whose cards were due to expire.  Some 70% of cases involved self-assessment, with applicants being asked only to confirm that the relevant circumstances had not changed.  In the remaining cases a full review of eligibility, comparable with an initial application, was conducted.  This involved the production of original or copies of documentation.  Across both groups, almost 11% of medical card holders had not responded to the renewal notice by May 2013 and their medical cards lapsed as a result.  A further 1.9% of medical cards were not renewed because it was established that the medical card holder had died.  Of the remainder, over 94% had their eligibility confirmed as before or had their medical card upgraded to a full medical card instead of their previous GP visit card.  Some 1.7% had their eligibility reduced from a full medical card to a GP visit card, while 4% were deemed not to be eligible for either form of medical card.<\/p><p> During 2012 the HSE also reviewed around 40,000 medical cards where the card holders had not accessed medical services for periods of 12 months or more.  Eligibility was removed in just under 40% of these cases.  By definition, these cases had not recently resulted in payments for prescriptions or other items but capitation payments to their GPs would have been incurred.  On the other hand, the cancellation of medical cards that are effectively unused would probably not yield high savings.<\/p><p> Overall, the available evidence suggests there is a material level of ineligibility in the medical card system.  However, the financial implications of this ineligibility have not been reliably established.  The HSE has not yet developed a reliable estimate of the underlying level of excess payments in the medical card system.  I have recommended, therefore, that it initiate a cyclical programme of reviews of eligibility in respect of random samples of medical card holders.  This would allow a reliable baseline estimate of the scale of excess payments to be identified.  Tracking changes in the levels of excess payments year on year would allow the HSE to evaluate the effectiveness of its overall control strategy and identify the key drivers of excess payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200006#E02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402566000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I am here with my colleagues, Ms Fiona Prendergast and Mr. Matt Collins, to deal with the Appropriation Account and the 2012 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of Vote 38 - Department of Health.  The director general of the Health Service Executive, Mr.Tony O&rsquo;Brien, will address Vote 39 and chapters 21 and 22 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<br \/>Let me set out in my opening statement the main points in the 2012 accounts as they pertain to Vote 38.  Funding is allocated to the Department of Health under Vote 38.  Through this Vote, funding is also allocated to bodies under the aegis of the Department such as the Mental Health Commission, the Food Safety Authority and the Health Information and Quality Authority.  The 2012 provision &ndash; current and capital - for Vote 38 was almost &euro;330 million, while the outturn was &euro;244.5 million, a saving of over &euro;85 million overall.  The 2012 provision for current expenditure was &euro;314 million, while the outturn was &euro;237 million, a saving of &euro;77 million.  In 2012 some &euro;70 million of this saving was used to offset the Supplementary Estimate requirement in Vote 39, Health Service Executive, thereby reducing the call on the Exchequer.  The 2012 provision for capital expenditure was some &euro;16 million, while the outturn was &euro;7 million, a saving of &euro;9 million.  The majority of this saving was due to a delay in progressing the Clinical Research Facility at Galway University Hospital.  Of the 2012 provision for current expenditure, almost &euro;130 million was provided for bodies under the aegis of the Department.  Savings of some &euro;42 million were made in this area, mainly due to the change in the remit of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.<br \/>The 2012 provision for the administration of the Department of Health was just over &euro;32 million, while the outturn was just over &euro;29 million, a saving of some &euro;3 million or almost 10%.  On the 2012 provision for compensation payments to people affected by hepatitis C and for statutory and non-statutory inquiries and legal fees, there was an underspend of just over &euro;30 million.  This can be attributed to the difficulty in determining when settlements will be made or paid but also simply to other legal costs not materialising when envisaged.<br \/>In 2014 there is a provision of &euro;190 million for current expenditure and &euro;16 million for capital expenditure under Vote 38.  This is a reduction of 17% or &euro;42 million on the 2013 provision and 38% or &euro;124 million less than the 2012 provision.  For information, the overall 2014 provision for the Health Service Executive is almost &euro;13 billion.  This comprises an Exchequer contribution of over &euro;11.5 billion and appropriations-in-aid of just over &euro;1.4 billion.  The capital expenditure portion of the 2014 provision is &euro;374 million.<br \/>There are a number of reasons for the reduction in budget provision in Vote 38.  Obviously, like all Departments and Government agencies, further efficiency savings were required and these have been factored into the allocations to agencies under the aegis of the Department.  Furthermore, the Department&rsquo;s administrative budget provision has been reduced to take account of the Haddington Road agreement.  The provision for legal costs and statutory inquiries has similarly been reduced, again taking account of the need for efficiencies and bearing in mind previous underspends.<br \/>In 2013 the purchasing functions of the National Treatment Purchase Fund were transferred to the special delivery unit in the Health Service Executive.  Thus, the budget provision remaining in Vote 38 relates mainly to the administration of the office, pending consideration of its future role in the context of the structural reforms set out in<i><\/i>Future Health - A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 &ndash; 2015.<br \/>In addition to these changes, &euro;22 million was transferred to the Health Service Executive for the drugs initiative as part of the 2014 Revised Estimates Volume.  The funding will support around 220 drugs task force projects.  Up to now, the HSE was a channel through which the Department allocated the funding, with separate reporting, accountability and monitoring arrangements.  The allocations will continue to be based on drugs task force recommendations and will continue to focus on tackling the drug problem.  The transfer of operational responsibility for funding the administration of drugs task force projects to the HSE is a key priority in the HSE's primary care division operational plan 2014. <br \/>As members will be aware, the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Bill 2013 is expected to be enacted before the summer recess.  It provides for the disestablishment of the Health Service Executive Vote and the funding of the HSE from the Vote of the Minister for Health with effect from 1 January 2015.  The Department is making preparations for this change, together with the Health Service Executive.  The return of the Vote to the Office of the Minister for Health will enhance accountability and is one part of the reform of the health service, as set out in Future Health - A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 &ndash; 2015.<\/p> <p>In addition, I am pleased to advise members that a detailed business case for a new finance operating model, including the procurement of a new integrated financial management system, IFMS, for the wider health service has recently been submitted to my Department.  The business case has been endorsed by the Department for further consideration by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The project is a top priority for my Department and the Health Service Executive.  <\/p><p> Finance reform is the highest non-clinical priority of the HSE.  The health system is committed to introducing new financial management practices to improve efficiency and effectiveness and enable increased transparency across the health economy.  This new model will fundamentally transform how financial management is delivered.  The successful delivery of the reforms set out in Future Health is largely dependent on having robust financial systems, reporting and organisational design in place to meet future requirements, as current practices are not fit for purpose or sustainable in the merging landscape.  I will be happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402566600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>May we publish Dr. McLoughlin's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200008#G00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402566600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1402566600,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. O'Brien to make his statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200008#G00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402566600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend to discuss the 2012 annual report and Appropriation Accounts for Vote 39 and chapters 21 and 22.  We submitted a range of information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting.  I will, therefore, confine my opening remarks to a number of specific issues.<\/p><p>  On the issue of financial performance, it is important to reiterate that each year in developing its approach to the annual service plan the Health Service Executive sets out the likely cost of running the services for the upcoming year and specifies foreseeable risks likely to increase costs in that year.  It must be noted that the HSE does not control the process which leads to the final allocation of its budget.  The amount allocated for HSE expenditure is decided, among other things, against a backdrop of national budgetary objectives and prevailing macroeconomic conditions.  The final Estimate provision allocated to the HSE is, in effect, determined outside it following the conclusion of the Estimates process. <\/p><p>  HSE net expenditure fell by &euro;931 million or 6.8% between 2009 and 2012, with a further reduction in 2013, bringing the cumulative five year reduction to &euro;1.066 billion or 7.8%.  Despite considerable media and other commentary regarding HSE budget overruns, in the six years from 2008 to 2013, during which the HSE received &euro;71.277 billion in a total net Vote, it received a net Supplementary Estimate of under &euro;2 billion.  Of this figure, &euro;1.37 billion or 69% is related to Exchequer and other items not within the control of the HSE.  A further &euro;475 million or 35% is related to medical cards, drugs and other demand-led services provided by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS.  The remaining figure of &euro;144 million or 10% is related to core service areas within the HSE's direct control and represents 0.2% of the aggregate net Vote for the period.  <\/p><p>  Members will be aware that expenditure in acute hospitals increased by &euro;52 million or 1.3% between 2012 and 2013.  It is important to note, however, that net expenditure in acute hospitals has fallen considerably in cumulative terms, by &euro;515 million or 11.6% in the five year period 2009 to 2013.  Despite this decline in expenditure, combined inpatient, day case and births activity has increased by around 15%, bed days used have reduced by around 10% and emergency department presentations have increased by approximately 6%.  As outlined in written submissions for the most recent completed finance year, 2013, separate from Exchequer related and other items outside the control of the HSE, the position is that it delivered a &euro;25 million surplus.  This figure is made up of deficits on core services, primarily hospitals, and surpluses on capital and other services.  In addition, there was a deficit of &euro;96 million in PCRS expenditure, namely, medical cards, general practitioner fees, drugs and other demand-led schemes, for example, the dental treatment service scheme.  This indicates a combined &euro;71 million deficit in the areas within HSE control and the PCRS, which equates to 0.6% of the net original Vote.<\/p><p>  I emphasise that there is full clarity on the components of the cost overrun in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service for 2012.  This includes the residual &euro;90 million referenced in the chapter.  Line by line detail in this regard has been provided for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Accordingly, it is important to stress that there is no unexplained expenditure.  All public funds were appropriately accounted for and the Health Service Executive has provided a full analysis of expenditure for the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of 2012 and all previous years.<\/p><p>  As the Secretary General noted, the finance reform programme is a key element of overall system reform in the health service.  Following detailed work in recent months involving a wide range of health service staff involved in finance related activity, a new operating model for finance has been designed and agreed.  A business case has been developed and submitted to the Department of Health for approval to procure a new integrated financial management system for the health service.  Implementing a new financial operating model will provide the opportunity to transform the financial management of the health system and support the delivery of key elements of the reform agenda of Future Health, including introducing hospital groups and the money follows the patient principle.  I consider this programme to be the single most important non-clinical priority of the health service for this year. <\/p><p>  On section 38 agencies, members will be aware from the update provided in early March that work has been ongoing with all section 38 service providers to assist them in reaching compliance with Government pay policy.  An internal review panel, comprising nominated members of the leadership team, has concluded the process of reviewing the business cases made for the continued payment of allowances.  The panel's report has been furnished to the committee. <\/p><p>  Agencies have been advised that it is their responsibility as the direct employer to implement the recommendations made.  A period of up to three months to 1 July has been provided to allow each agency to make the necessary arrangements to cease the payment of all unapproved remuneration and ensure appropriate risk mitigation measures are put in place to deal with issues as they arise.  On the completion of the compliance process, a final report, detailed by agency, will be provided for the committee in early July, at which time it is expected that all agencies will have demonstrated full compliance with Government pay policy. <\/p><p>  I advise the committee that the interim administrator to the Central Remedial Clinic, Mr. John Cregan, has completed his work and I have received a report from him which I am considering.  Once I have fully considered the findings and recommendations made in the report, I intend to issue it to the committee.  It is hoped this will happen early next week.  At this juncture, however, I can advise the committee that a new board has been appointed to govern the clinic and that a new chief executive officer has been appointed to manage the day-to-day affairs of the Central Remedial Clinic.  Furthermore, service arrangement obligations have been met and there are no apparent obstacles to the Health Service Executive and the Central Remedial Clinic entering into similar arrangements for the foreseeable future.  In addition, the CRC has sound financial systems in place.  I thank Mr. Cregan for his work as interim administrator.  I am certain that the new governance arrangements that have been put in place will secure and renew what is a very important service for the clients and their families. <\/p><p>  With regard to section 39 agencies, as members are aware, these agencies are distinctly different from section 38 agencies as they are not directly bound by the Department of Health's consolidated salary scales.  Notwithstanding this, it is important that all agencies in receipt of public funding have due regard to overall Government pay policy.  The Health Service Executive's director of human resources wrote to the chief executive officers of the section 39 funded agencies on 10 December 2013 stressing the importance of each such organisation having due regard to overall Government pay policy in respect of the remuneration of their senior managers.<\/p><p>  Since the introduction of the national standard governance framework for the non-statutory sector, the HSE has required all agencies covered by a service arrangement, both section 38 and section 39 agencies, to complete a template setting out details of the remuneration arrangements for senior managers who are defined as grade VIII and above or equivalents. <\/p><p>  The exercise in respect of section 39 agencies has been undertaken in two phases.  Phase 1 looked at the not-for-profit agencies which receive in excess of &euro;5 million annually in grant assistance, of which there are 23, while phase 2 looked at those agencies which receive between &euro;3 million and &euro;5 million in grant assistance annually, of which there are 16.  While this work is at an advanced stage, a number of the organisations in question have recently forwarded additional updated information on the pay arrangements, etc., that apply and which, I understand, have been provided for the committee.  This information is being validated against the original information provided for the HSE and any necessary change will be incorporated in the HSE's final report on the validation exercise.  The report, when finalised, will be available to the committee. <\/p><p>  On the issue of medical cards, members will be aware of the Government's decision to develop an enhanced policy framework for medical card eligibility to take account of medical conditions, in addition to the undue hardship test.  The HSE has established an expert panel to examine the range of conditions that should be brought into consideration.  It acknowledges that this process may include the development of a new legislative framework for the operation of the medical cards scheme.  While the task set for the expert group is an extremely complex one, it has been requested to furnish a report to me by September.<\/p> <p>In the meantime, the HSE has suspended reviews for existing medical cards that had been granted on a discretionary basis and no further reviews of such cards will commence pending the outcome of the process to develop a new policy framework.  Urgent measures are also being examined to provide for people with severe medical conditions who have recently lost medical cards.  All other medical card reviews continue.<\/p><p> That concludes my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200008#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402567200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien.

Despite the fact that the HSE provided an additional budget of &euro;50 million this year to hospitals and despite the efforts made to more closely link budgets to that underlying cost, sufficient resources were not available either this year or last year to provide them with an amount equal to their previous year's actual expenditure.

It is important to say that, as we put in the HSE service plan, we are seeking to ensure that our management of the safety and quality of services is put at least on a par with the management of our resource position.  Each of those hospitals at local level, within its own management structure, is seeking to manage itself safely within the resources available to it and reduce its overall costs.  In addition, the national division for hospitals is engaging, on a monthly basis, in performance management meetings to try to reduce that expenditure safely.  The new national director for hospitals has sought additional cost containment plans from all hospitals in order to bring them towards break-even position.  Those are due in this week.  Separately, the director general has led a series of meetings with hospital board chairs, CEOs and clinical directors to give clear messages on the need for cost reductions with a view to bringing overall expenditure towards break-even before year ends.  A significant effort is under way, bearing in mind that we have to look not only at the year-on-year position but at the position over the past five or six years.<br \/>During the past five or six years, hospital expenditure - while it has increased slightly, as the Director General said, between 2012 and 2013 - has fallen by between 11% and 11.5%, but the issue is that the budget has fallen by more, and the reductions in expenditure are not keeping pace with that.  In that period, productivity has effectively increased because more services are being provided.  That the increases in productivity are not keeping pace with the falling resource is a constant struggle in continuing to provide safe services - which, we have been very clear in pointing out, is the number one priority.  In terms of providing clear messages and clear direction around the prioritisation of issues to be managed and the hierarchy of accountability, all of these have been reiterated recently at the highest levels, and this will continue towards the year's end.<br \/>We are using every opportunity, including the benefits of the Haddington Road agreement, to get as close as possible to break-even in that sector, but it does represent 75% of our overall challenge.  It is clear from our performance assurance report<b><\/b>that there are examples of additional costs in the hospitals sector, such as in agency services - of which the vast bulk is clinical agency, and the vast bulk of that is medical agency - which are not indicative of a lack of cost control in terms of more doctors on the ground.  It is indicative of price effect that the cost of agency services is going up and up.  Overall, 95% of HSE payroll costs relate to directly employed staff; about 5% overall relate to agency staff and overtime.  In hospitals that cost is higher, at closer to 10%, and it has increased.  While we have dropped overtime in recent years, our agency costs are rising.  Efforts are being made, particularly on the hospital side, in medical and other areas, to further reduce agency costs by looking at particular strategies after we have got the full benefit of the additional hours from the Haddington Road agreement.  As many levers as we can apply are being applied to safely reduce that cost towards break-even.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200009#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1402567200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>Tied in with that is the &euro;690 million target for savings this year.

Hospitals are dealing with increased pressure at the front door at the emergency end.  They are dealing with challenges within the staffing space.  The reason for the increased dependency on clinical agency services - and, therefore, the increased cost - is the twin challenge in some areas of attracting both consultant personnel and non-consultant personnel into permanent employment.  Those areas in the hospitals which are dependent upon cost extraction are where we are most challenged.<\/p><p>  The second area of recourse is that in the original &euro;666 million there was a cost extraction from the Vote of &euro;113 million which related to medical cards, of which &euro;47 million was reversed by way of additional funding, but we have to fill the remaining gap from within our own resources, and that is also providing a challenge.

Can that be explained?  Has the HSE conducted a specific examination of an individual hospital to see where savings might be made and also where extra money is required to be spent, particularly at the front line?  I imagine such an examination would throw up useful information not only for that hospital but for hospitals in general.

However, I caution against any simplistic assumptions that administration costs are in some way bad.  We have significant challenges on the clinical side whereby we expect clinicians to carry out administrative duties.  In some cases there is a need for targeted investment in administration.  We may not have been especially good over the years in separating what is called administration from what people might understand as administration.  Our administrative management costs include costs which other agencies would call professional and technical costs.  We also include costs which relate very much to front-line administration staff.  Let us suppose a person is on a mental health community team.  The team secretary does all the reception work, answers the telephone to the public and ensures the staff get connected to the consultant, if necessary.  That is an essential part of providing a mental health service in the community.  The analogy applies to all our services and yet that is what is called administration.  When most members of the public think of administration they think of back-office administration.  For example, in the case of the primary care reimbursement service we can show that the cost of administering the entire system is approximately 1.2% of the budget it dispenses.  Administration is an essential part of providing a health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200010#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1402567800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Mulvany suggesting that the examination carried out on Tallaght hospital led to considerable efficiencies in how it was run and operated?

Hospital budgets have developed over time in a way that is not entirely related to the demands hospitals face.  There is still some residual impact on the way funds were allocated by health boards.  I offer a good example.  The North-Western Health Board was particularly strong in its community services but not so strong in its hospital services and its funding bias reflected that.  When we did the moderate rebalancing that we carried out in 2013 in respect of hospital budgets it was necessary to make a significant adjustment in respect of Letterkenny and Sligo hospitals.  Part of the story is that the underlying resource allocation is not demand-related.  This is why the money-follows-the-patient initiative is so important because it will progressively enable the funding provided to hospitals to more closely relate to their demands and therefore to their costs.<\/p><p>  Let us consider the Limerick group as an example.  I imagine it is not a group that is overly burdened with administrative back-office functions.  Much of the work is done externally now through health business shared services.  It is probably a hospital that could do with more administrative staff rather than less, having regard to the impact on front-line services of clerks and so on who would fundamentally be able to change some of the workflow processes and skills mix.  It would be unfortunate if the impression were gained that the hospital sector is administratively overly burdened.

The savings this year from reference pricing are on target at about &euro;50 million, which is a substantial benefit.<\/p><p>  On the question of medical cards, including discretionary medical cards, to be clear, a person who wishes to apply for a discretionary medical card can still do so.  Over 5,000 such medical cards have been issued this year and during the period of review and the suspension of reviews we have not suspended the scheme.  Those who have particular needs arising from the cost of treating a medical condition are still eligible to apply and will be granted a medical card if they qualify.  <\/p><p>  To answer the Deputy's specific questions on eligibility, it is important that the scheme be accessible on a national basis without regional variations.  While there are many negatives arising from the review process as it relates to discretionary medical cards, it has achieved one thing in that it has clearly surfaced that there were wide geographical inequalities in terms of who could and could not receive medical cards on a discretionary basis.  That local variation meant that people who probably did not conform with the rules as they stood at the time were receiving medical cards in one area, whereas others in another area had to pass the strict test.  I do not think that going back to that system is the right thing to do.  There is a process in place to determine what medical conditions it might be appropriate to include in terms of eligibility in circumstances where it would not arise.  As this is a process that will ultimately result in consideration by the Government, I would not want to prejudge it.  We have established the expert group which will look at the medical conditions which could be included in addition to or in substitution for the undue hardship test.

The second issue is that of salary top-ups, and the third item is medical cards.  In saying this I am not being personal, but there has been a good deal of talk about the process and so forth.  I find it slightly ironic that we can read in an article in one of today's newspapers that 148 people are fighting over top-ups while people have been contacting us for the past six months about their medical cards, many of whom are elderly people who are petrified that they will lose their cards.  I ask about the whole morality of this.  I, as a public representative, do not think I have ever been as angry.  Other people have come to us telling us that their medical cards have been pulled.  They have gone to their local pharmacist or GP completely unaware that this has happened, and have been told in front of a crowded pharmacy, where they have probably shopped for the past 20 or 30 years, that their medical card has been pulled.  That comes down to administration.  I will return to this point, but I want to put it in context.  The Chairman has also referred to this.  We are talking about it in very abstract terms, but this is about real people's lives - about people losing their medical cards - and there must be questions about the process involved.<\/p><p>  I want to move on to the top-ups.

In a number of instances, that statement and other issues were referenced and it was necessary for us in the first instance to be able to proceed to gain a clear statement of current public pay policy.

As a result of that, the report was furnished to those entities &ndash; I emphasise the entities rather than the individuals &ndash; together with the statement of policy with a requirement for them to respond.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell will recall, when we came before the committee with the report, which I think was in November, we were at a stand-off with some organisations and we had full co-operation with others.  The Deputy will be only too well aware, because of the role the committee itself has played, of the difficulties we had getting some organisations to engage.  I acknowledge the active involvement and support of the committee in helping us to get the attention of some of the bodies concerned.  In many of those bodies we have now seen definitive progress on some of the top-ups being ended and others that are in the process of being ended.  In some instances &ndash; I was at pains to explain that when we provided the committee with the report &ndash; it is not the individuals who are at fault, it is the persons who purported to provide unapproved payments.  Many of the individuals may have taken jobs where they left jobs paid at close to or the same as the new topped up salary without any knowledge that they were being paid an unapproved part of their pay.  There is a due process issue at stake.<\/p><p>  Our human resources and internal audit sections have pursued this assiduously.  People are working on the matter virtually continuously.  However, we do not have the right to set aside a circumstance where an individual may have a legally binding contract.  We are whittling down to the final few cases where that may be the case.  The deadline is 1 July.  Martin Wall speculated about the matter on radio this morning.  There may be a necessity to engage in discussions about the legal framework and whether there are legal options available.  We have not yet reached that point but it is a matter of a couple of weeks away.  Barry O&rsquo;Brien indicated in correspondence to each of the individuals that if they are claiming they have a legal right, or a legal obligation more particularly, to continue paying this, first of all they must prove it to the HSE.  If they show sufficient cause the HSE will then engage in relation to that with the relevant Departments to seek to come to a view as to how we resolve the matter and move forward.  The overall exercise has produced significant change, not just on this but in the totality of our relationship with the section 38 sector.

I understand that the tenders are only now in place to do the fit-out at the new accident and emergency department in Limerick Regional Hospital and that the contractors will not be in place until November.  Why are the contractors not ready to roll on the fit-out today?  Why was there not a parallel process?  It appears to me that there is a six month delay in the contractors being appointed for the fit-out.  Is there a problem with funding?  My understanding is that there is no problem with funding; &euro;20 million has been allocated already.  We have a problem of major overcrowding in the accident and emergency department in Limerick Regional Hospital for the patients and the staff alike.

One reason it was a forerunner in the group structure, one of the first two, was because of the enormity of the challenges it needed to overcome.  The group chief executive officer, the interim board and I identified the necessity to strengthen the management team there.  We have, for example, by open competition put in a financial officer there that it did not have before, as well as other posts.  This particular post simply proved impossible to fill for a variety of reasons, as sometimes occurs.  Consequently, on an interim basis, pending the rerunning of the competition, we used an agency-based approach.  In other words, we brought in someone from an agency to fill the role.

Taking it that they are two components of the debt collection process &ndash; a piece on the HSE and the piece on the insurer side &ndash; the HSE has improved its measure of how quickly we are billing and collecting the debt, by about 7.5%.  Unfortunately, the insurers have disimproved theirs by about 27 days, or 39%.  It is important to say that if we are measuring this process against what we believe to be a process designed by the HSE for the efficient collection of the statutory charge, which is probably what we are regarding it as, that would be an incorrect measurement.  This is not a process designed by the HSE and certainly not a process designed to collect the statutory charge efficiently.  The HSE would be quite able to issue the statutory charge bill on the day of discharge or the day after.  The insurers do not accept that charge until we provide them with a significant amount of additional information which is unrelated specifically to the statutory charge and its collection.

Generally speaking, we have dealt with all the other stuff.  As I said to Mr. O'Brien, it is a business.  On all the major fronts, in my opinion, you have failed.  As a representative of the shareholders, I am sure if they were all here they would probably look at Dr. McLoughlin, because he negotiates the budget in-house before it gets political on the other side, and Mr. O'Brien and consider that both of them should resign.  It seems to me that this is a sort of Groundhog Day in that we deal with the same issues every single time they come before us.<\/p><p>  We had Cathal Magee here a number of years ago who said that the HSE was not fit for purpose.  We have seen the same problems being debated here today.  Half the population of the country are frightened out of their lives.  Individual medical card holders and their families are unable to cope with costs or a system that has failed them.<\/p><p>  People may call for the Minister to resign, which is political on that side and is a different argument.  If I was acting for my shareholders, looking at the organisation, I would say that they are not fit for purpose and should go.  All of these figures and projections point to that.  Not only have they not reached their targets or exceeded them, but they are also employing people at a massive amount of money.  At the same time, the public are looking on with utter disgust at how the medical card process has been managed.<\/p><p>  People who rely on medical cards are turning up at their chemists, as Deputy O'Donnell has said, and are being told at that stage that they do not have a valid medical card.  During the election campaign a man stopped me in the street in Kilkenny.  He ran after me when I passed his house.  He was caring for somebody in there who was terminally ill.  Someone rang the GP to ask if that was right, even though the GP had filled out forms and sent messages about how urgent it was.  Every time an elderly or sick person is asked for evidence of their condition, they are now being charged by the GP for that letter.  GPs are now turning up at the doorsteps of elected public representatives and accusing us of insisting on the letters.  In fact, however, Mr. O'Brien and Dr. McLoughlin are insisting on those letters for people who are sick or dying and relying on the system for their medical cards and their medication.  Nobody seems to understand the pain that is being inflicted upon them.  The letters that are sent out are not helpful.  So many letters go out seeking the same information. <\/p><p>  I want to confirm something for Dr. McLoughlin and Mr. O'Brien.  I have had to put in a scanning system in my own office to scan the material that goes to the HSE for these unfortunate people who are waiting.  That is because when the day arrives, and it seems to be inevitable that it will arrive, that the HSE requests the information again, I can scan it again to the HSE without extra cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200021#U02500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1402574400,"counter":531,"content":"<p>Can I just make a point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200021#U02600","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1402574400,"counter":532,"content":"<p>No, I am sorry, Deputy.

The Chairman asked me to comment on a Government decision and to say whether the HSE got the correct budget.  Government decided on the budget.  We have been through an extraordinary international economic crisis at a financial level.  I clarify that the recent reductions in expenditure <i>per capita<\/i>in Ireland are the highest experienced in any OECD country with the exception of Greece.  I ask the committee to understand that as a civil servant, I am obliged to carry out the decisions of the Government and the Minister in these matters, as is Mr. O'Brien.  We accept that we are in an extremely challenging environment and will do everything we can to take on board the constructive recommendations the Chairman and many members of the committee have made in respect of medical cards and other issues.  However, Ireland's position in terms of public health expenditure has changed dramatically.  We have lost &euro;3 billion and 12,000 staff since 2008.  We have been providing more services for less and reached a point where we will have to provide less for less.  We have done everything we can.<br \/>I am precluded from getting into the political space, but I want the committee to understand that I have been diligent in every respect in terms of discharging my office, as has Mr. O'Brien.  The health committee of the Cabinet is made aware of our concerns and those of our Ministers.  Our Ministers have stated in public that there have been very significant reductions.  At the same time, there have been dramatic improvements in productivity.  We are working on Haddington Road and dealing with a variety of issues.  We have seen significant reductions in cost - a macro number of &euro;950 million from 2007 to 2013 in respect of drug costs - but there are significant challenges in reforming the health system.  We are addressing that.<br \/>I want to recognise the contribution the committee made to section 38 and 39 bodies.  However, I remind the committee respectfully that it was the Department of Health and its Minister who uncovered this following a HIQA report and sought the investigations.  We are obliged to follow due process.  We share the committee's concerns and will deal with the issues in a proper manner having regard to natural justice.  We will get the very best result in respect of the top-ups and all our actions will, of course, be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014061200022#V00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1402575000,"counter":537,"content":"<p>In response to that and to clarify the record, I did not ask you anything about policy.

It was important to put this in the context of the major changes that are under way.  Since January 2012 the Department of Social Protection has incorporated F&Aacute;S employment and community services.  It has reconfigured the system and rolled out the Pathways to Work approach, which aims to provide a more targeted income and support system to people who are unemployed and, in many respects, some of this is as a consequence of criticisms coming from organisations such as the OECD over many years.  One of the difficulties with much of that reconfiguration, and that has been raised with us by individuals members and affiliated organisations, is that to access income and activation supports - in effect to access the public employment service -  one must be in receipt of a jobseeker's payment, be it jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.  That leaves many people unable to access those supports; I refer to people who are not in receipt of either of those payments - people who are in receipt of a one-parent family payment or people who are in receipt of disability payment.  One of the concerns that has been raised with us by affiliates is the current lack of access to a public employment service.<br\/>We are conscious that the services were in need of reform but we would like to see that such reform has as its core a person-centred approach and that the principles of equality and social inclusion are embedded within that approach.  To roll out such services, it is important that the staff who provide them have good training and supports because they need a good working knowledge of social protection, education and training, and employment programmes and then of job opportunities in the wider labour market, which, from an activation perspective, is critical.  A question we are regularly asked by unemployed people and others is: &quot;Activation for what?&quot;, and without there being jobs, that is a very good question.<br\/>As the members are no doubt aware, SOLAS published Ireland&rsquo;s first further education and training strategy in May.  One of the aspects of it we welcome is its learner-centred approach.  In its mission statement it states &quot;enable individuals and communities to achieve their developmental, personal, social career and employment aspirations&quot;.  There is that important role that further education and training and activation in those areas can play in terms of supporting people to be able to find work and in terms of their own personal health and well-being.  <br\/>At our annual delegate conference in 2011 the following motion was put to conference: &quot;The INOU calls on the Government to ensure access for unemployed people not included on the Live Register to the full range of employment, training and education supports including the Training Allowances and other supports.&quot;  It was put to the conference by the general branch, which is the mechanism through which individual members can engage with the formal structures of the INOU.  To be an individual member a person must be unemployed, regardless of whether she or he is in receipt of a social welfare payment, or the nature of that payment.  There would be a number of people in receipt of other social welfare payments, be it the one-parent family payment or a disability payment to our individual members. <br\/>Mr. Michael McNamara, who is a member of the general branch, spoke at the time - this was prior to some of the changes that have come through with the reconfiguration of the system - of being offered opportunities of re-education and retraining but of not being able to access them because he could not access a payment because his wife was working and he then found it very difficult to participate on the course.  That closed off an opportunity for him to be able to reskill and re-enter the workforce.  In many respects, his circumstances reflect a space in which a good number of unemployed people find themselves - their jobseeker's benefit has come to an end and they do not make the transition to jobseeker's allowance.  Approximately one third of those who leave the live register fall into this category.  <br\/>In the  case of a person aged under 25, their parent&rsquo;s income is taken into account and in the case of a person over that age, the income of their spouse or partner - or the means of the person concerned if they have means - is taken into account and that can mean that the person concerned does not make the transition to jobseeker's allowance.  The person may find that after six or nine months they are unable to access activation supports and in many cases people find that were not able to access such supports because they would not have been deemed officially unemployed long enough to be able to do so.  The other category in this respect are people who are self-employed.  These people were not entitled to a jobseeker's benefit payments because they were not paying the necessary social contributions and may not have applied for a jobseeker's allowance payment because they may have assumed they were not entitled to one although they may have been, or they may not have been able to access it because of the means test.  They are in a very similar space to somebody coming to the end of their jobseeker's benefit payment.<br\/>We are conscious as a result of the issues raised with our welfare rights section through our individual members and affiliated organisations and the training work we do that many people fall into these two categories and many people who have worked ten, 20 or 30 years feel very badly let down by Ireland's social protection education and training and employment support services.  This is very much captured by an e-mail we received from a woman in Tipperary who asked us:<blockquote>Are there others like me?  I am currently unemployed but not in receipt of any SW payment as my husband is in full-time employment.  I have no problem with that but what does annoy me is that I cannot apply for any Employment Schemes, F&Aacute;S courses etc. because I have to be in receipt of a payment.  I really want to get employment and would happily work in a scheme but find the situation very unfair ...  I feel as if I am the forgotten unemployed!! <\/blockquote><\/p> <p>On the situation the lady in question and Michael raised, prior to budget 2010 people were able to access a F&Aacute;S training allowance and were able to participate on a course.  In that budget access to such a payment ceased and since then with the way the system has been reconfigured, access has been further tightened and it is now very difficult if one is not in receipt of a payment to apply for a scheme or F&Aacute;S course.<\/p><p> Feedback from affiliates, individual members and others highlight the importance of being able to participate on a programme for people&rsquo;s health and well-being and the negative impact when people cannot access a course or scheme.  Likewise, we are conscious that being forced to participate on something that one does not deem suitable or feel is going to improve one&rsquo;s chances of getting a job can have equally negative consequences for people.  We feel choice is really important and people being supported to make an informed choice.  Being unemployed impacts on people&rsquo;s confidence and their ability to network.  We regularly hear that it is difficult to hear about a job if one is not in a job.  As we all know, so much information in Ireland goes around informal networks.  It is critical to have the choice to be able to access supports and could make such a difference to people.  It is an important issue to address and it is critical that if Ireland is to emerge out of this crisis that it would have a more equitable and inclusive society.  We recommend that the matter is addressed urgently; that access to programmes is based on wider criteria than a person&rsquo;s live register status; that programme participants are given the wherewithal to support their engagement; and that the public employment service develops the capacity to respond to the needs of all people of working age seeking employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200003#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Br&iacute;d O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402564200,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I thank Br&iacute;d O'Brien very much.

I also thank the committee for this opportunity which we appreciate.  I represent the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, NWCI, which is the leading national women's membership organisation in Ireland.  We represent 175 member groups across a diversity of backgrounds that have different interests in this area.  We also represent a growing and committed individual membership.  Economic independence for women, which is key to the discussion, is a core priority of our work.<\/p><p>  The NWCI has long argued, most recently in the Careless to Careful Activation Report, produced by Dr. Mary Murphy who is present, that the limited focus on the live register on jobseeker payments cannot reflect or address the full picture of joblessness in Ireland or the levels of unemployment or underemployment among women of working age.  While the live register may illustrate some important trends in terms of gender - men, for example leave the register at four times the rate for women, a large number of women who are jobless fall outside its scope.  This is a useful opportunity to move the public and political debate on unemployment beyond the rise and fall of the live register and on to the question of joblessness.<\/p><p>  We hoped to contribute perspectives on two aspects of context and then to make a couple of specific recommendations for the committee.  The first important context is that wider access to activation will be needed in order for Ireland to meet its obligations and commitments on the increased economic participation of women.  Increased economic participation of women is a core objective of Ireland&rsquo;s national women&rsquo;s strategy.  It is also a key requirement within the Europe 2020 strategy.  Earlier this month, the first country specific recommendations, CSRs, for Ireland delivered under the EU semester process strongly emphasised the need for new measures to support women&rsquo;s economic participation.  The CSRs noted that \"Ireland has one of the highest proportions of people living in households with low work intensity in the EU.\"  The rate moved from 14.% in 2007 to 24.% in 2011.  The CSR also highlighted \"the unequal labour market participation of women at 67.2% in 2013, as compared with 83.4% for men.\"  It is worth noting that participation rates fall to 55% for married women.<\/p><p>  The ESRI also noted a reversal in the long-term rise in female participation rates during recent years.  Child care and access to child care must be tackled in order to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s targets for participation are to be achieved.  That can be seen when we look at the Central Statistics Office's annual Women and Men in Ireland 2011 report.  It is an important report that must be maintained on an annual basis.  I am aware the matter is currently under discussion.  In 2011, labour market participation for men and women aged 20 to 44 was equal at 85% for those without children.  However, for those with a youngest child aged under three, women&rsquo;s participation rate plummets to 57%, and even after the youngest child has reached the age of six, women&rsquo;s participation still remains at only 58%.  Clearly, that is a point at which women are falling out of the labour market and remaining out.  The NWCI would strongly recommend that child care, and access to child care support such as the extension of child care supports currently available to those accessing various jobseekers schemes and projects, including afterschool care, should be considered as an essential as part of non-income activation support within the committee&rsquo;s proposals.<\/p><p>  Women also face significant obstacles to re-entering the labour market after any period of absence, as described by Br&iacute;d O&rsquo;Brien.  Those who have been out of the labour market for a period find avenues of activation have been closed to them.  One of the few initiatives that was previously available was the spousal swap.  The focus on the INOU&rsquo;s presentation was on activation supports through means testing or due to their partner's employment.  That has a strong gender dimension and particularly impacts on women and household insecurity.  Given the increasingly precarious nature of much employment, including much employment available to women, for example, who may be offered precarious employment, there can be a reluctance to take it up if it inhibits the access that others in the family, including a partner, might have to activation.  It is worth noting that by limiting activation in that way one is pushing families into a situation of relying on one partner to work which might be precarious and households can easily may slip into joblessness.  We support the extension of training supports so that households have resilience and that they are job ready, and that one is looking at two job-ready individuals within a household.<\/p><p>  Voluntary access to certain activation supports would also be welcomed by many women on disability payments.  An option to seek out training or career planning supports could prove important to many women on one-parent family allowance to ensure they feel job ready after a period of absence.  That should be a resource that is made available around career planning and training programme access.<\/p><p>  Those are some of the issues of importance but in the limited time available I wish to focus on the specific question of qualified adults.  In many ways they are a legacy of the social protection system&rsquo;s origins in the idea of a single, usually male, breadwinner who is also the financial decision maker.  Under the arrangement, recipients of social welfare payment such as a contributory pension or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance may receive an increase in their payment in respect of a qualified adult, previously known as an adult dependant, usually their spouse or partner.<\/p><p>  There is a strong gendered dimension to this arrangement.  More than 90% of qualified adults are women and, although in certain circumstances direct payment to the qualified adult is facilitated, the overall arrangement of payment to the usually male claimant for both partners contributes to an imbalance in the power and decision-making dynamics within families and households, including the decision to return to work.  Those concerns were highlighted by women themselves in recent research by Creegan and Murphy.  One quote is: \"Sure I can hardly go to the shops without him wanting to know where I am, never mind working\". <\/p> <p>That power dynamic needs to be addressed, and extending access to activation supports is a way to ensure that women do not have to move through a filter.<\/p><p> Given that women are not in the system in their own right, very little is known about qualified adults.  The National Women's Council has long called for a comprehensive data survey on the numbers of qualified adults and their circumstances.  We strongly support the policy recommendations made by the Department of Social Protection, in its 2006 report, which suggested administrative individualisation as an important step towards an individualised social welfare system and concluded that \"each person will have access in their own right to our system\".  Such administrative individualisation could be introduced.  I am aware Dr. Murphy has a number of proposals as to how administrative individualisation could be incrementally and practically introduced, and we might address those during questions.  These non-income activation proposals are a positive step in the right direction.<\/p><p> Currently, almost no activation schemes are open to qualified adults.  Previously, the spousal swap was a very limited scheme that allowed a jobseeker claimant to transfer their entitlement to accessing community employment, CE, or back-to-education allowance to a partner.  That was concluded in January of this year and the scheme has ended.  Even though that scheme was flawed in that the decision rested with the usually male partner claimant, it allowed some families to negotiate a transfer between the breadwinner or carer roles in a family and to examine how those were allocated.

The key point I would make is that research has found that where jobseeker claimants are claiming an extension for qualified adults there is only 67% of the normal rate of claim closure.  These are jobless households which are not closing claims.  Reports have also found that 50% of qualified adults make use of a small income disregard available to them.  That shows that many women are keen to engage with the labour market.  That is the reason qualified adults in many cases may have more to gain and contribute in terms of access to activation or training opportunities.  Opening up opportunities to both partners could have a positive impact on reducing the number of jobless households.<\/p><p>  I will not elaborate on them but there are four factors to be considered in this regard.  Choice is fundamental.  It must be voluntary and decision-making must lie with qualified adults.  An appropriate range of options must be made available.  I referred to individualisation earlier.  Education first approaches are often most appropriate for qualified adults, and the 2010 reversal in access to training could be revisited.  Child care, as I discussed, is another factor and also the question of training for case workers because research has found that job centre staff specifically lack knowledge in engaging with internal decision-making in households around the power dynamics to which I referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200005#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice-Mary Higgins"},{"type":"speech","time":1402564800,"counter":616,"content":"<p>Mr. John McKeon is the next speaker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200005#G00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402564800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it today for the discussion on the provision of activation supports.  I am joined by my colleagues Niall Egan, who is a principal officer with responsibility for policy in respect of the provision of income supports for people of working age, and Eoin O'Sheaghda, who is our assistant principal officer working in our illness and disability policy division.  The purpose of my opening statement is to provide the committee with an overview of the various activation services available to jobseekers and others.  As usual, we are happy to take any questions at the conclusion of the statement.<\/p><p>  The activation services provided by the Department of Social Protection can be categorised under three broad headings: employment services, employment programmes and employment supports.  Employment services are personal advisory services such as those provided at our Intreo centres and those services funded by the Department and provided by local employment services and job clubs. These services include advice on job-search activities, personal support with the development of a personal progression plan, assistance in the development of curricula vitae and interview skills, the provision of guidance on education and training opportunities, and the provision of online job search tools.  These services are, subject to resource capacity, available to all people regardless of their social welfare status.  However, given the current level of unemployment, and in particular long-term and youth unemployment, resource capacity is prioritised to serve the needs of people who are unemployed and on the live register.<\/p><p>  Apart from employment services, the Department provides a number of employment programmes to help jobseekers acquire and-or retain and maintain the currency of their employment skills.  The programmes include temporary employment programmes such as community employment, T&uacute;s, the rural social scheme and Gateway; support for entry to self-employment through the back to work enterprise allowance; internships and work placements such as JobBridge and the work placement programme; and income maintenance support for return to education through the back-to-education allowance scheme.<\/p><p>  In addition to employment services and programmes the Department operates a range of employment supports to assist jobseekers and employers.  These include the JobsPlus subsidies for recruitment of long-term unemployed people; in-work income supports including family income supplement and income disregards for groups such as lone parents and carers; and a range of supports specifically for the recruitment and retention in employment of people with disabilities.  These include EmployAbility, the wage subsidy scheme, the work equipment adaptation grant, the employee retention grant, the disability awareness scheme, and partial capacity benefit.<\/p><p>  Expenditure by the Department on these activation services and supports is considerable and it is estimated that it will reach approximately &euro;1.36 billion for 2014.  Large numbers of participants are involved, for example, average budgeted participation in 2014 is just under 25,000 on community employment; just under 8,000 on T&uacute;s; just under 11,000 on the back to work allowance; just under 24,000 on the back-to-education allowance; and just under 7,000 on JobBridge.<\/p><p>  Outside of the Department, the other main form of non-income activation support is through the provision of a range of training programmes by SOLAS and the education and training boards.  These include programmes specifically tailored for young early school leavers; mainstream day and evening courses for unemployed people; and training specifically for people with disabilities provided through specialist training providers.<\/p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills through the general education system also provides return to education options at second and third level that are availed of by unemployed people and people looking to re-enter the workforce.  In the case of people of working age in receipt of a social welfare payment, income support in the form of the back-to-education allowance is available to sustain them for the duration of the course.<\/p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills also provides through the Springboard programme a mechanism whereby unemployed graduates can undertake a third level conversion programme to acquire qualifications that are in demand in the labour market, for example, the conversion to IT programmes.  Such graduates can avail of the back-to-education allowance scheme provided by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>  Eligibility for access to non-income activation services can be considered as falling into three categories.  The first category is made up of people who are unemployed, not engaged in any employment activity and receiving a jobseekers welfare payment.  Such people have access to the full range of employment services, subject in some cases to requirements in respect to the period of unemployment.  The distinguishing feature of this group of people is that they declare themselves to be fully available for and genuinely seeking work and as such they are prioritised for, and are required to engage with, our activation services as part of the job search and availability conditions attaching to their welfare payment.<\/p><p>  The second category is composed of persons in receipt of other working age welfare payments, for example, those related to disability, long-term illness, caring, casual-part-time working, and lone parenthood.  In general, people in receipt of such payments do not declare themselves to be available for work.  In the case of disability payments, recipients have declared themselves unfit for full-time work and have been assessed as such by the Department's medical assessors.  Similarly, those people in receipt of carer's payments have self-declared that they are not available for full-time work.  Accordingly, people in receipt of the payments mentioned are not required to engage with an activation support scheme as no job search or availability conditions are attached to their welfare payment.  However, the Department is anxious that, in so far as resources allow, people in receipt of these payments should have access to supports from the Department so that they may have an opportunity, without obligation, to pursue employment options.<\/p> <p>Accordingly they have access to the full range of supports, with the exception of T&uacute;s, JobsPlus and MOMENTUM or in other words, those payments or services which require a minimum duration of unemployment and where eligibility is limited to long-term recipients of jobseekers&rsquo; payments.<\/p><p> As for the jobseeker payment group, when participating on a scheme they receive a payment either equal to or higher than their prior welfare payment.  It should in particular be noted that there is a number of specific activation services, such as the wage subsidy scheme and the EmployAbility service, provided to support people with disabilities access the labour market.  We have set these out at appendix 1 to the opening statement.  Recent changes to one-parent family payments also have introduced a category of transitional jobseeker payment specifically designed to address the employment services and activation needs of lone parents migrating from one-parent family payment status to jobseeker status as their children get older.  Again, this is set out in appendix 2.<\/p><p> The third category is made up of people who are not in receipt, in their own name, of a working age welfare payment such as, for example, a person in respect of whom a spouse or partner, who is in receipt of a welfare payment, is claiming a qualified adult allowance.  This group also includes people who, although they are seeking employment - for example are looking to re-enter the workforce - may not be entitled to a jobseeker payment because they do not satisfy insurance contribution or means conditions.  For example, their means, based on the earnings of partners who are in employment, may exceed the threshold required to qualify for an income support payment.  People in this category can register with our Intreo centres and with local employment services and job clubs and, subject to capacity and the priority which must be afforded to the other groups mentioned, will be offered access to the employment services provided at those centres.  In terms of employment programmes and supports, the eligibility of this group is generally limited to access to SOLAS training for unemployed people, to the work placement programme and to the return-to-education options provided by the Department of Education and Skills.  With the exception of some travel and meal allowances attached to the SOLAS and education and training board, ETB, programmes, there is no income support associated with participation on these programmes.  However, it is important to note there are circumstances whereby people who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment in their own names may, nevertheless, qualify for the full range of services and supports.  For example, a person who is a qualified adult dependant on another&rsquo;s jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claim may choose instead to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance in his or her own right and this is known as claim-splitting.  In splitting the claim, the person concerned becomes subject to the job search and availability conditions attaching to his or her welfare payment but gains access to all employment supports on the same basis as other wholly unemployed claimants.  Similarly, people with a prior history of social insurance contributions may be eligible to sign on for what are known as credited social welfare contributions or credits.  People signing for credits, although not receiving a cash payment, are eligible to participate in a number of additional schemes, including JobBridge.  Moreover, the spousal swap option is still available, certainly in respect of the back-to-education allowance scheme.<\/p><p> The principal rationale for the differential approach to treatment I have set out is that, in a period of high unemployment and given the detrimental impact of prolonged periods of unemployment at an individual, family and societal level, the key objective of activation policy has to be to provide a pathway back to employment for people with a work capacity who already are, or who will in the absence of support become, long-term unemployed.  A further consideration is that State expenditure should be targeted towards those who, on the basis of an assessment of means, need support the most.  These policy objectives prioritise the allocation of scarce resources in the first instance to those people in receipt of qualifying welfare payments, in particular those for whom there is a job-seeking conditionality where the State should, in line with the principle of rights and responsibilities, match this conditionality with the provision of services to support the jobseeker on the pathway back to employment.  However the State also is mindful that other unemployed people could benefit from support in accessing the labour market and has committed, as part of the Pathways to Work programme, to develop proposals during 2014 as to how the Intreo activation process can be extended to jobseekers not in receipt of a welfare payment.<\/p><p> I hope I have set out adequately the current situation with regard to the provision of activation services by the Department of Social Protection and my colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200005#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402565400,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il libh as an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite agaibh.  I asked that this issue be raised and examined to ascertain how the issue of the hidden unemployed can be addressed.  In many ways that is what it is, namely, some people who may qualify for qualified adults allowance and others who do not exist in the system for one reason or another, many of whom formerly were self-employed and do not qualify for jobseeker's allowance.  Such people may have built up savings and therefore, if means tested for supplementary welfare allowance, do not even get this until their means are reduced.  My interest in this issue arose initially because a man from Cork wrote to me - interestingly, it was a man.  While I had come across a number of cases over the years, all I could tell people was they had fallen into a crack and needed to sign on in their own right.  That was the advice I had but in this instance, the man set out in considerable detail, over approximately ten pages, the consequences for him of being unemployed and not being able to access what he hoped would be some form of retraining or re-education away from the work he previously had undertaken.  His point was that most schemes within the system require one to be in receipt of a social welfare payment, not to have built up credits or to have paid PRSI or anything else.  I sought to bring this issue before the joint committee to try to tease out whether mechanisms exist that can be put in place.  While members understand that funding is tight, the question is how can one address cases in which people seek not funds but access to a course, from which they then can go on to be in full-time employment again.<\/p><p>  In the case to which I referred, the man had been self-employed formerly and his point was that he was excluded from the supports.  Although he had paid class A PRSI for many years, on becoming unemployed he found himself excluded.  He observed that although the advisory group on tax and social welfare has acknowledged this education and training deficit, the issue of the exclusion of such people has not been addressed.  In another case, a man wrote to me last week stating that he lived with his girlfriend, who is unemployed, and that she was refused jobseeker's allowance on the basis of his means.  However, he is not in the position to avail of her tax credits or allowances.  This issue has been around for quite some time and ties in with this matter, in that she is being punished and there is no benefit.  The idea of individualisation arises repeatedly and perhaps it must be examined.<\/p><p>  I have another question with which the departmental officials may be able to help me.  One problem is that if one decides to sign on in one's own right, one then must start from scratch.  There is no recognition that one had qualified for a qualified adults allowance, whether for six months, six years or 36 years.  Consequently, if one signs up in one's own right, the eligibility activation criteria, be they for six months, nine months or one year, all start from scratch.  This can be a deterrent and there are cases of women who may be in abusive relationships, who desire to get out of them and who wish to have the requisite training to revert back to the work they had.  However, because they do not have this, it may hold them in that abusive situation for longer.  Obviously, were they to leave the home, they could qualify for a payment but one is starting from scratch.  That is the key and one of the initial issues to be examined specifically could be the qualified adult allowance and a recognition that someone in receipt of that allowance is in receipt of a payment.  If the State is recognising them, it should recognise they exist and this is a question for the Department.<\/p><p>  Ms Alice-Mary Higgins made mention of Dr. Mary Murphy's proposals and Dr. Murphy might provide detail regarding the aforementioned administrative individualisation.  Finally, Ms Higgins mentioned the spousal swap option had been ended but this was contradicted by Mr. McKeon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200006#H00200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402566000,"counter":620,"content":"<p>To clarify, for CE schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200007#J00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice-Mary Higgins"},{"type":"speech","time":1402566000,"counter":621,"content":"<p>If one does not go to individualisation, there should be no restriction on spousal swap for any course and the system should recognise that.

I have been following a lot of their work with interest because I am interested in social welfare.  I have Dr. Murphy's report, and there is quite a lot in it.<\/p><p>  I could talk all day about these matters but I will try to summarise what I want to say.  On the access to programmes, Mr. McKeon has contradicted that by stating that applicants have access.  According to his report, they will not have access to funding but they will have access to all the activation programmes.<\/p><p>  On women in the home, prior to 1995 the women had no homemaker's credits.  The men are sick of me because I bring this up at every committee meeting they attend.  The women who are facing pension reductions today are in that position because we moved the goalposts.  I state constantly that these women should be given credits the same as the women after 1995.  What is the difference between women prior to and after 1995?  I cannot see it.  Obviously, it all boils down to funding.<\/p><p>  Ms Higgins has much in her presentation.  Of course, needless to say, in a wonderful world it would be great, but the fact is we are dealing with limited funding and there is no getting away from it.  Where someone has been in the home rearing children or whatever, the children have gone off to work or are going themselves, and the person can go back to work, he or she cannot access jobseeker's allowance because the person's spouse is earning too much.  No doubt we cannot merely open a floodgate and state that everyone can get a payment, even if his or her spouse's earnings are considerable, because we do not have the funding to do so.<\/p><p>  For the departmental officials, I will give the example of a carer in the home where the child being cared for is gone off to school for the day and the carer wants to do a course to retrain.  Such carers find they can access the course but they cannot take it up because, if it is over 15 hours, they immediately lose their carer's allowance.  That is ridiculous because the child is in school for those hours and the carer should be able to do that course.  I have had several cases of carers who tried to do that and lost their carer's allowance, which is ridiculous.  They should be allowed to do a training course to retrain themselves in another area.  Even when the person being cared for passes away or no longer needs caring, the carer has a wealth of experience and knowledge in caring.  They could be a special needs assistant or a home help, but they must access a course to get their qualifications for it.  All of these matters are proving to be problems for them.<\/p><p>  Ms O'Brien stated that one third of those who are on jobseeker's benefit do not make the transition to jobseeker's allowance where they are unable to access activation supports, but I cannot understand why they are not signing for credits which will give them access to the activation supports.  There should be no reason they cannot.  The only ones who cannot access credits are those who come off a self-employed contribution, which is another issue I have taken up with the Department on several occasions.  Someone who is self-employed, comes off a class S contribution and signs on for jobseeker's allowance and is successful does not get a credit contribution even though he or she is signing for jobseeker's allowance.  It does not make sense to me.  I will keep that fight going.<\/p><p>  The issue of child care has to be tackled.  Last year we hoped to put in the second free year of preschool.  We all know what happened there, that the funding had to go to retraining.<\/p><p>  There is another matter I want to raise with the officials.  I have a lady who is coming off the one-parent family payment and going onto jobseeker's allowance.  She went to the local office last week and she came to me for help with the forms.  While I have every faith in Intreo, which is good and is really working, she came into my office and asked would I help her fill them.  I filled five forms, one of which is large and has detailed information and four others, including a yellow one and a white one which for some reason means test twice those on jobseeker's allowance.  The five forms contained the exact same information about one's children, one's relationship with them, whether one lives with the applicant, etc.  I cannot understand why, in this day and age, one form will not suffice and the information is not keyed into the computer from the one form where all the social welfare officers can access that information.  The woman was overwhelmed.  She has not worked in many years because she was rearing her family.  She has no choice but to go onto jobseeker's allowance and here she is presented with this barrage of paperwork.  It is crazy and I cannot understand it.  I immediately rang the social welfare office in Killarney and spoke to a social welfare officer who said she had no idea what I was talking about.  I said I would bring it in, and I meant to bring it today to show the officials present in case they think I am exaggerating, which I am not.  Five forms containing the exact same information does not make sense.<\/p><p>  I will leave it at that.  I will come back in afterwards, if I have time.

We are expecting that report shortly.<\/p><p>  On the question about starting from scratch where, for example, a qualified adult decides to split a claim or move on, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh is correct that such is the position.  It is not one that has been raised with us previously but we will have a look at it.  We apply conditionality for access to schemes as flexibly as we can.  For example, there would be other schemes which take applicants off the live register and then they want to go on MOMENTUM, and they are on community employment.  We take account of and aggregate their time if they have been on another scheme and are moving between schemes.  In principle, there is not an issue with it.  I will check to see whether there is an administrative issue that might make it difficult, but certainly that is something we will definitely look at.

Owing to the way the legislation is drafted, the vast bulk of people who will be affected this year will lose their entitlement on a single day, 3 July 2014.  We have put in place a very streamlined process.  We have written to all affected one-parent family payment recipients inviting them to an information session to talk them through their various options.  This group needs a lot of help because many of those concerned may never have gone to a social welfare office in the past.  It is a question of making them aware of all the available supports, including family income supplement, the carer's allowance, disability allowance and jobseeker's allowance, and explaining the jobseeker's transitional arrangement, which is a special arrangement specifically for lone parents making the transition.  Part of the process involves a streamlined application.

What was said by the two members on credits and contributions is really important.  While recognising that qualified adults are doing care work in many cases, I believe individualisation is one route whereby people could be building up credits that could facilitate access to the workplace.  Starting from scratch is a very real concern because, as we mentioned, when women are seeking to make a change in their lives, the impact on the overall household is very often a huge consideration.  To move to a position of seeking jobseeker's allowance, waiting for the claim to be processed and waiting for an opportunity is much more daunting than that of moving straight into a dynamic activation process.<\/p><p>  The question of contributions was raised by Senator Marie Moloney.  As the Senator stated, the homemaker's credit represents a very important issue.  Moving towards a full transition to the homemaker's credit, rather than the homemaker's disregard, is essential.  Bearing in mind the principle and practice, it sends a very strong signal to women, not just women of working age but also women who are not of working age, that the time they spent outside the workforce is valued as still connected to society and the system.  Even the language of credit is essential and important.  That is something that should be pushed forward immediately.  It sends a strong signal and it is very practical.  The homemaker's credit could provide a starting point, much like the re-entry credit, which has been discussed.  This idea was advocated previously by the National Women's Council.  The proposal is for a re-entry credit that might be granted to women, or any partner or spouse, seeking to re-enter the workforce after a period of not being in it.<\/p><p>  Since I mentioned individualisation, I will pass over to Dr. Mary Murphy.  If I have an opportunity, I will answer some of the other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200008#K01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice-Mary Higgins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402566600,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I thank the members for the opportunity to contribute and for their questions.  The dominant issue is the policy rationale for using the live register as the key vehicle through which to prioritise access to activation supports.  This is really the structural issue on which we are focusing.  We have been here before.  Just as we were coming out of the crisis in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was considerable policy attention on initiatives such as the Partnership 2000 working group on women's access to the labour market and the report from the social partnership process.  This concerned the degree to which we should use the live register as the vehicle through which we distribute resources and engage in activation.  It is worth pointing out that when we had 4% unemployment, 20% of the working age population were dependent on social welfare.  We are fooling ourselves to some degree if we believe the live register is an accurate reflection of phenomena such as poverty or the lack of labour market participation.  There is a lot of social welfare hidden in the data in that people are not participating and could be.  We need to learn from the past more clearly.<\/p><p>  With regard to learning from the present, we know we have a new problem on our hands.  Our number of jobless households with children is twice the European average.  They are most at risk of poverty and represent a deep structural problem in Irish society and the labour market.  This problem needs to drive our activation policy in a way that it may not be driven at present.  Those three caveats are important.<\/p><p>  Jobless households with children are headed by lone parents in some instances, or people with disabilities or jobseeker families in others.  With regard to jobseeker families, 50,000 people in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or jobseeker's benefit have qualified adults and children.  Therefore, there is a very targeted group of householders who are clearly passing payments means tests, have children and are clearly jobless.  They have to be a target for activation policy.  One question that arises is whether we are making enough of the possibilities of activating the women in those households.  Clearly, we are arguing that we are not.  Some of the issues that arise concern the degree to which the live register is acting as a barrier to those women.  First, there are barriers preventing them from getting onto the live register.  That they are not able to do so becomes the barrier to activation.<\/p><p>  There is ESRI evidence dating back 20 years that when women are visible in the social welfare protection system, they see themselves as potential labour market participants in a different way than if they are invisible.  The State acts on their visibility and invests more in them to move them off social welfare.  Visibility, individual access and individual entitlement comprise an important embedded principle.<\/p><p>  There are many barriers that we know of.  One of the biggest is that one must be looking for full-time work.  We know many women, or qualified adults, have children.  To some degree, we have been innovative in the recent policy on lone parents.  The jobseeker's transition payment recognises that one can be attached in some way to the social welfare system and jobseeker's payment but seek part-time work.  There are clear creative opportunities to design access routes to the live register for qualified adults using the transition vehicle.  That is one approach.<\/p><p>  Other blocks are anomalies such as the three-day week and atypical work.  There is ongoing work on this as part of the activation report.  There are many cultural issues to be addressed in terms of how we administer the social welfare system.  Having to fill out five forms, as mentioned by Senator Marie Moloney, is an issue in this regard.  There are cultural barriers faced by women even when trying to make a claim in the local office.  The orientation of the social welfare system is, for very good reason, not to incur extra administrative work when it is not useful.  Hatch clerk workers tend to say to individuals that there is no point in their signing on in their own right as they will not get any more money.  They say signing on is a pain in the neck, that one must fill out various forms, prove one's child care circumstances and prove one is seeking a full-time arrangement.  They tell the potential claimants they are wasting their time and should go home.  That still happens in the local offices when women try to activate a claim splitting process.  Therefore, there are many cultural practices we need to name.<\/p> <p>There are a number of clear policy moves we could make to open up that space, even in the context of limited resources.  They all need to move towards an individualisation of the tax and social welfare systems.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, the fact the tax system is not individualised for cohabiting couples but is for married couples is a structural issue that acts as a disincentive to work.  That needs to be looked at, but I want to focus on individualisation of the social welfare system.<\/p><p> People have referred to the spousal swap, which I always thought was unfortunately named, as a popular option for people to take.  It is limited and does not address in any structural way what is going on.  It is not addressing the possibility of both parents in that household activating into the labour market.  We should be trying to maximise the amount of economic activity of both adults in those households.  Maybe both of them could get part-time jobs that would add up to a full-time job instead of focusing on one adult or the other.  It is very past tense to be doing that.  The spousal swap is wrong in its orientation because it is swapping entitlement rather than opening up both parents' orientation to the labour market.  That is an important thing.  It is a quick fix and may have been welcome for what it did at the time, but it is not the answer.<\/p><p> We need to understand that claim splitting was originally introduced in situations of domestic violence or where the male breadwinner was not delivering money back into the family home.  The cultural association of claim splitting in a lot of working class communities is that one needs a letter from a social worker or doctor to prove that one's husband was not giving the money.  One would then get the payment in one's own right.  Claim splitting is unpopular culturally and we need to know why people do not do it.  A lot of the time we say only 1,000 people are looking for claim splitting, so people must not want individual access.  That is not the case, however.  They do not want something that has a stigma attached to it, so a lot of men in working class households are uncomfortable if their wives seek to split a claim because it is known in the pub as not bringing home the bacon and not giving her the money.  We need to understand, therefore, how these things work in practice or why they do not work.  Something that is not a spousal swap or claim splitting needs to be deeper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200008#K01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402567200,"counter":648,"content":"<p>Is that culture moving away?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200009#L00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402567200,"counter":649,"content":"<p>It is moving away but these things move away over generations and the culture gets embedded over generations as well.

For first-time claimants, one could introduce a default option whereby the claim is split and where both adults in a household are recognised as potential claimants.

In that instance, however, it offers the opportunity that one of the parents in a household is seeking full-time work while the other one has care obligations for a certain time period but is eligible for the jobseeker's transition payment.  It allows one to open up that space whereby both see themselves as potential labour market actives.  In the longer term, they can manage their household and orientation around that framework.<\/p><p>  The Chairman is right in that, over time, we would like to see the cultural sharing of care open up in a more meaningful way.  This opens up those possibilities.  It is not necessarily a question of who would be the jobseeker's transition payment recipient.  It is open to either person and is not necessarily a gender decision.  It is recognising that there are children in the house who need care.  Let us be realistic, therefore, that there will not be two full-time workers in a house.  In most households in Ireland there are not two full-time workers.  The dominant model is 1.5.<\/p><p>  Introducing default for first-time claimants would open up the system a little bit and allow us to build on it.  As resources open up and, hopefully, we move into economic growth, we could remove the limitation rule for parents who want to opt into labour market participation.<\/p><p>  One of the big issues is that there are live register implications.  The politics of this are difficult because if one brings more people into means-tested jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit payments, the live register goes up.  There is room to be creative around that, however, in terms of how we measure unemployment.  It is possible to have different measurements of unemployment.  For example, we could have a measurement showing how many households are unemployed, rather than how many individuals.  That could get over the problem, but it is not something I would get stuck on.

One concerns data and appreciating the benefits of doing this in the longer term.  There are short-term implications for administrative resources in the Department but they can be overcome.  There are implications in having a sufficient number of activation resources.  If we are bringing more people into potential eligibility, we want to be able to satisfy the legitimate demand that might be created.  To some degree there is an argument that we have to increase budgets around activation measures.  The EU's social investment package stresses that we need to calculate the cost-benefit analysis of putting in extra activation programmes.  We should get a quick social return on that investment.  Within a year we would begin to see the benefits of reduced social welfare payments and increased revenue.<\/p><p>  We must get smarter about showing the economic benefits of investing in these activation programmes.  They should be made available in a way whereby those who can best utilise them can return the investment as quickly as possible.  There are data issues regarding how we measure the social impact of these matters.<\/p><p>  Pension incentives are important.  People might ask why we are talking about pensions when we are discussing activation, but many women realise they will need a decent pension later on or will have their own independent pension.  To that end, they know they will need to work at some stage.  They not only want to return to work now but also want to secure their future in old age.  Opening up eligibility for pensions and making it easier to access them ties in with incentivising women in such households to work.<\/p><p>  Tangible things could be done that do not have massive resource implications but which open up gateways to provide stuff incrementally that might have resource implications down the road.  One need only take those steps when one knows one can fund them.

I am somewhat concerned that because we have limited resources, we cannot address this issue from the perspective of people who are unemployed but not in receipt of a payment.

It is not just the information that is in issue.  Many people who are the subject of a qualified adult allowance - obviously someone else receives it - do not know the consequences of that.  When the partner goes down to claim a social welfare payment in the first instance, he or she is asked who else is in the house and says \"my spouse\".  It is usually a wife.  That is a qualified adult.  Nobody ever explains that there is a consequence for her to be a qualified adult rather than to have a payment in her own right.  Nobody says she would be limited by not being able to access these job activation measures.  Where there is a policy change in the Department on eligibility criteria, an information campaign should be in place to inform people of the option to individualise a claim and the restrictions as a consequence of not doing so.<\/p><p>  In terms of credits, I have continuously encouraged people to sign on for credits.  The incidents where people are not permitted to must be addressed.  At the very least, if a person is unemployed and cannot receive a payment, he or she should be able to receive a credit.  Perhaps, the credit should be the mechanism for eligibility rather than the payment.  There are people who to all intents and purposes should qualify for CE, but because they are not in receipt of a payment, they cannot.  I have encouraged some of the social protection workers to give a peppercorn payment of 5 cent so that those people would be in receipt of a payment which would allow them to access job activation.  I know it would be an administrative nightmare but these people are not looking for a huge amount of money, they just want access to the courses so they can get back into the system.  That is some of what underlines what I have said.<\/p><p>  The other thing to remember is that much of what we are looking for is voluntary.  Many people who are qualified adults are happy in that position.  However, there are those who are looking for changes.  To clarify my earlier point, if a person's time as a qualified adult could be taken into account, it would be a major shift and a welcome announcement from the Department.  It might be that a certain period as a qualified adult would be required as an initial step, but in any event it would help a lot of women in particular who want access to community employment and JobPlus, though not JobBridge, with which I do not agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200010#M01200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1402567800,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I came across a case recently of a person who could not sign on for credits.

There was some information in our youth guarantee plan.  I will find the reference and send it to the Chairman.  It set out that the number is quite small and the European Union has recognised that the situation in Ireland is not the same.  In many other member states, one must work before one can claim any jobseeker payment.  In France, unless one has worked, one will never be measured as a young person who is unemployed.  In Ireland, one can claim jobseeker's allowance immediately.  Unless one's family income is in excess of &euro;100,000, one will be able to claim some element of payment.  Most young people can get on the live register.  There are no plans to change the credit situations of people who have never worked or that people who do not come straight out of school or college will get it.<\/p><p>  I might respond to a couple of other matters.<\/p> <p>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh raised the issue of linking the claim of the qualified adult to a subsequent claim.  We do not have a difficulty with that in principle but we need to look at the administrative and regulation aspects.  This issue has been raised with us before.  As I said, we do not make allowances for people on other schemes that would not strictly speaking be live register schemes.  The principle is already established.  We need to look at the practicalities of regulatory, legal or whatever other issues we might need to get through to make it happen.  <\/p><p> I will talk about some of the other issues that have been raised, for example, using the live register as the mechanism to access supports.  The issue there is that most people on a social welfare payment, as I said my opening payment, can get access to the supports.  The issue is the employment service at the Intreo level.  Purely by weight of numbers, we must prioritise people who are coming in, signing on and declaring them jobseekers in terms of access to the Intreo centre service.  Where there is capacity in the Intreo centres, we will deal with other people.  The other thing we must be cognisant of is that it is a condition of jobseekers' payments that they genuinely and actively seek work.  Again in terms of prioritising resourcing, we must respond to that as the State and say that we are obliging them to do something and must help them to do it.  Some of the other cohorts mentioned do not have that obligation.  In the first instance, we must prioritise those who have the obligation.  <\/p><p> To the extent that there is capacity in the system, people on disability and carer's payments will get access to the Intreo service.  On the local employment service, one-third of its capacity is reserved for what it calls \"walk ins\" - people on non-jobseeker payments walking in as opposed to people referred by the Department - so that capacity is there.  <\/p><p> Claims splitting is a difficult issue.  There are cultural issues in terms of claims splitting.  One of the issues is that when someone splits a claim, they are declaring that they are now a jobseeker.  Again in line with the Government policy of rights and responsibilities, if a person declares that he or she is a jobseeker and claims a payment on that basis, we would require him or her to stand up to that declaration by participating in activation schemes and in that case, it would be non-voluntary just as it is for jobseekers.  There are important issues there and many qualified adults were not working prior to their partner becoming unemployed.  It means them changing their status and for a variety of reasons such as no longer being the caregiver or homemaker, they want to be treated as a jobseeker.  One can get into cultural norms and so on.  It means that when they make that declaration, they must then respect their obligations.  The Department has no issue with that.  It is perfectly happy to take people splitting claims once they accept that they then have an obligation to engage with the Intreo centre, to take a referral and to move on to community employment or T&uacute;s if they are so referred.  This is not what many people want, which is the difference between the voluntary and obligation and obligation versus opportunity.  It reflects where we are.  I know Dr. Murphy mentioned that when we were at the peak of the economic boom, there was a greater shift towards moving away but we must recognise that circumstances have changed.  The infrastructure we are putting in place with Intreo, which of its nature must deal with people on the live register, will be available in time as conditions improve.  That is something we have committed to look at as part of Pathways to Work this year to see what might be available.  We must all accept the reality.  There are 390,000 people on the live register and we are obliging them to look for work.  The Department must focus our services and the &euro;1.4 billion we spend on those people first and foremost.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200010#M02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402568400,"counter":681,"content":"<p>My point concerns what Mr. McKeon said about how those open to claims splitting for qualified adults would have to be available for and genuinely seeking work and accept the rights and responsibilities.  To some degree, that is missing the point that 55% of qualified adults are working part-time.  They are utilising the income disregards in the social welfare system.  I do not think there is as much of a cultural shift for qualified adults to come in and accept some of those obligations.  The problem is that the obligations are gendered in that they are obliging people to seek full-time work.  If the obligations were in the context of the way the jobseeker's transition is being rolled out for lone parents with caring responsibilities between seven and 14, qualified adults would engage in that space.  Many of these women actually want to work.  They think of themselves as moving on.  The nearer they get to the system, the more the system will also have a motivation to move them out of that system.  It is good for both to make them more visible in the system.  The jobseeker's transition opens up the policy space to do that.  One is talking about a very targeted group of women being brought into the system but it would have the greatest possible impact on the places where the poverty risk is the highest.  I do not think we should forget that.  There is such a focus on activation as a way of reducing the live register but activation is also a key part of a national anti-poverty and social inclusion strategy.  Those jobless families with children are in the middle of that strategy and we need to make sure we are targeting them because we are not doing so right now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200011#N00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402568400,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I would echo that.  When we are looking at the question of genuinely seeking work and the way we consider and configure the criteria around that, the National Women's Council strongly believes that the jobseeker's transitional payment should be used and looked to for qualified adults, particularly those within jobless households.  The reality is that 50% of qualified adults are engaged in some form of work.  By recognising that there is such a thing as genuinely seeking and being available for part-time work, one will not only accommodate and recognise care and recognise that it is not a zero sum game between breadwinner and carer but that care is shared in many modern families and the breadwinning role can be shared, one that will bring women into the system and recognise that 36% of the women in the workforce are working part time.  Part-time work is a reality that is increasing.  As well as looking at extending the jobseeker's transition model as a really strong and workable model for qualified adults, there is also a need to look at some of the activation programmes and training we have and to make sure they are working for part-time work and accommodate flexible hours so that part-time work is not equated with precarious work but that people are provided with routes into genuine progression and careers that work around flexible hours.<\/p><p>  I did not raise the issue of spouse swap to say that we should necessarily bring it back.  I was saying that looking to the potential for activation for both adults in a jobless household is important.  Even in terms of the priorities as listed and discussed, I would think that jobless households with a jobseeker's claimant and two unemployed adults should be very much a priority group in terms of activation because conditionality is coming into that household through one individual.  If voluntary measures were introduced for the other individual in that household, we saw from the ESRI report yesterday that positive motivation and incentives, initiations to act and the possibility of long-term economic security in terms of one's pension are the things that motivate people into work.  <\/p><p>  Voluntary contributions to pensions have become quite difficult because the threshold has been raised in terms of being allowed to make voluntary contributions for people coming back into the workplace after a long period of absence.  That should be looked at so that the long-term security of being in the system with a pension becomes more achievable rather than seeming impossible because one is starting from a disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200011#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice-Mary Higgins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402568400,"counter":683,"content":"<p>A question was asked about signing on for credits.

One of the goals of the interim model is to improve the level of knowledge and awareness of the group engagements.

The number on family income supplement, FIS, has nearly doubled this year compared to last year, and much of that is directly attributable to our working with jobseekers.  Newspaper reports yesterday about families that cannot be bothered working because they are on welfare are nonsense.  We make an effort to point out that FIS is available and that one can move into employment and be far better off.  That illustrates the kind of effort we are making to improve the level of knowledge and awareness.<\/p><p>  The matter of jobless households gets airtime, and while it is an issue, based on the data, it does not exist independently of the unemployment situation.  Before the economic bust, Ireland had a lower level of jobless households than the European average.  Although it has increased to above the European average since then, it has increased exactly in line with the level of unemployment generally.  We must be careful about the definition of the term \"jobless household\", which means low-work-intensity household, where work occupies less than 20% of the adult time.  We need to be careful when issues get airtime and make headlines which may generate more heat than light.  While we have an issue, particularly for lone parents and families with children, it is not as acute as it is sometimes represented.  The primary focus in tackling jobless households must be unemployment growth and activation.  If we reduce the number of unemployed people, based on how it grew, it will bring the number of jobless households back towards the European average or below.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014061200012#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1402569000,"counter":692,"content":"<p>Given that many of the jobless households are not families that are on the live register, the activation strategy does not stretch to them.

It is, therefore, welcome to have this early opportunity to look at the June European Council and the decisions beyond.<\/p><p>  Before going into the detail and nature of this process and examining our views on the recommendations, I will address why it is of benefit to Ireland to participate in the European Semester before examining how it will work and what will happen in the coming weeks and beyond.  I will then offer a few perspectives on each CSR and the Government's priorities in respect of them.  I refer to why there is a semester and why it is in the national interest to participate in it.  The semester is fundamentally about advancing our own national interests.<\/p> <p>It is about us taking steps that are necessary and working together with our society to put in place measures that will support the competitiveness of the Irish economy and support the ability of individuals and families to do well.  It is about ensuring we have the ability in our society to generate the wealth in the future that will deliver a higher standard of living for all the people we represent.<\/p><p> Alongside that, we have seen the consequences of bad policy and decisions elsewhere and the impact they have had in other countries.  Fundamentally, we have seen how decisions elsewhere can have consequences at home in Ireland.  They can have ramifications that extend well beyond national boundaries.  That is why we have the European semester.  It is to help and support us in making decisions that we believe are important for getting more jobs into Ireland, for making it a fairer country and for ensuring there is more wealth in the future to support families and their standard of living.  By doing this through a semester, it creates an environment in which other countries can do the same.  All of these decisions are made together to move Europe forward in its entirety.<\/p><p> We should also be clear that everything within the country-specific recommendations is entirely consistent with policy decisions and outlooks that we have firmly established at home.  I refer to the plans in regard to the medium-term economic strategy which look at the objectives the Government has from a budgetary point of view, at our deficit, at the difference between tax and spending and at the targets in regard to our debt, how many jobs we want in our country and how we want our economy to grow in the future.  The policy content of other plans, such as the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work, is absolutely consistent with being inside the European semester.  I refer to the recommendations which have emerged from the European semester through the country-specific recommendations.   <\/p><p> As I said, the main focus of this process is on the underlying performance of the Irish economy.  This means, first and foremost, adapting our public policies and our public services to ensure we respond effectively to the challenges and opportunities of an increasingly knowledge-intensive and increasingly interconnected global economy.  It means identifying the steps that can be taken over the next 12 to 18 months to deliver growth that is sustainable and inclusive and consistent with what Europe is trying to do overall through its 2020 strategy, on which I will touch in a moment.  It means, in particular for Ireland, keeping at the very top of our political agenda our collective response to addressing what clearly remains continued high and unacceptable levels of unemployment.  That is the reason behind the semester, the reason we are participating in it and the reason it is being done in a way that involves all countries playing a role.<\/p><p> I will now look at the process.  The Commission's country-specific recommendations package was produced on 2 June and it brings us into the closing phase of the semester process for 2014.  It is about developing and implementing jointly agreed measures to support growth and jobs.  In essence, it means that in many policy areas, we agree particular priorities at EU level and we implement them at national level.<\/p><p> This process brings together the different strands of the European Union's stronger post-crisis economic governance arrangements.  There are two key phases in this regard.  First, we agree on our shared challenges through the annual growth survey.  The committee will remember that there were five main priorities here and they were endorsed at the December and March European Councils - in other words, at the meeting of Heads of State and Government.  These five priorities are: pursuing differentiated - in other words, plans specific to different countries - growth-friendly budgetary changes; restoring lending to our economies; promoting growth and competitiveness for today and tomorrow; tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the unemployment crisis; and modernising public administration.<\/p><p> Second, and following from this, we agree specific orientations for each member state, tailored in the light of the priorities I mentioned to reflect the national circumstances of each country.  These country-specific recommendations are prepared by the Commission for agreement by the Council and endorsement by the June European Council.  They then fall to be taken forward by the member states through the national budget and policy cycles in the second half of the year.<\/p><p> The crisis has taught us important lessons about the interdependence of the economic and budgetary policies pursued across the member states.  In other words, what happens in one country can affect what in all member states.  We all know this is particularly true given our sharing of a single currency.  We enjoy a shared dividend or a benefit when our different economies are performing well and responding successfully to globalisation - in other words, the changes that link all of our different economies together.  We have a shared interest in safeguarding against the emergence of avoidable and shared instabilities.  That is why we developed the stronger economic governance arrangements now in place, including the so-called two-pack which was agreed under the Irish Presidency and why the European semester process is anchored in policy co-ordination at EU level in the first half of the year, supporting stronger mutual surveillance, peer review and shared learning.  It is a forward-looking process that aligns preparations for the national budgets with agreed economic and social policy objectives.<\/p><p> I will move on to the overall country-specific recommendations package and speak briefly on each one.  The Commission presented its country-specific recommendations package on 2 June.  This followed a number of specific inputs by the Government, on which I made a presentation at a previous committee meeting.  They included the national reform programme under the Europe 2020 strategy which relates back to the five priorities to which I alluded earlier and the stability programme updates under the enhanced Stability and Growth Pact.  That plan looks at all the different targets and strategies in regard to budgetary objectives, such as deficits and debt levels, and the level of employment we seek to deliver in the future. <\/p><p> The Commission's package is also informed by the 17 in-depth reviews produced on 5 March - one for each of the 16 member states identified in the alert mechanism report as being at risk for macro-economic imbalances and one for Ireland following our exit in December from the EU-IMF programme.  The Commission has presented country-specific recommendations proposals for 26 member states.  The other two - Greece and Cyprus - remain under specific adjustment programmes.  Ireland is a full participant in this year's arrangements.  The CSRs will now be settled within the Council over the coming weeks.  Ministers in the areas of employment protection and social policy will agree their country-specific recommendations on 19 June and on 20 June, ECOFIN Ministers will finalise the country-specific recommendations on budgetary and economic policies. <\/p> <p>On 24 June the General Affairs Council, at which I will represent Ireland, will approve an integrated set of final country-specific recommendations, CSRs, which will then be endorsed by the Heads of State and Government at their meeting on 26 and 27 June.  These will be reflected in a final Council recommendation to be adopted by Finance Ministers in early July.  Preparatory work by the relevant Council committees began last week and is now well under way.<\/p><p> There are seven country-specific recommendations for Ireland.  These are in the areas of stabilising the public finances, health care spending, labour market policies, social inclusion, access to finance, non-performing loans in the financial sector and legal services.  Before turning to each of them, it is fair to say that there are no particular surprises for Ireland.  Following many troika reviews, many of the key issues are well rehearsed.  We have raised some minor technical and drafting issues with the Commission which cover its assessment and the CSRs themselves.  These fall for consideration through the Council committee work that got under way last week.<\/p><p> On the whole, we see the CSRs as broadly sensible policy directions that will underpin the positive trajectory we have re-established for the Irish economy following a very difficult and protracted recession.  Last year marked Ireland's first year of net employment growth since 2007 and 2014 will see a return to net employment growth for the EU as a whole.  A strong momentum for this recovery into 2015 and beyond will now be reinforced by the CSR package to be endorsed by the European Council at the end of this month.<\/p><p> I will now speak about each recommendation.  The first CSR focuses on the further work necessary to restore balance to our public finances, responsibility for which rests with the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Notwithstanding the very significant fiscal or budgetary adjustments of approximately &euro;30 billion already undertaken, the Department of Finance's official forecast is for an Exchequer deficit of 4.8% this year.  The Government is committed to reducing this deficit below 3% of GDP in 2015, consistent with exiting the excessive deficit procedure, the mechanism for monitoring deficit levels in various national economies.  The amount of further consolidation necessary will be determined in the context of the October budget, informed by the latest forecasts and endorsed by Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  We have raised a drafting issue with the Commission with regard to this CSR.  We do not agree that expenditure ceilings require further enforcement.  We have amended the Constitution to ratify the stability treaty and have already legislated for relevant expenditure ceilings.<\/p><p> The second CSR refers to health spending and is focused on cost-effectiveness in the health sector as part of our overall management of public finances.  Lead responsibility rests with the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The direction set is fully consistent with the reform programme, Future Health, produced in 2012.  It should also be seen in the context of the significantly increased demand on services associated with the crisis.  This includes 500,000 more medical card holders since 2008, an increase of more than one quarter.  We envisage further savings on pharmaceutical spending this year.  We are developing a business case for procuring a new integrated financial management system and aim to roll out individual health identifiers in early 2015.  We have also raised a wording issue here, as the January target specified for the health identifiers in the draft CSR is not realistic.  We expect to agree a suitable amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014061200002#A00400","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402578600,"counter":705,"content":"<p>To clarify, is what has been raised a wording issue or the fact it is not realistic?

It refers to the timing of achieving this objective as recommended by the Commission.  We will achieve it but we believe it will take a different length of time from that in the CSR.<\/p><p>  The third CSRs is focused on further strengthening of our active labour market policies.  This means building a bridge to the workplace for the unemployed.  It also means being responsive to an accelerated pace of change by supporting continuous upgrading of skills and capabilities.  Lead responsibility is with the Ministers for Social Protection and Education and Skills.  The Intreo one-stop shops will be fully rolled out by the end of 2014.  We have produced a new five year further education and training strategy following the establishment of SOLAS in October last.  We continue to support a significant expansion in training and work placement, including through rolling out the first phase of the youth guarantee.  While we face a significant challenge in expanding service provision within current resource constraints, the further development of our active labour market policies remains unambiguously at the very top of our agenda.  The next phase of this work will be reflected in the forthcoming Pathways to Work 2014.<\/p><p>  The fourth CSR focuses on a set of policy challenges in the area of social inclusion.  These are jobless homes, child poverty and child care services.  Lead responsibility is primarily with the Ministers for Social Protection and Children and Youth Affairs.  Low work intensity is the official EU indicator for households with little or no paid employment.  It is clear that the share of the Irish population in such households, at almost one in four, is significantly above the EU average.  Key policy responses include Intreo, reform of lone parent supports and development of the housing assistance payment.  The advisory group on tax and social welfare is due to report shortly on structuring a smoother transition from welfare to work.  Further research is under way through the National Economic and Social Council to support clearer identification of key problems and solutions.  There is, however, little doubt that increased labour market participation remains the best route out of poverty, and that affordable child care will continue to play an important role in this context.<\/p><p>  The fifth CSR is focused on policy supports for SMEs, with a particular emphasis on access to finance.  These are issues on which the Ministers for Finance and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation lead.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, is finalising proposals to improve the operation of the credit guarantee scheme.  A review of the microfinance scheme will commence shortly.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, recently launched the SME online tool that will help Irish start-ups and small businesses navigate the range of supports for which they may be eligible.  The establishment of the strategic banking corporation of Ireland was announced on 22 May.  This envisages a mix of funding from the German bank KfW, the European Investment Bank and the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The first phase is expected to make available &euro;500 million, with work continuing to expand its scope and size.  We will ensure strong political momentum behind these initiatives to support SME finance through ongoing development and implementation of work under the Action Plan for Jobs.<\/p><p>  The sixth CSR is focused on non-performing loans in the banking sector.  It addresses a very difficult set of issues arising from the complete collapse of our banking system.  There is, therefore, a strong continuity with a challenging agenda already advanced up to December last.  An integrated mortgage arrears strategy is now firmly in place.  It includes personal insolvency, the mortgage advisory service and the mortgage to rent scheme.  The most recent mortgage arrears resolution targets were produced by the Central Bank on 4 June, setting out expectations to the end of 2014 of sustainable solutions for 85% of customers more than 90 days in arrears and concluded solutions to reach 45%.  For SMEs, the Central Bank has been setting quarterly institution-specific targets since June 2013.<\/p> <p>This means moving distressed borrowers to longer term forbearance solutions.  Progress by Irish banks in restructuring their small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, loan books are well advanced.  In terms of distressed commercial real estate exposures, this is an ongoing process through the work of NAMA, including last year's wind-up of IBRC.  Work on establishing a central credit register is being taken forward by the Central Bank.<\/p><p> The last recommendation focuses on legal services reform.  This issue has been repeatedly highlighted by our National Competitiveness Council, NCC, for many years.  Under the Action Plan for Jobs, we are committed to enacting the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 by the end of this year so that we might strike a better balance between the interests of consumers and legal professionals.  The work on this is being led by the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p><p> We agree that we must improve data collection in respect of the efficiency of court caseload disposal, but this is another area in which we expect to secure agreement on a more suitable wording, including by removing the reference to the quality of judicial proceedings.  Work in this regard is being taken forward by the Courts Service, with a particular focus on the upgrading of ICT systems.<\/p><p> The recommendations touch on a wide range of issues relevant to the preparation for the October budget and, more generally, ongoing public policy development.  This point is worth emphasising.  In my discussions with this and other committees on how we engage with the EU's processes, much of our debate has related to debt or deficit levels.  As members can see from the overview I have supplied, there is a broader engagement on many aspects of Irish governance that subsequently impacts issues such as debt, growth and jobs.  The breadth of this process is something that I have always emphasised when appearing before this committee to discuss the semester and it cuts across the responsibilities of a number of Ministers and Departments.  The detailed timing and relative prioritisation of individual policy measures will remain firmly a matter for determination by their respective Ministers and the Government.<\/p><p> This meeting forms part of an important process of developing a more visible role for the Oireachtas in the European semester process.  It builds from our previous meeting in April on finalising our national reform plans for submission to the European Commission later that month.  I understand that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, held a useful discussion with the jobs committee on Tuesday in advance of his Council meeting, which will settle the country-specific recommendations, CSRs, on employment and social policies.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is due to have his pre-ECOFIN meeting with the finance committee on 18 June, where I expect the agenda will touch on the recommendations for budgetary and economic policy.  There will be statements in the D&aacute;il on 25 June in advance of the European Council.  While my presentation has focused on the process and overall nature of the recommendations, there has been and will be an opportunity to touch on the CSR relevant to each committee.  Endorsement of the final package by the June European Council will, in turn, provide and line up plenty of opportunities for further engagement on all policy areas across the relevant committees during the months beyond.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to make this presentation.  I look forward to members' questions and comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014061200004#C00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402579200,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014061200005#D00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1402579200,"counter":709,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the committee.  He mentioned that there would be no great surprises in these recommendations.  The Government has been dealing with the relevant matters for a while.  The recommendations continue on from the troika's programme.  On Tuesday, I asked a question of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, at the jobs committee.  These are classed as recommendations, but what is their legality?  Are they directives, recommendations or expectations?<\/p><p>  The Government will play a role in implementing the CSRs, but is the Minister of State directly responsible for liaising within the Government to ensure their implementation?  Are the CSRs similar to those of other countries?  Bank restructuring, access to finance and reducing unemployment are surely issues across the EU.  The Director-General for Enterprise and Industry, Mr. Daniel Calleja Crespo, appeared before the jobs committee yesterday.  Access to finance is a particular issue in his country, as is its high unemployment rate.  Can anything be learned from how the other countries are dealing with such issues?<\/p><p>  Personal and public debt present a significant challenge and are the subject matter of a recommendation.  In March, the Commission described it as one of the remaining macroeconomic imbalances.  How much of an issue will it pose?

In his introduction, the Minister of State referred to how we had seen the consequences of bad policy mistakes at home and abroad.  I would amend that, as we are still seeing the ramifications of bad policy on Ireland and further afield.<\/p><p>  This is a question of sustainable jobs across Europe.  Consider the high rate of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment.  The Minister of State's document refers to social inclusion and inducing spending in the economy, which is of paramount importance to the country's survival economically.  If we cannot induce spending other than what we see from external investment, we will face a major difficulty.  The issues of social inclusion, a reasonable quality of life, unemployment, child poverty, our high literacy and numeracy rates and so on are interlinked in the creation of sustainable jobs.  If we cannot create those, this report's recommendations will mean nothing.  We discuss bringing unemployment figures down, but that is substantially done through the creation of schemes that focus on taking people out of the social welfare system for an extra &euro;20.  They are paid a rate that almost impoverishes their families.  I supplied examples in the D&aacute;il.  One chap was on a scheme under which he got an extra &euro;20, &euro;15 of which was taxed.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, could not comment, as she did not know why that would be the case.<\/p><p>  This is a problem across Europe.  There have been many recommendations through the years, but that is exactly what they end up being.  I see nothing concrete or evidential in terms of how we will implement them.  For instance, from where will these sustainable, long-term jobs come?  Jobs are everything in any economy.  It is not possible to keep 220,000 people - this number depends on the figures one uses, as it could be anything between 170,000 to 250,000 - in long-term unemployment.  Not only would it draw billions of euro every year from the social welfare budget, but also from the health budget, dampening the economy and curtailing growth therein.<\/p><p>  In the past six months in particular, people have had a problem with Europe.  They expressed it in how they voted.  We get nothing concrete from Europe.  For example, I can make recommendations on how something should be done.<\/p> <p>What we need are concrete proposals for the creation of sustainable jobs in Ireland and to address all of the issues covered in this report, including social inclusion, child poverty, unemployment and the provision of a reasonable quality of life for people.  That is a reasonable request.  There is nothing in this report to support the claim that within two years we will have induced spending in the economy and reduced our rate of inflation, because we will have provided people with quality jobs which, in turn, enabled them to spend money and assist in rebuilding the economy.  This is where Europe falls down consistently.  It simply produces tonnes of recommendations to which there is no substance.  <\/p><p> I am not being critical of the Minister of State.  Where in this report is the evidence that in two or three years something substantial will happen in the Irish economy that will help growth and reduce our illiteracy rate and child poverty level, which is extremely high?  We need to be able to point to somewhere in this report which supports the claim that within a two or three year period Ireland will have dealt with its high level of unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014061200005#D00400","speaker":"1094","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402579800,"counter":712,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the meeting.  I would like to follow on from some of the comments made by Deputy Halligan.  The objectives of European Semester 2015 include pursuance of differential growth, friendly fiscal consolidation, restoring lending to the economy, promoting growth and competitiveness, tackling unemployment, social consequences of the crisis, modernising public administration and so on.  No one here has any problem with any of that.  However, what we would like to know is how this is to be achieved.<\/p><p>  I am disappointed that the Commission's recommendations appear to call on the Irish Government and other Governments across Europe to continue with their austerity programmes, which have been disastrous for middle and low income families.  The message following the European elections not only in Ireland, but across Europe, is that people want a different approach.  The approach suggested in this report while at face value is fine will not deliver for people in difficulty.  We have a two-tier Europe.  The growth necessary to create employment has not happened.  Many economies across Europe are in the doldrums.  <\/p><p>  The anticipated growth rate of forecasts is never met.  What steps are being taken to ensure a more accurate picture in this regard and, more important, what steps are being taken to ensure real growth in the economy?  The Minister of State referred to active labour market policies, including the roll out of the Intreo one-stop shops and a significant expansion in training and work placements.  Yesterday, I raised in the D&aacute;il the reduction by 20 in the number of VTOS places in my constituency.  For no logical reason, these places are being allocated to Balbriggan.  While the population of Tallaght and Walkinstown is double that of Balbriggan, the latter is getting 20 additional places.  There is no logic in relation to what is being done.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State also said in relation to social inclusion that there is little doubt that increased labour market participation remains the best route out of poverty and that affordable child care will continue to play an important role in this context.  I know from speaking to lone parents and parents in general that the problem is a lack of affordable child care.  What is being done to address this problem?  Other issues addressed in the report include a reduction in the cost of legal services and so on, which is positive.  Reference was made to the Commission's conservative attitude in regard to how growth in an economy is brought about.  In regard to its proposals for a widening of the tax base, a sharpening of environmental taxes and wider application of the property tax, what is the Irish Government's reply in light of people saying they have had enough and cannot afford to pay more?  In taking more money out of local economies we are creating more unemployment.<\/p><p>  While I am critical of the overall tone of the recommendations, I do not have a problem with some of them, including the need for progress on reducing legal services and drugs costs and so on.  It is often stated that Ireland has a small population and should work out its own drugs bill.  Is there a need for a European-wide review of the cost of drugs?  Many drugs are produced by pharmaceutical companies located in Ireland yet drugs cost more in Ireland than anywhere else across Europe.  The companies that have located here are welcome.  Ireland has no separate agreement with these companies.  While I would welcome health savings, how will these be achieved?<\/p><p>  Other recommendations include reform of societal issues such as mortgage arrears, taking on vested interests in health and legal services and so on.  We are at the top of the class in relation to austerity but at the bottom of the class in relation to most other issues.  At the end of the day, one can take what one likes from this report but there is a democratic deficit within the EU.  This is being said not only by Sinn F&eacute;in and the Independents, but other organisations dealing with poverty.  In my view, we are only going through the motions today.  Unless there is substance in terms of what Government is doing, we are only going through the motions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014061200006#E00200","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1402579800,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Minister of State for leaving earlier but I had to attend a vote in the Seanad.  Like Deputy Crowe, I would like to comment on the drugs cost issue.  The cost of drugs in this country has been allowed to increase from &euro;560 million in 2000 to &euro;2 billion by 2010, which is an almost 300% increase in a short time.  The legislation in relation to generic drugs has since been introduced.  Currently, &euro;2 billion of the &euro;13.2 billion health budget is spent on medicines and so on.  We do not appear to have brought on board all of the players in the health care sector.  For example, the IMO recently appeared before the Joint Committee on Health and Children and was heavily critical of various issues in relation to Government.  The point I made to them was they had a part to play.  The complaint from hospitals is that there is over-prescribing by GPs and GPs are complaining about medication being prescribed in hospitals.  There appears to be no attempt to work together to bring down the huge cost of drugs to the health budget.  We have fallen down in terms of getting people to work together.  It is in everybody's interest that this huge cost be reduced.  Legislation is welcome but this is not only about legislation, it is about getting people on board.  If in the morning a facility to which people could bring unused medicines was open, one would have no problem filling a skip very quickly.  We are not doing enough in this area.  It is an issue that must be addressed.<\/p><p>  The second issue of concern for me is that of legal services costs.  A matter I tabled for discussion on today's Adjournment Debate in the Seanad was, unfortunately, not selected.<\/p> <p>I will return to it next week.  I raised the matter 18 months ago of a third Taxing Master being appointed to the High Court.  We are talking about legal costs but people have finished cases as long as three years ago and nobody has been paid because decisions are not being made when cases have been dealt with by the courts and costs are not finalised.  The only solution is to appoint a third Taxing Master to sort out the problem.  Taxing Masters have reduced costs substantially but we should give the people involved in providing a service the opportunity to get paid.  I raised the issue 18 months ago but now we have a worse problem than before.  The matter must be sorted out once and for all.<\/p><p> Cases that would take less than four hours have no decision on costs a year later.  We speak about money flowing in the economy but, unfortunately, in this area people who have provided a service have not been paid.  We have a part to play in this process.  We can talk about a legal services Bill all we like but if we are not prepared to provide the adjudication process for decisions to be made in order that people can get paid fairly for the work done, we are wasting our time with any reform.

In the past, when people sought to address issues of economic insecurity in a similar fashion, it brought about serious disaster.  I am concerned that we are heading in that direction again.  Extreme views are emerging on the hard right and the hard left.  If that continues, the result will be disastrous and every country in the European Union, including this country, will pay the highest price.

The Chairman will attend the COSAC meeting in the next few days.  I strongly urge that he and his colleagues in the EU bring this to the attention of all the authorities in Europe and ask why these people were elected to represent these extreme views.  What is the purpose or objective, where are they going, who sent them there and for what purpose?  Perhaps the Chairman can return with the answers to those questions.

With regard to country specific recommendation No. 1, dealing with financial consolidation, we must note that there has been a significant increase in tax revenue in this country recently and also a significant real drop in public expenditure.  I do not believe we should agree to taking another &euro;2 billion out of the economy.  Last year the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform listened to the views of a number of actors, including the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, the Small Firms Association and others who, surprisingly, at that time and without the continued improvement we have seen in the economy, were very concerned that to remove any additional expenditure from the economy would have an adverse effect.  In fact, when it comes to removing money from areas such as social welfare expenditure, the knock-on effect on the wider economy is even greater.  I raise that as a caution in respect of CSR No. 1.<\/p><p>  With regard to the active labour market policies and the related matter of social inclusion, I am very concerned about what the Minister of State referred to in his statement as low work intensity, which is the official EU indicator for households with little or no paid employment.  It is probably something we do not say often enough but it is important to point out that at the height of the Celtic tiger economy, in the period 2004 to 2007, this country had the second highest level of households with no member of a family employed.  It is important to emphasise that in the European context.  We are now ranked as the highest, but to go from number two to number one at a time when the bottom has fallen out of the economy is not entirely a surprise.  There is a serious structural issue with households that are experiencing severe long-term unemployment.  While we are making progress with people who have experienced unemployment over recent years, we have a structural problem with the long-term unemployed.<\/p><p>  I welcome initiatives such as the introduction of the housing assistance payment, which allows people to move out of dependency on rent supplement and to go back to work.  In my experience, when people have the ability to move on to a differential rent system, they tend to go back to work.  They want to work.  There are structural issues in terms of State payments and it is important we deal with them.<\/p><p>  On the SME finance sector, I have a serious concern about SME procurement and I have raised it on a number of occasions.  It has been my personal experience that often when the State puts work out to tender, it puts in request for tender requirements on companies and SMEs that are simply unrealistic.  I can give an example.<\/p> <p>I was involved in a request for tender for free legal services in a previous life when I was on a State board.  The value of the contract was no more than &euro;15,000, yet there was a requirement for &euro;3 million in insurance.  It is outrageous to look for that amount of insurance for a job worth &euro;15,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014061200008#G02300","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402581600,"counter":757,"content":"<p>Was it public liability or professional indemnity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014061200009#H00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1402581600,"counter":758,"content":"<p>It was professional indemnity insurance.  This morning there was an issue raised about the procurement of books for libraries, for example.  Some of the requirements put Irish SMEs entirely out of the frame.

We have to be very conscious when we start looking at so-called value for money that we do not remove value for society on another level.  I ask the Minister to look at SME procurement requirements and, in particular, State requests for tenders.<\/p><p>  With regard to non-performing loans, the good news is that the most recent statistics show that the number of mortgages in arrears for more than 90 days has decreased.  A lot of the data have put a cloud over some of the issues that we need to address.  One of them is that we have a major problem, not only with access to finance for the SME sector, but access to finance for middle and lower income households.  The banking sector does not want to know middle to lower income households.  We will have to look seriously and realistically at what we are going to do about introducing some type of third banking force into this country or looking to the local authorities within the context of mortgage finance for low income families.<\/p><p>  We should look at the threats facing the economy when we look at some of these issues.

Those are the recommendations in the area of debt levels, deficit levels and all the things that could contribute to that, whether that is public spending and all the measures that underpin same.  They could, at a point, lead to sanctions but there are many different steps in between that we would have to through to trigger the sanctions.<\/p><p>  In saying all that, I wish to emphasise that much, if not all, of what is included in the country-specific recommendations we would have to do anyway to deal with many of the challenges posed by our national finances.  That direct answer to the Deputy's question on the source of all this is that it is the two article references I mentioned.  The sanction nature of this, were that to happen, is mostly loaded in the budgetary end of the country-specific recommendations.<\/p><p>  With regard to the non-budgetary CSR, it operates on the basis of what is called \"comply or explain\".  That means one is recommended to do them but if one does not do them, the relevant Minister must give an explanation at his or her relevant Council group.  In Ireland's case, nearly all of what is included in these country-specific recommendations comes out of plans or strategies we are already implementing or have already published.<\/p><p>  With regard to whether the CSRs are consistent across all countries, there are some areas of consistent focus, such as, for example, the areas of budget, debt levels and the need to promote the kind of growth that will deliver more jobs.  There is a fair bit of variation depending on the particular needs of different countries.<\/p><p>  The Deputy made a point about public and private debt.  The public element of the debt is covered off, in terms of CSR No. 1, which relates to the fiscal and budgetary measures that we are looking to implement.  Some of the private debt is at least included in the measures in CSR No. 5, which refers to what will happen in our banks in terms of access to finance, but definitely in terms of CSR No. 6 which relates to the issue of non-performing loans, which is a different way of looking at the very high levels of private debt we still have within our economy.  I would note that there are different indicators that the level of private debt is reducing.  As Senator Hayden said earlier, one of the most difficult sources of private debt can be mortgage arrears and mortgage debt.  At least there are some signs of stability and progress in that area at the moment, which is welcome.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Halligan's questions, I agree with him that jobs and employment growth is the silver bullet that can unlock so much else and all the different interconnections to which he referred.  I disagree with him strongly on the following matter.  If I quote him incorrectly I am sure he will correct me.  He said we need somebody to tell us how we will create good quality jobs, as he called them.  My answer is that is our responsibility but other people will give us advice.  The European Union will do what it can to create an environment within which jobs will be created but, first and foremost, it is the responsibility of national governments and parliaments and people at the different levels of local and national politics to rise to the challenge.  People will give us advice but the people who are going to do the work and come up with ideas and implement them will be the national governments.  We must be consistent in how we talk about Europe.  On the one hand, we cannot say it has too much power and, on the other hand, criticise Europe by saying that what power it has it does not use.  The people whose primary responsibility it is to improve the living standards of people within their own countries are national governments.  We cannot outsource that responsibility to other people or pretend that will happen.<\/p><p>  Deputy Crowe raised a number of specifics to which I want to respond.  Before doing so I shall offer an overall comment in response to his overall approach.  He correctly made a point that there are a number of poverty traps.  We continue to be aware of them and that is why some changes have been made to lone parent supports which make an important contribution to dealing with poverty traps.  For me, a measure that I think is hugely important, and I encounter the issue regularly during my constituency work in Dublin Central, is the poverty traps that exist for people in private rental accommodation and people who are uncertain in work.  That is why the measure that has been announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on the housing assistance payment, which was trialled, has now been rolled out.  I know it is a measure that will positively affect a very large number of people by making those payments available in a way that will give them a bit more certainty about their ability to afford accommodation and will also give more certainty to people who can provide the accommodation.<\/p> <p>In this case, much of it comes through landlords.  That measure will contribute to the kinds of poverty traps colleagues raised.<\/p><p> With regard to the points made about substance and austerity, Sinn F&eacute;in is saying that it will abolish property tax, water charges and the universal social charge.  In respect of expenditure, it will undo the cut to child benefit and undo all the painful measures implemented in the social welfare system.  Sinn F&eacute;in also proposes to hire more nurses and teachers and to find more money to build more public housing and create more jobs.  I would love to do all those things because I am keenly aware of the pain and suffering of people in respect of these changes.  The question I have for Sinn F&eacute;in is how it will do that.  How will it cut all these different taxes and abolish them completely?  At the same time, how will it pay for all the things it says it wants to do?  I know what people have gone through has been extremely painful.  If our country was still in the situation where we had to pay an interest rate of 15% to borrow a single euro, we could not afford the level of social welfare payments and public services that we all want to deliver.  If Deputy Crowe asks for substance, that is my argument for why we have put through these changes, which we know have caused difficulty.  I want to hear how Deputy Crowe argues he will do it.<\/p><p> Many of the points made by Senator Burke are within the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is not for me to respond as that Department will do so.  One point to be aware of, which I will touch on in respect of the point made by Senator Noone, is contained in the European Commission document, which suggests that one of the costs SMEs regularly encounter is the huge cost of enforcing contracts and of legal work.  Paragraph 16 states that legal \"fees represent the majority of these costs\", at 18.8%.  This is the environment in which the Legal Services Regulation Bill is being examined and needs to be enacted.  Senator Noone and Deputy Byrne exchanged views on the Taxing Master and legal costs.  I am sure this will be dealt with in the context of the Legal Services Regulation Bill, which the Minister will prioritise later in the year.<\/p><p> Deputy Byrne noted something that caught my attention in paragraph 11, which states \"Even though Ireland has a relatively young population, public healthcare expenditure was among the highest in the EU in 2012 at 8.7% of GNI, significantly above the EU average of 7.3%.\"  Deputies Byrne and Hannigan pointed out that some of this is due to the awful economic recession, the granting of medical cards to people who need them, and the physical and mental consequences of what we have gone through.  Nevertheless, the core point is that the level expenditure as a percentage of national income is high.  The reasons behind it are matters the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, will address but the European Commission points to the fact there are still many different systems involved in how our money is spent and that the Health Identifiers Bill, which the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, is dealing with, will give people a better means of identifying where they are in our health system, where they stand and how they are being moved through treatment.  It will allow our levels of expenditure to be translated into a better level of care for the people we represent.  The Deputy also referred to legal services, which I tried to answer in my response to Senator Noone.<\/p><p> I agree with the comments made by Deputy Durkan.  He asked me two questions about the level of far right and far left forces represented in the European Parliament.  It strikes me that, despite the severity of the crisis that Europe and Ireland have gone through over the past seven years, none of the forces have been successful in being elected to national government.  They have attained a high level of representation in the European Parliament but, with only one exception, I am not aware of any of them being elected to national government.  With regard to their role in the European Parliament, this is a major challenge for them.  They must find a way of working with other parties in the European Parliament and working with each other.  This leads to the challenge many forces of protest face.  It is all well and good saying what one is against but when one has a role of influence, one must say what one will do.  This is something they must deal with soon in the context of the new European Parliament, which will meet twice in plenary session in July.<\/p><p> Senator Noone asked some points about the Legal Services Regulation Bill, to which I have responded.<\/p><p> With regard to Senator Hayden's point on SMEs and procurement, I must direct her question to the Office of Public Works, which is the lead body on that.  I am not in a position to respond to the detailed point.  With regard to the sum of &euro;2 billion, I stress the importance of the overall goal, which is to get to a 3% deficit by 2015.  Why is that important?  Were it to be achieved, our country could continue to borrow at affordable interest rates and, if we can do so, less money needs to be spent on servicing debt and more can be spent on public services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014061200009#H00600","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1402582200,"counter":763,"content":"<p>Is the percentage deficit the key figure for the Minister of State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014061200010#J00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1402582200,"counter":764,"content":"<p>It is too early in the year, as the Minister for Finance has said, to determine the exact figure that will help us to get there.
