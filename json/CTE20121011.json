The last time I attended the committee I stated no one had a monopoly of good ideas.  Traditionally, I have been a strong supporter of the Oireachtas being fully involved in actions, particularly on the reform side.  I value members' opinions and advice on what we must do.<\/p><p>  I am joined by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who works closely with me on implementation of the plan.  The committee knows the Secretary General, Mr. Robert Watt, and the assistant secretary, Mr. Paul Reid, whom we have recruited to drive the dedicated reform office.  We have just come from a Cabinet sub-committee meeting at which the sectoral plans driving the reform agenda were considered.  Last month we published a statement on the implementation of the reform plan, a copy of which I forwarded to all of the committee's members for reading.  The statement set out the significant progress made in the first ten months of the plan.  I thank the staff of my Department, as well as those of all other Departments, for embracing the reform agenda.<\/p><p>  It is fair to say the Government has embarked on the most ambitious and comprehensive public service reform programme in the history of the State.  No previous Government has taken on anything of this scale and breadth.  Our task is considerable.  However, given the situation the Government inherited, comprehensive reform of the public service is not an option.  It is an essential part of the strategic response to our economic challenges.  This was the rationale agreed to by both parties in government for establishing a dedicated Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>  Before I get into the detail of public service reform, it is important to recall briefly the progress made in achieving our fiscal targets.  In total, budgetary adjustments designed to save or yield approximately &euro;25 billion have been made.  This is an extraordinary burden on the people.  As the committee is aware, two thirds of these adjustments have been on the expenditure side.  It is also important to recall that we have negotiated substantial reductions in the cost of our international programme of assistance to the value of approximately &euro;10 billion.  Last year's underlying central government deficit was 9.4% of GDP, a healthy improvement on the underlying deficit recorded in 2010 and well within the 10.6% limit set under the EU-IMF programme.  The deficit limit we have set for this year is 8.6% of GDP, or approximately &euro;13.5 billion.  We must incrementally reduce the deficit to below 3% by 2015.  We are determined as a Government to do this.<\/p><p>  Since 2008, overall gross departmental expenditure has reduced by &euro;6.5 billion, despite the pressures on public services imposed by the downturn.  We are committed to making significant further reductions during the next three years.  It is a difficult circle to square - we have reduced amounts of money and numbers of public servants and have significantly increased demands.<\/p><p>  As set out in the comprehensive review of expenditure report last year, a total expenditure reduction of &euro;2.2 billion is envisaged for this year, of which &euro;1.45 billion represents current expenditure and &euro;750 million capital expenditure.  The Exchequer pay bill has reduced by 17.7% between 2009 and 2012, from &euro;17.5 billion gross to &euro;14.4 billion, including the pension-related deduction.  The aim is to reduce the total cost of the Exchequer pay bill by &euro;3.8 billion in the period from 2009, when it peaked, to 2015.  To put it another way, the aim is to reduce the public pay bill by 20%, which is a daunting challenge.<\/p><p>  In discussing the pay bill we should, of course, recall that those working in the public service have already had two pay reductions, totalling an average of 14%, by way of the pension-related deduction and direct salary cuts.  Salaries at the highest levels have been reduced by up to 30% and capped in the Civil Service at &euro;200,000.  We have also reduced the salaries of new entrants to the public service by 10%.  Public service pensions have been reduced, saving more than &euro;100 million annually.  Legislation for a new single public service pension scheme has been enacted this year.  Public service staff numbers have been reduced by 28,000 from a peak of 320,000 to 292,000.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the progress made, the deficit in the public finances remains large.  To this end, the Government has begun working on the detailed measures underpinning next year's budget which will be announced on 5 December.  We must also be conscious of our obligations to reduce public spending in a way that is fair, protects those who rely on public services, supports employment and enterprise and takes a more strategic view to position ourselves for economic and social recovery as a nation.  In terms of public services, it is clear that we must work harder and more flexibly than ever before.  In other words, we must get more for less.  <\/p><p>  With a backdrop of ongoing significant reductions in public expenditure and numbers, the Government's ambitious public service reform plan was published last November.<\/p> <p>I have set out the five commitments for change, which are placing customer service at the core of everything that we do; maximising new and innovative technologies; reducing our costs to drive better value; leading, organising and working in different ways; and having a strong focus on implementation and delivery, which was one of the failures of previous reform agendas.<\/p><p> Since then, effective structures to implement the reform plan have been put in place within my Department and in other Departments, offices and sectors of State.  The Cabinet committee on public service reform, which met earlier this morning, continues to drive the reform agenda and holds senior management to account for the specific timelines in the plan.  We have also put in place a strong governance model and brought in the necessary skills where most needed.  On 6 September, over nine months into the implementation process, we published a report on the progress, and I will provide some of the examples.<\/p><p> We are proceeding with a radical reform of public procurement, and that is being led by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  An external review estimates there could be annual savings in the range of &euro;250 million to &euro;600 million after three years.  This will involve a new national procurement office overseeing the integration of procurement policy, strategy and operations; greater aggregation of purchasing; better spend analytics; and many other actions to transform our procurement model.  We are currently in the process of recruiting, through an open competition, a new chief procurement officer to lead this body, which will be located in my Department.<\/p><p> In April, we published the e-Government strategy, which builds on Ireland's strong recent performance in this area and is borne out by a number of international benchmarks.  We have also published a cloud computing strategy and have set out plans for significant further data centre consolidation.  With such initiatives, we are among the first half dozen countries in the world to have specific agendas in those areas.  As part of a wider shared services strategy, which I mentioned to the committee previously, we approved the establishment of a human resource shared service centre for the Civil Service.  It is estimated that this will reduce the human resources headcount by 17% and costs by 26%, with annual net savings of &euro;12.5 million.  The idea is to migrate all the human resources management centres, of which there are approximately 40, into a single centre, which will be up and running next year.<\/p><p> We have accelerated our plan for a pensions administration shared service and will integrate this with the human resources shared service.  We are also developing a business case for a payroll shared service, which will take in all the points of payment in the Civil Service in the first instance and the public service generally.  There will also be a banking and financial management shared service.<\/p><p> These are all Civil Service projects and each of the main sectors - health, education, justice and local government - are now finalising their own shared services plans.  We got an update on that today.  In July, we agreed a range of actions aimed at achieving a focused and integrated approach to external service delivery of non-core processes.  A shortlist of potential major projects for priority implementation is being prepared and plans are being developed by the four main sectors.  We are also proposing new services across the public service which will first be tested for external service delivery before any approval for a new service is granted.<\/p><p> We will shortly launch the &quot;Ireland Stat&quot;<i><\/i>website, which the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, will describe in greater detail.  We have introduced a range of expenditure reforms to change the processes involved in allocating and assessing public expenditure to improve transparency and decision making.  The agreed standardisation of annual leave and the standardisation of paid sick leave will assist the move to a more integrated public service by having the same cap on leave allowances for different public service employment groups.  We have talked about these issues for decades but we have done them this year.  Specifically, the major reform of sick leave for the public service will realise productivity and performance gains and reduce costs.  For most employees, the new arrangements will mean that the amount of paid sick leave will be halved.<\/p><p> The senior public service has been established to promote a more integrated public service and even the Oireachtas is finding how that works as managers move across the public service.  Significant reforms to the performance management and development system in the Civil Service have been agreed and significant progress is being made on the ambitious programme of political and legislative reform.  Perhaps there will be another opportunity to speak about that.  This takes in the expansion of the Freedom of Information Act, the protected disclosure in the public interest Bill to protect whistleblowers and the enactment of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill currently before the Seanad.  Additionally, legislative proposals will be brought to the Government to regulate lobbyists and on Oireachtas inquiries, in which I know the Chairman and the committee are deeply interested.  These are just some examples of the reforms that we are driving and which are set out in the report.<\/p><p> Along with this comprehensive suite of cross-cutting reforms, the reform and delivery office in my Department is also working with the main sectors of health, education, local government and justice on their sectoral plans.  The office has collaborated with these sectors to develop an integrated approach to reform.  The main strategic reforms being driven are public service initiatives in each sector, the suite of reforms facilitated by the public service agreement - the Croke Park agreement - clear timelines and ownership of the reform agenda, and structures to drive their implementation.<\/p><p> The committee is aware that the Croke Park agreement is a key enabler of the public service reform plan and is playing a strong part in underpinning many of the changes we are making in the public service.  There is much commentary about the agreement but it is an extraordinarily useful tool for change and most of my colleagues in Europe would give their right arm for it.  Within the health sector, this year 3,500 people have moved seamlessly to fill gaps after the significant exodus of people earlier this year.  We must drive it much more proactively, particularly managers on the ground.  Solid progress has been made and this has been documented by the implementation body's two annual progress reports.  The committee will hear from the body's chairman later.<\/p><p> I want to see delivery under the agreement maximised and with that in mind, the Government agreed last month that Ministers should give consideration to options for accelerating the delivery of savings and reforms under the agreement.  My Department has been examining the proposals received and, together with the Taoiseach, I will meet representatives of the implementation body later this afternoon.  The Government is agreed on the need to ensure that the agreement delivers on its full potential.  I expect managers to be proactive and ambitious in the pursuit of change set under the agreement, and I expect unions to continue to approach the implementation of reform in a constructive and co-operative manner.<\/p><p> The Croke Park agreement offers an unprecedented opportunity to achieve change in an atmosphere of proven industrial relations stability, which is extremely important not only for the delivery of public services, but for the perception of Ireland externally.  We must not be seen as a place with major industrial unrest and upheaval, and working together across communities is the way to achieve these reforms.  As I noted, the Taoiseach and I will meet representatives of the implementation body later today, stressing the need to ramp up delivery.  We will ask that the body ensures that the proposals we have advanced and which Ministers have given be reflected in the action plans now being carried through.  Our focus remains squarely on maximising the potential of the current agreement to leverage further pay and non-pay savings, as well as a further reform of work practices, which are equally important.<\/p><p> The committee is aware that the Chairman has written to me on the issue of the recently completed review of public service allowances.  There has been much commentary on the work being carried out in my Department on the review of public service allowances, which I announced as part of the Budget Statement in December 2011.  In that statement I indicated that I aimed to secure additional savings by way of reductions in overtime and allowances to assist public service management in meeting their pay bill targets.  Some &euro;40 million in overtime savings has been achieved by making reduced allocations to public service organisations this year.<\/p><p> With regard to allowances, in all over 1,100 allowances were notified to my Department as part of the review and of these 800 business cases, some covering more than one allowance, were made to retain allowances in either their existing or an altered format.  As members of the committee will be aware, I published details of all these business cases on my Department's website.  In my announcement on 18 September, I gave details of the Government decision on these allowances, and details were published of a range of allowances, costing approximately &euro;475 million annually, which would no longer be payable to new beneficiaries.  In addition, a further range of allowances, costing &euro;245 million per annum, would be subject to review and modification for new beneficiaries.<\/p><p> On their own and over time, those measures would produce medium term savings as new appointments are made to posts which previously benefitted from these payments.  This was the first ever review of allowances paid to public servants.<\/p> <p>I spoke about this in some detail when answering questions in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  This is the first time anybody has drilled down into allowances and the structure of pay in the public service.  The complex matrix of allowances is the result of old agreements at sectoral level, previous national wage agreements and local decisions to secure service improvements.  The disaggregation of this multiplicity of decisions is not and will not be simple.  Despite the impression given in much media commentary, from my perspective, dealing with the overall issue of rationalising public service allowances is very much a work in progress.  I said this on the day I made the announcement, but only the headline figure was heard in some instances.<\/p><p> Turning to the cases of existing beneficiaries, it is clear that the allowances for which, in modern eyes, the business case cannot be justified fall into two distinct categories.  The first, representing the largest allowances in terms of spend, forms a significant element of the overall taxable and often pensionable remuneration of the staff involved, especially for certain groups of public servants such as garda&iacute;, firefighters, prison officers and members of the Defence Forces, teachers in schools and certain support grades across the public service.  It would neither be practical nor reasonable, as I said when I made the announcement, to attempt to take away unilaterally such a large portion of these public servants' pay, in effect applying an additional pay cut to specific groups of public servants purely on the basis of how their wages had been built over a period of years.  What the review has highlighted are structural weaknesses and a lack of transparency in the way in which these groups are paid and how their pay was constructed over decades.  Addressing these issues will require preparatory work and discussions involving the relevant sectoral management, my Department and the relevant staff interests.  The aim will be to achieve a simplification of the way in which we pay these staff for their services and to ensure the pay regime for these groups supports efficient and cost effective public services.  As I indicated privately to the Chairman, what is at issue is looking at incorporating allowances into a proper pay structure in order that as people get a grade of promotion the work practices now paid by way of allowances will be incorporated into the core pay.<\/p><p> The second category of allowances is made up of payments that do not form a significant element of the overall remuneration of the beneficiary.  In these cases, my Department has written, as has been widely reported today, although it was done at the end of last month, to all sectors of the public service asking that, where there is no business case to pay an allowance to a new beneficiary, the sectoral management immediately engage with staff interests to secure early agreement to eliminate payment of these allowances to existing recipients.  We have also asked that all allowances falling into this category be identified to my Department in terms of their priority for elimination.  My Department has also indicated its views as to those that should be tackled first - the 88 referenced today, which is not an exhaustive list.  It is what we put on the table, but sectors can add to it from the list published.  My Department suggests the 88 allowances would be suitable for elimination.  I remind members of the committee that the Croke Park agreement provides for speedy and binding third party findings on these issues.<\/p><p> Good progress is being made on the implementation of the public service reform plan.  It is a core function of my Department and extremely wide ranging.  It is a huge endeavour, involving hundreds of organisations and nearly 300,000 employees.  Everyone has a part to play in the transformation of the public service.  There are challenges, but the reality is that front-line services will suffer unless we continue to implement these reforms.  Without meaningful and sustained reform, we will lock into the system all the costs and practices built up in the boom years, and that would be a missed opportunity.  In a nutshell, I am not interested in simply top slicing public pay and embedding bad practice and inefficiencies into the system.  I want to change fundamentally the way public services are delivered.  Through the establishment of a dedicated reform and delivery office in my Department, we have placed an emphasis on implementation.  As a public service, we must have an equal balance of policy and implementation skills to drive the reform.  My challenge is to build reforms that will last not just for the duration of the current crisis but for generations to come, not to pander to particular interests or headlines.  I am fully aware that the pace of change needs to be accelerated.  As Minister with responsibility for expenditure, I will have to help to shape next year's budget and all the budgets to 2015 to get the deficit below 3%.  I am confident that we can do this and deliver a public service of which we can all be proud.  I can honestly say the committee has an important role to play in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100002#A00600","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349946600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee and recognise its importance in our work.<\/p><p>  To put it bluntly, the key task of the Government is economic survival.  That means getting the country to a better position over a period of years in order that we can get the economy growing again.  When both parties were elected to office, the mandate given to them was not just to clear up the economic mess we inherited and bridge the gap between expenditure and tax receipts over a period of years, it was also to seek radical reform of the public sector and specifically to decide how to deal with this.  It was important that, nine months after the launch of the public sector reform plan, we put in place a review and set out what we had achieved.  As the Minister said, what we are looking for is buy-in and support across the public sector in delivering on these key tasks.  We have a clear plan that is headed by a special unit in the Department.  There are key time lines with the names of the officials who will deliver the reform within a period of time.  We have a political responsibility, as does the committee and all Members of the House, to ensure the plan is implemented.<\/p><p>  In much of the commentary surrounding this debate there is no focus on what has been achieved.  The achievements have been astonishing, given the economic collapse that occurred in this country.  The number in the public sector was 320,000 some years ago and it is just over 290,000 now.  It will go down to 282,000 in the next period of time.  That is an extraordinary reduction in the total number of public servants.  We must ensure the group that is left is organised in such a way that we secure maximum efficiencies within the public sector at a time when more people are using the health service, more children are in school and there are greater demands because of the economic collapse.<\/p><p>  I have responsibility for four areas in the plan: shared services, public procurement, property and Ireland Stat.  The Minister spoke about the reductions in human resources.  To put it simply, we have approximately 860 employed to perform HR functions across government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100004#C00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1349946600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Human resource management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100004#C00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1349946600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Yes.  By the time our plans are fully implemented that number will be down to approximately 640.  Bringing all of the HR personnel together will yield savings of 26%; therefore, we will have reduced by one quarter the total amount of money we are spending on HR services in the public sector.  It will allow us to move HR personnel to do other things because of the arrangements in place under the Croke Park agreement.  That is a tangible example of what \"shared services\" means.  We also have plans to bring forward the same principle of shared services on the pensions, pay and banking sides.  We are very confident we can achieve this.<\/p><p>  We are still spending a great deal of money on public procurement.  The figure is about &euro;9 billion for goods and services and &euro;5 billion for construction.  We must achieve much greater savings.  I will be clear and blunt to the committee.  We have too many involved in public procurement.  This is a small country.  The efficiencies should be much easier to obtain here because of our size.  If we can organise the system properly, we will do so.<\/p> <p>The first decision we have taken is to ensure we mandate the public sector to use the framework agreements that have been put in place.  The Cabinet signed off on it last July.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, announced a competition for chief procurement officer.  It is proposed that the chief procurement officer will bring forward an implementation plan by March 2013 to generate savings ranging from &euro;250 million to &euro;600 million during the next three years.  These savings can be achieved by aggregating contracts, having greater framework contracts and by demanding the public sector uses the framework agreements we have negotiated.  That will require much more centralised procurement, which brings its own issues but none the less we believe significant savings can be put in place.<\/p><p> We have 2,200 buildings across the public sector.  About 60% are owned but 40% are leased.  Some years ago we were spending &euro;130 million on leasing buildings.  There is no reason that in two years that figure should not be less than &euro;100 million on an annualised basis.  We are negotiating in a much more aggressive way because of the circumstances we face and because of shared services.  We will be demanding that the public service will work in a collaborative way and use space better.  We will put in place a new policy on the use of office space, with greater use of open plan offices in the public sector.  We hope to launch Ireland Stat if not next week, then the following week.  This website is aimed at explaining to people how we are doing internationally and will be very clear.  It will show our outputs and expenditure levels across a whole range of matrices.  I think this portal will explain how much money is being spent and what we are getting for it.<\/p><p> I appeal for fairness in the commentary on our situation.  Much has changed.  We must ensure the implementation process actually works and the change process is delivered.  Many positive things have occurred.  In the debate we do not get the full buy-in and support for what has occurred.  While the change has occurred, much more needs to happen.  We need to parcel the debate in the context of the dramatic changes that have taken place in the public sector in the past number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100004#C00400","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349947200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>That you.

Many people would say that should happen anyway.  If there is a vacancy and somebody in a job is able to fill it, then the person should fill the vacancy.<\/p><p>  The Minister has also made this point many times, and last week he criticised the slow rate of change.  Who is accountable for the length of time it takes to make changes?  Who is not getting paid an increment or not getting a promotion in the different sections because of the slow pace of change?  I am supportive of the Croke Park agreement and it is the way to handle staff.  The most decisive characteristic of the economic lives of the people who pay our wages has been involuntary change - the involuntary loss of jobs and wages.  Many in the public sector are doing a great job but they labour under a voluntary agreement.  I think the Minister may share my views on the rate of change.

The State property portfolio involves many agencies.  OPW is responsible for many Government buildings.  NAMA, a Government agency, has the biggest property portfolio in the world.  IBRC, formerly Anglo Irish Bank, still has a massive property portfolio, which it is entitled to dispose of or whatever.  There is something else known colloquially as the \"NAMA for local authorities\" - the Housing &amp;amp; Sustainable Communities Agency.  During the boom years all the local authorities paid boom prices to buy land for housing developments in towns and on their outskirts, none of which are now proceeding.  There are at least &euro;500 million worth of almost greenfield sites being sent over to this agency through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  There is nothing wrong with consolidating the ownership of those away from the approximately 40 different local authorities. <\/p><p>  Those are four State bodies with major property portfolios.  I would like to see a co-ordinated State approach to the management of all property under all State agencies.  I would suggest the OPW should have ongoing talks with NAMA.  We asked representatives of NAMA here before and I might have mentioned it.  I want to broaden it to the local authority properties that were purchased and those owned by IBRC.  The Minister should have a consolidated approach rather than four State agencies competing with each other in the property area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100006#E00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1349947800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The Minister has said the Government's reform programme is ambitious and revolutionary almost, but it is nothing of the sort.

I am preparing legislation on the capacity of inquiries generally.  There are issues of objectivity with any inquiry.  It is important that people are not compromised by any utterances they make in advance regardless of the issue.  I believe members of this committee are very mindful of that.<\/p><p>  A variety of issues were raised and I will be as comprehensive as I can.  Deputy Donohoe asked some insightful questions.<\/p> <p>The Croke Park agreement, as I said, is the most useful device for bringing about change, but, like any device, it is only as useful as its utilisation.  We have a very complex, multi-layered and disparate public service.  During my time at the Department of Health I saw that services were built in a topsy-turvy fashion, whereby voluntary services were subsumed into the main health sphere, for example, which makes reform very difficult.  The most difficult challenge for us is to engage management at ground level to utilise the capacity of the Croke Park agreement to change skill mixes, rosters, working arrangements and so forth.  We have been desperately pushing that agenda.  There is full engagement at the top level, but it has not filtered down to every level.  As I have said previously, there are some who will use the agreement as a shield in claiming they cannot do what they patently can do.  We need to break through this.  Deputy Derek Nolan made a point on a particular hospital where a new manager is like a new broom and has brought about significant change.  We need to drive this change everywhere, but it is a daunting and difficult task.  <\/p><p> I wish to be very direct with the committee on the task facing us.  Public pay accounts for a large proportion of all that we spend, but, in relative terms, we do not have a huge public service.  There are 1.8 million people working, approximately 1.5 million of whom are in the private sphere.  There are now less than 300,000 in the public sphere, within which there are large groups such as garda&iacute;, teachers and nurses.  We need to motivate them because we have already taken significant money from them through a direct pay cut of 7%, on average, and up to 30% at the top levels.  We have also imposed a pension levy of 7% on them.  We are driving them to deliver services differently and most of them are working much harder.  <\/p><p> On the question of allowances, as I have explained previously, this is very complex, although I know some might want to portray it as being simple.  If one looks at the structure of public service pay, one sees that some allowances have been subsumed into core pay, although they are still called allowances.  We must disaggregate them in order that we can determine what is considered pay and an allowance.  If there is an allowance payable, we must determine what is the direct function.  An allowance meets an additional cost to the individual, for example, where he or she pays the cost of travel for work purposes, or there is a premium payment for working out-of-hours or for being on-call during the night or at weekends, or where there is a definable, additional workload.  That is the criterion used to evaluate the business cases submitted.  In the appendix we have produced it is stated there are 180 classes of allowance for which we have determined, politically and objectively, there is not a sustainable business case.  However, we could not take the bulk of them away instantly because we would be taking away a core pay element.  The bulk of the money is paid in three areas - education, the Army and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If, for example, we were to take the rent allowance of &euro;4,000 from the pocket of every garda, it would account for a large proportion of the money he or she earns.  That is how his or her core pay was built.   We want to make sure that is not the way he or she will be paid into the future and that we will have a different way of paying him or her.  <\/p><p> We have identified 88 allowances that do not form such a huge part of core pay.  The rule of thumb is that allowances up to the value of approximately &euro;1,500 annually are not deemed to form a significant part of core pay and can be bought out under the Croke Park agreement.  Deputies will know that there is a facility under the agreement whereby, for a payment of 150% of the annual cost of an allowance, we can buy it out.  However, this must be done through agreement.  As I said in September, one of the complexities is that if I decide, arbitrarily, to abolish the 180 classes of allowances that I have identified, every one of the workers affected, by right, will be able to go to the Labour Court for independent arbitration.  To be blunt, that would mean the Labour Court would do nothing else for the next year and that the reform division in my Department would do very little else except prepare these cases, all in respect of a sum of &euro;75 million.  That would not be the right thing to do.  I made my determination in that context and took a political hit for it.  However, we want to phase out these allowances and I want to use the mechanisms of the Croke Park agreement to do it, while also reforming the way pay scales are structured, particularly in the education sector and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I have spoken in detail to the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Justice and Equality about these matters.  <\/p><p> On the issue of voluntary redundancies, the first exit package-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100006#E02200","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349948400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Will the Minister tell us what the 88 allowances are?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100007#F00200","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1349948400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I can give the Deputy that information later, although it is not an exhaustive list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100007#F00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1349948400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>That is the number the Department has identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100007#F00400","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1349948400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Yes, it is a list of the allowances we have identified that do not form a significant part of core pay and which can, therefore, be addressed under the existing Croke Park agreement arrangements.  However, I have asked sectoral managers to add to that list and I will keep the committee informed of how that work is progressing.  I do not want them all to be referred to the Labour Court, although people have that option.  I am hoping to negotiate a quicker arbitration mechanism to determine these cases.  If people want to use the legal mechanisms in place, they can do so, but I want to engage with the unions to try to find a quicker way of dealing with these cases.<\/p><p>  In terms of voluntary redundancies, the exit package in February involved people making sensible decisions for themselves.  Those who were coming up to retirement were given the option of having their pensions based on their pre-cut salary level and some decided to leave early.  We had no control over who those people would be and, as Deputy Paschal Donohoe rightly said, we lost skilled staff we did not want to lose.  The voluntary redundancy scheme for which I have Government approval involves each Minister examining his or her own Department and agencies within its remit to find areas in which there are surplus staff.  There are surplus staff in many agencies.  There are significant staff surpluses in the HSE on the administrative side, for example, and also in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to name but two.  We will have targeted schemes to deal with these surpluses.  Staff will not be applying for redundancy and no one with a critical skill who would have to be replaced will be eligible.  We can talk about this matter again in greater detail at a future date, but I am under time pressure today.<\/p><p>  I have answered Deputy Eoghan Murphy's question on allowances, but I can provide more details for the committee, if required.

Allowances are included in a great amalgam, but they vary widely.  I will endeavour to give as much detail as possible by issuing the aforementioned letters and so forth.<\/p><p>  The question was asked as to how we could disaggregate Croke Park agreement reforms from what would have been happening in any event.  The implementation body is supposed to examine the implementation of the Croke Park agreement, the framework through which the reform agenda is progressing.  <\/p><p>  Members asked why change was taking so long, which was a nice and handy political ball to present to me.  We now have a Department responsible for reform, led by a Minister and a Minister of State who are determined to reform, as well as an office and a Secretary General responsible for reform, which is why things are now happening.  However, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  At the end of our five year term we want to have a transformed public service.  I hope it will be accepted that there will be hiccups along the way.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Paschal Donohoe spoke about involuntary pain in the private sector, but I can assure him that there was no voluntary sign-up for a pay cut or a 7% pension levy in the public sector   We must, therefore, be balanced in our approach.

The approach we are taking to reform is rather different.  We are driving reforms throughout Departments.

We have assigned people who have senior responsibility to lead and drive the reform throughout 40 public service bodies.  In general, the senior responsible owners are from within the system and the senior management have responsibility and accountability to drive change across the systems.  We have had limited recruitment of specialist skills.  We brought in one person to work centrally in the reform office on shared services.  That person has global experience of implementing shared services.  We supported the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which has a large local government plan related to driving shared services.

We are now in a position to outline a total suite of reforms that encompass the public service reform plan, the programme for Government reform elements driven in each Department and sector and the Croke Park elements of reform that have industrial relations implications.  We have an overarching reform and each of the major sectors must put in place and is putting in place the equivalent of what we have done centrally, that is, a central governance structure.  Overall it is strong.  It is a programme management discipline that has strengthened our approach to reform.  This has probably not been traditionally a skill.  We used to lean harder on policy but now we have strong, disciplined programme management and we hold Departments and sectors accountable.  This morning was our fifth Cabinet committee meeting in the course of this year since we launched the plan.  Overall there is a strong governance structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1349949000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I will take the Chairman's question on print managed contracts first.  It was interesting that the Chairman approached the issue from the perspective of the local business but not from the perspective of the public purse.  It seems that if we are to make the savings on procurement, we must become a good deal more strategic and ensure we implement what we claim we will implement.  The Chairman referred to print managed contracts.  This is something the national procurement service negotiated under my Department.  A total of five companies won that contract, three of which were Irish small or medium-sized enterprises and two of which were US multinationals.  We put it to everyone in the Irish public sector that the framework we had negotiated on exceptional prices should be used.<\/p><p>  One example is the savings that Dublin City Council has managed to realise as a result of a print managed contract.  What is a print managed contract?  A print managed contract is an alternative to the old fashioned way of having photocopiers everywhere which we own and every time they spew out paper, we pay for it.  Under this method, we give a contract to a company to run printing in that aspect of the public sector.  Dublin City Council had savings of 60% over a two year period by doing this.  We will replicate this in every other aspect of the Irish public sector.  If that means some local companies miss out, I am sorry.  However, if the Chairman is telling me that he wants to extract savings on procurement as part of his role as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, then this is the brave new world we are entering.  Moaning and groaning about local businesses here, there and everywhere will not achieve the targets we want to achieve.  The Chairman cannot have it both ways.

We have had and continue to have discussions with NAMA to establish whether we can extract the best possible deal in terms of the utilisation of space.  Along with the Minister, Deputy Howlin, I will bring a new memorandum on property to Government.  Property in the public sector is like a gigantic chess game.  If one moves someone, there is a gap that must be filled.  Up to now, we have not had the big stick to compel a Department to move to a particular place and say \"sorry for your troubles\", but we will have it as a result of this memorandum, and that is important.  Up to now, the OPW has been in the position of trying to cajole and persuade people but we have not had a big stick approach.  The memorandum will give us that.  The memorandum will also ensure we have for the first time ever a map of what we know we own throughout the country.  This has not been the case in the past but the new office plan we will put in place will ensure greater and more efficient use of space.  I will challenge everyone to reconsider cellular offices.

I am sorry Deputy McDonald has left the meeting.  Unfortunately, she always makes the same presentation, that we do not need any of these changes and it is all a matter of cutting top pay.

I explained in some detail yesterday that the number of people in the public service - not the Civil Service - earning more than &euro;100,000, is 1.8% of the total.

That is &euro;80,000 or &euro;60,000 each.  I do not think it is &euro;60,000 each.  As an example, if they were each receiving an increment of &euro;1,000, that is &euro;500,000 and half that comes back, so it is less than &euro;500,000.  Would the Deputy recommend bringing in specific legislation for that sort of money?  If we are talking real money, let us deal with that in a proper way.  Deputy McDonald is not present, unfortunately, but the presentation of her argument seems to be much more important than the substance of it.  This committee is about substance.  As a people we have a horrendous task to solve our economic woes and this committee has a role to play.<\/p><p>  I refer to the other point made by Deputy McDonald.  I may be straying away from my role this morning in commenting on yesterday's meeting of the committee and the officials who came before it.  To put it bluntly, there are standards of decency which should be observed when people come to attend.  Every public servant should be treated with respect.  This is a personal point of view about how senior public servants, who are servants of the public, must be held to account but in a way that is respectful of the individual.  I do not think that was done yesterday, but that is a personal perspective.<\/p><p>  Deputy McCarthy spoke about the biggest challenge and I think I have already answered that.  We are driving an agenda for which we need to have a buy-in at all levels but we have not succeeded yet.  However, I am determined to do that.  The shared services issue is a very large and important agenda for us.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, spoke about the human resource service which is to be put in place.  We are fast-tracking other areas of it and we can supply details of these areas.  One body doing the task rather than 40 centres all doing the same work is a significant reform not only in monetary terms, but also in terms of efficiency.  It is often the case that personnel officers are moved on promotion to other duties.  This may mean that such individuals have no skills in personnel work.  We need to change this practice and make it more professional.<\/p><p>  On the Chairman's final point, I will send him a copy of the standard contract.  The contracts for driving the reform agenda in my Department are all term contracts.  The last time I sat beside the director at this committee we were discussing public pay - I should not say this - but he gave me a note in which he wrote that he was now earning half of what he earned in the private sector for doing a similar job and without the public scrutiny.  That is an issue we need to be mindful of when discussing salary ceilings.  If we want to recruit capable people to drive the change, then we must mindful of that also.  The Secretary General has a seven-year contract.  The new procurement officer will be on a contract and the Minister of State is determined that the pay for the office will be determined by achievement.  This will be an innovation in the public service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100009#H01500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1349949600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>How many people are coming in from the private sector to fill advertised management and senior management positions?

They seemed to be under a misapprehension that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss a draft report they had received which was sent to them out of courtesy.  In fact, the purpose of the meeting was to examine the facts and figures given a previous meeting with Mr. Cathal Magee.<\/p><p> I was taken aback by the content of the delegates' opening statements which were almost legalistic in style and largely set out why they could not answer particular questions.  It is not the case that we were getting into policy matters.  As the Minister is aware, I read out a statement at every meeting declaring that we do not deal with policy issues.  Moreover, I have often had to caution members when their questions are policy related.  However, we do have an open exchange at the committee and have enjoyed a relationship with the HSE and the Department under previous CEOs and Secretaries General that has been very fruitful and productive.  I do not know why the delegates came to Tuesday's meeting armed, as they were, with references to legislation and Standing Orders and declaring that they could not answer a specific set of questions.  In fact, they went on, after the incident we are discussing, to do their business as we would expect them to do.<\/p><p> It might have been helpful if they had brought their concerns to me prior to the meeting.  I met Dr. McLoughlin last Thursday and there was no indication that he had concerns about attending the meeting on Tuesday.  Tensions were obvious before the meeting, however, in that it was difficult to fix a date for the delegates to come before the committee in the first place.  Perhaps there are issues in that regard.  As such, I take the opportunity to assure the Minister and the Minister of State that their officials can knock on my door at any time to explain their concerns or outline why they do or do not want to answer specific questions.  On Tuesday, however, I would not accept the statements they placed in the public domain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100009#H02600","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349950200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I am under a time constraint, unfortunately, as I have to be elsewhere at 11.30 a.m.  I referred to the incident in question only because it had been raised by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.

We said on the last occasion that we would be happy to return when we had completed the second review of the public service agreement.<\/p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to brief the committee again on the ongoing implementation of the agreement and, in particular, the second report.  I am joined by the secretary to the implementation body, Mr. Colin Menton.  As I mentioned on the last occasion, I am here as the independent chairman of the body; I am not representing management or trade unions or their agendas.  I will seek to provide the committee with a fair, impartial and objective assessment of progress made or deal with other issues the Chairman or members wish to discuss with me.  I will provide the committee with a short overview of the second annual review report and then deal as best I can with questions or other issues the Chairman or members wish to raise.  <\/p><p> On a point of clarification, there is sometimes confusion about this, although I realise that is not the case here, but it is not the role of the implementation body to make decisions on reforms or the structures that need to be put in place to deliver them or on the size and scope of the public service.  That is the role of the Government and management in the various Departments and the hundreds of organisations throughout the public service.  The agreement can and must enable decisions that have been made by the Government or management to be implemented with the co-operation of staff and their representatives in a climate of industrial peace and full co-operation.  I continue to be encouraged by the support and commitment of my management and union colleagues on the body.  They have been unstinting in their determination to make the agreement work, often when there are difficult issues for them to confront.<\/p><p> As members will know, under the agreement, the implementation body is required to carry out an annual review for the Minister and the Government which must quantify the sustainable savings achieved and the progress being made in each sector in implementing the change and reform agenda.  The review was completed in April and May this year and the report was presented to the Minister and the Government and published in June.  We plan to carry out the next review in line with the calendar year; therefore, it will be for the 9 month period ending in December, as that will make it easier to make comparisons with Budget Statement outcomes and so on.<\/p><p> We made a number of key findings.  We have concluded that the agreement continues to be a very effective enabler for the implementation of the reforms and changes provided for in the agreement and the more recent Government public service reform plan which was reported on separately a few weeks ago.  A key role of the agreement when it was drawn up was to enable a sustained and large reduction in the size of the public service.  We noted that a very substantial reduction in numbers, some 11,500, had taken place during the review period.  That significant reduction presented particular challenges for both management and staff during the period which, in the view of the implementation body, were responded to effectively.  The committee will recall that when we appeared before it previously there was concern about the retirement of some 8,000 staff in the first two months of 2012.  In particular, the redeployment provisions of the agreement, its other major feature, have been critical in enabling public service organisations to maintain and develop services with significantly fewer staff.  We are satisfied from all of the evidence we have seen in the second year of the agreement that management, staff and trade unions are co-operating with the reductions in numbers and the redeployment provisions, some of which are not often that easy because personnel can be and have been redeployed up to 45 km away.<\/p><p> The agreement continues to be successful in ensuring the large reduction in numbers and the necessary and fundamental reform that flows from it have been and continue to be achieved in a climate of industrial peace, notwithstanding the magnitude of the task of maintaining services with almost 30,000 fewer staff than in 2008.  That is not to imply for one minute that it is all plain sailing.  Issues do and will always arise when one is implementing major changes and, if they did not, there would be something wrong with the ambitions set in terms of change.  As I said on the last occasion, one of the benefits of the agreement and its dispute resolution provisions is that they ensure when disagreements arise, they are dealt with speedily and in a timebound way - there is a six week period for consultation and a four week period for the LRC-Labour Court process.  <\/p><p> It is also important to note that the outcome of the Labour Court process or arbitration in the case of the Civil Service is binding on both sides.  There is no opt-out if issues are referred to a third party.  That, in its own way, creates an incentive for management and trade unions to reach agreement in face to face negotiations.  For example, I chair the Garda sectoral group because its members are not and cannot be part of the ICTU.  I also chair the Defence Forces sectoral group.  The new Garda rosters which were introduced in April and represent a massive change across the country were the first change made in 50 years.  The change was successfully negotiated without reference to a third party; there was no involvement in terms of mediation or arbitration.  My involvement as chairman was minimal; management and unions did the work.  Other changes such as the introduction for the first time of a performance management system in the Garda; the transferring of compensation injury claims from the courts to the State Claims Agency, which involved a saving of approximately 40% in legal and medical fees; co-operating in outsourcing in the operation of speed cameras; and civilianisation, which has been implemented at passport control at airports and in other areas have all been agreed to in face to face negotiations and not once did anything have to be referred to a third party.  There is an incentive for management and unions to negotiate, but there are some issues that end up being referred to a third party because management and unions cannot resolve them and the benefit is that the outcome is quick and binding.  In other words, there is no hiding place in obstructing change under the agreement.<\/p><p> Turning to pay and non-pay savings, we found that the agreement facilitated the delivery of further significant savings.  The Exchequer pay bill has been reduced by almost 18% between 2009 and 2012, net of the pension related deduction.  We found that in the second year pay bill savings amounting to &euro;650 million were facilitated by the agreement.  We also recognised that the Government had announced that it was going to fill some front-line posts.  We checked with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform what the limit might be and it advised that there might be recruitment to fill up to 3,000 front-line posts.   We then allowed for this.  In other words, the figure of &euro;650 million was reduced to &euro;521 million to allow for the fact that there might be recruitment.  We did not want to publish figures that might by year end be overstated by the equivalent of 3,000 staff.  As of now, that provision of 3,000 has not been utilised; there are about 2,000 fewer under the ceilings set.  I do not know what the figure will be by the end of the year.  There will certainly have been an increase in terms of the number of teachers in September in the education sector.  The figure we reported and the one we have used is &euro;521 million which is probably on the conservative side; it may well be different when we have the end of year figures.  We also found that the agreement continued to leverage non-pay savings.  Savings equivalent to &euro;406 million on an annualised basis were reported to us.  <\/p><p> In summary, in the first two years the agreement has delivered &euro;810 million in sustainable pay savings and &euro;678 million in sustainable non-pay savings, giving a total of &euro;1.5 billion.  The target is that by 2015 the Exchequer pay bill will have been reduced by &euro;3.8 billion, or &euro;3.3 billion net of expected increases in public service pension costs.  We were asked on the last occasion to consider not doing this by including more than a footnote in the second report.<\/p> <p>We have done that.  We have set out in the report the year-on-year increase in pension costs.  They do not necessarily arise from the agreement but as a result of the numbers retiring or leaving the public service for whatever reason.  We included that and we have a table in the body of the report showing the year-on-year increase.  The pension costs are &euro;3.8 billion gross with an additional pension cost of approximately &euro;500 million by 2015 from 2009.  The reason we took 2009 as the base is because that is when the public service pay bill peaked, when the last phase of the previous pay agreement kicked in.  We have given many examples in the report.  I will not go through them all.  There are many examples of new roster arrangements that match peak demand to services.  I mentioned the Garda.  There are new rosters in the prisons.  We have extended working days and new rosters in laboratories, radiography departments and many nursing units.  Discussions have taken place at the LRC with consultants on extended working days and weekend working.  There are also new rosters for non-consultant hospital doctors.  There has been much development around more efficient and more cost-effective rostering.<\/p><p> I mentioned redeployment.  Again, another 200 secondary teachers and 950 primary teachers have been redeployed.  Before the agreement there was no redeployment of second level teachers at all.  Significant costs have been avoided because teachers are being replaced.  There is no moratorium on the recruitment of teachers.  A significant cost is avoided with the redeployment of 950 primary and 200 secondary teachers.  We are not claiming that as a saving.  We are simply making the point that if the redeployment provision did not exist then more teachers would have had to be recruited.  A total of 4,500 people were redeployed or reassigned throughout the health service during the year.  Hundreds of administrative staff in the Civil Service and State agencies have been redeployed, some to other Departments to meet increased demand, such as the Department of Social Protection, others where agencies have numbers that are in excess of their authorised numbers and they have to reduce their numbers so staff are being redeployed.  There is a range of such movements.<\/p><p> Quite a bit of reconfiguration is going on.  We have a lot of examples in the report about areas such as mental health, child care, services for the elderly and health.  The closure of the Army barracks and the collapse of three brigades into two in the Defence Forces has resulted in a significant reconfiguration that has impacted on thousands of Defence Forces members.  There has also been much reconfiguration of local offices in the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc offices and the courts.<\/p><p> Work practice changes have been progressed.  Terms and conditions have been standardised such as annual leave, sick leave and pension arrangements.  The committee is probably aware of the recent Labour Court ruling on working hours in the local government sector.  VECs are to follow.  Streamlined, centralised and shared services have been progressed in many sectors.  We have given examples of those.  In education, the single student grant, for example, replaces four separate grants previously administered by 66 different agencies.  One body, the Dublin VEC, administers the scheme and online facilities are available for people to use.  It has simplified the maze students and parents had to go through previously.<\/p><p> The centralisation of the medical card processing system has taken place.  A national procurement model has been adopted in the health service.  More national procurement frameworks have been put in place by the National Procurement Service.  The HR shared services of the Civil Service is significant.  Members might have heard about it.  We are talking about savings in the order of &euro;12 million per annum and a reduction in staff numbers of approximately 149 following the development of a shared services centre.<\/p><p> When we were before the committee last year there was discussion about evidence relating to productivity and how it was faring with reduced numbers.  This time we sought to include information on activity levels.  I will not go through it in detail but members will see from the report that in virtually every sector demand has increased, which is what one would expect in a recession in any event.  I refer to demand for social welfare services, health services, employment and services generally.  That is evident in the Prison Service and in Revenue.  We have given examples and I am happy to elaborate on them but I will not go through them in detail.  There are many good examples in the report.<\/p><p> On the pace and ambition of change, notwithstanding the progress that has been reported, the body is of the view that the pace and ambition must be systemic and fully address the fiscal challenges that lie ahead, which are still significant.  There is no doubt that the establishment of a dedicated Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the reform and delivery unit within it, together with the external recruitment of staff with the skills to drive shared services, procurement and contract management has been of huge benefit to the implementation body.  There is a complementarity in that much of the change agenda under the Croke Park agreement and the reform agenda are separate, but there are overlaps as both require the buy-in of staff and unions and co-operation.  We, as an implementation body, have found the establishment of a dedicated Department to be very helpful and to be of huge assistance to us.  However, as we say in the report, the Department alone cannot drive the reforms for the entire public sector.  We are talking about well over 20 Departments and hundreds of agencies.  Managing change in one organisation is a huge challenge.  Managing change in hundreds of organisations simultaneously is doubly so.  The Department does need the support and active engagement of top management in all sectors.  We have repeatedly emphasised the critical role of management across the public service in terms of devising ambitious plans for change and leading that change.<\/p><p> Our view is that the sustainability of the agreement will be measured against its ability to accelerate the pace of change and its potential for extracting further Exchequer savings, both pay and non-pay.  Clearly, a priority issue for the agreement would be to support the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s 2015 target for public service numbers of 37,000 or reducing the overall number to 282,000.  It is a challenging target but we believe it can be done.  The recent collective agreement between public service management and the public service unions on voluntary redundancy terms is an important development, if it is required.  Further and more fundamental reform will be necessary to ensure that services are maintained to the greatest extent possible as numbers continue to reduce.  We made it clear in our June report that a range of priority change initiatives still need to be urgently progressed.  Further roster changes, in particular for nurses and consultants, are required.  Skill mix in the health service is an area that requires attention, as is benchmarking under its support staff programme<\/p><p> We have seen the example with shared services when the business case was produced for HR shared services and the scope for savings.  There are many other areas where there is scope for savings across the entire public service.  We have been driving this forward and some sectors have taken it up and are moving on it more quickly than others.  In any sector where there is a large number of bodies doing pretty much the same work, there is no reason that they should all have their own HR departments, payroll and pension sections.  We have seen a good example with the Civil Service shared service model which has been driven by Paul Reid and his people.  Work has started on it and we have seen the business case savings on that which are significant.<\/p> <p> Performance management is still a big issue, and it must be driven right across the public service.  The recent review of the performance management system certainly does give it more teeth.  It addresses some of the issues we discussed here on the last occasion about the power of managers to discipline the public service and the fact that they do have the same power as managers elsewhere.   There are positive aspects to the performance management system.  It has developed a system for those who are doing a good job.  There are, of course, thousands doing a good job so I would not like to give the impression that there are not many people doing a good job.  The revision of the sick leave scheme is a positive aspect as well.<\/p><p> We need to see further changes to work practices, particularly where there are outdated working arrangements, extended working hours, and there ought to be efforts to ensure the availability of resources to front-line services by making full use of the redeployment provisions of the agreement.  We need to see continuing co-operation on the rationalisation of structures, organisations and offices.  Any agency rationalisations or amalgamations that have been progressed so far have enjoyed full co-operation, including in respect of the redeployment arrangements that are very often necessary to enable those rationalisations or amalgamations to happen.  We give some examples in the report.<\/p><p> More effective inter-agency co-operation must be considered.  One considerable area that the Department of Justice and Equality is examining is co-operation between the courts, Garda and prison service, particularly with reference to the utilisation of fewer prison officers and garda&iacute;.<\/p><p> Let me return to a point I have mentioned here before and at many fora, that is, the need for more online services.  These are critical.  They involve providing a better service to the customer or user and reducing the work for the staff in organisations.  There is still much potential in this area.  Much progress has been and is being made.  However, there can be no let-up in this area.<\/p><p> In summary, it is clear that the agreement continues to deliver, but there are challenges ahead.  Industrial peace has been maintained.  When I last appeared before the committee, we continued to insist that action plans for savings and reform be sufficiently ambitious, both in their scope and timeframes for delivery.  We have just completed a series of meetings with the top management of other sectors, although we must still meet representatives in the defence area.  We emphasised once more the importance of accelerating change through reviewing action plans.  We all know the budget challenges will not be any easier and that they will be significantly more difficult.  We were frank in our report in saying it is not sufficient for management to rely on the reforms delivered to date, however significant or welcome they might be.  We recognise there is further change required in light of the continuing difficult circumstances confronting the economy.<\/p><p> The agreement continues to provide a very effective framework.  I have seen nothing frustrated or stopped by the unions or staff.  Where there are disputes or issues that cannot be resolved genuinely, there are fora to achieve this quickly.  That is what is happening where disputes arise.<\/p><p> I assure the members that the body will continue to do what it can to increase the momentum around the agreement.  We will also be working to ensure that all sectors play their part.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to brief the committee on recent developments.  I will be happy to deal with any questions they have on implementation.  I know they will be taking up the progress report with various sectors and Accounting Officers.  As I said at our last meeting, this is mutually beneficial.  I thank the Chairman and members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100011#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. P. J.

Therefore, it is a very useful forum.  We have similar arrangements in place for each of the big sectors, which total eight.  We recognised at the beginning that if we were to become a dispute-resolution body, we would just get bogged down in industrial relations issues, and the focus would not be on the change agenda at all.  We met the Labour Court and Labour Relations Commission and everyone was very clear that the dispute resolution procedures that would be used would be their well-tried, well-trusted ones.  They work very well.  I compliment both the Labour Court and the LRC on the manner and the speed with which they have handled the Croke Park referrals to them.<\/p><p>  We have an interpretation role.  If issues arise over the interpretation of issues in the agreement, they can be submitted to us.  There have not been very many of them.  Our main role is to try to ensure that whatever obstacles arise are unblocked  We meet sector management regularly to try to make progress.  We are not working on this full-time.  We are non-executives and all those concerned have full-time jobs.  However, we meet regularly and meet sector management.  We do, therefore, have a role in driving and reviewing the action plans, challenging the action plans we get, sending them back, as we have often done, and ensuring we face up to new expenditure challenges.  The budget, for example, always brings new challenges that are not provided for in the Croke Park agreement.  The detailed steps that were to be taken are set out in a series of appendices at the back of the agreement.  Virtually all of them have been taken.  The agreement has moved on, therefore.<\/p><p>  The big ticket item was reducing the number of staff and facilitating the Government to do so.  It also involved ensuring the redeployment arrangements worked to support that process.  This is still a significant feature.  Many of the points in the individual sector plans have been addressed.  The agreement has moved on and every budget brings a set of new challenges.  Take the area of defence, for example.  The Army barracks closures were handled under the Croke Park agreement.  At the moment, the Department of Defence, with the staff associations, is managing the collapsing of the three brigades into two.  This is not easy because it involves much movement and retraining of people.  Our role, which is challenging, is to drive progress and report to the Government on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100014#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. P.

At that point, the target was a reduction of 25,000 by 2014 under the then Government's four-year recovery plan.  It subsequently became a reduction of 37,000 by 2015 under the new programme for Government.  Consequently, we track the numbers on a quarterly basis.  On the other reforms, such as shared services or the more organisational reforms, we track the action plans.

On redeployment, there has been full co-operation and full engagement with the agreement.  As for the areas around which we would like to see greater urgency, we have identified shared services, for example, as the big one.  In sectors such as local government and education, which are ready-made for shared services, there is no reason for loads of organisations to be doing the same work.  In this regard, members may have seen the recent review but the local government sector has now put in place a dedicated office and has identified 29 projects for shared service potential, which range from major projects like payroll and pensions and human resources down to items such as waste permits, for example, which have been centralised in a single county for all the counties in Ireland.  I would say the big one is education, where there is much scope for shared services, in that there are a lot of third level colleges doing pretty much the same work.  While some work has been done in that there is some joint procurement and so on, there is big-ticket stuff there.  I note the new reform unit in the Department is driving this with the different sectors.  However, if the Deputy asked me about the area for the biggest savings that needs more acceleration, this is one big area.  The other one is online services.  Very often, people wait for a big expensive system to put in online services but this is not always required.  For example, when the second house tax was introduced, the local government sector had that up and running within weeks.  Very often, it does not cost a fortune to put in place online services.  Sometimes, people think it needs a major IT system when it actually involves quite a modest investment.

I also chair the Garda sectoral body, for example.  When the new Garda rosters were introduced, there was not one word in the media.  No unions were complaining and the rosters were introduced almost unnoticed under the radar.  That would not have happened before.  Part of it is a realisation of the times we are in.  Trade union officials know how tough and difficult things are, but it is a good example of something big that was introduced virtually unnoticed.  It was introduced nationwide on the same day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100018#R02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. P.

I agree that it was a massive change and have witnessed the huge difference it has made in my community.  He said this would not have happened before and the fact that it is happening now is a tribute to the Croke Park agreement.  However, it should have happened previously and the normalisation of such change is a move to where we should be and perhaps is not the achievement it is made out to be.  The Garda rosters had not changed for 40 years and I acknowledge fully that it is a gigantic change.  However, this has not changed since the 1960s and the country has changed beyond all recognition.

The rosters should have changed, but they did not.  The reality is that it was a big issue because changing rosters was different from any other change that could be implemented, particularly in any area in which 24-7 cover was required.  People's lives are often built around rosters, including their partner's working arrangements and child care arrangements.  One, therefore, is not just changing something in their workplace; one is changing their entire domestic life also.  That was the big challenge with the Garda rosters.  That is why roster changes tend to be more problematic than most other changes because they are intrinsically linked with people's home lives.  One tends to find this in the health service and any sector in which people work around the clock.

However, my point still stands in that I can see progress in the itemisation of non-pay savings because that was a question I put to Mr. Fitzpatrick the last time.  I return to the point of verification, a point we discussed.  Paragraph 2.6 of the report outlines the four sample validations that were selected for evaluating the non-pay saving element.  To the best of my understanding, the second point listed, the implementation of a national single procurement model in the HSE, is the biggest ticket item of the non-pay savings identified across that period.  The third-party evaluation of it picked the big-ticket item of the &euro;430 million.  This was something of which I was critical in March and it has changed.  I wanted to acknowledge that.<\/p><p>  Is Mr. Fitzpatrick still satisfied that the evaluation methodology is as broad as it can be for logging these?  I will give an example to bring it to life.  On Tuesday evening at a meeting, which is now famous for other reasons, we had a discussion with representatives of the HSE.  The most interesting part of the meeting came at the very end of it when we had a discussion with Mr. Tony O'Brien about the new consultant contract and the saving of &euro;200 million.  His perspective was interesting.  He cautioned against saying that the new consultant contract would automatically deliver a saving of &euro;200 million.  His point was as follows: the consultants will work for different hours and they will see more people at different hours.  While that is the right thing to happen, of itself it will generate an on-cost of which one must be aware as we work through the year.  With that in mind, are we adopting the right approach in evaluating the non-pay savings resulting from the Croke Park agreement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100019#S01300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349955000,"counter":251,"content":"<p>We got some very helpful suggestions that last day, which we tried to take on board.

Mr. Fitzpatrick seems to be prudent.  In the second progress report on the public service agreement 2010-14 he states the body is of the view that accelerating change needs to occur across all public service bodies in every sector with an increased sense of urgency.  I do not believe he has made that statement lightly.  Clearly, he has concerns that the rate of change is not fast enough.  He probably signed off on the document at the start of June.<\/p><p>  How long is Mr. Fitzpatrick's contract?  When the Minister was before the committee this morning, he indicated that there might be intransigence within some areas of the public sector at middle management level with respect to the changes required under the Croke Park agreement.  My fundamental view is that we do not need to reinvent the wheel, rather we need to get the agreement to work to maximum effect.  Are there jams within the system which prevent this from happening?  There are great people working in the public sector and I believe in the Croke Park agreement.  Nevertheless, it is about getting it to work to maximum capacity.<\/p><p>  With regard to redeployment, community welfare officers were transferred from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Protection.  I believed at the time that many of these personnel should have been assigned to the fraud detection section of the Department of Social Protection.  My understanding is they have not been.  Their local knowledge is unrivalled.<\/p><p>  Will Mr. Fitzpatrick provide the context in terms of where he sees the agreement working and where there are weaknesses?  Where does he see a need for oil to be applied to get the agreement to work to its maximum potential?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012101100022#V03500","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349956800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>From memory, the contract is the period from 2010 to 2014.  As the Deputy knows, it is not a full-time role.  As the contract took in the wording of the agreement, there is no specific date.  If the agreement ceases to operate, the contract will cease.<\/p><p>  We did not make the comment referred to lightly.  It was a considered statement that was subscribed to by management and union personnel.  It is a statement on behalf of the nine members of the body.  I also agree that there are thousands working very hard and trying to cope with fewer staff.  In many cases they are doing a really good job.  <\/p><p>  The main issues of concern are the big ticket items such as shared services.  We can see how much can be saved in the Civil Service, particularly in areas such as education and local government.  There is another in which we have sought more information, although I am not arguing that nothing has happened.  Nevertheless, we do not have information from the voluntary sector.  There is a significant amount spent in the health sector on voluntary hospitals and mental handicap organisations.

I know he is under a time constraint as he must go to meet the Taoiseach.<\/p><p>  I have a different view of the Croke Park agreement but I sat here willing to be convinced about the whole process.  I wondered why I had so many reservations about it.  The pace of change and reform, which is critical to the survival of the State, is very slow and tedious.  By comparison, in the private sector when the market closed down, everything chopped and changed, places closed and people lost their jobs and income.  Despite this, in the public sector, we have the Croke Park agreement which has undoubtedly delivered but at a pace that does not compare with the private sector.  That is the issue I have with the agreement.  The Croke Park agreement also protects the level of pay, which is out of kilter with the private sector.  Sometimes increments, which are added on each year, create a massive difference when one compares a low paid employee in the public sector and the private sector.  While all those involved in the Croke Park agreement might be quite happy about the progress within the rules they have fashioned, when it is benchmarked against the private sector it leaves a great deal to be desired.<\/p><p>  My next remarks are no reflection on Mr. Fitzpatrick, and I appreciate his frank exchange at this meeting.  The four senior civil servants, four trade union members and a chair seem to conduct business as usual.  Should the implementation body have been expanded to include someone different from the outside who would be able to give a flavour of the comparison between public and private sector operations?  Change is being driven by the reduction in budgets.  If there is significant reduction in a budget because of the economic collapse, one must shed staff or cut pay.  Acceptance is built on the reality that the State cannot do any more.  We were setting out to buy peace, where in fact there was no war.<\/p><p>  I appreciate that Mr. Fitzpatrick came before the Committee of Public Account and gave us an explanation of the facts and figures.

Agreed.  We will deal with the minutes from 9 October at our next meeting.  On matters arising from the minutes, I note the correspondence received.<\/p><p>  Item 3A is correspondence from Accounting Officers.  Correspondence dated 4 October 2012 is from Mr. Tom Boland, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, in respect of the committee meeting of 27 September 2012, to be noted and published.  Correspondence dated 21 June 2012 from Mr. Pat Geoghegan, secretary of the Irish Environmental Forum, alleging waste of public funds is to be noted.  This matter was referred to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for a note on the issues raised and also to the Comptroller and Auditor General for appropriate follow-up in the context of his audit of that body.  I have checked with the clerk.  The EPA comes under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In the context of that letter, there are a number of pieces of information that need to be clarified.  I ask that they be clarified in order that if members want to raise it with the Accounting Officers when they come in, we can refer to the note from the Comptroller and Auditor General or the note from the Minister's Department.<\/p><p>  Item 3B.2 is correspondence dated 2 October 2012 from Deputy Derek Nolan re HSE west property rental budget, to be noted and published.  The matter was referred to the HSE for a note and to the Comptroller and Auditor General for the appropriate follow-up in the context of the annual audit.<\/p><p>  Correspondence dated 1 October 2012 is from an anonymous source re the prison officers social club Castlerea and is to be noted.  This may not come within the remit of the committee as it relates to a social club funds.  However, as it alleges inappropriate use of moneys, we will refer it to the Garda Commissioner for appropriate follow-up and comment.<\/p><p>  On the issue of individual correspondence and complaints, the first two matter, 3.1 and 3C were deferred from previous meeting because they relate to issues raised by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.  I discussed this with the Deputy and she asked that if she was not here today, because of the structure of the meeting, that they would be deferred again.  With the permission of the meeting, that can be done.<\/p><p>  Item 3C.3 is correspondence dated 27 July 2012 from Ms Julie O'Shea in respect of the second home charge and fine.  This has been noted.  The collection of the household charge is a matter for each local authority and is outside the remit of the committee.  However, we will ask the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to examine this complaint to ensure the local authority levys the appropriate change on this individual.  The Department will be asked to deal with this matter directly.  Presumably when that has been dealt with, we will get a copy of the correspondence.  With all of these new charges, it is important the issues that come out of them are followed up in order that we can improve the process of collection and so on.<\/p><p>  Item 3C.4 is correspondence dated 18 September 2012 from Mr. Martin Moore and Company, Main Street, Blennerville, Tralee, County Kerry.  This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  This is to be noted.  We have dealt with his issue.<\/p><p>  Item 3C.5 is correspondence dated 23 September 2012 from Mr. C. Callan in County Clare re the budget.  Again, this is a policy issue and is not for the committee.  We can refer it to the Department of Finance for comment.<\/p><p>  Item 3C.6 is correspondence dated 26 September 2012 from Mr. Michael Brosnan, North Circular Road, Dublin 7, re Mr. Charles Farrell.  This is to be noted.  We have dealt with this matter arising from previous correspondence<\/p><p>  Item 3D relates to documents before this committee - opening statements - and we will publish them.<\/p><p>  Item 4 is reports and statements and accounts received since our meeting of 4 October 2012.  They are listed from 4.1.to 4.6, all to be noted.<\/p> <p> The work programme on the screen takes account of meetings on the payment of public sector pay allowances in 2011.  It has been suggested that we hold a private meeting on this next Tuesday.  Since our meeting, the Minister for Public Expenditure has made statements on this and has attended a meeting here.  The question for the committee is whether we wish to continue to examine the allowances.  If so, will we hold a meeting on 16 October and discuss it again?  The meeting on 16 October at 2 p.m. was to distribute to members the initial review of the business cases and discuss them.  Will we add this as an item on the agenda for the meeting with the Department of Defence on 18 October and allow members to discuss it then instead?  It is up to the members.

On behalf of the select committee, I welcome the T&aacute;niste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and his officials to the meeting.  The purpose of this meeting is to discuss with the T&aacute;naiste the policy choices that might be considered so that the cost of activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade can be made within the fixed expenditure ceiling for 2013.  The expenditure ceilings for each of the years 2012 and 2013 were fixed in the context of the three-year multi-annual framework that was established by the Governments' Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-14.  An indicative ceiling was set for 2014.  This means that the focus of our discussion should be on how a limited provision might be allocated rather on the adequacy of the overall provision.<\/p><p>  This is an opportunity to engage formally with the T&aacute;naiste on his spending plans for next year before that year commences.  This is a significant and a very welcome innovation in the way spending is done.  It gives practical effect to one of the core principles that the Government has said runs through all its budgetary reforms.  The principle is that in a democracy better decisions are made when policy makers are held to account and when the entire policy making process is subject to a parliamentary oversight, scrutiny and participation.  Parliamentary input into the resource allocation process has traditionally happened only in the context of the approval of Revised Estimates.  Typically, committees have not had the opportunity to consider these Estimates until half way through the year when much of the financial provision being debated had already been spent.  Key to our discussion is that there is no Estimate before the committee for discussion.  This is an opportunity to influence the options that will be considered in formulating the Estimates later.  <\/p><p>  The select committee had a very constructive engagement with the T&aacute;naiste in May this year on the 2012 Estimates and it was aided by the enhanced format, which reflected the move to performance based budgeting.  This select committee is the first committee to road-test the advanced scrutiny process.  I know that members and the T&aacute;naiste, as always, will engage constructively here.<\/p><p>  I propose we hear an opening presentation from the T&aacute;naiste and that we structure the subsequent discussion by considering each of the five programmes in turn.  Are members agreeable to our proceeding in this way?  Agreed.  Before I invite the T&aacute;naiste to make his presentation, I remind him that there are two new members of the select committee since he was last here.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe has replaced Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Loughlainn for the Sinn F&eacute;in Party and Deputy Brendan Smith has replaced Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  I note Deputy Olivia Mitchell is not present but she may arrive later.  I am conscious that the T&aacute;naiste is under a time constraint as he has an important meeting at 3.45 p.m. and will need to leave at 3.40 p.m. if that is agreeable to the members.  I hand over to the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2012101100002#A00600","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1349962200,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I join the Chairman in welcoming Deputies Brendan Smith and Se&aacute;n Crowe as members of the select committee.  I had an opportunity at a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs Committee to have a discussion with Deputy Crowe in his new capacity and I look forward to working with both Deputies.<\/p><p>  Our exchanges this afternoon represents another step in the ongoing reform of the budgetary process.  As the Chairman has stated, this is the first time an Oireachtas committee has discussed the formation of the annual departmental Estimates in advance of the finalisation of the budget.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate and I will bear the views of members in mind in considering the distribution of the funds allocated to my Department.  I hope the members can agree that this is not the occasion for a debate on wider Government budgetary policy.  There will be an opportunity for such a debate the week after next in the House and, therefore, I will confine my remarks today to the priorities and resourcing of my Department for 2013. <\/p><p>  As part of the performance budgeting system, we presented more detail in the 2012 Estimates on our expenditure plans and on the relationship between money being spent and targets being achieved.  A range of relevant indicators provide benchmarks against which the performance of the Department can be measured.  While this approach is still in its formative stages, I hope members are finding it helpful and I believe it will contribute to greater public understanding of the Department's work.<\/p><p>  In preparing the Estimates for 2013, we will again set ambitious, attainable targets that reflect the programme for Government, are in line with the Department's statement of strategy and take account of the available resources.  The new budgetary procedures operate within the framework of the overall limits on Government spending which, as members know, are set in accordance with the troika programme.  Within that overall amount, expenditure ceilings were set for each Department for 2013 in the comprehensive expenditure report last November.  For the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that amounts to &euro;733 million for delivery of the diverse range of citizen services, economic promotion, programme management and policy advisory functions discharged by the Department across the globe.  That ceiling is also fixed.  Any increase for one programme is necessarily at the expense of another activity.  Members can be assured that I will be working to ensure that we get the maximum value from the available funds.  <\/p><p>  In July, my Department forwarded to the committee a working-through of the implications of the comprehensive expenditure report on the allocations for 2013.  The overall level of reduction foreseen was &euro;27.7 million across the two Votes for which I am responsible.  At the request of the committee, we modelled the impact of a <i>pro rata <\/i>reduction across the various departmental programmes. The effect on the services we deliver and the outcomes we pursue is described in the accompanying commentary.   <\/p> <p>International co-operation, funded under Vote 27, is the largest programme administered by the Department.  Despite the pressures of recent years, the aid programme is independently rated as one of the most effective in the world.  It is sharply focused on the fight against hunger and poverty in some of the poorest countries, with a clear geographic concentration on sub-Saharan Africa.  The Government is committed to keeping development at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and to maintaining the focus on Africa.  Last year, I launched the Department&rsquo;s new Africa strategy.  We are now using our resources at home and in our network of missions across the continent to broaden our relations with African countries to encompass political engagement, a strong focus on development issues and the building of new economic and trading links.<\/p><p> We are also completing our review of the 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid, an important commitment in the programme for Government.  The public consultation process for the review underscored the strong levels of support for the aid programme, even at a time of great economic difficulty at home, and the recognition that it operates in the interests of the poorest people and communities in the world, but also in our interests as a small country in an increasingly interdependent world.<\/p><p> In the most challenging of circumstances, the Government has succeeded in maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance above 0.5% of GNP.  We remain committed to reaching the UN target of 0.7% as soon as we possibly can, based on the restoration of sustained economic growth domestically.  We will continue to play a strong role in the formation of international development policy, especially when we take on the role of EU Presidency in the first half of 2013.  During the Presidency, I look forward in particular to opening up the debate across Europe on the millennium development goals and the shape of policy for global development after 2015.  In doing so, this country will continue to emphasise the centrality to international development of the fight against hunger and undernutrition, and the lessons we have learned from our own work on the ground in Africa and elsewhere since the establishment of the aid programme 40 years ago, in 1973.<\/p><p> On emergency humanitarian needs, this country will continue to respond as quickly and as effectively as we have over many years.  We have learned many lessons from our interventions ranging from the Asian tsunami to the earthquake in Haiti, which we continue to put into practice in situations as diverse as Syria and Sudan.  We have helped save countless lives and also built the capacity of communities to withstand future shocks through our work on building resilience.  In Somalia in July I witnessed at first hand how devastated communities can almost miraculously rebuild if they have the means and help that we can offer.  We will continue to offer that vital assistance.<\/p><p> This country's ongoing high profile on international peace, security and human rights issues consolidates and enhances the positive image the State has traditionally enjoyed abroad and sends a strong message about our capacity to work through our economic difficulties.  Our largest financial commitment in this area relates to our contribution to the UN and other organisations.  The actual amount is hard to predict as it depends on a number of variables, including the adoption of a new contribution key later this year, the number and scale of UN peacekeeping missions and on the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar.  Our chairmanship-in-office of the OSCE culminates with the major challenge of the ministerial meeting in Dublin in early December.  We assume the Presidency of the European Union in the new year.  We are running a strong campaign for membership of the Human Rights Council.  That election is scheduled for next month and the outcome will have a bearing on our internal resource deployment.<\/p><p> The EU Presidency is probably the single biggest project for 2013, not just for my Department but across the system, including for the Oireachtas.  Management of the Presidency will place enormous demands on staff in my Department at home and abroad.  We aim to optimise the cost-effectiveness of the Presidency and have taken a number of measures to reduce outgoings as much as possible.  These include the use of Dublin Castle and similar State-owned venues to host all meetings in Ireland.  We have temporarily doubled the number of staff in the permanent representation in Brussels but have squeezed the additional personnel into the existing premises.<\/p><p> The indications are that we should be able to adhere to the original budget of &euro;60 million across all Departments over two years, which is appreciably less than the cost of our previous Presidency in 2004.  There will be a separate budget for security.  A successful Presidency coupled with the ongoing promotion of our business interests will further our efforts to communicate our economic progress to a global audience.  We are working closely with the relevant semi-State bodies and local authorities in a co-operative fashion.  We are also considering some helpful sponsorship offers that will reduce some of the cost.<\/p><p> The passport service is now servicing a record level of demand more cost-effectively and within the turnaround times guaranteed for applicants.  My Department is pursuing a number of further technology-based service enhancements.  These include moving to a new counter appointments service instead of the existing queuing arrangement and the introduction of an online renewal option for adults.  These improvements, and the already overdue replacement of production machinery, will require some initial capital investment.  While individual situations are impossible to predict, we are planning on the basis that we will need to respond to something of the order of 1,500 serious consular cases next year and will stand ready to respond to large-scale emergencies that might arise.<\/p><p> Recent events in Northern Ireland are a reminder of the journey that remains to be travelled on the path to reconciliation on this island.  The reconciliation and anti-sectarianism funds are focused on the most disadvantaged communities in Northern Ireland.  This includes engagement with young people, especially those living in at-risk areas.  Support is being provided to projects in interface areas designed to address the root causes of sectarianism and which are aimed at breaking down barriers between communities.  In addition, the funds will be used in the promotion of North-South co-operation and linkages and as a support to commemoration events.<\/p><p> Delivery of all of these programmes relies heavily on the work of the officials in my Department at home and abroad.  Even allowing for the temporary additional posts sanctioned for the Presidency, the Department is managing an unprecedented conjuncture of major international responsibilities with some 10% fewer staff than it had three years ago.  This is placing exceptional demands on personnel, the majority of whom are engaged in providing direct services to Irish citizens and business or supporting delivery of the Irish Aid programme to some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world.  The pressures we face have necessitated a nimble response.  We have consolidated and streamlined functions at headquarters.  Abroad, the level and scale of our representation has necessarily been reduced in some locations and, regrettably, we were obliged to close three missions at the end of last year.<\/p><p> We have also proactively taken a range of other measures to reduce our cost base and maximise the return for each euro we spend.  The administrative cost of delivery of the Department&rsquo;s services has been reduced by approximately a fifth in the past three years.  The search for further efficiencies continues unceasingly but realistically there are limits to the additional economies that can be made without adverse impact on service delivery.  The level of funding foreseen for 2013 is going to force us to make further hard choices in the Department.  Until the final budgetary arithmetic and some of the other variables I have mentioned are crystallised, I cannot be more precise as to where the adjustments will fall.<\/p><p> I trust that the committee will understand the challenges facing me, as they face all Ministers, and that we can work together to ensure that we achieve the best possible outcomes on foreign affairs and trade with the resources available to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2012101100002#A00700","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349962200,"counter":529,"content":"<p>With the co-operation of members we will take questions under the five programmes.

At a time when there is pressure on us to promote trade, what will be the impact on the Department?  If one loses a vice consul, is pressure then placed on the consul in any given area?  I am thinking of areas such as San Francisco, which is to lose staff.  A considerable proportion of the trade between Ireland and the United States is associated with the region incorporating San Francisco.  If we are withdrawing staff from this area, what will be the impact?  People refer to the positive role of embassy staffs, including individuals, in some areas with regard to the promotion of trade.<\/p><p>  With a view to saving money, could the staff of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and consular services be placed in one building such that we would have a one-stop shop?

A number of Departments and agencies are involved in the trade function.  These include the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has responsibility for Bord Bia and food exports.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is responsible for tourism activity.  A number of other Departments now have a trade role, including the Department of Education and Skills.  Education is now a product being traded.<\/p><p>  We are seeking to have co-ordination.  The lead role in any country is taken by the embassy.<\/p> <p> The resources of both my Department and the agencies concerned are limited and consequently, we seek to achieve the greatest possible degree of co-ordination on the ground in individual countries and markets.  Second, we seek to back that up here at home, mainly through the Export Trade Council the Government has established, which the respective Ministers to whom I have referred, as well as their Departments and agencies attend.  In addition, the council has representatives of the private sector.  For example, in countries such as Russia, we have a joint economic commission that reports through it and there are 27 separate market plans which it reports back to us.  There is now in place a much more joined-up approach to trade activity.  In order to provide resources to so do, some additional staff were transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I believe the total increased allocation to meet that was approximately &euro;400,000, mainly to provide that degree of co-ordination.  I believe this is working and clearly, much of the growth of 1.4% recorded in the economy last year is export-related.  The Ireland House concept, that is, the idea of having all these agencies under a single roof is something to which we try to give effect where we can.  It functions very well in a number of countries and we wish to expand it.<\/p><p> On the issue raised by Deputy Crowe regarding consular services, as I have explained to the select committee a number of times previously, the number of diplomatic staff Ireland has compared with countries of similar size is very small.  I believe we have a total of 347 all told, whereas Denmark has more than 800 such staff and countries such as Finland have approximately similar numbers.  We must use our staff to best effect which is the reason, for example, when faced with something like the Presidency, we are obliged to redeploy staff from missions.  However, we so do in a manner that ensures the consular services in different parts of the world are maintained.<\/p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne raised the strategy regarding the African countries.  The current position is that as a country, we export as much in food and drink to Nigeria alone as we do to China.  At present, seven of the ten fastest-growing economies in the world are located in Africa.  Ireland has a high reputation in Africa, much of it derived from the success of our aid programme and it is a way of opening doors for us on the trade front, which is the reason we give such a priority to it.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised the international day of the girl child and I note Ireland was one of the countries which co-sponsored the resolution that established the day.  We give a high priority in all our work, whether on the aid side or the human rights side, to gender equality and  in our aid programme we work to support programmes that, for example, support education for girls.  As for sustainability, the issue of sustainability underpins Ireland's entire approach to the aid programme.  I hope it also will underpin the involvement of the private sector in the programme.  This year, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I jointly launched a programme in Kenya and Tanzania, in which we are involving private sector food companies in our aid programme because, as the Deputy noted, there is huge potential in Africa for the development of the food industry.  We now have the active engagement of a number of Ireland's major food companies in that programme.  It is a highly innovative approach to extending our aid programme, in that work the Government has been doing for years will now involve the private sector, which will work with private companies in African countries in the development of their food programme and the upskilling of their food processing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2012101100004#C00600","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349963400,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

I wish to record my thanks to staff in the Passport Office and the T&aacute;naiste's own office because while dealing with constituency work during the summer, I encountered plenty of issues.  A media campaign still is required to encourage people to apply for passports in time.  All members receive weekend calls on Friday evenings or Saturday mornings involving people going on holidays or whatever.  However, I wish to record my appreciation for the assistance of the staff involved.  As for the Irish abroad programme, all members are aware that unfortunately, people still are living in difficult circumstances in the major cities in Britain, the United States and elsewhere.  The Irish abroad programme has been highly successful and it is clear, from visiting different Irish communities in different cities, particularly in Britain, the assistance that has been given is valued.  However, such assistance probably still is needed.<\/p><p>  I have often thought that with society having more active retired people, there may be an opportunity to engage with people who are retired from employment and to get them involved.  For several years, the numbers of people active within the Irish community have been declining and the age profile has been rising.  While the embassy staff would be in a better position to judge, I believe an opportunity exists to engage more people.  During the passage through the Oireachtas of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill, Deputies Crowe and Maureen O'Sullivan and I met people from London who were dealing with Irish people who had been the victims of abuse in residential institutions.  There still is a major need to provide assistance and help to many Irish people living in many different communities.  Consequently, I am anxious for the maintenance of whatever assistance is possible for that programme, as it is put to good use by volunteers in those cities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2012101100005#D00300","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1349963400,"counter":540,"content":"<p>On consular cases, the T&aacute;naiste indicated he expected 1,500 such cases to arise.

I believe 87,000 did so last year, 81,500 in 2010 and probably tens of thousands this year.  I presume the demand for services and support will be a lot higher in consequence.  How can the Department support such demand?  Much of the emigrants' services provided in Britain are directed towards an older population.  Is there the same demand for some of those younger people who are going there?  All members have received the telephone call at the weekend to the effect that Mary or Johnny so-and-so has been arrested in the United States or is in difficulty in Australia.

I thank members for their complimentary remarks about the passport service.  We have seen a significant improvement in the service over the course of last year.  The performance target for 2012 was to process 60% of passport express applications within ten days and 90% within 15 days.  In 2012 we managed to process 78% of passport express applications within ten days and 99.55% within 15 days.  As of 30 September 2012, 529,152 passports have been produced this year, which represents an increase of almost 4% on last year&rsquo;s figure.  We also intend to introduce a different counter management system and an appointment system in order to address the issue of queueing.  We are now at the upper end and are probably world leaders in terms of security of our passports.  We intend to introduce a higher specification passport booklet next year to further enhance the security of Irish passports and reduce the potential for abuse.<\/p><p>  Deputies Smith and Crowe raised the issue of the Irish abroad.  We are trying to address two situations.  The first is the longer term emigrant, that is, people who emigrated in the 1950s and 1960s and in many cases sent back remittances to Ireland.  Some of these emigrants are living in difficult circumstances and we continue to provide support to emigrant services in the UK and the United States.  These kinds of support services tend to be more heavily dependent on grant aid from the Department, whereas younger emigrants are more dependent on consular services.<\/p><p>  We have opened an emigrant support service in Toronto in Canada and are working with the Canadian Department of Citizenship and Immigration to support our emigrants.  When the Canadian Minister for Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, Jason Kenney, visited Ireland last week he announced an increase in the number of visas available to Irish people working in Canada, as well as an extension in the validity of visas from one to two years.<\/p><p>  The GAA makes a significant contribution by acting as a point of contact with younger emigrants.  We are working with the GAA to provide support to young emigrants.<\/p><p>  The total number of consular cases is higher than 1,500 but this is an estimate of the serious cases which require a degree of attention.

We had another snapshot of this earlier this year to remind us that these difficulties remain.  Many awkward discussions, as described by my party colleagues, are going on in many communities and they need to be encouraged and built on as they involved people who were involved in the past in the conflict.  They are trying to create a new beginning following the hurt imposed on many individuals.  The sectarian footprint is still bubbling away under the surface and the committee can send a positive message that we need to continue the peace building and support of community relations.

First, there is the issue raised by a number of Deputies, notwithstanding the progress at political and institutional level in the North, about the continuing underlying sectarian difficulties in many communities.  That is why we have the funds to promote co-operation and tackle sectarianism, which are important.  European Union PEACE funding has also been provided.  We have been in discussion with the UK Administration about this issue because there are differing views between Ireland and the UK, for example, on the composition of the EU budget to 2020.  The UK wants to reduce the budget while Ireland wants to maintain it and there will be consequences in all of that for PEACE funding.

There is a very big commitment from my Department to working with Northern Ireland institutions, the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and so on.  While I know a separate committee deals with Northern Ireland issues, it is probably a matter to which we should return.<\/p><p>  The &euro;514 million does not include the contribution of other Departments in the area of overseas aid.  Regarding what Deputy Crowe said, I did not say at the UN that we would meet the 0.7% target by 2015; I said that we were committed to meeting the 0.7% target and that we would do so when we are able to do so economically and as our economic situation improves.  I do not believe anybody expects us to meet the 0.7% target by 2015 in our present economic difficulties and therefore there is no merit in our making statements to that effect.  The 0.7% is the target that has been agreed internationally.  We are aiming at that target and remain committed to reaching it.  As evidence of our good faith, it is important to point out that in difficult times we are maintaining our aid budget.  There were significant reductions in the aid budget in previous years, with reductions of approximately 30% since 2008.  The Government has maintained our commitment to aid.<\/p><p>  Deputy Mitchell asked about the difference between the &euro;514 million and the &euro;524 million.  It is based on a proportion of GNP and we do not know the GNP with ongoing quarterly revisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2012101100008#G00900","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1349965200,"counter":563,"content":"<p>Are we protecting an optimistic revision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2012101100008#G01000","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1349965200,"counter":564,"content":"<p>It is related to that.

We welcome the opportunity to appear before it.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Shane Dempsey, head of consumer foods, who will make the majority of the presentation.  I will make some introductory remarks on the overall position in the agrifood sector.<\/p><p>  Agrifood is our most important indigenous industry.  In total, between direct jobs, indirect jobs and linkages with the wider agricultural and rural community, approximately 230,000 people are employed in the sector, or one in eight jobs in the economy.  That is the same of number of jobs as there are in the car industry in Germany.  It is, therefore, our single most important industry.  As we have seen in some of the announcements made in recent days, it has its highs and lows.  It is under a lot of pressure in the domestic marketplace, but at the same time it is at the cutting edge of innovation in the overall food sector, not just on an Irish or European basis but on a global basis.<\/p><p>  The profile of the food industry includees 690 enterprises, 94% of them being SMEs and 6% being large companies.  Many of them have a strong export focus, but they also supply the domestic market.  We sell about &euro;9 billion worth of goods into the economy and about &euro;9 billion into overseas economies.  Food Harvest 2020, the strategy housed in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, was strongly industry-led in its development and has a vision of smart, green growth, with an ambitious export target figure of &euro;12 billion by 2020.  The industry is strongly linked with the broader economy and accounts for two thirds of exports by Irish companies.  We purchase &euro;11.5 billion worth of raw materials, other products and services in the domestic economy, while accounting for 90% of agricultural output. <\/p><p>  There are key drivers in the industry.  Competitiveness is vital, as is the brand, regardless of whether one is selling directly to the consumer or other businesses.  Reputation is very important.  Food safety underpins any food business operator in this or any other state.  The reputational issues that flow from this are of vital importance to the food industry, as we attempt to maintain and grow our share of the domestic market and, particularly, export markets.  From our perspective, it is vitally important that the image of the food industry and its reputation are not just protected but also enhanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100003#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349944200,"counter":582,"content":"<p>The food industry is deeply embedded in the economic and social fabric of Ireland.  We are here to say we want to be an active partner in solving the problem of childhood obesity and recognise we have a responsibility in this regard.  We are here to engage with the Government on the issue and commend the committee for the work it is doing to this end.<\/p> <p>I want to take a few minutes to outline how food companies are actively living up to their responsibilities to provide the solutions that might inform the work of the committee.  I respectfully ask the committee to recommend to the Government that it adopt a whole society approach that will draw in all stakeholders who have a role to play in resolving this issue.  I will take members through the types of policies that would make a major difference in tackling childhood obesity.  We can discuss a number of them.<\/p><p> Slide No. 4 sets out the food companies' contribution under a number of headings.  Heading No. 1 is reformulation, in respect of which companies reduce nutrients in products; heading No. 2 is information - companies provide information and adhere to strict marketing and advertising guidelines in the promotion of their products and communications with consumers; under heading No. 3 is listed the companies that produce and market a range of products, including reduced variant products, and offer products of varying portion sizes to consumers.  The final heading is active lifestyles and wellness, in respect of which companies support local community activities and, at national and EU level, support the multi-stakeholder forum such as the Nutrition and Health Foundation<b>,<\/b>NHF, and the EU platform on diet, health and physical activity.<\/p><p> Slide No. 5 shows the statistics from a recent survey that FDII carried out of its members.  Let me highlight some of the elements.  Some 82% of FDII companies have engaged in the past three years in reformulation of their products; 76% have reduced their salt content; 50% have their reduced saturated fat content; 58% have reduced their sugar content; while 60% have launched alternative products.  We spoke about variants; this includes actions by companies such as the 68% which had variant portion size information on their products and the 46% which had introduced products of reduced portion size.  <\/p><p> The issue of trans fat was raised at other committee meetings.  It is important to note that the FSAI reported that trans fat levels in the population were within guidelines mainly owing to the work of food companies and FDII members in removing trans fat.  The industry is taking steps to deal with the issue.  I will now outline the further steps we propose to take to deal with it.  <\/p><p> FDII members believe partnership and engagement are the way to solve obesity.  Most members will agree with this.  They have asked Food and Drink Industry Ireland to create a platform on which the industry and the Government can collaborate to solve the problem together.  Our approach is called the Live Well Project.  Slide No. 6 presents our ideas in graphical format and I will highlight some of the key points.  The first pillar is that all participating members sign up to a pledge reinforcing their commitment to inform, provide choice, reformulate products and promote healthier lifestyles.  The second pillar is that member companies work with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, on the issues of reformulation, choice and fortification on an annual basis, similar to the approach used to the salt reduction programme.  The third pillar involves a national workplace wellbeing campaign aimed at creating healthier workplaces.  The fourth pillar is to engage with some of Ireland's leading health professionals to identify the key research projects that will give us the necessary insights into tackling obesity.  The fifth pillar lists the food categories such as cereals, bread and confectionery, on which we will work in union and consultation with the Government to agree specific initiatives where a difference can be made.<\/p><p> Most experts agree that obesity, childhood and adult, is a very complex problem that requires all stakeholders to work together.  Slide No. 7 has a series of quotations from the UK Foresight report of 2008, the European Commission and health professionals.  The message is that everyone needs to pull together.  I am not under any illusion.  We all have different views on how it should work, but it is important to get together and use a platform such as the Live Well Project to address the problem.  <\/p><p> Slide No. 8 highlights the complexity of the problem, but as it is not very clear, I have a map of the 109 factors which drive obesity.  These factors are interdependent and inter-related and some are more important than others.  Slide No. 9 groups the factors together under the following headings: food consumption, individual psychology, the biology of the individual and food production.  The point the slide makes is that obesity is a very complex problem.  If one targets a single factor, the others that influence obesity are still at play.  We need to get everyone involved, food companies, schools, parents, sport groups and NGOs, to address the problem.<\/p><p> Slide No. 10 outlines the principles of a solution.  The first is a strategy for a societal response in which all stakeholders are involved.  The industry want to be an effective partner in the process.  Intervention should be long-term and sustained.  Early and sustained interventions aimed at prevention are key to dealing with childhood obesity.  Physical activity has a major role to play in dealing with it.  We are willing to work with the Government on the principles of a solution to deal with the issue.<\/p><p> Let me outline a case study of how the partnership model will work.  In 2004 the FSAI and FDII began work on salt reductions initiatives across the industry.  Slide No. 11 shows some of the results of that initiative.  There was a 20% reduction in the salt content of bread; a 25% reduction in the salt content of soups and sauces; a 48% reduction in the salt content of breakfast cereals since 1998 and a 19% decrease in the salt content of crisps.  That demonstrates what can be done when the industry and State agencies work together to bring the population along.  The last Irish Universities Nutritional Alliance, IUNA, survey found that while the level of salt consumed by people in foods had reduced, the level of discretionary salt intake had increased, in other words, people were starting to shake it on food.  This highlights the complexity of the issue.  One needs to supplement the efforts of the industry and the Government with information directed at particular groups.<\/p><p> Slide No. 12 relates to labelling and shows the guideline daily amount levels.  Labelling was mentioned at the previous committee meeting.  The industry introduced labels in 2009 and allocated significant resources to having them put on products.  The statistics on slide No. 13 speak for themselves.  Some 95% of own brand products and 83% of branded goods carry information on GDAs.  This is another example of the industry working together to make a difference.<\/p><p> Slide No. 14 refers to food advertising and marketing.  It is important to state the level of exposure of children to advertising of food products has reduced greatly.  That has been a trend in recent years.  In Ireland voluntary steps by the industry have led to the level of exposure of children to advertising on Irish television services dropping from 36% to 7%.  This is a contentious issue which will come up in the question and answer session.<\/p> <p> Food companies have a very high compliance rate with the existing Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland advertising guidelines.  They have their own internal codes as well.  I mentioned the EU bodies earlier.  Food companies are committed to the EU advertising pledge.  A recent audit showed that there is almost 100% compliance with that across the media.  A report that was compiled recently as part of the BAI consultation showed that the advertising of foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt decreased by 48% between 2003 and 2010.  Under the current BAI proposals, with which everyone at this meeting is familiar, cheese will be included in the advertising ban even though one in three Irish children has an inadequate calcium intake.  We believe the reason for its inclusion was the failure to lean strongly enough on data from the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance.  If we are to address childhood obesity, the point needs to be made time and again that science has to be used as part of an evidence-based approach.  The world class data from the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance, which was compiled at a cost of &euro;7 million to the Irish taxpayer, is the best data and is the envy of other countries.  It should be used when decisions on policy are being made.<\/p><p> The introduction of vending machines in our schools is a contentious issue that has been mentioned by the joint committee previously.  I am sure we will talk about it again.  I would like to say at the outset that there are no vending machines in primary schools in Ireland.  In 2005, FDII and its members established guidelines for vending machines in schools.  All relevant FDII members are complying with those voluntary guidelines.  It is worth noting that members consult school management when they are stocking products.  We have established that schools control the product mix, the introduction of vending machines and the number of machines.  It is also worth mentioning, from FDII's perspective, that most schools are stocked by third party operators.<\/p><p> The effect that any potential increase in the rate of taxation that applies to soft drinks would have on the obesity crisis is another issue that is being examined at the moment.  The evidence that taxation reduces obesity, or has any impact on obesity, is very sketchy.  The reality is that taxation will more than likely affect wealth and not health.  That has been the experience in Denmark.  It is interesting to note that Italy has rejected any proposals for food taxation.  I return to the point that all policies, regardless of their specific features, have to be balanced and have to be part of a holistic response.<\/p><p> FDII is respectfully asking this committee to recommend that the Government should lead a whole-of-society approach to childhood obesity.  We are requesting that the committee engage with the proposal that has been made by the industry on the LiveWell project.  We suggest that the committee should avoid policies that are not based on evidence and programmes that target food companies.  Education and information must form the basis for policy interventions.  We have cited the use of the data from the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance in that context.  I would like to finish by restating the commitment of Irish food companies to work with the Government to solve this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100003#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Dempsey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349945400,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dempsey for this thought-provoking presentation.

I thank all the members who are present for the interest they have shown in this crucial issue.  We believe the State is failing in its duty of care to protect the health of children.  The facts bear this out.  One in four children at primary school level is overweight or obese, as is one in five teenagers.  Those rates are rising despite the measures being taken by the food industry, as outlined by the previous speaker.  Some 23% of heart disease, which is responsible for approximately 2,000 deaths in Ireland each year, can be attributed to obesity.  If legislators do not act decisively, we face an even worse future and the prospect of a generation blighted by chronic disease, long-term ill-health and premature death.<\/p><p>  At a time when the rights of children are at the centre of the political agenda, it is extraordinary that so little is being done to protect them from the powerful environmental forces that can lead to children being overweight or obese.  Political leadership is needed.  Up to now, responsibility has been pushed to parents and children themselves.  It seems that anti-obesity measures focus mainly on what parents and children can do to reduce risk.  Media campaigns and education programmes are valuable to a point, but we need to tackle the principal driver of obesity: the ever-growing availability of cheaper, tastier and more calorific foods and beverages.  Powerful and sophisticated marketing techniques that overwhelm parental will are resulting in the excessive consumption of energy-dense and nutrient-poor products.  Policies which could tackle this damaging food environment, such as the prohibition of the marketing of junk food to children, the introduction of traffic light labelling and the taxing of unhealthy drinks and foods, have been slow to win political support.<\/p><p>  I do not wish to criticise the Department of Health or the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  They deserve much credit for the important work of the special action group on obesity, which I am sure the committee will hear all about in a few minutes, but they cannot tackle this complex societal issue on their own.  Progress can only be achieved through a whole-of-Government approach, as Mr. Dempsey suggested.  Such an approach needs to be led by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and should be given solid support from all Departments, including the economic Departments that often bat for the industry.  Rather than having to make a choice between public health and the food industry, we are required to strike a balance between the two that puts children's needs to the fore.<\/p><p>  Higher rates of people being overweight and obesity are inevitable consequences of the commercial approach of producers of high calorie, low nutrition foods and drinks.  Their primary remit is to maximise profit for their shareholders by selling as much as they can.  The commercial requirement to keep selling more and excessive consumption go hand in hand, which means that industry self-regulation cannot work.  Therefore, the Government needs to make regulations that strike a reasonable balance between industry profitability and public health.<\/p><p>  We believe there are four immediate areas of action that could bring substantial public health benefits, lead to extra revenue for the Exchequer and provide food companies with incentives to provide healthier options.  We can take fiscal measures, for example, by introducing taxes and subsidies to promote health; we can protect children from marketing tactics; we can make schools healthier and more protected environments; and we can increase physical activity.<\/p><p>  As sugar sweetened beverages have no nutritional value, taxing them cannot be regressive.  It is estimated that children who consume such drinks receive approximately 20% of their recommended daily sugar intake from them.  In its pre-budget submission, the Irish Heart Foundation is calling for a sugar sweetened beverage tax that would increase the price of such products by 20%.  In addition to its obvious health benefits, this measure could yield approximately &euro;60 million in extra revenue that we believe should be used to subsidise the food industry to provide healthier options for children in particular.  This could also provide a win-win scenario for public health and the soft drink industry.  Sugar consumption would fall and the introduction of the tax would provide an impetus for the industry to reformulate its products, avoid the tax and potentially access new markets, as well as funding subsidies for healthy produce.  We are not calling for the introduction of a fat tax in our pre-budget submission.  Instead, we are asking for the immediate prioritisation of a full regulatory impact assessment, including a health impact assessment, of such taxation.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Ms Mulvihill, will go through the other measures we are advocating.  As the Chairman said, she is the health promotion manager of the Irish Heart Foundation.  She was also a member of the national obesity task force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349945400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>The second action we are proposing today is the introduction of a restriction on the marketing to children of foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt, such as snacks, fast foods, confectionery, soft drinks and sweetened cereals.<\/p> <p>Essentially, these are most of the foods that sit on the top shelf of the food pyramid and which should only be eaten once per day.  The bombardment of messages promoting foods high in fat, sugar and salt has contributed to a shift in the balance of children's diets and it is damaging their health.<\/p><p> The potential health consequences cannot be underestimated.  A generation of children are in danger of dying younger than their parents.  This is of particular concern to us because the foundation is dealing with heart disease, the number one killer.  As Mr. Macey remarked, obesity is a major contributor to death from heart disease.  Major comprehensive and systematic reviews have led to a statement from the World Health Organization to the effect that there is robust science and research linking commercial promotion of foods and beverages to poor diets in children.  There are implications not only for obesity but for heart disease as well.  Regardless of overweight, some Irish children are undernourished.  They have a low intake of calcium, iron, folate and key vitamins, including vitamins A, C, and D, which are protective against cardiovascular disease.<\/p><p> Some 193 countries at the world health assembly adopted the World Health Organization's recommendations for members to limit children's exposure to unhealthy food marketing.  This highlights that governments should take the lead on actions and monitor and measure controls.  The current evidence warrants intervention at least on the balance of probabilities and on a precautionary scale.  It is methodologically impossible to produce incontrovertible evidence of the effects of food advertising on children but there is vast evidence available it that warrants action.<\/p><p> The spend on television advertising has been reducing but it is still the greatest spend.  For several years the foundation has called for a ban from 6 a.m. up to the 9 p.m. watershed of television advertising of foods high in fat, sugar and salt.  We are concerned that the proposed revisions for the code of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, when published, will fall short of giving adequate protection from commercial advertising, thereby missing an opportunity to implement a key legislative response identified by the World Health Organization and many other international and national public health bodies.  More children watch television between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. than during children's programming hours and the case is well made in the BAI's report by the expert working group.<\/p><p> However, marketing on television is only the tip of the iceberg.  Sponsorship of sports ranging from the Olympic Games to other sporting events and in areas where children congregate, including theme parks and recreational areas and schools, are an issue.  Packaging is an issue as well.  We are all familiar from walking down supermarket aisles of the vast array of products marketed to children with characters, cartoons, links to film and colourful, creative packaging.  Almost all provide some incentive on the packaging, whether a giveaway or associated collectibles or more extensive giveaways that can be accessed through linking to the Internet or texting.<\/p><p> The Internet is a growing area of advertising.  Techniques on the Internet include incentives and giveaways which are often linked to packaging.  Most of the links bring children into what is termed \"advergames\".  These are fun, creative very entertaining games but they are highly branded with many characters and colour and symbols of branding in evidence.  This is an area of immediate and growing concern because it is a low cost area for the industry, it is interactive and it has considerable appeal for children and young people.<\/p><p> The retail sector is another area of concern because of the placement and display of products.  Many products appealing to children are placed lower down on shelving rather than at a height for parents or adults.  Retail outlets have purchase incentives such as \"buy one, get one free\" or \"BOGOF\" as it is termed in the industry as well as other incentives.  Hallowe'en is approaching and it used to be about fruit and vegetables and nuts at the doors but now it is all about snacks and chocolate.  The retail offers are for half price and reduced price goods.  These areas are outside television and they are not controlled by regulation in the same way as television and broadcast media.  The result is constant exposure to marketing for unhealthy foods.  This normalises these products into the mainstream diet of children.  Our proposed actions include a ban on television advertisements for products high in fat, sugar and salt from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.  We continue to maintain that position.<\/p><p> The Government and whichever is the lead agency that takes responsibility for this area should monitor marketing outside of the broadcasting sphere, especially the Internet.  Parents and adults really do not know what their children are watching when they play branded games.  We recognise that the Internet is global and that collaboration with other countries is necessary as part of any response.  Perhaps we should consider actions in the retail area such as those announced by the Scottish Government last month.  These involved the redesign of supermarkets to give less prominence to foods high in fat, sugar and salt.  The authorities in Scotland have warned that if retailers and the industry do not respond then legislation will be considered.<\/p><p> We believe schools should be protected from all forms of marketing and commercial sponsorship.  More important, they should have a health promoting environment.  There is marketing in post primary schools.  I accept the remarks in the presentation from Food and Drink Industry Ireland relating to primary schools.  However, in post primary schools there are vending machines and tuck shops and so on.  There is also sponsorship of sports, sports equipment and school events.  Schools should be health promoting facilities but increasingly they are being used as marketing venues for commercial gain.  The linking of foods high in fat, sugar and salt with school activities adds a strong note of endorsement and credibility to the brand or product in question.<\/p><p> Irish Heart Foundation research from 2007 highlighted the availability of food stuffs under discussion.  Some 74% of post-primary schools provided confectionary for sale.  Confectionary is the biggest form of marketing because the packaging is part of the advertising and marketing.  Up to 45% of schools had drinks vending machines, 57% sold salty snacks and crisps and 52% sold sugary carbonated drinks.  Our research showed that many schools have become reliant on sponsorship and funding from industry to support educational or sporting equipment.  This undermines attempts by schools and the curriculum authors to promote healthy eating and healthy lifestyle.  Only 30% of post primary schools had healthy eating policies and more than 90% of schools called for a code of practice for industry sponsorship and the provision and content of vending machines.  Necessary actions include the code of practice to which I have referred.  In addition, adequate funding should be provided by the Department of Education and Skills to ensure funding for schools for computers and physical education equipment.  This point was highlighted in our research.<\/p><p> We recognise that the healthy eating guidelines are due to be published.  We welcome this and urge that it be done as soon as possible.  Schools need support to adopt a health promoting concept and this is broader than simply addressing healthy eating and vending machines.  In addition to addressing healthy eating habits and the associated culture we must ensure that the school environment supports increased opportunities for physical activity as part of any health promoting school policy.  The green schools initiative serves as a good example.  Under funding from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the smarter travel programme, funding was provided for co-ordinators.  There was huge success with the green schools intervention in respect of general health with increased activity in cycling and walking to schools.  The physical activity theme is important.  We call for increased support for physical activity.<\/p><p> Our priority suggestion is to ensure the implementation of the new physical activity plan for Ireland, which is currently in press.  It should be adequately resourced and implemented.  In 2010 we published a paper on building young hearts.  It was about physical activity and young people in the physical environment.  We carried out the project in partnership with the National Heart Alliance.  Some of the members are here today, including Dr. Catherine Woods from DCU, who was one of the main authors.  We urge the implementation of the 30 recommendations around the physical environment that can encourage our children to be more healthy.  It includes making the areas around the school more appropriate for safe walking.<\/p><p> The measures we have proposed today are endorsed by the World Health Organization and other international bodies.  Obesity is a complex area and we acknowledge that many other policies must be addressed but those outlined are our priorities for today.  We believe they are actionable immediately at little or no cost to the State and they would make a real difference.  However, we are concerned that they may not be implemented because up to now many of the initiatives proposed have been shelved or watered down due to the demands of industry.  This has not favoured the health of our children and we believe that must change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100005#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maureen Mulvihill","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349946600,"counter":589,"content":"<p>The final group is the special action group on obesity.

I am joined by Professor Donal O'Shea, Dr. Nazih Eldin from the HSE, Professor Mary Flynn from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; Dr. Cliodhna Foley-Nolan from <i>safe<\/i>food, Dr. Catherine Woods from DCU, and Sandra Barnes from the Department of Health.<\/p><p>  The levels of obesity and people being overweight have increased at alarming speeds in recent years, so much so that obesity has been termed a global epidemic by the World Health Organization.  The problem was aggravated in recent years by our changing social, economic and physical environment, a dramatic reduction in the levels of physical activity and our changing dietary patterns.  Across Europe childhood obesity is reaching epidemic proportions.  It is well known that diets excessive in energy combined with physical inactivity are the key contributors to obesity.  However, as acknowledged by previous speakers, the relationship between these factors - what promotes obesity - is complex.  We acknowledge that problem.<\/p><p>  There is no harm in reminding ourselves of some of the stark facts we face.  Various studies have shown that children as young as three years are overweight or obese and this pattern continues as children get older.  One in four seven year olds is also overweight and obese and for teenagers, the figure is one in five.  This is of concern because of both the short and long-term effects, not only in childhood but also in later life.  In the short term we are aware of conditions such as high blood sugar causing diabetes, high blood pressure which contributes to diabetes, and heart disease.  In the longer term the effects of obesity include heart disease, stroke, type II diabetes and some cancers.  These are conditions we would normally associate with people who are quite old.  To compound these effects, many overweight children grow up to become obese adults.  The prevalence of obesity in adults has risen steadily in Irish society, so much so that some 61% of the Irish adult population is either overweight or obese.  In 1998 the corresponding figure was just 44%.  This indicates a trend.<\/p><p>  We have discussed the issue of diet.  We have very good information from nutritional surveys and what these show us is that approximately 60% of infants are snacking on chocolate, biscuits and crisps between their main meals.  Approximately 40% of older children and teenagers eat sweets daily and one in four drinks fizzy drinks at least once a day.  <\/p><p>  With regard to physical activity, approximately one in four adults takes no physical activity and approximately only half of children exercise four or more times a week.  A particularly noticeable trend is that there is a fall-off in physical activity among older girls.  For example, only 10% of girls aged 15 to 17 years had exercised during the seven days previous to being asked.  The figure is a little better for boys in that one out of five had exercised.<\/p><p>  It is well recognised by the Department and the Minister that there are a number of chronic conditions related to obesity and people being overweight and that there is also an impact on physical and mental health.  The Minister established the special action group on obesity in 2011 to tackle this growing problem.  Members have met some of the representatives of the group today, but we also have representatives from other Departments such as the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills in recognition of the multisectoral element to this challenge.<\/p><p>  On what we can do, some years ago the OECD looked at the impact of obesity prevention strategies and concluded that the most efficient and effective interventions happened outside the health sector such as in education settings, the workplace, fiscal measures, food labelling and advertising.  Where the health care system has a role and has its greatest impact on obesity and related conditions is in focusing on high risk children and adults.  This is where it plays an important role.  In order to take a multisectoral approach and focus on high risk individuals, our group is liaising with Departments and organisations in a cross-sectoral approach to help halt the rise in the numbers who are overweight and obese.  The issues we are dealing with include calorie posting in restaurants, the impact of a levy on sugar sweetened drinks, the marketing of food and drink to children, the supply of products in vending machines, the detection and treatment of obesity, healthy eating guidelines and the promotion of physical activity.  These give just a flavour of the work we do.  I would like to expand briefly on one or two of these measures.<\/p><p>  We have identified calorie posting as being an important element as a means of educating the general public on the calorie content of menus.  Following public consultation and in response to the Minister having written to fast food restaurants earlier this year, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland launched a major public consultation exercise which resulted in over 3,000 responses.  This has demonstrated to us that the majority of consumers and some businesses want calorie labelling.  We welcome that support.  There is also broad support for this type of initiative and, together with the FSAI, we are working on an implementation plan.<\/p><p>  The issue of sugar sweetened drinks has been raised.  It has been estimated that these drinks contribute approximately 5% of total daily energy in the diets of Irish children.  This equates to something between 70 and 140 calories a day.  On my way here today I stopped at a shop to look at some of the high energy drinks which equate to 200 or 250 calories per can.  This year we established a steering group to conduct a health impact assessment of the health and economic aspects of introducing a levy on sugar sweetened drinks.  In the summer the Minister launched a stakeholder day.  The health impact assessment is close to completion and when completed, it will be brought to the Minister for further consideration and action.<\/p><p>  During the summer the Minister launched the healthy eating guidelines, a copy of which I have left for committee members interested in looking at them.  The guidelines are for the general population and inform people on the food and drink choices for a healthy lifestyle and set out in plain and simple language the food servings we need to maintain health and well-being.  A new emphasis is being placed on food servings from the top shelf of the food pyramid and alcohol is listed for the first time as a significant contributor to calories.  This is something of which many are not aware.  The physical activity guidelines were launched a few years ago and we are now working on a physical activity plan.  There are many good examples of local initiatives, on which we need to build.  My colleagues will be happy to provide more information in the discussion that will follow our presentation.  <\/p><p>  The issue of a broader cross-government approach was raised.  It is worth noting that the Department is developing a new health and well-being framework.  This will set out goals for improved health and well-being which are relevant for every sector and everybody's responsibility.  It will provide for new arrangements to ensure collaboration and co-operation between sectors such as children, social protection, education, housing and the environment.  Many of the determinants of health lie outside the control of the health care setting such as transportation, education, workplaces and so on.  Priority issues to be addressed under the framework will include implementing our tobacco policy and work on alcohol, nutrition and physical activity levels.  This year we are also starting a new health and well-being survey which will allow us to measure in much more detail health and lifestyle trends across the adult population.  We include in this children from as young as 15 years upwards.<\/p><p>  The trends in obesity and people being overweight are a major source of concern.  In Ireland, as in other countries, we have crossed a threshold where chronic diseases have become a challenge as great, if not greater, as those posed by communicable diseases approximately one decade ago.  The rising burden of chronic disease is very much due to behavioural factors.  It is due to what we eat, how we exercise, whether we smoke and high levels of alcohol consumption, all of which is amenable to prevention.  The focus in the SAGO is to build on those actions previously identified, the good work done by the obesity task force a number of years ago, various health promotion strategies and the cardiovascular strategy laid out two years ago which set out clear nutrition and exercise targets.  We want to move forward on all of these through our work.  <\/p><p>  A slide was presented on the complexity of obesity and the range of measures involved.  The question raised was whether we were singling out a particular measure over another.  The answer is no.  We believe no single measure will reverse the trend in people being overweight and obese and that a combination of measures will make a difference in dealing with this challenging public health issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Devlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1349947200,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Devlin, for your sobering and challenging presentation.

We should be trying to design something that makes it easy for people to do the right thing and difficult for them to do the wrong thing.  It is some time since we discussed the role of pricing for unhealthy food and drink versus pricing for the healthy alternatives.  The food and drink industry spokesperson did not encourage that approach and has argued that it is a wealth measure and not a health measure and has pointed out that much work is being done by food production companies.  The problem is, as the evidence from others proves, that what is happening at present is not working.  We are not succeeding so we must examine what we are doing at present.  We need to do more and we need to make sure we are doing the right thing.  <\/p><p>  I was surprised at the statement from the Irish Heart Foundation that it wants to study the proposal for taxing high-fat, high-salt and high-sugar foods and subsidising more healthy foods because I would have thought that it has been fairly well studied already.  I also would have thought that there is a fair amount of political support for such a measure.  Perhaps I misunderstood what the foundation was suggesting and if so, I ask for clarification.  <\/p><p>  There was no reference in the presentations to children playing computer games.  It is my experience, and that of many other parents, that it is easy enough to get children away from television but once they are hooked on computer games, it can be extremely difficult to get them outdoors. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100008#G00500","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1349947200,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his brevity.

We have had many deliberations already about the need for a multi-faceted approach to this problem.  Part of me worries that we are over-analysing and over-complicating the problem.  I never thought I would refer to Ms Ann Widdicombe in this context, but she said that she would love to write a book on obesity  and losing weight but the only problem was that the book would only have four words - exercise more, eat less.  While it is very important that we analyse the issues involved, we must remember the fundamentals underpinning this.<\/p><p>  While I welcome much of the presentation from the food and drink industry and its positivity, I found it very difficult to see the tangible actions that the industry proposes to deal with the problem.  Reference was made to active engagement, partnership and so forth and we all agree that working together is important.  I would like to hear a little more on what the industry proposes we should do, apart from labelling.  <\/p><p>  Given my background, I am particularly concerned about advertising and marketing to children.  Reference was made to a voluntary reduction in such advertising and I would like to know where that figure came from.  Who conducted the research?  We all know that with voluntary codes the good companies sign up while those at whom the codes are aimed do not, with the result that we do not solve the problem.  Unfortunately, to get things done, we all need deadlines and we all need to feel someone is looking over our shoulder.  I fully support the advertising ban and believe the Irish Heart Foundation is being quite moderate in asking for the ban to be in place from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. I would go further.  <\/p><p>  The argument about cheese is being used as a red herring in the debate.  It is all about moderation.  Certainly there are some wonderful Irish cheeses on the market but the issue is about cheese products directly aimed at children.  Such products are highly processed and include squeezy and stringy cheeses.  Where is the nutritional value in such products?  We need to be a little careful with some of the red herrings in the argument.  Of course a balanced diet is essential but we must look at the specific products that are causing concern.  I am interested in the view of the Irish Heart Foundation on the question of cheese because it is constantly raised in debates with this committee.  <\/p><p>  I note that in the foundation's presentation it is argued that only 20% of children consume the recommended amounts of fruit and vegetables.  The special action group on obesity reminded us of data from the Growing Up In Ireland Survey from 2011 which found that one in four children, as young as three, are overweight or obese.  That is a startling fact.  We must demystify this whole discussion and get down to the basics.  We can have an ongoing debate the issue of obesity but the fact that this generation of children will have a shorter life span than their parents means that we, as decision makers and legislators, must act.  <\/p><p>  Including a calorie count on menus is an excellent idea and can inform one's choices and influence one's eating decisions.  However, I was surprised when I was in New York during the summer to discover that a restaurant must have 15 branches before it is required to list calories on its menus.  We are often told that New York is doing it and so should we but there is a cost to restaurants.  How does the delegation suggest we tackle that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100008#G00700","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1349947200,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming here today.  When I was canvassing during the general election campaign 19 months ago I  could not help but notice the number of people who were overweight or obese.  I said to myself at the time that if I could do something to help such people, I would.  The problem is alarming.<\/p><p>  I congratulate the Minister for setting up the special action group and some of the solutions put forward are excellent.  However, since I have entered politics I have heard a lot of talking but have seen very little action.  We could talk about this morning, noon and night.  I can go into the Chamber and listen, for four or five hours, to all the solutions in the world but there is no action.  There are a lot of clever individuals here today and we should all try to work together.  I am just an ordinary Joe Soap but I am willing to help.  I attended the local Novena this morning in Dundalk and the priest said that while Ireland may not have any money, 60% of our population is involved in voluntary work, which is wonderful.  Let us all work together on this.  <\/p> <p> People do not understand how bad obesity is.  Many people come to my clinic looking for help.  I would be keen to give them help, but those best placed to provide help are across the table from me now.  They are the experts.

This is more important than any referendum.  We are investing money.  Reference was made to taxes and so on but why not send one of these leaflets to every household in Ireland?

A comment was made about the cosy relationship.  It is fair to say we have our differences with the industry with regard to advertising and how it should be marketed and we make our own submissions in that respect.  That process is still under way so we cannot determine what the outcome will be.  That is being done through the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  We are holding strong on the watershed and especially with regard to those foods high or on the top shelf of the food pyramid.  We believe there should be restrictions for these.  The booklet outlines that certain foods, especially those on the top shelf, have no nutritional value.  Unfortunately, this is where most of the advertising takes place.  We would prefer to see more advertising in respect of fruit and vegetables and so on.  Many of the products advertised are not consistent with our healthy eating policy.  We work closely with the industry with regard to potential solutions in this area.  We have differences with regard to the desirability or otherwise of a sugar and sweetened drinks levy.  It is fair to say there are different perspectives on that.  This is why we have conducted a thorough health impact assessment and we will be reporting soon to the Minister with all the impacts relating to health and the burden of disease and obesity as well as the other potential impacts relating to trade and employment and so on.

I will pass to my to colleagues in the front row.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Devlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349947800,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee and I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for his comments on our leaflet.  I reassure him that this leaflet has gone out from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to all general practitioners, dieticians and all practice nurses.  It is a guide for health professionals.  Unfortunately, when the people read the information in the booklets and then try to buy food, problems arise.  Often there are problems with portion sizes.  In most cases one muffin would do for a family of five and it should be divided up in that way.  This is where calorie posting comes in.  We know what occurred in the United States: Kentucky Fried Chicken introduced grilled chicken for the first time on the back of calorie posting.  We know that outlets selling cakes and biscuits have begun to reduce or introduce portion sizes with which we were all familiar in the 1970s.  However, when we show them to people, they think we are referring to portions for children.  They think a certain bottle of Coke is a dinky.  We are used to portion sizes that have doubled and trebled.   This has been highlighted in the booklet.<\/p><p>  At the moment, because of the recession, food service outlets are hanging on by their fingernails.  We know this is a reality.  People running restaurants are not taking salaries and unemployment is affecting people severely in this area as well as in the construction area.  How do we do it?  Legislation was introduced in New York and consideration is being given to rolling out the legislation throughout the USA.  They have suggested that the proposal of making calorie posting mandatory should apply to outlets with 20 or more branches and it would be cost-effective to do so.  If one goes to the trouble of analysing recipes and standardising portion sizes, one could spread it among 20 outlets, and that is a good idea.  At the moment in Ireland this is done on a voluntary basis.  I thank the Minister for Health for highlighting the problem.  There were outlets operating here which had posted calories in their outlets in other jurisdictions but were not doing so here.  As a result of the intervention, we have had a change overnight, and that is welcome.<\/p><p>  I am a dietician but I did not know that there were 1,200 calories in a big box of popcorn that one might buy at the cinema.  Such a box contains the equivalent of seven bags of popcorn.  Something strange happens to humans.  When we are given such food in a box, we eat it and then we go home and decide that we only had popcorn and that we will still eat a dinner.  However, somehow if we open bags of popcorn and begin to eat them, we stop after three bags and we would probably decide that we did not need dinner.  We need these stops.<\/p><p>  The most wonderful thing about calorie posting was the reaction from the population to the whole initiative.  From a total of more than 3,000 consumers, some 96% responded.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland was overwhelmed by the reaction to the public consultation.  It was the biggest reaction we ever had.  I could not believe it but 96% of consumers suggested putting calories on everything in all outlets because they wanted to know.  That was the first time we saw such a reaction.  It was not from the top down or from the authority trying to do certain things but from the bottom up and it involved people who are overweight.<\/p><p>  No one wants to be overweight and they all want a solution.  I have worked in Canada, the Middle East, Britain and for most of my life in Ireland, and I have never met anyone who wants to be overweight.  Everyone wants a solution.  Deputy Colreavy is absolutely right about the need to make the healthy option the easy option.  We need a partnership with the food and drink organisations.  I have never met anyone in the food and drink organisations who has wanted to make anyone obese.  They want to make a fast buck and a profit.  It is about setting up a framework such that we all get to where we want to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100009#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1349947800,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a comment about a possible solution.

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is trying to come up with a solution involving an easy-to-use computer programme and establishing a related training programme that restaurateurs could use.

It is worth noting the complexities associated with the construction and transmission of price and the whole area of margin in the food chain.  This has been evidenced in recent days by 20,000 farmers protesting outside the gates of Leinster House on Tuesday last and by some of the job losses in the last day or so.  There are significant issues relating to the asymmetrical transmission of price along the supply chain, that is, the ability of different players in the chain to recover costs.  Much of that has to do with increased volatility in commodity prices.  That, in large part, has to do with the disappearance of the managed market scenario we have had in the EU for the last number of decades.  Agriculture prices and food prices are normalising towards global levels and this is introducing a significant amount of additional volatility.<\/p><p>  It is also worth noting that the commodity that has jumped the most in the last year or two is sugar, which has gone from &euro;400 per tonne to &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,250 per tonne on the spot market.  From a production planning perspective, it would be incorrect to consider sugar a cheap nutrient in terms of price or availability and security of supply.<\/p><p>  Food companies are not completely obsessed with profit.  In this country, the net profit margins of the consumer foods arms of publicly quoted companies are in low single figures.  At primary level, primary dairy processors and meat processors are probably working between 1% and 2% profit margins.  That is the reality.<\/p><p>  The final price is set by the retailer.  Resale price maintenance is banned under competition law.  Food companies and food suppliers have no part to play in the price the consumer ultimately pays.  We already have a tax differential.  The 23% standard rate of VAT applies to a small number of food products. They are, typically, the ones in question, including confectionery, soft drinks and cakes.  There is already a 23% differential between them and all other food products, which are zero rated. <\/p><p>  In the consumer price index, food and non-alcoholic beverages now account for approximately 11% of consumer spend, compared with roughly 25% in the 1980s.  This has had a huge impact along the food supply chain.  Food is a highly regulated sector, and correctly so, with regard to food safety and so on.  All of these costs have had to be absorbed at production and processing level.  These costs are highly relevant to this overall discussion. <\/p><p>  In Denmark, where a saturated fat tax was introduced approximately one year ago, there is now cross-party support for the removal of the tax because of its impact on a number of areas, particularly the economic area.  It has driven cross-border shopping into Germany.  We had a similar issue here two or three years ago with Northern Ireland.  Work done by the Central Statistics Office and the Department of Finance suggested a cost in the region of &euro;800 million from that.  Denmark has also withdrawn proposals for the introduction of an additional sugar tax.  Similarly, in Italy a range of taxation measures are being examined as part of that country's austerity programme but the Italian Government has pulled back from introducing a tax of that sort.<\/p><p>  Senator van Turnhout mentioned stringy cheese and the fact it is highly processed.

Each of us on this side of the room is actively making contributions but our contributions are fragmented.  Even within the food industry each company is pursuing a different way to make a contribution.  That is why we talk about a whole-of-society approach.  To do the right thing, all the players must make a contribution.<\/p> <p>There is probably a case to be made for more co-ordination.

It means that the people who have not made the effort to be part of the voluntary code ask why they should participate in it.  We need to encourage all companies to get involved and that can be done by means of a whole-society response.<\/p><p>  My colleague has spoken about the cheese argument.  This is always being raised because it is an example of the BAI's approach, which was to take a nutrient profile model from the English situation and to transpose it onto the Irish situation.  There are other products, apart from cheese, that will also be restricted in their advertising and which, in our view, should not be restricted.  However, the cheese advertising is being raised because this is a very political issue in Ireland.  As I said earlier, one in three children have calcium deficiency.  If we had used the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance, IUNA, data, we would have identified that issue and we would have been able to use Irish data to change the system to suit the Irish population.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of soft drinks, Senator Crown put it very well at last week's meeting that no product is bad in moderation and no product is safe in excess.  Despite the comments made about soft drinks, IUNA shows they only contribute approximately 2% of energy for Irish children and 60% of the population does not consume soft drinks.  We are considering the introduction of a national tax across the whole population when 60% of the people do not even consume soft drinks.  I ask what impact this measure will have on obesity in the medium or long term.  I use this example to highlight a point that we need to target our interventions.  The Live Well project has been the subject of much discussion between the industry and other groups.  We think that project will be a very tangible step forward in how industry and government can work together on this issue.  It would not be the place of the industry to decide on the programme for the children because by doing so, the programme would be discredited.  We want to work with the relevant agencies on deciding what is the correct intervention.<\/p><p>  In reply to Professor Flynn's statement, the food pyramid and physical activity plan are in place and the healthy eating guidelines will be in place soon.  Those documents are the basis for a societal response but, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, they might not get out there.

In reply to Deputy Colreavy's question, the pricing measures for obesity are not about income generation but rather about behavioural change.  There is talk about stealth tax.  I understand that the income to be raised from any such taxes would be modest.  We must look to behavioural change which is how patterns of consumption are changed.  I acknowledge the argument that these measures are economically regressive and will affect poorer people more.  In terms of health, I would consider these measures to be progressive.  I refer to the concept that only 2% of energy comes from sugar-sweetened drinks.  This figure is 20% for those who consume those drinks.  A small number may consume these drinks but 20% of their energy intake comes from those drinks.  Therefore, the tax only affects those who consume and it will hit them more.  They are also in the lower socio-economic group so it is financially regressive in that sense, but their health gain is magnified, so it is progressive in health terms.  The committee members are the legislators and they must decide.  It is about behavioural change and progress in health terms.  We then must examine the knock-on impact and how we make up the difference to those who are more affected.<\/p><p>  I liked Senator van Turnhout's comment on the red herring which introduced fish into the cheese debate.  There should be no more mention of cheese.  It is on the third shelf of the food pyramid and it is nutritious.  We are talking about the top shelf of the food pyramid and cheese should be out of the argument.<\/p><p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked how to help the constituent who is clearly in trouble and whose children are also physically struggling but on a smaller scale.  That demands the kind of measures that have been discussed and it demands partnership and knocking our heads together.  It also demands treatment.  I would love to see Senator Crown stand over a prevention of cancer programme that involves no treatment.  At the moment that is what we have in Ireland.  We are talking about prevention but Deputy Fitzpatrick and others can offer practically nothing to the constituent who walks in the door.  That situation has to change.  One of the recommendations I would love to see as a result of today's meeting would be that prevention is the way forward but we must be able to treat our obese kids and adults and that is not happening at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100011#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal O'Shea"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349949000,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I wish to respond to Deputy Colreavy's question about our position on fat tax.

The zero rate is applied to foods such as frozen chips, pizza and chocolate spread.  We are calling for those anomalies to be removed in the next budget.  In the future we will be very strong proponents of a fat tax.  However, we try to base everything we do on the available evidence.  We believe there are very compelling reasons for the introduction of a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages if the interests of our children are to the fore.  There is some evidence about unintended consequences of fat tax, such as people may move from a high fat diet to a high salt diet.  There needs to be some clarification at this point.

I wish to add to what the Chairman asked about how to identify foods from the top shelf and how to create a more informed consumer.  Allied to the calorie count on menus in catering establishments, the Irish Heart Foundation, along with many public health allies both here and across Europe, has called for a traffic light coding system on the front of packs.<\/p> <p>This would allow customers to see, at a glance, whether a product is high in fat, sugar and salt.  The new regulations being introduced in 2014 include provisions relating to back-of-pack data.

Guideline daily amount information is permitted on the front of pack, but numbers are more complex to read and take more time to process.  We have proposed, in the context of the debate on this issue at the European Parliament, that a combination of GDA information and traffic light coding would be the most effective.

The challenge we are facing is well summed up in the following statement in the document by Food and Drink Industry Ireland: \"Childhood obesity is a hugely complex multi-faceted problem that requires a 'whole of society' response.\"  Clearly, we are all in agreement on this.  It is my view that wealth is health - the more money one has, the more open one is to reading food packaging in the supermarket and the greater one's ability to identify the nutritional value of the products one puts on the kitchen table.  Some parents, particularly in poorer areas, may find this more challenging.  Like most women, I go to the supermarket every weekend and, I confess, often pay little attention to back-of-pack information.  I am usually rushing home to do something else or to canvass or deliver leaflets.  The booklet the delegates have produced is excellent.  It would be very helpful to me, as a public representative, if I were permitted to reprint some of that information in the public leaflets I distribute to communities on a regular basis.  This is a concrete way in which public representatives can contribute to promoting awareness of the issues we are discussing.  If the delegates' permission is forthcoming, I will be happy to do so.<\/p><p>  The booklet advises that a portion of meat or fish should be the size of the palm of one's hand.  The problem that springs immediately to mind here is cost.  In advance of this meeting, I conducted a review of prices in shops in my local area yesterday.  The cost of a small piece of fish, I found, was &euro;3 to &euro;4.  That cost would be difficult to cover for a person with five or six children, particularly those, including social welfare recipients, with very small budgets.  My survey showed that a package of cooking fat cost 48 cent compared with &euro;3 to &euro;6 for a bottle of oil.  We must take  realistic approach in all of this, and the reality is that the people suffering most from obesity are those living in poorer areas and struggling to survive on a daily basis.  My local butcher told me yesterday that his best-selling product is the cheapest cut of mince, followed by chicken, which includes not just the breast fillet but the small fillet that comes off the back of the bird and from which one must remove the innards.  Looking at bread prices, meanwhile, I found an 80 cent difference between the cost of a white and brown sliced pan.  This is where the problem lies for the poorer sections of our society.<\/p><p>  My children attended a local school in Goldenbridge where the principal, Mrs. Carmel Solan, developed a healthy eating policy some 25 years ago.  The rule that children would not be allowed through the door with crisps or chocolate bars had a significant positive impact on the lifestyle of many young people.  At the weekends, Mrs. Solan would purchase, out of her own pocket, bags of apples, oranges and bananas in order to ensure that every children would have some nutritious food every day.  This was long before initiatives such as breakfast clubs.<\/p><p>  I read some interesting statistics in a book which landed on my desk this morning.

Moreover, it is predicted that by 2015, 1.5 billion will have died.  Meanwhile, the global diet industry commands a gross annual profit of &euro;13.9 billion.  Some of the answers to disordered and unhealthy eating can be found by an examination of that industry.  I have young teenagers who, although very slim, are always on crash diets which require them to restrict their food choices severely.<\/p><p>  Ultimately, however, the buck stops with parents and it is vital that they have control over what is in their cupboards.  My six year old does not decide how my cupboards are restocked at the weekend.  As I have said, however, pricing is an important element in this.  What is happening in poorer areas is that parents are going for the easier-fix solution.  People are buying bags of frozen chips and everything else, or a can of carrots instead of peeling three carrots into a pot to cook them.  Education is vital if we are to achieve a change in behaviours.  I realise that resources are extremely restricted, but would the delegates consider running a television advertising campaign based on the information contained in the booklet?  Television is the most effective medium through which to get any message across because it has very high penetration across all groups, in both poor and rich areas.<\/p><p>  I am not a fan of McDonalds but when I went to a birthday party there last week I found it was standing room only.

Dr. Donal O'Shea has spoken about the many difficulties that arise in tackling childhood obesity.  I would not like to turn up at Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick's clinic unless I knew my weight was in the acceptable range.  I have been on crash diets myself, starving myself to lose a pound or two.  As an ex-school principal, I am aware that children are entering school already overweight.  In fact, as Dr. Eldin said, increasing numbers of babies are born overweight.  I will not say what weight my children were when they were born - suffice to say, they were huge babies.  Such children are facing a battle from the very beginning.  I agree with Deputy Catherine Byrne that it is a difficult problem for parents to tackle, especially if they do not have the money to purchase more expensive cuts of meat and so on.<\/p><p>  I applaud the principal to whom Deputy Byrne referred who brought in apples and oranges for pupils.  What is required, however, is a deeper engagement by schools which should begin with training for teachers on nutrition.  There is a great deal of misleading labelling and misinformation on what is meant by \"low fat\" and other descriptors.  This type of information must be included as part of teacher training so that it can then be incorporated into the curriculum.  It is vital, of course, that any such initiative is implemented sensitively.  We all know that overweight children are vulnerable to bullying.  Teachers will be aware that they must not be seen, in imparting information to students, to be pointing their finger at the boy or girl whose weight is way beyond the healthy range.  Visits by district nurses offer a good opportunity to educate parents regarding healthy eating.<\/p><p>  Mr. Macey referred to the necessity of striking a balance between industry profitability and public health.  The industry representatives made strong arguments and referred, for example, to the farmers who protested last week.  The food produced in this country is of a very high nutritional quality.  The problem arises when it undergoes processing and the sauce, salt and everything else is added.  The challenges facing the industry must be set against the huge public health issue we are facing.  Dr. Donal O'Shea has warned that there is a diabetes epidemic coming down the track which will cost millions, if not billions, of euro to address.  That must be taken on board.<\/p> <p>As Mr. Macey stated, there must be a balanced approach.  As legislators, we must look at it in that light.<\/p><p> I thank our guests for their really interesting presentations.

As a former teacher, I am very much aware of the limits of education in getting through to people.  It is only part of what is required.  We must ban the advertising of unhealthy foods to children.  In Sweden there is a general ban on advertising all products - not just foods - to children.  This is because advertising is regarded as an abuse of children who are not so well able to assess what they see and hear in advertisements.

At our previous meeting I indicated that I had undergone a road-to-Damascus like conversion on the dietary front approximately 12 years ago, which resulted in my losing in the region of 25 kg.  I have largely managed to keep that weight off in the intervening period.  My experience gave me an appreciation of the difficulties involved, the skills necessary and what needed to be done.  The more important issue, however, is the realisation that people in the profession, particularly those within my specialty, were horrifically ill-informed on the importance of diet.  There was nowhere near enough education on dietary issues in the past.<\/p><p>  I emerged from years and years of oncology training and experience to become a moderately involved breast cancer specialist on the international stage, but it is only in the past few years that the penny has been dropping with those in my profession on the importance of diet from the point of view of cancer prevention.  I do not just refer to diet in this regard but also to obesity and its various causes.  I will not discuss all of the details, but I can point out that almost all of the common cancers that are not caused by cigarette smoking tend to have an increased incidence in those who are obese or whose intake of calories is too great.  There are even data which suggest that if one has had cancer, the chances of it returning in a lethal secondary form are higher if one is obese following one's diagnosis.  As a result of this, I spend a great deal of time discussing diet with my patients.  I was doing a rough estimate and reckon that I take 20 dietary histories a week and make the same number of attempts at some kind of dietary intervention for patients whom I identify as being obese.  I do so without specialist support for my conclusions.  If someone looks obese and I know his or her actual weight, I will discuss his or her diet with him or her.<\/p><p>  The results of my efforts in this regard are surprising.  My patients are not children; most but not all are middle-aged women.  They will often wring their hands and inform me that they cannot understand their failure to lose weight.  They state they eat healthily, do not consume fatty foods and only eat modest amounts of bread, etc.  When one takes their histories, one comes to realise that while there are foods which are more likely to make one gain weight - a previous speaker alluded to this and I pointed it out last week - there is no food that is safe if one eats too much of it.  Likewise, I really believe there is no food that is dangerous if it is eaten in strict moderation.  People must understand that merely eliminating sugar and fatty foods from their diets will not prove sufficient, particularly if they are eating four spuds or a great big plate of rice or pasta every night.  In many of the patients I see the latter are the principal culprits.  My patients are women who, because they have had cancer, buy into the idea of avoiding extraneous chemicals.  As a result, they stay away from processed foods and soft drinks.  None of this probably makes that much difference to one's risk of cancer if one is consuming too many unhealthy foods - to the point where one has become obese - and one's daily calorie intake is too high.  This provides some indication of the challenge we face.<\/p><p>  The primary strategies we should adopt should focus on education and regulation.  I would be grateful if Dr. O'Shea indicated whether he is of the view that we are spending enough time educating young doctors in matters of nutrition.  It is my opinion that we are not doing so.  Other than stopping people smoking, the single most important action we could take to decrease the death rate from cancer 30 years from now would be to curb calorie intake.  This would have a greater impact than anything we do in the context of screening or treatment.  I support Dr. O'Shea in his comments on the lack of treatment.  I do not know what is the current position, but when I inquired a few years ago, he indicated that there was a two to three year wait for people to be seen at his clinic and that there was a corresponding wait for the minority of patients who required bariatric surgery.  I commented previously that if abortion were available in this country, there would be a ten month waiting list.  In that context, a health system which obliges patients to wait three to four years to be assessed and then a further three to four years to be treated is profoundly abnormal.  This speaks to the need for a fundamental reform of the health system and the removal of responsibility for managing it from those who currently run it.<\/p><p>  As we move forward, we must educate doctors, teachers and parents who need to get the message that systematically malnourishing their children - I am not referring to undernourishing them - and giving them the wrong foods is a form of neglect.  In extreme cases, it is a form of child abuse.  The traffic light idea has much to recommend it and if there are some foods which are utterly devoid of nutritional value and contain large amounts of calories - people may continue to consume these foods because they have a low-level addiction to them - they should be the subject of special treatment and there should be a total ban on their being advertised.  A similar and complete ban should be introduced on advertising alcohol.  Social pressure of this nature can work.  The debate in which we engaged in respect of people smoking in cars in which children are present has had some effect.  This is now something which people are reluctant to do.<\/p><p>  In the incentivising good behaviour and disincentivising bad behaviour I intend to bring before the committee in the near future a proposal to make the entire Leinster House campus a smoke-free zone.  I know Deputy Michael Colreavy who referred to this matter will support me in that regard.<\/p><p>  I am not so certain about using taxation measures to deal with this issue.  The idea of taxing people to modify their behaviour is one about which I am somewhat uncomfortable.  I do not understand why poor parents who provide their children with proper nourishment six days a week and then take them out on the seventh day to see a movie and have a \"Big Mac\" should pay more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100013#M01000","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1349950200,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I apologise that I was not present for many of the contributions.  It is ironic that as I was attending the launch of the Global Hunger Index 2012, at which reference was made to children in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia being underweight and malnourished, the committee was deliberating on childhood obesity in Ireland.<\/p> <p> Dr. Eldin made an important point about breast-feeding.  He is correct that a baby-friendly environment will help to improve the uptake of breast-feeding.  The single biggest step that could improve our breast-feeding uptake in this country would be to allow public health nurses to have the time to assist new parents with breast-feeding, especially in the first couple of days after they come home from hospital.  The difficulty at the moment is that they do not have the time.  As a result of that breast-feeding numbers will begin to fall rather than increase.<\/p><p> I will give an example of what is happening at the moment because of the cutbacks.  One woman wanted to contact the breast-feeding specialist as she had a particular problem on a Tuesday.  The message she got is that she could contact the breast-feeding specialist between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Thursday.  By Thursday, she was bottle-feeding the baby.  That is the challenge that currently exists.  It is a simple thing.  We have the professionals and the know-how and we have women who are willing to breast-feed but they need support and basic time would make a significant difference in that regard.<\/p><p> The biggest single challenge to the food industry currently is information.  If one were to ask the committee members what is their target calorie intake, very few would know it.  We must address the issue.  People know what foods are healthy and what foods are not healthy but they do not know what should be their target calorie intake on a daily basis.  Such information would assist people.  Deputy Byrne&rsquo;s point about price was correct but it is also a matter of information and convenience.  We must make healthier choices the easy choice for people to make.  A campaign was run two weeks ago by Bord Bia in which a cookbook was distributed in one of the national newspapers on wholesome foods.  Many of those dishes were quick and easy to prepare.  Much more focus must go into the area.<\/p><p> Portion size is a big challenge for the restaurant industry.  One can go to a restaurant with healthy options on the menu but when one asks for the children&rsquo;s menu one finds chicken nuggets and chips and sausages and chips.  In some restaurants it is nearly impossible to get a half portion of the adult dishes.  The only option is the unhealthy choice for children.  The adults can have the healthy choice but not the children for some bizarre reason.  More must be done to assist the restaurant industry in that regard.  It is a matter of information for them as well.  In fairness to the FSAI and the Nutrition and Health Foundation, they are doing much work in that area.<\/p><p> Labelling is a significant challenge for us because one sees food products advertised as 95% fat free, which means that they are 5% fat, which is a significant amount of fat.  How it is being advertised, promoted and labelled is a big part of the problem.  There is much merit in looking at an amalgamation of GDA and traffic light labelling to provide people with clear choices because if they had the choice people would make the decision if the product is cost competitive.  When they do not have the basic information it is difficult to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100013#M01100","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349950800,"counter":635,"content":"<p>Listening to the discussion shows the complexity of the issues.  Deputy Byrne&rsquo;s first point related to the inequality dimension of the issue.  We are conscious of that.  It is something we would like to discuss with the industry in terms of what we can do also.  It does start in the home.  I do not like to use the term an \"obesegenic environment\" but the committee will know what I mean in that everywhere we go we see food outlets and when one turns on the television there is a considerable amount of food advertising directed not at adults but at children, in particular those under the age of eight who cannot make cognitive decisions as to whether a food is good or bad for them.  They will not look at the back of the pack and work out the GDA to see whether it is within the recommended daily calorific intake.  One has to deal with all of those issues.<\/p><p>  In terms of the tools and levers available to us, we must consider education and what more we can do.  We have produced healthy eating guidelines but the fact that the committee did not know about them shows that perhaps there is more we can do even though we have produced tens of thousands of booklets.  We would welcome the support of the committee in making them more available.  It is true that we do not have a large social marketing campaign so we must be innovative in terms of how we get our message across.  Meetings such as this one are helpful.<\/p><p>  Deputy Dowds made a point about regulation.  There is a hierarchy of approach and we like to try to start with education and awareness.  Co-regulation might be a good approach but regulation must be at the top of the scale.  A good example is caloric posting.  The Minister indicated that we will start on a voluntary basis and try to rope in as many restaurants as we can.  We will try to be practical in our approach.  We will start with restaurants that have menus that run for more than 30 days.  We are not talking about zooming in on the one restaurant that produces a single menu every night and the difficulty in that regard.  We are trying to be practical but if we perceive the process is not working on a voluntary basis regulation is somewhere at the back of our minds.  All of these levers are available to us.  It is not just education and regulation.  Pricing is important.  I did not want to let the remark slide in case anyone felt that many countries in Europe are going away from the notion of a sugar tax or a fat tax.  Many other countries are considering introducing it.  The matter is very much on the EU agenda at the moment in terms of looking and learning from the experiences of other countries.  This is a work in progress.  The EU is very interested in what we are doing in this country about a health impact assessment.  It is the first of its kind in the world.  We will be able to learn a lot from it and we will also be able to export our learning not just to the European Union but also to the World Health Organization which is interested in seeing what happens.<\/p><p>  The availability of foods and products must be taken into account as well.  The point was made about whether we should segregate unhealthy foods, which would be challenging but it is one of many things that have to be considered in the same way as the approach we took to our alcohol policy.  Senator Crown referred to people eating healthy food.  It is all very fine eating a healthy chicken but a bottle of wine on top of it negates the overall effect in terms of what one is trying to achieve with calorie intake and a healthy diet.<\/p><p>  A number of references were made to physical education.  I will ask Dr. Woods to speak about some of the things happening in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100014#N00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Devlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349950800,"counter":636,"content":"<p>There are two sides to every coin.  I have heard a lot of discussion around nutrition and a lack of discussion on physical activity.  I wish to draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the fact that 86% of primary and post-primary school children are insufficiently active to benefit their current and protect their future health.  One could ask why that is important.  It is important because physical activity will protect one&rsquo;s heart and lungs, develop mental capacity and allow one to perform better in school and it will help one in social circumstances.  It will also address obesity.  It is a behaviour that has massive health consequences if not adhered to.  Inactivity &ndash; sitting - as we are all doing right now and have been for some time, is the fourth leading risk factor for premature mortality in the world.  We need intervention.  Dr. Eldin referred to the physical activity plan, which I urge members to read.  It explains exactly how we might go about addressing the problem of inactivity in a concrete way where we use a multi-sectoral approach but it tells us how to do it using evidence from around the world.  We have consulted with the WHO and everybody on the issue.<\/p><p>  Intervention is needed on children.  One could ask why and where it is needed.  It is needed because of high levels of inactivity but we can do it in the home.  The vision in the plan is that children are born into active families with active brothers and sisters, active parents and active aunts and uncles.  The vision in the plan is that there would be an increase in the frequency and quality of physical education in the school, where only 10% of primary and post-primary children get the recommended minutes of physical education every week.<\/p> <p>It recommends that breaktimes, in a whole-of-school approach, are long enough that children do not need to eat their lunches quickly and have time to go out and play.  They learn and develop all the decision making skills and social skills on the pitch that are important for the education of our children.  We want interventions in communities with speed limits that allow children to walk and cycle to school safely.  We want footpaths and cycle lanes, and coaches who are trained in how to work with children.  We should put children first and sport second every so often, with increases in participation in recreation.  We want professionals who advocate for a physical activity world.  We do this in a unified way through a national plan through which education talks to health and transport, so to speak, to ensure that when a child leaves his or her home every decision is thought about and active choices are made, which are the easy choices.<\/p><p> Deputy Byrne referred to the principal and her healthy eating vision.  Would it not be wonderful if that vision was also to do with physically active children?  Being active was part of what we were when we left school, as well as acquiring our junior or leaving certificates or other skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100014#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Catherine Woods","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349951400,"counter":638,"content":"<p>Do any of the witnesses believe that, historically, people's concern about eating disorders in young people, especially young girls, made them shy away from discussing and tackling weight?

They could stand up in class for half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the afternoon.  We know that standing is a form of exercise compared to sitting and there are many classes which would lend themselves to that, in which people could stand while holding a book rather than sit a desk.

The personal responsibility comment from Deputy Byrne is critical.  One of the big problems is that parents do not recognise their child is overweight until it is too late.  By the time they recognise it they are in serious trouble, as the child has an 80% chance of being obese as an adult because if it is let happen it tracks, so to speak.<\/p><p>  To respond to Deputy Naughten, the role of the public health nurse in breast-feeding and monitoring will be critical.  Currently, we weigh children up to the age of four.  That is done historically because of under-nutrition.  The problem now is over-nutrition.  We stop weighing them at the age of four but we must continue doing that and tell the parents that their child is on track or a little over but they should keep it steady because they will grow into it.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Dowds's question about banning advertising of unhealthy foods and letting the industry promote healthy options for every unhealthy option they advertise, that is part of the bigger industry health collaboration.

If industry were to promote Dr. Flynn's guidelines from the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, that combination would be magic.<\/p><p>  To respond to Senator Crown's point on professional regulation and professional education, one of the recommendations of the obesity task force in 2005 was that education about nutrition and obesity would be embedded into nursing, medicine and all allied health.

Professor O'Shea will take diet histories but they will be heavily influenced by under-reporting because we make people so uncomfortable about the whole issue of overweight and obesity they do not tell the truth about what they eat.<\/p><p>  I have a concern about the focus on obesity.  We must be careful and take people to task in this regard.  When there is anything in the media about obesity the most unflattering photographs of women and children they can find are made public.

Before we go forward with any campaign we should ask overweight men, women and children if it would encourage them to take action because if it makes them feel like hiding under a rock or burying their heads in the sand it will not do any good.  There should be a call to action about the fear of fatness.  We need to include the body image and be aware that we make people feel ashamed.  Parents are terrified that somebody will say their child is obese or overweight because of what it says about them.  We need to understand that psychological aspect to it.<\/p><p>  We did research from the mid-1990s up to the early 2000s in which 19% of our transition year students said they would smoke to keep down their weight.  They said they had started smoking and would continue to smoke to keep down their weight.  That is how terrified they are of putting on weight, and that is not within the eating disorders group.  We were surprised that 15% said they induced vomiting as a weight loss strategy.  Also, with regard to the use of drugs such as ecstasy, it is a reality that people lose weight.  We think of their vulnerability but adolescents do not think about what will happen when they are 30, 40 or 50.  They are thinking of tomorrow or next week.  They under a lot of pressure, and we must be very careful, when we talk about weighing people, that we do it in a manner that does not exacerbate those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100015#O01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Flynn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349951400,"counter":649,"content":"<p>On the last point, we already have a surveillance initiative with the World Health Organisation.  We have strict guidelines on weighing children, and they are adhered to.<\/p><p>  I will make two points in answer to Senator Crown.  Where do I start?<\/p> <p>I agree with all Senator Crown said.  There are two further points to be made, however.  The first concerns chronic disease management.  The HSE already has chronic disease management programmes.  We have added another one specifically for the area in question.  My colleague, Dr. Fenton Howell, leads on chronic disease prevention.  We actually recognise what the Senator says and we will be addressing the matter very shortly.  We have already produced a paper on the matter and I am willing to share it with the committee, if it wishes.<\/p><p> On the statement that we require education and legislation, I contend we also need engineering.  My colleague, Dr. Woods, has alluded to the fact that we have engineered physical activity out of our lives.  We need it everywhere in life, including work and leisure, as it is very important.<\/p><p> My last point to Senator Crown is on education and training.  This was one of the 24 recommendations in the task force report and it has now been actualised.  We have a training programme - it is only in its infancy &ndash; and we are training general practitioners.  The focus is almost entirely on postgraduates, rather than undergraduates, because it is much more difficult to get to universities.  We hope that in the next stage, the period 2013 to 2014, the programme will be part of undergraduate education.<\/p><p> Deputy Naughten asked a question on breast-feeding.  I just published a paper on the obstacles to breast-feeding faced by professionals and will send it to the committee.  The paper has three objectives, the first of which is to promote breast-feeding among the general population, including the young population.  This is very important because there is no culture of promoting breast-feeding in Ireland, be it because of the Famine, religiosity or concepts of decency and covering up.  There are obstacles to breast-feeding enshrined in Irish culture and we must overcome them.  We must better promote breast-feeding.<\/p><p> The second objective is to support those who wish to breast-feed.  I alluded to one or two examples, on which I am willing to expand further.<\/p><p> The last objective pertains to protection.  The Government and the HSE must adopt the World Health Organization's international code of practice on breast-feeding substitutes.  We are not adhering to it.  I am not against formula because it is needed, but it is used in hospitals unnecessarily when babies are born.  We spend &euro;500,000 on it but we could reduce this expenditure to &euro;50,000.  There are children who need substitutes but most do not.  We really need to be stricter on adherence to the guidelines.  I am willing to work to this end.<\/p><p> I have already stated my interest.  As I said, I am not a politician so I ask the members to forgive me.  Everywhere I go as a health promotion officer, I say the most important thing anyone can do to promote and improve his or her health is vote.  Owing to this, I believe the members are the most important people because they have a considerable responsibility.  Bearing in mind that one in four children is obese, we must not continue to do what we are now doing because we will get the same results.  We must be very progressive and active.  No country in the world could treat so many people; it is impossible.  No country could afford it, nor could industry.  Therefore, the only approach is to be absolutely progressive and harsh on all the causes of obesity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100015#O01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nazih Eldin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349952000,"counter":651,"content":"<p>The members listened last week and this week.

The complexity of the pricing system needs to be considered in the round when some of the fiscal measures are under consideration.<\/p><p>  Fresh produce, by its nature, incurs an additional cost because it is much more difficult to handle and there is a higher rate of wastage.  Seasonality must also be considered.  One can find virtually any vegetable or fruit in a supermarket for 12 months of the year.  These fruits and vegetables, however, do not exist seasonally in Ireland for 12 months of the year.  Therefore, there is a cost associated with their production off-season under glass in Ireland or with importing them from other countries.  <\/p><p>  Fresh protein, including that in fish, meat and chicken, tends to be more expensive because of the cost inputs.  This is evident when one considers the differences between the various proteins.  Chicken tends to be cheaper than some red meat products, for example, because the conversion efficiency of the feed inputs is greater.  In some respects, therefore, it costs less to use.  Such products are increasing in price significantly because of higher feed costs, which are driven, in turn, by factors such as the drought in the mid-western United States this year.  Unfortunately, our having a globalised food chain has implications for the consumer in Ireland, including Dublin.<\/p><p>  Rather than considering fiscal measures such as taxation and subsidies - our position on this is clear as we have talked about it before - there is a need to consider the margins of end organisations such as fruit and vegetable retailers.  There is some flexibility in this regard because there has recently been more promotion of fruit and vegetables.  This suggests there is flexibility regarding the margins that are being garnered at end of the food supply chain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012101100016#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349952000,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I have very little to add.

There are many solutions, and we have all suggested them.  The members need to identify in their report the actions that need to be taken and they need to prioritise them.  From our perspective, a priority is establishing the Live Well platform.  There are four or five clear and key activities that must be stress-tested for use.
