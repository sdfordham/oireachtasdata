As the most cost effective of the technologies available to Ireland, wind energy will make the largest contribution to bridging the gap to meeting the electricity target.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2013, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government began a review of the existing Wind Energy Development Guidelines.  The review focused on the specific issues of noise, proximity, and shadow flicker.  Submissions were received from around 7,500 organisations and members of the public during the public consultation period. <\/p>  <p>  This is a very technical area and the engagement between the two departments is ongoing.  Technical studies have been obtained on various aspects of the issues, particularly noise - including separation distance - and detailed assessments of various options have been undertaken by the two Departments.<\/p>  <p>  Any revisions to the guidelines following the conclusion of deliberations, will be introduced by issuing the revised guidelines to planning authorities under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000053#WRA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000053#WRA02850"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[38979\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000053#WRA02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"for an update on the Government's commitment to provide fibre broadband to every house and business in County Donegal; the deadline for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.

The MANs have facilitated large and small retail service providers, operating in a fully liberalised market, in providing high speed broadband services without having to build their own networks.  The MANs provide a link between national backhaul networks and the &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; access networks that deliver telecommunications services to citizens and businesses. The 88 MANs which cover 94 regional cities and towns are managed, maintained, marketed and operated under a concession by a Management Services Entity (MSE). enet is currently the MSE for the MANs and further details relating to the MANs are available at . <\/p><p>The MSE provides fibre based services and products to licensed telecommunications operators on a wholesale, open access basis. In towns like Clifden, for example, the MSE provides wholesale broadband services to a number of different operators who provide downstream services to end customers.  The decision, however, to avail of the MANs is ultimately based on the operator&rsquo;s own commercial business case. <\/p><p>The MANs are now used by over 60 licensed telecoms operators and it is estimated that in excess of 600,000 users are benefitting from services provided through the MANs.  The SME market has also benefitted from the MANs, with enhanced services on different platforms available from a range of service providers.  Other end customers served by service providers availing of the MANs infrastructure include industrial estates, multinationals, State entities, educational institutions, as well as fixed and mobile customers outside Dublin. <\/p><p>enet, in its private capacity, has developed a model to construct wholesale Fibre to the Building (FTTB) networks, aimed at meeting the needs of the SME market, in four pilot towns, namely Claremorris, Loughrea, Ardee and Kilkenny.  These networks provide a fibre connection from the MAN to business premises in these towns.<\/p><p>Under EU State Aid rules, the State can only intervene in cases of clear market failure. Any question of subsidising connections to the MANs would come within the area of State Aid. <\/p><p>The current focus of policy is to deliver high speed broadband services through the National Broadband Plan (NBP).  The Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband to every citizen and business in Ireland.  This is being achieved through a combination of accelerated commercial investment by telecoms operators, and a proposed State intervention to provide high speed broadband to those parts of the country where the commercial sector will not invest. The State-led intervention will deliver services where through an open and competitive process in which all operators can bid to provide services. <\/p><p>The NBP proposed Intervention Strategy document, which I published on 15 July last, sets out a series of detailed proposals by Government in respect of the proposed State intervention.

Ireland has made good progress with regard to renewable energy deployment.<\/p>  <p>  To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity.  Figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for 2014 show that 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met from renewable sources.  In addition, SEAI has calculated that, in 2014, 22.7% of electricity, 6.6% of heat and 5.2% of transport were from renewables.

These schemes will be closed to new applications at the end of this year.  In terms of renewable heat, in addition to existing measures such as Part L of the Building Regulations, the 2014 Draft Bioenergy Plan recommended the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. <\/p>  <p>  On 31 July 2015, my Department launched two separate consultations on new support schemes, one for renewable electricity and one for a proposed Renewable Heat Incentive.

Following the completion of a rigorous public procurement process, two companies were selected to provide the JobPath service - Turas Nua Limited and Seetec Limited.  The companies will deliver services directly and will also engage a range of local subcontractors, including local training and employment service providers. <\/p>  <p>  JobPath was designed having regard to international experience of contracted out employment services and taking account of inputs received at a number of open information fora and advice received from Irish and International experts.  Significant safeguards have been built into JobPath.  These include a service guarantee to ensure that all participants receive a baseline level of service as well as penalties for the companies if service performance or service quality does not meet standards.  Both companies will be subject to regular on-site inspections and audits to ensure that JobPath is delivered in accordance with contractual obligations.  It is also the case that decisions regarding a person&rsquo;s welfare entitlements while on JobPath will be taken only by Department officials and not by the JobPath companies while the sanction process for clients on JobPath is exactly the same as the process for clients who engage with the Department&rsquo;s own activation service. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the experience of the person in Longford, I have been advised that a letter was sent to the person concerned on 13 October inviting her to attend a JobPath group information session on 20 October.<\/p>  <p>  The person concerned received a follow up phone call on 14 October to confirm the appointment but she said that was unable to attend the scheduled group information session.  She was offered an alternative appointment on 27 October but again she said she was unable to attend.  Arrangements were then made for her to attend an individual information session on 28 October which she duly attended. <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the person concerned was interviewed on 19 October for a place on a local Community Employment (CE) Scheme following which she was provisionally offered a position for 19 &frac12; hours a week for one year.<\/p>  <p>  While CE schemes are intended to help long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce, by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine for a limited duration, they are not full-time sustainable jobs.

They will spend a year on the programme and if they are placed into a job they may continue to receive support for the first year of employment.  During their time on JobPath they may also be referred for further education and training opportunities.  Jobseekers retain their existing social welfare payment while on JobPath. <\/p>  <p>  Given the circumstances of this case I have asked a senior official of the Department to review the person&rsquo;s case with a view to assessing the validity of the complaint received and determining the best outcome for the person concerned.

Expenditure on pensions at approximately &euro;6.675 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2015, representing almost 34.4% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. <\/p>  <p>  While the decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was a difficult one it provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.

The report is available on my Department's website at .  The issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public servants who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.\u00a0 Such individuals are (or were) liable to modified rate PRSI, which does not generate an entitlement to the State Pension.<\/p><p>The Government decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as it would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it would involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefitting from the exemption.\u00a0 In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions. <\/p><p>However, as a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. Budget 2015 provided for an increase in the\u00a0exemption threshold\u00a0to\u00a0&euro;12,012 and I announced in my recent Budget speech that this threshold will increase to &euro;13,000 per annum from 1 January 2016.

The publication of the regulations marks another important step in the development of a strengthened regulatory framework for credit unions. It is considered that the commencement of the remaining sections of the 2012 Act and implementation of\u00a0  these regulations, combined with and the prudential and governance requirements already in place, provide an appropriate regulatory framework for the credit union sector at this time.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced at end December 2015. I\u00a0have\u00a0asked the Registrar of Credit Unions to consider the views of the credit union movement as regards the draft regulations and their implementation and report back to me before I commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015, in line with the introduction of the regulations. These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the\u00a0 Credit Union Act 1997.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of regulation making powers to the Central Bank on commencement of the remaining sections of the 2012 Act provides flexibility where the Central Bank can, in the future, review and update the regulations as appropriate on a timely basis following consultation. The Central Bank is keen to ensure that the regulations remain appropriate for the credit union sector and in the future, where credit unions set out a clear path on how they wish to develop, the Central Bank will consider any amendments to the regulations that may be appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The need for credit unions to grow income has been recognised as a requirement for sector viability. While developing new products and services is a necessary element of this, the Central Bank has highlighted the importance\u00a0of credit unions ensuring that they are in a position to grow their income from their traditional lending business. It is also recognised that there is a level of\u00a0change in the sector arising from the voluntary restructuring programme.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that since 2010 it has received less than 10 applications for approval of additional services under sections 48 to 52 of the Credit Union Act 1997. These applications have all been received in recent months and are currently at a various stages of the approval process. The e Central Bank\u00a0further informed me that\u00a0it is open to working with the credit union sector to ensure that prudent and appropriate development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework. In supporting the sustainable and prudent development of the sector,\u00a0the Central Bank is working\u00a0to ensure that proposed changes to the business model are prudently structured and implemented.\u00a0To that\u00a0effect the\u00a0Central Bank\u00a0has invited a number of interested parties in the credit union sector to participate in focused dialogue in November 2015 with a view to gaining a better understanding of how credit unions want to develop their business model and to identify changes that may be required to the regulatory framework to facilitate prudent development. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the concerns highlighted by the credit union sector in relation to the cap on savings\u00a0of &euro;100,000 and I have requested that the Central Bank provides a clear process for credit unions to follow regarding the application process.

As the terms of the Lansdowne Road Agreement have now\u00a0been accepted by the Public Services Committee of ICTU and by\u00a0Government, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Bill 2015, which is currently before the Oireachtas, contains these provisions.  The Agreement\u00a0is significantly weighted in favour of the lower paid and applies to all public servants including teachers.  It\u00a0makes provision\u00a0for\u00a0increases in gross pay in 2016 for those on\u00a0pay up to &euro;31,000 and in 2017 for lower and middle income public servants,\u00a0namely those on pay up to &euro;65,000.

The Midlands is home to key clients such as Abbott, Covidien, Integra, GeneMedix, Freund, Utah, KCI, and AMS.  All of these international brands are an attraction for potential clients to locate in the Midlands and provide employment opportunities for people living in County Longford.  Examples of where the cluster effect benefits investment decisions include the announcements in 2014 by Jazz Pharmaceuticals in Athlone and American Medical Systems, who are already seeking planning permission to expand after only two years in Athlone.<\/p><p>As well as the FDI sector, this cluster is supported by over 600 people employed in medical technology-related industries from the indigenous sector, in areas such as manufacturing to delivery of elements of the supply chain.<\/p><p>The arrival of Jazz Pharmaceuticals to Athlone and the announcement of investment by Alexion Pharma combined with the existing presence of Alkermes, employing c. 400 staff identifies a new cluster in the Midlands in bio pharmaceuticals and this will be presented to potential new name companies in the market place.<\/p><p>The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative was launched in February of this year and aims to identify a range of actions which will help each region to achieve its economic potential.  The Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; Midland Region was launched on the 29th June.  This plan sets out over 120 actions aimed to deliver enhanced employment growth in the region over the coming years with a target of increasing employment in the region by 10-15 % by 2020.  The overall ambition of the Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; Midland Region is to increase employment by approximately 14,000 by 2020.<\/p><p>IDA Ireland launched its new strategy entitled &lsquo;Winning &ndash; Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019&rsquo; earlier this year.  As part of this strategy, IDA Ireland will roll out a &euro;150m property investment plan over five years, which will support the achievement of the organisation's regional goals.  The funding will be used to upgrade its business and technology parks, strategically invest in utility-intensive sites and build new advanced technology buildings in a number of regional locations.  An advanced office building is planned for 2017 for Co. Westmeath as part of the programme.<\/p><p>Competition for FDI is intense globally with virtually every country in the world actively seeking new FDI investments.  Investors have many attractive location options to choose from but IDA Ireland has a long and credible track record of presenting potential investors with the best location options throughout Ireland for each client.  The agency actively incentivises and encourages investors to consider a range of potential locations in Ireland.  The ultimate decision on location, however, rests with the client.<\/p><p><b>IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits to Longford and Westmeath 2011-2014<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000064#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000064#WRM01100"},{"type":"question","counter":413,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[39233\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000064#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"in view of the exposure of the abuse of migrant workers in the fishing industry here (details supplied), the steps he will take in order to strengthen the legal position of workers in the industry; if he will consider issuing work permits and permission to remain in the State to workers who report abuse of their employment rights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1197","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":414,"content":"<p>I am aware of the allegations to which the Deputy refers.

The most significant of these factors is the prevalence in the industry of the &ldquo;share fishermen&rdquo; model, under which the fishermen are categorised as self-employed.  The Irish employment permits system is predicated on the existence of an employment relationship between an identifiable employer in the State and his\/her employee.  As there would appear to be a genuine model in the sector of self-employed share fishermen, such individuals would be outside the scope of the Employment Permits system.<\/p>  <p>  A second relevant factor is the lack of evidence to date pointing to a skills shortage in the sector that cannot be filled from within the EEA.  As a result, all fishing occupations are currently specified as ineligible occupations for the purposes of the employment permits system on the &ldquo;Ineligible Categories of Employment&rdquo; List (ICEL). This List is reviewed twice yearly with input from relevant Government Departments, Agencies, Trades Unions and industry.  In the context of the review currently underway, I have invited fish producers&rsquo; organisations to make a submission on the case for removing fishermen from the list.<\/p>  <p>  In order to examine wide range of issues facing the Irish fishing sector and workers within that sector, the Government decided last week to immediately establish an Inter-Departmental Taskforce chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Simon Coveney.

The maximum stocking density in net pens is 10Kg\/m<sup>3<\/sup>. These regulations are given practical effect through a series of national and international organic standards, with in many cases individual producers being accredited by reference to several such standards simultaneously. Accreditation is by way of independent audit by suitably qualified and accredited audit bodies.<\/p><p>The control protocols for the management of sea lice are operated by the Marine Institute on behalf of the State.

The European Communities (Animal Remedies) (No. 2) Regulations 2007 (SI 786\/2007) provides the legislative basis for licensing of veterinary medicines.\u00a0 Under this regime, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) acts as the main national licensing authority for veterinary medicines (animal remedies), while my Department licenses premises engaged in the commercial distribution of veterinary medicines. All animal remedies intended for use are required to be authorised in the State and may only be used in accordance with the conditions attached to the product authorisation.\u00a0 The treatments are used under the control and direction of veterinary surgeons, as provided for under the animal remedies legislation. The sea lice management and control protocols and in particular the Pest Management Strategy introduced in 2008 lay down conditions for the compulsory control of sea lice infestation levels on marine salmon farms. As part of this control strategy farm operators are required to undertake treatments to control lice infestation levels once certain trigger levels are reached. In certain circumstances treatments alone may not be the most appropriate strategy and in a number of limited circumstances an accelerated harvest may be required. In 2015 accelerated harvests were undertaken in two instances to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000067#WRP02200","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licence Applications","counter":506,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000067#WRP02300"},{"type":"question","counter":507,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[39042\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000067#WRP02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is satisfied that no conflict of interest exists for his Department and for Bord Iascaigh Mhara in the assessment of Bord Iascaigh Mhara's Galway Bay licence application, given that his Department&rsquo;s fisheries division is responsible for both the governance of BIM and for the assessment of licence applications.","asker":"1192","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":508,"content":"<p>An application by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) for an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of finfish near Inis Oirr in Galway Bay was received by my Department in 2012.\u00a0 The application and its accompanying Environmental Impact Statement are being considered under the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act and the 1933 Foreshore Act.<\/p><p>The assessment process will take full account of all national and EU legislative requirements and will reflect the full engineering, scientific, environmental, legal and public policy aspects of the application.<\/p><p>There is always a strict separation between my Ministerial role as decision maker in respect of aquaculture licence applications and my Ministerial duty to promote the sustainable development of the industry.

I also provided that such farmers would be automatically approved for GLAS Plus, should they be farming sufficient area of habitat. I would strongly encourage all farmers with Hen Harrier land to take up this measure under GLAS, which offers a payment rate of &euro;370 per hectare. Farmers can earn up to &euro;7,000 per annum through a combination of GLAS and GLAS Plus payments and some 1,400 hen harrier farmers have already been approved into the new scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have recently announced that I intend to introduce a further scheme of assistance under the Locally Led Agri-Environment measure, to cater for farmers who are farming large tracts of hen-harrier land. One of the principles of the planned locally-led measure is to explore new ways of managing farming effort for the benefit of the environment, and in this case for the benefit of the hen-harrier. When the new scheme is designed, it has then to be negotiated with the EU Commission and formally introduced by amendment to the Rural Development Programme.

The vast majority of participants in the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) will easily meet and exceed the land requirements necessary to receive full payment.<\/p><p>For example, a farmer with 10 calved cows and a stocking density of 0.5 will have access to 20 hectares but will only require 6.66 hectares for the purposes of payment under the Programme. This herdowner would then have to ensure that they submitted each year, on their SPS form, eligible forage hectares to cover at least 80% of 6.66 hectares (5.33) to ensure that they are compliant with the land requirement of the BDGP and remained within the scheme. Even if this farmer had a stocking density of 1 calved cow per hectare, they would have 50% more land than they require. <\/p><p>Based on numbers from the 2014 Beef Genomics Scheme, nearly half of farmers (46%) will have a stocking density of less than 0.5 calved cows per hectare whereas 90% of farmers have a stocking density below 1 calved cow per hectare.

","asker":"1075","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":712,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy cuts across areas of the youth justice system for which my Department is responsible and the area of children&rsquo;s detention for which my colleague Dr. James Reilly, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is responsible.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS), which is composed of officials from both Department&rsquo;s, is responsible for leading and driving reform in the area of youth justice.<\/p>  <p>  Statutory provision in relation to young offenders is set out in the Children Act, 2001 (as amended).  Under the Act, a child is defined as a person under the age of 18 years and it is further provided in section 52 that a child under 12 years of age shall not be charged with an offence except where certain stated charges apply.  <\/p>  <p>  The latest available information in relation youth offending and re-offending is set out in the 2013 Report of the Committee Appointed to Monitor the Effectiveness of the Diversion Programme which I recently laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As the Deputy may know, before any young person is brought before the courts, he or she must first be referred for consideration of a caution and inclusion in the Garda Diversion Programme by the Director of the Programme.  In 2013, 10,420 young people were referred for such consideration.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the &ldquo;estimated number of young offenders who enter the criminal justice system annually&rdquo;, if by this the Deputy means the number of young people who are brought before the courts and the number of convictions involved, the Courts Service has advised that their statistical information is not compiled in a way which identifies new offenders.  The Courts Service points out that figures in relation to the Children Court are published in the Courts Service Annual Report which provides details of offences and outcomes.  In this regard, the 2014 Annual Report on page 56, sets out extensive details in relation to &ldquo;juvenile crime&rdquo; and the range of offences and their outcomes.   <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the number of &ldquo;school age adolescents that engage with Garda Diversion Programmes annually&rdquo;, the 2013 Report of the Monitoring Committee which I refer to above states on page 16, that 7,732 young people were deemed suitable for inclusion in the Diversion Programme.  In this context, I should mention Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) which my Department funds.  In 2013, some 5,065 young people were engaged with GYDPs.  GYDPs are youth justice crime reduction\/crime prevention community programmes which are specifically targeted at young offenders and those at serious risk of offending. They provide essential support to the Garda Diversion Programme and to the effectiveness of the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer system operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding support for youth justice community interventions is based on evidence that diversion programmes in the form of high quality preventative intervention can do more to reduce crime than more costly custodial options. Just over &euro;11.5 million was allocated to GYDPs (and 5 Local Drugs Task Force projects working alongside GYDP) in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the information sought by the Deputy in relation to the percentage of young offenders who are unemployed 12 months after their release or who are released at 21 years of age with no qualifications is not maintained by the Children Detention Schools or the Irish Prison Service.  However, the Deputy may wish to note that Young Persons Probation (YPP), a specialised Division of the Probation Service, in the context of its supervision of community based sanctions, utilises a number of community based organisations with dedicated resources to work with young offenders.   A number of the YPP projects provide education courses (such as FETAC levels 3, 4 and 5) through the Educational Trust Boards  which result in the young person\/offender obtaining an academic qualification. Other YPP projects provide various training or skills programmes and initiatives (such as IT skills) which assist young offenders subsequently seeking employment.  The provision of these services enhance the young offender&rsquo;s personal development and life outcomes, thereby reducing their risk of re-offending and leading to safer communities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000074#WRW02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":714,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[38975\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000074#WRW02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of offenders under 30 years of age who are unemployed at the time of arrest.","asker":"1075","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":715,"content":"<p>I am advised that the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000074#WRW02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Station Refurbishment","counter":717,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000075#WRX00200"},{"type":"question","counter":718,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[39065\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000075#WRX00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide funding for windows in a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na station (details supplied) in County Kerry to bring the building's facade in line with the adjoining building; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

As the Deputy will be aware my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has brought forward the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2015 to give effect to the Lansdowne Road Agreement. The Bill starts the process of the phased restoration of remuneration to public servants, including members of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na.The Bill also provides for the suspension of the operation of incremental pay scales in respect of any public servant who is not encompassed by a registered agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The LRA is not, of course, solely about beginning the process of restoring remuneration, it is also about securing the enhanced efficiencies and performance delivered by the earlier Haddington Road and Croke Park Agreements. Specifically in relation to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the LRA provides for the continuation of the obligation under the Haddingtion Road Agreement to work an additional 30 hours per year. As the Agreement identifies 10 of these hours as overtime which is to taken as compulsory time-off in lieu, the actual additional hours per member are 15. The Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have informed me that their members have rejected the LRA, as is their right. I met representatives of both Associations last week and it was agreed that a useful next step would be to tease out the implications of their position. Arrangements are in train for meetings to take place with officials of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform  for this purpose. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy suggests, in the event that the Associations do not become party to the LRA, there will be a loss of hours available to the Garda Commissioner from 1 January 2016, although not of the order suggested by the Deputy. It will, of course, be a matter for the Garda Commissioner who has responsibility for the distribution of resources to manage this. I would, however, draw the Government's commitment to the ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; to the Deputy's attention. The Budget provision for 2016 provides for the recruitment of an additional 600 Garda&iacute; and these positions will be advertised shortly.

My announcement followed an extensive consultation process with key stakeholders and hearings by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence on a report from a Joint Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\/Department of Justice and Equality Working Group published in November 2014. The changes announced will address issues in the short term but also map out the longer term future for a licensing system which balances the rights of those who wish to pursue their interests with public safety, which has to be the paramount consideration.  I understand the Sports Coalition (of which the National Association of Regional Games Council is a member) has welcomed and fully endorsed my announcement. <\/p>  <p>  My intention is to make fundamental long term reforms in this area by proposing legislation for a Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority. The primary function of the Authority will be to determine, on the basis of an objective assessment of all the issues, with safety of the public being paramount, whether particular forms of firearms may be licensed in the State, whether there should be any limit on the number of such firearms and what safety conditions might properly be applied to their licensing.  The functions of the Authority will be subject to further consultation with key stakeholders in advance of the preparation of the necessary enabling legislation, which will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the review process, I announced my intention to re-establish the Firearms Consultative Panel. The re-established panel had their first meeting on 29 October 2015. It is made up of key stakeholders, including the Sports Coalition. This panel provides a valuable forum for contact and discussion between my Department and representatives of shooting organisations, An Garda Siochana and other interested parties.  I have sought submissions from the Firearms Consultative Panel on a number of issues affecting licensed gun owners including the proposed Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority.  I look forward to building on the positive relationships developed between representative organisations and my Department during the review of firearms licensing and I look forward to continued open and positive dialogue with all representative organisations.<\/p>  <p>  I have notified the Garda Inspectorate that I intend to ask them to review the administration of firearms licensing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when the Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority is in place for a period of 12 months. <\/p>  <p>  I have introduced  an immediate temporary cap on the licensing of any new centre-fire semi-automatic rifles pending the establishment and determination of the Authority.

This legislation clarifies for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na what firearms may be considered by them for licensing. <\/p>  <p>  In line with my commitment to prevent any proliferation of handgun availability in Ireland, I am continuing to monitor the number of 0.22 inch rim fire calibre handguns being licensed. If there is a significant increase in the number of applications for new certificates or import licence applications for these handguns, I will introduce priority legislation for a future cap. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Garda Commissioner intends to establish a centralised licensing system for restricted firearms, pending the establishment and determination of the Firearms Assessment and Appeals Authority.

This funding, which is in addition to the direct support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit, provided support to more than 100,000 children each year.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2016, I announced an &euro;85 million package of additional investment for the childcare sector which will provide for a range of significant enhancements to the childcare support programmes. These include an expansion of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and increased provision under the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme that supports low income and disadvantaged families.<\/p>  <p>  The question of tax allowances for parents was considered prior to the introduction of the childcare support programmes.  A number of issues emerged at that time which did not favour the introduction of a childcare tax credit.  For example, the introduction of a tax credit would not help to support quality improvements within the sector and would not help those families on low pay who may not have any tax liability. There was also concern at that time that the application of tax credits could lead to increased prices and therefore have limited impact in terms of savings to parents.<\/p>  <p>  Experience in other countries has shown that demand side supports such as subsidies and tax relief can result in increasing cost for parents. This was the case in both Australia and the Netherlands, where childcare costs continued to rise despite the introduction of tax reliefs and\/or subsidies.  The policy trend in most European countries is to provide support through supply side measures such as those, which have been implemented in Ireland over the last number of years.<\/p>  <p>  The Inter-Departmental Group, which I established earlier this year to consider options for future investment in childcare, did examine both supply and demand side measures. The report of the Group, which included an evaluation of the value of the introduction of tax relief measures, outlined concerns that the value of the tax credit would be capitalised into the cost of childcare and that little or no benefit would accrue to the parent.  The Group concluded that investment in supply side measures was strategically optimal in achieving the combined objectives of affordability, accessibility and quality.<\/p>  <p>  The additional investment in the childcare sector which I announced will have a significant impact on the affordability of childcare services with the extended provision under the free pre-school year programme reducing parent's average annual childcare costs by a further &euro;1,500 approximately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000078#WRAA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care Education","counter":822,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000078#WRAA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":823,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[39619\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000078#WRAA01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the reason for delaying the introduction of the expanded preschool programme; if he is aware that the delay will exclude some families whose children will have commenced primary school before its introduction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":824,"content":"<p>At present, children qualify for the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme when they are within the qualifying age range which is 3 years and 2 months to 4 years and 7 months in the September of the relevant year.  This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 qualified for free pre-school from September 2015. Children who turn 3 from 1 July  2012 are below the age range for eligibility for ECCE in the 2015\/2016 programme year but will qualify for the 2016\/17 programme year.<\/p>  <p>  The recent Budget decisions, which introduced an extended provision under the ECCE programme that allows children to access the free pre-school programme from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school, come into effect from September 2016. This extended provision, when fully rolled out, will mean that children will have access to free education - either in pre-school or primary school - from the age of three.  The start up date for the introduction of this new measure was decided so as to allow pre-school providers an adequate timeframe to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional numbers benefitting from the programme, which are estimated to increase to approximately 127,000 per year from the current average of around 67,000 per year.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious that, depending on their date of birth, some children enrolling in the ECCE programme in September 2016 will not benefit from this extended free pre-school provision. I am also aware that, when the programme is fully in place (i.e. from 2017), there will be some children who will benefit for a shorter extra period of free pre-school than others. Again, this will depend on the child's date of birth and the age at which they make the transition to primary school. Ultimately however, when this extended programme is fully in place, all children will be better off than in the present programme. Indeed, the net effect of the improvements for children overall will be an increase of an average of 23 weeks over the current programme.  I think that this is a significant step forward for children and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000078#WRAA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":826,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000078#WRAA01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobility Allowance Review","counter":825,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000078#WRAA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":826,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[39758\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000078#WRAA01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the replacement to the mobility transport grant is likely to be delivered, with particular reference to the fact that this has been suspended now for a period of two years and has led to enormous isolation among those who would have traditionally benefited from it.

It has already served to deepen our understanding of the various and complex issues that arise for Ireland in connection with a potential change in the nature of the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU. <\/p>  <p>  The findings of the study are clear: there are significant risks for Ireland if the UK were to leave the EU. Key areas of our economy could be adversely affected and there would also be implications for migration and in regard to the border between both parts of the island. Particular difficulties might arise as well in the energy sector. <\/p>  <p>  The report reinforces our conviction that a British withdrawal from the Union would be very negative for Ireland. That is why we are already working hard, across Government, to help ensure that scenario does not come to pass. This means working with all our EU partners, and especially the UK, to find a solution that will allow for continued British membership of the Union. My Department is naturally heavily involved in that process, as is our Embassy in London and all our diplomatic missions.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also raised our concerns about any change in the nature of the EU-UK relationship with the British Government. In a number of meetings this year, I have stressed to the British Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, how much we value the UK&rsquo;s continuing presence in the Union. I have also emphasized the important role our common membership has played in strengthening our bilateral ties and in supporting peace and political stability in Northern Ireland. The Taoiseach has made similar points in discussions with Prime Minister Cameron.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to make its voice heard in the debate ahead in the UK on its membership of the Union.

He also reconfirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to work with the UK on areas of common interest within the British reform agenda.<\/p>  <p>  Our approach continues to be guided by the belief that the best way to mitigate the risks of a British departure from the Union is to ensure it does not happen in the first place.

My Department closely monitors international developments, primarily through our network of Embassies, and also through close consultation with our EU and other international partners.<\/p><p>The Department also operates a citizen registration facility at . This facility allows Irish citizens to register their contact details with the Department so that they are easily contactable in the event of an emergency. We strongly encourage all travelers to register, and especially so when they are travelling to remote or insecure locations.  <\/p><p>Based on a direction issued by the Irish Aviation Authority on 4 November 2015, my Department promptly amended its travel advice for citizens intending to travel to or from Sharm el-Sheikh to the following:<\/p><p>&ldquo;Any Irish citizen scheduled to travel to or already in Sharm El Sheikh should contact their tour operator or airline for further information. Citizens should note the direction issued by the Irish Aviation Authority on 5 November to Irish airline operators not to operate to\/from Sharm el-Sheikh airport or in the Egyptian Sinai peninsula airspace until further notice. Citizens should also be mindful that UK flights are currently suspended and of the possibility of similar directions by other aviation authorities which may affect scheduled flights. Citizens in Sharm el-Sheikh should make their travel plans in coordination with their travel or tour company.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Department officials continue to keep the travel advice for Egypt under close review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000089#WRMM02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":1160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000089#WRMM03100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":1159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000089#WRMM03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1160,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[38973\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000089#WRMM03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"in the event of parents being forced to pay for the hiring of a teacher to provide extra instruction to primary school children with a diagnosis of Dyslexia, whether through the Dyslexia Association or otherwise, her plans to cover the cost of hiring such teachers, where there is a clear educational advantage; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1202","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1161,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that all mainstream Primary schools have been allocated significant additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model (GAM) to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs, including Specific Learning Disability (SLD), of which dyslexia is one such SLD.<\/p><p>All Post Primary schools have also been allocated additional teaching resources for pupils with high incidence special educational needs, including SLDs.

The basic principle of public procurement is that there should be a competitive process and this approach applies to procurement by all public sector bodies, and includes school transport services performed by contractors under the School Transport Scheme. The tendering process is a competitive process which allows Bus &Eacute;ireann to achieve the procurement objectives in terms of value for money, access to the contracts for all interested parties, transparency on how the contracts are awarded, and equality of treatment.  The rules of the competition and the selection and award criteria were clearly outlined as to how the contracts would be awarded and all interested parties were provided with the same opportunity and the same information.  In this way the procurement process is carried out in an fair, open and transparent manner complying with all applicable EU Procurement Law, domestic legislation and government regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The contractual obligations that contractors are obliged to satisfy provide assurance that school transport services provided under the School Transport Scheme continue to meet the highest safety standards, and are neither unfair nor unreasonable.  This includes an obligation to keep and provide evidence that all statutory vehicle, driver and company certificates and licences are kept current and in order.  Nominated drivers are obliged to satisfy medical examination, must be licensed to drive the size of vehicle used, and are subject to vetting procedures arranged by Bus &Eacute;ireann and conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  Vehicles and maintenance systems are subject to random inspection conducted by leading independent experts in this field on behalf of Bus &Eacute;ireann in addition to satisfying statutory obligations outlined by the RSA, and service performance is monitored by School Bus Inspectors with support from the local Bus &Eacute;ireann school transport office.<\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is very conscious of the specialised nature of transport provision for pupils with special educational needs under the School Transport Scheme.  This is reflected in the standard of service provided and by Bus &Eacute;ireann factoring the individual requirements of the children concerned into the planning of these services which generally operate on a door-to-door basis.  They remain very conscious of the disruption in service provision occasioned by a potential change of driver arising from the tendering process they are obliged to conduct but the award of a five-year contract to the successful tenderer provides security for the duration of the contract to the contractor as well as stability, in terms of familiarity with transport arrangements, for the families, schools, and children concerned.

With an overall programme value of &euro;4.15 m, the EU contribution is &euro;2.49 m, representing 60% of the total.  As the programme will run until next September and most public beneficiary bodies are funding the cost of EGF measures from their own budgets and will subsequently submit declarations at programme end for the final report and statement of eligible expenditure due to be submitted to the European Commission by 19 March 2017, it is difficult to accurately forecast the final expenditure.  No final expenditure declarations or payment claims have yet been received in my Department and I am not currently in a position to indicate the level of EGF programme expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  However, I understand that take-up of EGF support measures offered to date is less than anticipated. The total number of redundant workers who were potentially eligible under the EGF Programme was 424, with a further 200 young persons under the age of 25 not in employment, education or training (NEET persons) also being targeted under a new option introduced under EU Regulation 1309\/2013 governing the EGF Fund.  Based on previous experience the targeted number of redundant workers under the Programme is set at 250 plus the 200 NEET persons.  While the Deputy refers to May 2015 figures, the recently published 2nd Implementation Report sets out that at end August 2015, 193 former workers and 76 NEETs had participated in EGF related programme measures; this equates to 77% and 38% of those targeted cohorts respectively. Engagement with the NEET persons is proving more challenging in the time limited context of EGF programmes.<\/p>  <p>  At end August, 256 of the 424 former workers were in employment (60.3%).  While positive, this re-employment rate may be mitigating against a higher programme participation rate.<\/p>  <p>  The local EGF Coordination Unit office established by SOLAS and located in Tallaght is coordinating EGF programme supports. All potential beneficiaries have been contacted by the Unit on a number of occasions.  The Unit and my Department met with the South Dublin County Partnership) earlier this year in the context of the LTAI EGF Programme and Ms Anna Lee, former CEO of  the Partnership subsequently took up the Chairperson of the LTAI EGF Consultative Forum set up to assist in the implementation of, and to maximise participation in the EGF programme.<\/p>  <p>  An information and advocacy event, arranged by worker and NEET representatives on the consultative forum and supported by the EGF Coordination Unit, will take place this week to encourage those eligible to avail of EGF programme support measures.  This includes a second tailored 10-week 'Dealing with Change and Opportunity, Mindfully' programme which will commence later this month.  My Department continues to liaise with the EGF Coordination Unit and other partners to maximise engagement with the programme.  The potential for wider engagement with the community sector in the Tallaght area to maximise participation, particularly of the NEET cohort, is being considered in that context.<\/p>  <p>  Final uptake of an EGF support measure is dependent on the individual choice of each eligible beneficiary and may be influenced ultimately by a range of factors including reintegration into part-time or full-time employment or a focus on job searching.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000092#WRPP01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"question","counter":1247,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[39388\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000092#WRPP01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"for a breakdown of all moneys returned to the European Commission from previous European Globalisation Adjustment Fund programmes, expressed in nominal terms and as a percentage of the total amount awarded for each programme by the European Commission.","asker":"959","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1248,"content":"<p>A table showing the initial allocation and actual expenditure and reimbursement figures for each of the seven completed programmes co-funded by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in Ireland to date is set out below. <table><tr><th>EGF Programme<\/th><th>Programme Allocation <\/th><th>EU Contribution <\/th><th>% EU <\/th><th>Actual Expenditure<\/th><th>EU Contribution<\/th><th>EGF Budget used %<\/th><th>EGF Amount Returned<\/th><th>EGF Amount Returned % <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>DELL<\/td><td>&euro;22,817,000<\/td><td>&euro;14,831,050<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>&euro;13,619,598<\/td><td>&euro;8,852,739<\/td><td>59.7%<\/td><td>&euro;5,978,311<\/td><td>40.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford Crystal<\/td><td>&euro;3,955,159<\/td><td>&euro;2,570,853<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>&euro;3,089,633<\/td><td>&euro;2,008,261<\/td><td>78.1%<\/td><td>&euro;562,592<\/td><td>21.9%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SR Technics<\/td><td>&euro;11,455,174<\/td><td>&euro;7,445,863<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>&euro;4,504,198<\/td><td>&euro;2,927,729<\/td><td>39.3%<\/td><td>&euro;4,518,134<\/td><td>60.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NACE 41 Construction<\/td><td>&euro;19,522,829<\/td><td>&euro;12,689,838<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>&euro;12,618,893<\/td><td>&euro;8,202,280<\/td><td>64.6%<\/td><td>&euro;4,487,558<\/td><td>35.4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NACE 43 Construction<\/td><td>&euro;33,329,459<\/td><td>&euro;21,664,148<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>&euro;20,249,086<\/td><td>&euro;13,161,906<\/td><td>60.8%<\/td><td>&euro;8,502,242<\/td><td>39.2%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NACE 71 Construction<\/td><td>&euro;2,135,107<\/td><td>&euro;1,387,819<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>&euro;1,810,636<\/td><td>&euro;1,176,913<\/td><td>84.8%<\/td><td>&euro;210,906<\/td><td>15.2%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Talk Talk<\/td><td>&euro;5,392,765<\/td><td>&euro;2,696,382<\/td><td>50%<\/td><td>&euro;3,793,765<\/td><td>&euro;1,896,883<\/td><td>70.3%<\/td><td>&euro;799,499<\/td><td>29.7%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000092#WRPP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1078"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":1250,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000093#WRQQ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1251,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[39407\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000093#WRQQ00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a child (details supplied) is being refused a full-time special needs assistant in order to attend school; if the decision not to award this support can be reversed, as the situation is causing distress to the child's family and parents; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1252,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014.<\/p><p>All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2015\/16 school year by 18th March 2015.

Work on the language curriculum for 3rd to 6th classes has commenced and will be introduced later.

A review is currently underway of the oral component of Irish in the Leaving Certificate, and it is expected that a report will be published on this in the next number of months.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to note that an in-depth review of Education Provision in the Gaeltacht is nearing completion.

I am satisfied that this process, including its parameters, criteria and processes, was conducted in a robust manner consistent with EU and National Procurement Guidelines.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000095#WRSS00400","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme Administration","counter":1311,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000095#WRSS00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1312,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[39024\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000095#WRSS00500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"for an update on the roll-out of a new tenant purchase scheme for local authority tenants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1313,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[39321\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000095#WRSS00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 681 of 20 October 2015, if the necessary regulations for the new tenant purchase scheme have been finalised and signed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1314,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 521 and 537 together.<\/p><p>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has signed the Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 to enable the new scheme for the tenant purchase of existing local authority houses along incremental purchase lines to come into operation on 1 January 2016.

In discussions prior to the adoption of the 2007 Tyre Regulations, it was made clear that this was the last opportunity for the tyre industry to embrace environmental compliance and take responsibility for the waste it produces.  If the required improvement did not happen, it was made clear to the tyre industry that the system would be reviewed and replaced with a full Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) model. <\/p>  <p>  As part of a wider review of producer responsibility arrangements completed in 2014, the structural and environmental effectiveness of all aspects of the current system for managing waste tyres was assessed. The results of this examination were stark. The report, published for consultation in November 2013 and in final form in April 2014, found:   <\/p>  <p>-  A non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,   <\/p>  <p>-  A lack of consistent and accurate data,   <\/p>  <p>-  That the current system was not tracking data flows well, and   <\/p>  <p>  -  Between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for with widespread illegal dumping. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, this system, which has resulted in between 15 - 30 million tyres being dumped illegally, is clearly failing to provide a proper waste management system for tyres and can not be allowed to continue. <\/p>  <p>  Following extensive discussions with the tyre industry, I announced my decision to establish a full PRI scheme for Tyres and Waste Tyres in Ireland on 30 January 2015. Since my decision, significant progress has been made in discussions with the tyre industry.     <\/p>  <p>  The new scheme will be operated by Repak with a registration and reporting role for the WEEE Register Society. Both organisations have long and successful track records under existing producer responsibility arrangements in the packaging, battery and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) areas and have been instrumental in making Ireland a top EU per former in these waste streams. The new system will provide a sustainable and environmentally focussed system for the management of waste tyres. Like existing systems for waste tyres elsewhere in the EU and for all other waste streams in Ireland, this system will respect the producer responsibility approach and be based on the polluter pays principle. These are long-standing environmental principles which are reflected in both European and domestic legislation. <\/p>  <p>  There will be no new tyre tax or levy under the new system. Consumers already pay a disposal fee to their tyre retailer whenever they buy a new tyre. The model that I am introducing will formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply but which does not currently go towards the cost of managing the waste in all cases, as it is supposed to. It is absolutely right and fair to provide a system that ensures it is properly directed in the future so that the consumer does not pay twice: once at the point of purchase and again when the taxpayer has to meet costs incurred by local authorities for the clean-up of illegally dumped tyres. <\/p>  <p>  Repak ELT, which has already replaced TRACS as the sole compliance scheme for tyres as of 1 November 2015, already has over 90 members and the model that I am developing, which mirrors those arrangements which are in place in 20 other Member States, will, I am confident, enjoy the full support of all members of the European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers Association who make up approximately 50% of the Irish tyre market. <\/p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, I urge both the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA) and the Irish Tyre Wholesalers &amp;amp; Retailers Association (ITWRA) to re-join the process and re-engage with my Department in finalising the details for the new regulatory regime.  In addition, my Department and Repak ELT continue to engage with representatives from the farming, construction and haulage sectors on the new arrangements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000095#WRSS01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Programme","counter":1329,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000095#WRSS01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1330,"qnumday":528,"qnumall":"[39165\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000095#WRSS01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will identify alternative funding initiatives to those iniatives under Pobal that award rural development grant funding to rurally-based small and medium enterprises, that is initiatives to regenerate new and existing tourist attractions and other similar projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1199","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1331,"content":"<p>The LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2014&ndash;2020 will provide &euro;250 million in financial resources to support the development of sustainable rural communities.

These mechanisms include units purchased, leased or constructed by approved housing bodies and both multi-unit developments and individual units leased or acquired through rental arrangements directly by local authorities. Units leased by local authorities or approved housing bodies can be for periods up to 20 years.

To facilitate this agenda, I established the CEDRA Interdepartmental Group (IDG), comprising senior representatives of all relevant Government Departments. The purpose of the IDG is to ensure that each Department&rsquo;s policy development and implementation fully considers the needs of rural communities. In this context, it is about maximising the financial resources already available for rural development and ensuring that these resources are directed in a way that best supports the sustainable economic development of rural areas. In this regard, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible or practical to quantify the cross Government funding of CEDRA projects in 2015 on a county basis. <\/p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that &euro;1 million was allocated in the Budget for 2015 to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine to establish a Rural Innovation and Development fund in line with CEDRA recommendations to support innovative, small scale pilot initiatives and I am advised by that Department that this funding will be expended on a range of projects by end 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2014&ndash;2020 will provide &euro;250 million in financial resources to support the development of sustainable rural communities.  This includes a provision of &euro;5 million to support the Rural Economic Development Zones (REDZ) identified in the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas (CEDRA). The approach to investing this &euro;5 million in these rural areas, through LEADER, will be informed by the outcome of the REDZ pilot scheme that is currently being implemented by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Under the REDZ pilot scheme, my Department has recently allocated over &euro;3.7 million to some 51 initiatives.  Furthermore, and in line with the objectives of the CEDRA report, I recently announced an additional &euro;30 million investment package for rural Ireland, which will be rolled over the coming months. This funding will also support the revitalisation of towns and villages with a view to improving the living and working environment in these communities and increase their potential to support increased economic activity into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000096#WRTT02000","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Development Contributions","counter":1364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000097#WRUU00175"},{"type":"question","counter":1365,"qnumday":541,"qnumall":"[39377\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000097#WRUU00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the local authorities that have revised their development contribution schemes in order to put more reasonable levies in place and in order to help stimulate residential and commercial development; the local authorities that have not; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1366,"content":"<p>Development contributions are levied by planning authorities on the basis of a development contribution scheme approved by the elected members which sets out how contributions are to be applied in their respective functional areas.

These guidelines emphasise the importance of promoting development through the application, where feasible, of reduced development contributions to facilitate development and promote economic activity and job creation in local areas. <\/p><p>Further to the 2013 guidelines, 20 of the 31 local authorities have responded positively by adopting revised development contribution schemes - encompassing reduced charges &ndash; which have been notified to my Department subsequent to their adoption. <\/p><p>This information is set out in the Table below:<table><tr><th>Local Authority <\/th><th>Scheme revised since January 2013 Guidance <\/th><th>Scheme predates January 2013 Guidance <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow County <\/td><td><div>_ <\/div><\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ca van County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>_ <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>_ <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>_ <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork County <\/td><td><div>_ <\/div><\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal County <\/td><td><div>_ <\/div><\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Authority <\/td><td>Scheme revised since January 2013 Guidance <\/td><td>Scheme predates January 2013 Guidance <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire\/Rathdown County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway City <\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway County <\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry County <\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare County <\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>_ <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim County <\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>_ <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>_ <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth County <\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo County <\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo County <\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Authority <\/td><td>Scheme revised since January 2013 Guidance <\/td><td>Scheme predates January 2013 Guidance <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow County <\/td><td><div>X <\/div><\/td><td><div>- <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000097#WRUU00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seniors Alert Scheme","counter":1367,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000097#WRUU00375"},{"type":"question","counter":1368,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[39410\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000097#WRUU00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"her views on a matter (details supplied) regarding the Senior Alerts Scheme and its registration with Pobal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1369,"content":"<p>The objective of the Seniors Alert Scheme is to encourage community support for vulnerable older people in our communities through the provision of personal monitored alarms to enable them to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.

Following a review in 2010 , one of the recommendations was that a centralised procurement proc ess would simplify the scheme.

There are now 52 technologies covered in 10 product categories (which includes a catering and hospitality equipment category), comprising over 10,000 products registered.<\/p>  <p>  SEAI promotes the provision of high quality energy efficiency audits for businesses through supports for industry and SMEs including assistance with implementation of certified Energy Management Systems and the provision of energy audits to business through the Advice and Mentoring Scheme. Over 2,000 businesses, representing an annual energy expenditure of over &euro;400 million, have already availed of this programme, with 10% energy savings routinely found in the first year and energy cost savings of up to 30% achieved in many cases. <\/p>  <p>  An energy efficiency obligation scheme commenced in 2014. Under the scheme, energy suppliers are required to deliver mandatory energy savings. The obligation scheme encourages energy suppliers to work collaboratively with customers to identify potential savings and to share the benefits that these savings could deliver.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012, the Government introduced a support scheme to incentivise the use of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generation in the commercial and industrial sector. This support for CHP is in the form of feed-in tariffs for electricity produced from biomass CHP plants. A further support scheme that covers renewable heat is expected to be introduced in 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000099#WRWW01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Incentives","counter":1435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000099#WRWW01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1436,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[39512\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111000099#WRWW01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when he will launch the renewable heat incentive being developed by his Department; and if it will include an incentive for domestic dwellings as well.","asker":"1001","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1437,"content":"<p>On 31 July last, I launched a consultation on the proposed Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) to incentivise larger heat users in the industrial and commercial sector to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources.

The State itself is not a player in this market and will only intervene in the broadband market in cases of clear market failure - the recent National Broadband Scheme and the proposed intervention under the National Broadband Plan are examples of such interventions. <\/p>  <p>  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising both fixed and mobile networks. This includes some &euro;850m invested in acquiring spectrum under the 2012 Multi-Band Spectrum Auction run by ComReg. Since then, the mobile operators have all continued to invest in rolling out 4G and enhanced 3G services nationwide. These investments are improving both the coverage and quality of voice and data services throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012 when the National Broadband Plan was first published, industry committed to providing high speed broadband to 1 million addresses in Ireland by 2015, with top speeds ranging from 100 Mbps for cable and 70 Mbps for eFibre services. <\/p>  <p>  Today, cable is delivering speeds of up to 240 Mbps to over 700,000 addresses and fibre-to-the-cabinet services of up to 100 Mbps are available to approximately 1.3 million addresses.

My Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine published Deer Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action in March this year which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread.
