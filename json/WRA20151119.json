The latest figures in relation to the unemployment rate show that it has been reduced from a peak of 15.1% in February 2012 to 8.9% in October this year The fiscal strategy underpinning Budget 2016 is designed to encourage continued sustainable economic growth and increase investment in public services in order to promote further employment growth. Increased employment results in more resources being available to deliver public services.\u00a0 It is of course important to ensure that those resources are being allocated to best effect. The\u00a0range of reforms that have been introduced by my Department to the budgetary cycles and processes help to support the\u00a0efficient use of public funds to deliver effective services for citizens.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2016 includes a significant measure in relation to childcare which has a clear potential to contribute to improved competitiveness and higher trend economic growth.\u00a0 The Early Childhood Care and Education scheme is to be extended. Investment in childcare will have both social and economic returns.\u00a0 It acts as a key labour activation measure, particularly for women   allowing those who wish to work to take up work and it improves educational and social outcomes, by providing our children with the best possible start. In relation to capital expenditure, the Capital Plan recently published by my Department prioritises spending on those areas of greatest need as the economy continues its strong recovery. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department has played a key role in ensuring Ireland met or exceeded its key\u00a0fiscal\u00a0targets in each year of the EU\/IMF programme of financial support resulting\u00a0in a successful exit from the programme in December 2013. Furthermore, as a result of the fiscal policies of this Government and the efforts of the Irish people, Ireland is due to exit the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)\u00a0at the end of this year. With this improved fiscal position the Government has been able to implement increases in expenditure this year and to target further increases in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  When framing Budget 2016 the Government was conscious of the need to continue to address the challenges that face Irish families. Our aim is to ensure that recovery is felt in every home and in every community across the country. With this in mind, resources were provided to allow for significant measures to be implemented across a number of sectors. An additional 2,260 teaching posts will be provided for in 2016 to cater for additional students, improve the staffing schedule and meet special education needs. A package of social protection measures was also introduced to protect some of the most vulnerable in society with increases in the State Pension as well as increases to Child Benefit and the Carer's Support Grant. <\/p>  <p>  With Ireland moving to the preventive arm of the SGP in 2016, sustainable expenditure policy will be anchored in the future by adherence to new fiscal rules which aim to help ensure Ireland makes progress towards its Medium Term Objective (MTO) which is a balanced budgets in structural terms.

The fishing opportunities available to vessels, including within the Irish Exclusive Fishery Zone (EFZ) for 2015 are set out in TAC and Quota Regulation on a stock by stock basis (Council Regulation (EU) 104\/2015 dated 19 January 2015 as amended by Council Regulation 2015\/523 of 25 March 2015, Council Regulation 2015\/960 of 19<sup>th<\/sup>June and Council Regulation 2015\/1961 of 26 October). In addition to the TACs and quotas set down each year by the Fisheries Council, under the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), a Member State may also swap (exchange) quotas with other Member States in a particular year. Details of fishing opportunities available to Member States in EU waters in recent years are available on the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries DG website, using the following link <\/p><p>Lithuania has received a swop for 2015 in respect of Horse Mackerel in ICES area VI, VII, receiving that quota from another Member State, which may be fished in ICES Areas VI and VII which includes Ireland's Exclusive Fisheries Zone. This data is provided on FIDES, the official EU Database of fishing opportunities. The FIDES database shows that Lithuania has a quota of 644 tonnes of Mackerel in ICES Zones VI, VII, VIb, XIb\u00a0of which 544 tonnes has been caught. Lithuania also has a quota of 5,953 tonnes of Horse Mackerel in IIa, IVa, VI, VIIa-c, VIIe-k, VIIIa, VIIIb, VIIId, VIIIe of which 4,085 tonnes has been caught. <\/p><p>All fishing opportunities set down in the TAC and Quota Regulation each year are determined by the EU Fisheries Council based on the scientific advice provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). ICES, in providing advice, considers all of the available data including catch and landing data supplied by the Member States and data provided by Member States scientific bodies, in Ireland&rsquo;s case &ndash; the Marine Institute. The collection and transmission of catch and landings data is mandatory. Member States are also responsible for the collection of scientific data in accordance with EU Data Collection provisions. <\/p><p>Under Regulation (EU) No 1380\/2013 (the CFP basic regulation), changes to fisheries policy involving access or restriction to fishing opportunities or fishing areas come within the sole competency of the EU. Only the EU Commission may propose changes and any such proposal must be adopted under the co-decision process by the EU Parliament and EU Council. Member States, in consultation with the Commission, Member States affected and stakeholders are permitted to introduce non-discriminatory measures for the conservation and management of fish stocks within the 12 mile zone subject to compliance with policy and procedures set down in CFP Regulation. However, access to the 12 mile zone is set down in the CFP Regulation and may not be changed by an individual Member State. <\/p><p>One of the key elements of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy is the introduction of a phased ban on the discarding of unwanted fish catches. The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on the 1<sup>st<\/sup>of January 2015. The EU Commission adopted a Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1393\/2014 on 20 October 2014 which implements a discard plan for certain pelagic fisheries in north-western waters in line with the recommendation of the North West Waters Member States Group. <b><\/b>A Control Experts Group from the North West Waters Regional Group of Member States has been set up and has produced a draft set of recommendations on additional control measures for the pelagic sector in respect of the landing obligation in pelagic fisheries. These draft recommendations have been sent to the Pelagic Advisory Council and the North Western Advisory Council in accordance with article 18 of the CFP basic regulation (EU No 1380\/2013) for their observations. When these are received, the draft recommendations will be considered by the NWW Member States Group. <\/p><p>Control of the vessel within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone is as a matter for the Irish control authorities who monitor fishing activity of all vessels operating the area.\u00a0 The Control authorities have on-going information in relation to the vessels operating in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries zone including their activities and characteristics. Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service.

In 2008 the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government estimated the value of pollinators (including honey bees) for Irish food crops was worth at least\u00a0&euro;53m.  This does not include the value of pollinators in terms of non-food crops and maintaining bio-diversity in the wild.  The value of honey produced in Ireland in 2014 was estimated at slightly over &euro;3m.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has not conducted a study to assess the possible impact of a significant bee disease outbreak, however I fully recognise that a disease outbreak, and especially an exotic disease outbreak, could have a significant negative impact on the Irish bee population.<\/p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of maintaining and further developing a healthy honey bee population.  With this in mind, the signing into law of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 repealed the out-dated 1908 Bee Pest Prevention Act.  American Foulbrood and the Small Hive Beetle are both notifiable diseases under the Notification and Control of Animal Diseases Regulations 2014 (SI No 110 of 2014).  While American Foulbrood has existed in Ireland for many years the Small Hive Beetle has never been found in Ireland.  In response to the 2014 outbreak of Small Hive Beetle in Italy my Department established a sentinel apiary programme earlier this year.  This programme was established with the support of the Federation of Irish Beekeeping Associations and the Native Irish Honey Bee Society.  Volunteer beekeepers in areas which are considered to represent greatest risk for the introduction of pests such as the Small Hive Beetle, as well as other beekeepers are participating in this programme.  Over 20 beekeepers providing a representative geographical spread across the country are involved.  A similar programme has also been rolled out across Northern Ireland.  The sentinel apiary programme is designed with the objective of providing early notification in the event that any exotic pest or disease affecting honey bees arrives in Ireland.  My Department co-ordinates the programme and has provided the equipment and guidelines to the beekeepers and also provides the diagnostic service to implement the programme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a bee diagnostic service is operated from the Teagasc laboratories at Teagasc, Oakpark in Carlow.  Analysis of approximately 300 samples submitted by beekeepers each year are carried out and my Department is informed where a case of a notifiable disease is detected.  Officials in my Department follow up where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The option of national action to limit or ban imports of bees must respect the primacy of EU Regulations.  The EU has strict bee health certification requirements which apply to the international trade in bees.  In accordance with Article 3 of Council Directive 92\/65\/EEC European Union Member States must not prohibit or restrict for health reasons the international movement of bees once all requirements set down in EU legislation have been met.  Direct imports of bees into Ireland from outside the EU are not permitted although imports from other EU Member States which fulfil the EU&rsquo;s bee health certification requirements are permitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111900060#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Payments","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111900060#WRJ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[41110\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111900060#WRJ02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of a single payment for a person (details supplied) in County Mayo; if it will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>The person named submitted a 2015 Transfer of Entitlement Allocation Right and Reference Value application to my Department.

This access built on previous arrangements for fisheries products and has more recently been part of wider trade missions to expand the access for Irish food and seafood products in China.  In the specific case of live crab, I understand from the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority that there has been a steady increase in exports most recently estimated at &euro;3 million in value with a significant number of Irish sea-fishing boats providing this product to up to 8 seafood export companies.  On 29 October 2015, the Chinese food import authorities wrote to the Irish embassy in Beijing expressing concern about the levels of the heavy metal cadmium in live crabs coming from Ireland which the authorities determined exceeded Chinese limits and requested that Ireland ensure only crabs which meet the Chinese standards for cadmium be permitted for export.  I am advised that the UK are currently experiencing similar challenges.<\/p>  <p>  European legislation sets a limit of 0.5 mg\/kg for white muscle meat from the limbs only; however the Chinese authorities are currently applying this limit to all crabmeat.  I understand that crabs take in cadmium from the environment and it builds up in the brown meat of the crab to much higher levels than the white meat.  In view of the Chinese request to meet this standard for live crabs, the SFPA notified Irish crab exporters of the new monitoring requirements and the difficulties this would pose for providing health certificates for live Irish crabs intended for export to China.  The SFPA followed up the notification last week with face-to-face discussions with crab industry to communicate the challenges the application of this standard presents.<\/p>  <p>  As part of efforts to support the trade of compliant safe seafood, a Memorandum of Understanding is in place with the Chinese import authorities which allows for technical dialogue.  With the support of the Marine Institute and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the SFPA has attempted to raise this issue with the Chinese authorities in recent weeks, so far without success.  The SFPA is leading on a technical response to the communication from the Chinese authorities before the end of November with a view to meaningful dialogue around reconsideration of the tissues to which this limit applies.  In order to provide additional support to the SFPA in preparing its technical response, a further meeting between the crab industry, the relevant state agencies (Bord Bia, Marine Institute and BIM), my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is being convened this week.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Marine Institute, that Irish waters have very low cadmium levels.  It is important to bear in mind that heavy metals occur naturally at low levels in the marine environment and as such do not pose a food safety risk.  I am satisfied that the procedures which are in place for monitoring the safety of Irish seafood, including live crab, meet the stringent European standards and consumers can continue to have high confidence in the quality of Irish seafood.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111900060#WRJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111900060#WRJ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[41130\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111900060#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"for details of all instances from 1 January 2000 to 2015 to date where legislation introduced by him or on their behalf, which is enacted and still in force, contains a provision amending the Data Protection Acts to allow for the transfer of personal or other data collected, retained and processed by the State for a particular purpose towards another specific purpose, in tabular form; the financial cost of creating and administering such databases, by case; the projected financial cost for databases not yet complete; the specific legislative provision which enabled such data transfers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1202","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>I have no legislation amending the Data Protection Acts.

I welcome the coming into force of the  European Union Victims Directive on 16 November. I believe that the Directive represents a significant change in the way that victims will be dealt with as they make their way through the criminal justice system. It provides for information to be given to victims from first contact with the criminal justice agencies. It provides for much additional information to be given in the course of the investigation and court process if the person opts in to receive that information. This is key to empowering victims. <\/p><p>The Directive also provides that victims of crime will be able to receive an individual assessment to identify victim&rsquo;s specific protection needs; access victim support services; enjoy safeguards in the context of restorative justice services; access protection and enjoy privacy in the context of the criminal proceedings.<\/p><p>The criminal justice agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions,  have been working to provide a service to victims in line with the standard set out in the Victims Directive. <\/p><p>I also secured an extra 21% for the 2016 budget to fund services to victims of crime via a scheme administered by the Victims of Crime Office in my Department which will assist those organisations in implementing the Directive.<\/p><p>As well as the administrative policies and procedures already put in place by various criminal justice agencies to give effect to the Directive, legislation to transpose the Victims Directive into Irish law is currently being drafted as a priority in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The Bill is expected to be published shortly and it will be enacted as soon as possible after that. <\/p><p>In terms of the injuries received in circumstances of a criminal nature, I wish to inform the Deputy of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal which administers the Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted. The Tribunal considers applications from people who suffer a personal injury or death as a result of a crime of violence. <i>Ex gratia<\/i>compensation may be awarded on the basis of any vouched out of pocket expenses, including loss of earnings, experienced by the victim or, if the victim has died as a result of the incident, by the dependants of the victim. Further information and copies of the Scheme's application forms may found on my Department's website and can be accessed via the following website <b><\/b>.<\/p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question concerning the health services received by the individual concerned, my colleague, the Minister for Health, has arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, he can contact the Minister for Health's Private Office and they will follow the matter up with the HSE. <\/p><p>Finally, I have asked the Garda Commissioner for a report in relation to the particular case referred to by the Deputy .

In addition, the Board took on responsibility for the Family Mediation Service in November 2011, which had been under the auspices of the Family Support Agency up to that point. A key reason for this transfer was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. <\/p><p>The Dolphin House initiative, set up in 2011, operating from the District Court in Dolphin House and involving a co-location of the Courts with a family mediation service and a law centre, has proven successful and was put on a permanent footing in 2014.

The reform is not about privatising hospitals.  This Government does not support the privatisation of hospitals which will continue, in the main, to be funded by the public purse.  The majority of work will continue to be conducted by the public sector.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the development of Trusts a strengthened Accountability Framework has been developed by the HSE, which includes specific targets across the Balanced Score Card of quality, access, finance and HR and timelines for achievement.  One of the most important elements of these accountability arrangements is a requirement that managers at each level ensure that any issues of underperformance are identified and addressed at the level where they occur.  Where there are issues of persistent underperformance, the HSE will implement a formal Performance Escalation, Support and Intervention process as part of its Accountability Framework.<\/p>  <p>  The key point to note here is that if Hospital Groups and Trusts are to have more authority and autonomy (to the extent that any organisation funded by public money can be), they will have to be more accountable.  Where hospitals fail to meet performance targets which others can and where the reasons are internal, as distinct from other causes, then this needs to be tackled.  The taxpayer legitimately expects results when their hard earned money is invested, whether in health or elsewhere.  When additional resources are invested, patients have a legitimate expectation that questions will be asked if improvements are not secured and actions taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111900064#WRN01500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111900064#WRN01550"},{"type":"question","counter":470,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[40950\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111900064#WRN01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"for numbers on, and the waiting times of, the waiting lists for hospital treatment in County Louth, by hospital, by specialty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":471,"content":"<p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is responsible for the collection, collation and publication of Inpatient and Day Case waiting lists.

Health Identifiers are also essential to underpin the modernisation and eHealth agendas for the operation of a high quality health service.

Section 8 of the Act provides that a Minister of the Government may provide information to the Minister for Health for the purposes of establishing or maintaining the accuracy of the National Register of Individual Health Identifiers.  Therefore, the Act provides that the Register can be populated from various data sources on an ongoing basis to ensure data quality, accuracy and completeness and it is intended to exploit and reuse the significant investment in data collection and verification being made by the Minister for Social Protection in the Public Service Card initiative.

The Scheme relies on the financial institutions to propose suitable properties, with the Housing Agency making a determination as to whether the agreed eligibility criteria have been met.  The financial viability of particular transactions, for either the lenders or the AHBs, are commercial decisions to be taken by the individual bodies concerned.<\/p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s on-going process of engagement with the relevant stakeholders involved in the operation of the Scheme, a protocol between all stakeholders was agreed and came into operation in June 2014. The protocol is intended to minimise delays in the process; to ensure that the borrower is involved from the outset; and is kept informed of progress throughout.  A key objective of the protocol is to ensure that cases which are unlikely to be financially viable for the parties concerned are identified as early in the process as possible and withdrawn from further consideration.  Such cases would generally include instances where the funding available to the AHB would not support the purchase of the property unless a discount in excess of 15% of the Open Market Value (OMV) was provided by the lender.

The Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme was rolled out nationally in February 2014.  The LAMTR scheme is similar to the Mortgage to Rent scheme for borrowers with mortgages from private commercial lending institutions, insofar as it also targets low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  The LAMTR Scheme also ensures that the family remains in their home and ownership is transferred to a local authority rather than to an approved housing body as is the case under the Mortgage to Rent scheme in the private lending sector.  Therefore, the family becomes a tenant of the local authority under the LAMTR scheme.  Eligibility requirements under both schemes are in line with other forms of social housing support.<\/p><p>Funding for the Scheme is secured through the annual Estimates process.
