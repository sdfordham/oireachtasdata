I am attending on behalf of Church of Ireland and Protestant primary schools.  I am joined by Dr. Paul Colton, Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross.<\/p><p>  The last time I appeared before the committee in October, I outlined in some detail the costs involved in running a primary school.  I have also noted the committee's recent report on these costs.  Instead of running through the figures again, I would like to focus on some key issues of concern for the Protestant religious minority on this matter.<\/p><p>  Our focus is the provision of suitable primary education for the children of parents of minority Christian religious traditions.  In that regard, we view our schools as part of the existing provision for pluralism and diversity in the Irish education system, a network that is embedded in towns and villages across the country.  Undoubtedly, every committee member will be aware of the value that local Church of Ireland communities in their constituencies place on having their own primary schools.<\/p><p>  We are fully aware that there is a cost involved for us as taxpayers to provide primary level education for all of our children.  The officials from the Department of Education and Skills will undoubtedly have exact figures on those costs.  However, there is also an obligation on all of us to ensure that the best possible education is available to every child in the State.  The impressive range of planned school buildings listed in the Department's five-year plan, with a budget of &euro;1.5 billion, is a display of the necessity of continuing to provide such a quality level of educational infrastructure.<\/p><p>  We are also conscious that, as we meet here today, a value for money, VFM, review of small schools is nearing publication.  The terms of reference of that VFM states that 50 pupils or fewer is taken as the benchmark for a small primary school.  The last such review was conducted as recently as 2006 and continued a policy of supporting schools where numbers were small.  Obviously, this policy has now been reversed and small schools are struggling to cope with the shock of having their minor works grants ceased and their capitation core funding reduced, along with the thresholds for the allocation of teachers being significantly increased and the VFM's sword of Damocles hanging over their heads.<\/p><p>  To retain a school's second teacher in September 2014, it will need 20 pupils, an increase of eight pupils or a 66.6% increase on 2011's figures.  A 14% increase is needed to retain a third teacher and a 7% increase is needed to retain a fourth teacher.  This clearly points to a policy of targeting the level of provision to smaller schools.  The Minister has stated that no one could support a pupil-teacher ratio of 12:1 and that, at 19:1, one-teacher schools would be better off in their allocations than schools with two or more teachers.  He has argued that the current 28:1 ratio is better than the levels that pertained in the 1990s.<\/p><p>  As any school principal in a one or two-teacher school will agree, the reality of life in that school is that the whole school - junior infants to sixth class - is in one or two classes.  One and two-teacher classrooms are multi-age, multi-grade and multi-ability with mainstreamed special needs students.  Modern curricular demands and the Minister's strategies on literacy and numeracy, along with the increased amount of administrative work, all add up to creating a very different school to that which existed 20 ago.  This is an extremely busy educational space and needs more resources, not less.<\/p><p>  In terms of Church of Ireland schools, we are of the view that any policy that seeks to close or wind down a school of fewer than 56 pupils or two teachers will have a disproportionate effect on the Protestant minority.  Based on the returns of 2011-12, 97 of our schools have fewer than 56 pupils.  This accounts for nearly 50% of all Protestant primary schools.  A policy of closing schools of fewer than 56 pupils will close half the Protestant primary schools in Ireland.  This is what we are facing and is the reason that our community is anxious.<\/p><p>  We submit that the aim of the Minister and his Department must be to support a diversity of patronage types through the maintaining of current provision, where reasonable.  The fact remains that primary schools exist to serve small children who cannot be expected to travel on buses or across large amounts of countryside in the depths of winter.  Such a policy would not value and respect children.<\/p><p>  However, we also recognise that there are situations where it is reasonable and sensible to close or amalgamate schools, especially where those schools are in close proximity and there is available capital to provide the same, or better, quality accommodation than the school to be closed.  In this regard, we wish to highlight to the committee that the Protestant minority has been down this road before.  Since the 1960s, we have closed or amalgamated nearly 200 primary schools and reduced our number of secondary schools from 46 to 27.  A further two schools were closed in recent years.  It cannot be claimed that the Protestant communities are not being realistic in this regard.<\/p><p>  The geographical spacing of our current network of primary schools did not happen by accident, but was part of a planning process in dioceses around the country from the late 1960s onwards.  Our difficulty is that, where a Protestant school closes, it is unlikely ever to be reopened.  We must be mindful of the next generation of members of our church and their right to be educated in a school of their own faith.  It is part of our duty of stewardship and is part of our cultural tradition.<\/p><p>  I will conclude by thanking members for the opportunity to highlight these issues this afternoon.  I hope that I have conveyed some sense of the level of anxiety that exists among the Protestant community towards the VFM review of small primary schools, which has been in gestation since 2011.  I suggest that these issues, which we will discuss today, go to the heart of questions such as who we are as a society, what do we value and how do we support that which is culturally distinctive.<\/p><p>  In recent days, the Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross has further consulted with his schools on the issue of the cost of running smaller primary schools.  The committee may be interested in learning this information from him as a primary school patron at first hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300004#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ken Fennelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1372853100,"counter":10,"content":"<p>We can probably deal with that matter when we begin asking questions.

The CPSMA represents almost 2,900 Catholic primary schools in the State.  We do not represent the voice of patrons, although they are critically interested in this issue.  We represent the approximately 18,000 voluntary members of boards of management around the country who offer management of their schools for free to the State.  At the minimum wage and for the minimum number of meetings possible, the saving is probably &euro;1 million per year.  This is good value for money at a time when we are all called to do more with less and for less.<\/p><p>  I will put this issue in context.  We accept that Ireland is in an economic crisis.  This was not caused by any of the 472,000 children served by our schools, nor by their boards of management or staff.  Ireland is a rural community; most people live in population centres of 5,000 or less.  Schools are largely founded on the parish basis.<\/p><p>  Every child has a constitutional right to primary education but many questions arise regarding how it is provided and, in particular, how it is funded.  I do not propose to address this matter now, as it was included in the submission that we sent to the committee.<\/p><p>  The Heckman equation is of importance.  Members will be aware of the Nobel prize winner, who has stated that the earlier the intervention in the life of a child, the greater the outcome for the child, society and the economy.  This is what the Americans call a \"no-brainer\".  The learning outcomes for pupils in so-called smaller schools are just as good as those for pupils in larger schools.<\/p><p>  What has been the effect of the pupil-teacher ratio, which Dr. Fennelly has outlined and I do not propose to repeat, on the schools in question?  The CPSMA surveyed 1,080 of its schools in May to determine what its members thought of the increase.  Some 47% responded, indicating a level of interest in the topic.  Some 9% of the schools in question each lost a mainstream teacher last year, a further 7% will each lose a mainstream teacher this year and a further 9% will each lose a mainstream teacher next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300004#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372853700,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I now invite Mr. Hubert Loftus to make his presentation on behalf of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300005#G00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372853700,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee.  Today we are discussing the impact of the increase in pupil-teacher ratios on small primary schools, as well as issues relating to the costs and funding in such schools.<\/p><p>  At the outset it is important to note the Department of Education and Skills, similar to all other Departments, is operating in the context of a budgetary programme that is designed to put the public finances on a sustainable footing.  It is particularly challenging to achieve savings in the education sector given the ongoing and significant increases in demographic trends across all levels.  For example, at primary level pupil numbers have increased by more than 27,000 in the past four years and further significant increases are projected over the coming years into the medium term.<\/p><p>  The criteria used to allocate teachers to primary schools are published annually on the Department's website and are commonly referred to as the staffing schedule.  The staffing schedule for the 2013-14 school year has been provided in the briefing material for committee members.  The staffing schedule operates on the basis of enrolment bands and does so in a clear and transparent manner.  It currently operates on the basis of a general average of one classroom teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS band 1 schools.<\/p><p>  The staffing schedule gives significant advantages to small primary schools.  For example, a two-classroom teacher school with 24 pupils has an average class size of 12 pupils.  In contrast, a typical ten-classroom teacher school with 272 pupils has an average class size of more than 27 pupils.  One of the savings measures in budget 2012 was a phased increase in the pupil threshold for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools.  The impact of the budget measure means that the staffing levels in small primary schools will no longer be as favourable as they were previously but they will still be better than the staffing schedule general average of 28:1 that operates in medium to larger schools.<\/p><p>  A new staffing appeals process for small schools was introduced as part of the budget 2012 measure.  This enables small schools that are due to lose a classroom post as a result of the budget measure to retain the classroom post on the basis of then-projected enrolments.  The impact of the budget measure on small schools in September 2012 was 64 posts.  This figure includes the 44 schools that lost a classroom post and the 20 schools with increasing enrolments that did not gain a classroom post as a result of the increased pupil thresholds outlined in the budget measure.<\/p><p>  In regard to costs and funding, the Department recognises the challenges faced by schools.  Energy costs are a significant area of expenditure.  The Department is at the forefront of design for school buildings in respect of sustainable energy efficiency.  The capital investment of almost &euro;3 billion at primary level during the past decade has transformed the standard of accommodation in primary schools throughout the country thus helping to reduce operating costs.  The Department also provides guidance to schools on practices in terms of how to improve energy usage with a view to reducing school operating costs and helping the environment.<\/p><p>  The Government has recently appointed a new chief procurement officer for the public sector and the Department is co-ordinating procurement reform across the education and training sector.  In that context, the Department is consulting school management bodies on the best way to enhance procurement processes for the sector in order to achieve savings for individual schools.<\/p><p>  The two main grants that are provided to primary schools for day-to-day running costs are known as the capitation and ancillary grants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300005#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372854300,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I will take questions from the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson, followed by the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson, followed by a representative of the Technical Group, if there is one, followed by a Government representative, if there is one, and followed by Deputies and Senators in the order in which they raise their hands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300006#H00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1372854300,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I join the Chairman in welcoming our guest speakers to the meeting.  They represent the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Catholic Primary School Management Association and the Department of Education and Skills.  I asked for this item to be placed on the committee's agenda because when I visit schools in my constituency, I get feedback from boards of management, teachers and principals about the difficulties being faced by primary and secondary schools at the moment.  I am sure other members of the committee have had similar experiences.<\/p><p>  Over recent years, the pupil-teacher ratio has been changed, capitation grants have been reduced and the minor works grant has been abolished.  In the last couple of budgets, the Minister has outlined that he has sought to protect the mainstream pupil-teacher ratio.  That is not the case for smaller schools with one, two, three or four teachers, however.  As has been outlined, the changes that are being made each year - further changes are expected in the coming year - are having an impact on such schools.<\/p><p>  According to the evidence that has been presented today, half of Protestant schools come in under the 56 pupil threshold.  It is quite concerning that the policies pursued by the Department over recent years will have a disproportionate effect on Protestant schools and consequently diminish the ability of people to continue to receive education with a Protestant ethos in their local areas.<\/p><p>  I want to get feedback from all the speakers on a couple of key points, such as the impact of these changes on school finances and on the day-to-day running and operation of schools.  In its presentation, the Catholic Primary School Management Association referred to research it commissioned last year and conducted by Am&aacute;rach Market Research which concluded that 50% of schools were in debt and a further 21% were on the breadline.  It was decided last year to remove the minor works grant, which was worth a minimum of &euro;5,000 to every school.  The grant was paid in the latter part of the year, so it would have been due to be paid in the coming months.  As we head into the autumn and the funding cliff gets nearer, a real crisis will become more apparent in many of our primary schools.  Last year, many schools managed to soften the impact of the loss of the grant by scrimping and scratching.  I recently visited a school of 80 students that is having to raise funds from families to make up for the loss of the essential &euro;7,000 it used to receive in minor works grant funding.  In a school of 80 students, that &euro;7,000 will have to be collected from 30 or 40 families - certainly less than 50 families.  As we know, household budgets are coming under massive pressure as a result of cuts like the reduction in the back to school grant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300006#H00300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1372854300,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I will give the Deputy a minute to wrap up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300006#H00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1372854300,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will make another couple of points.  I would like some more feedback from our three sets of guests about the crucial issue of financing and funding at school level.  A particular issue has arisen with regard to special needs assistants and resource teachers in recent times.  I would be particularly interested to hear feedback from the General Synod of the Church of Ireland and the Catholic Primary School Management Association in this regard.  What are school authorities saying about the impact these changes are having at school level?  What impact are they having on resource teaching, particularly at the back end of the year when demand increases?  Have students on the ground been experiencing reductions in hours as a result of the SNA cap staying the same despite an increase of 10% in demand?  It was only last week, after they had closed for the summer, that schools were notified of resource teacher and SNA allocations.  I understand from the feedback I have received that this created exceptional difficulties for school management.<\/p><p>  I would like to get feedback on two other points, the first of which is the burden that VAT notification has placed on schools when administering VAT, for example, by making VAT returns.  The lack of a threshold in this regard means that school managers have a responsibility to make a VAT return when it brings in a plumber to do &euro;100 worth of work.  I would also like our witnesses to comment on the issue of procurement.  How do they think that is affecting schools?  I know of many local businesses that in the past have been able to provide better value - or as good value, in many instances - than might be provided under the national guidelines.  It is important for such flexibility to continue to be provided as long as the savings are actually being made.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300006#H00500","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1372854300,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue has spoken for well over five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300006#H00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1372854300,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I will conclude by apologising in advance for the fact that I will have to leave this meeting to attend Question Time in the D&aacute;il Chamber at 2.30 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300006#H00700","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1372854300,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300006#H00800","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1372854300,"counter":23,"content":"<p>As Deputy McConalogue has said, education questions will be taking place in the D&aacute;il in a few minutes.

I will go straight into it.  Do the witnesses agree with me that the use of the pupil-teacher ratio as the main basis for funding schools and teachers is a very blunt instrument in the context of rural areas?  I note that some of the DEIS cutbacks were reversed, but they were not reversed in rural areas.  Could the Department outline why the value for money audit has not been published?  Will it be published soon?  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, alluded last week to the possibility that the pupil-teacher ratio might have to be examined on a national basis.  Is the Department undertaking such calculations at the moment on his behalf?  Would any changes be imposed on schools with one, two, three or four teachers, which have already taken an increase in their pupil-teacher ratios?  What do the other witnesses think about the effect such an extra whammy, so to speak, on top of the whammies, as it were, their schools have already been hit with, might have?<\/p><p>  When the Department is calculating the number of teachers in a school, how cognisant is it of the complexity of teaching in rural schools and small faith-based schools, as outlined at today's meeting?  Such schools may have multiple curricula, multiple age groups, principals who also have teaching duties, children with special needs, and English language or Irish language issues.  A smaller rural school may have less capacity to raise funds because of its smaller parent base.  Many rural schools are in areas that have traditionally had to confront socioeconomic difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300006#H01100","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372854900,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue asked about the cost impact on schools.

I have about 24 years involvement in school management, the last 15 years as a school patron.  County Cork is a pretty good example of what is happening to minority faith schools around the country.  I contacted the schools there, about 70% of which replied.  In short, the collective effect of the cutbacks in a number of areas is immense and it has induced despair and a lot of insecurity about the future, certainly in my type of school.  That is not just in rural areas but in the small city centre schools as well.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about the practical impacts.  The things about which I am being told are the heating being turned off, including during the winter, parents providing personal toiletries, reduction in working materials available to children, a ban on colour photocopying, cutbacks in teacher and board of management training and reduction in the amount of cleaning in schools, all to save money.  Those were the things reported to me in recent days.  <\/p><p>  The capitation to the smallest school in the diocese, by virtue of its enrolment and the demographic change, has been reduced in recent years from &euro;43,817 to &euro;24,000.  That gives the Deputy an idea of the scale.  Water costs have been added so, in general terms, the effects have been immense and, quite simply, the schools cannot operate without fund-raising or without voluntary contributions.  They are saying they are under pressure to increase pressure in regard to voluntary contributions.<\/p><p>  All of the schools have suffered reductions.  At the end of the last academic year, one of my schools was operating at a deficit while at the end of this academic year, five schools are operating at a deficit.  Every single one of my schools is saying that without the support of parents and without voluntary contributions, they would all be in deficit on a scale ranging from &euro;3,000 per year to &euro;16,000 per year.  That is very significant.  They all point to the cessation of the minor works grant as the single biggest issue affecting repairs, which are being done voluntarily or not at all.   <\/p><p>  It is the contention of the General Synod board of education that although this is an unintended consequence of the cuts, it is a consequence none the less and that, effectively, some of these will undermine our involvement, as a group, in education the not too distant future.  I point to the fact that traditionally in many areas, we cater for a large number of communities and a great diversity.  I will conclude by pointing to the fact that one of my schools, which caters for 17 different nationalities in an enrolment of 52 pupils, has been unable to secure its English language support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300007#J00300","nonspeaker":"Rt.

The OECD report, Education at a Glance, confirms that.  We put our main resources into third level, we scale back at post-primary level and primary level seems to be the poor relation.  That has always been the case.  Even when the capitation grant was &euro;200 - it will ultimately be reduced to &euro;176 per pupil, which is an enormous reduction - we said it was insufficient to properly fund schools.  We hear daily from schools in financial crisis.  <\/p><p>  As has already been said, the removal of the minor works grant has, in effect, meant that a school with 100 pupils, for example, is down approximately &euro;10,000, which is approximately one quarter of its funding.

Small schools are those with fewer than 50 pupils.  It is important to look at the context.  They represent about 20% of all schools.

Those figures help to put things in context, in terms of the number of schools, the level of enrolment and the additional classroom posts relative to other schools.<\/p><p>  In terms of funding, the Department fully acknowledges there have been budgetary impacts.  No Minister for Education and Skills likes to be in a position whereby the decisions on funding for schools or capitation budgets involve downward rather than upward adjustments.  Like all other Departments, the Minister is operating within a difficult scenario.  We are trying to manage within a budgetary programme which is trying to put our overall public finances on a sustainable footing.  The best way to ensure the long-term sustainability of our finances is to address that issue. <\/p><p>  The ongoing and significant increase in pupil numbers over recent years, which will continue into the future, has a particular impact.  Over the past four years while we had various budget adjustments at primary level and we also had 27,000 additional pupils.  We had to provide the school places, teachers, capitation funding and ancillary grant funding associated with that.  It is a very difficult scenario within which to operate.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to the minor works grant.  It was last paid to the school system at the end of 2011.  The current grant costs a total of &euro;28 million which the Minister does not have and was unable to pay.  He has committed to paying us as soon as he has the money.<\/p><p>  There is a cap of 10,575 on the number of SNAs.  The level of allocation has been below that over the past number of years.  There has been no policy change in terms of the methodology for the allocation of SNAs.  On resource teachers, last week the Minister announced resource teaching support will remain at this year's level.  There will be a consequential budgetary impact from that.  There has been speculation in the media on the impact that might have on the PTR at primary level.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on such speculation in advance of budget 2014.  The overall position is that a decision will be made by the Government on how it will achieve the necessary savings to manage its budget. <\/p><p>  Reference was made as to whether the PTR is a very blunt instrument.  The same could be said of the points system at third level.  The other side of the coin is that it is a very fair instrument and is open and transparent.  A school comprising 40 or 50 pupils, whether it is in Cork, Kerry, Galway or Roscommon, gets the same number of teachers from the Department irrespective of where it is located.  It is a very fair and objective way to allocate staff resources.  If the methodology is changed it would have an impact on allocations.<\/p><p>  Mr. Lally and I were both part of the team which prepared the small schools value for money report.  It is very comprehensive and examines many of the issues mentioned today, such as ethos, the stock of schools and how many schools are located within a short distance from each other.  It also examines issues such as amalgamation.  The report has been completed and has been with the Minister for the past three weeks.  <\/p><p>  Given that it is a comprehensive report, it will take time for the Minister to consider it and he will want to consult his Government colleagues.  He is fully committed to publishing the report.  All such reports are published in a standard manner.  It is something I have no doubt the committee will devote some time to in the future when it is published and will have a full and comprehensive debate.  A lot of detailed analysis is set out in it.<\/p><p>  In terms of issues like immigration and the impact on PTR, the staffing schedule for the 2013-14 school year has been published.  The phased increases have been set out and there will be no change.  The staffing appeals process introduced last year enables schools which are due to lose a classroom post to be able to retain it if their projected enrolments for September 2013 achieve the required level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300008#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Loftus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372856100,"counter":33,"content":"<p>If there are outstanding issues we can come back to them.

I have no option but to do so as it is a select committee.  I will throw a few grenades and run, if that is okay.  I thank the delegation for the presentations and I am interested in some of the comments made that half the Protestant primary schools in the country could be closed.  There was also a question of values and a suggestion that Ireland is a rural country, as well as the issue of competition between schools and the percentage of schools in deficit.<\/p><p>  I am coming to this partly as a politician but also as somebody who used to be principal of a small school, although it was not in rural Ireland.  There are different perspectives in this regard, including the perspective and individual ethos of the small school and what is being achieved for the children under care.  One can consider the pressures we see in this committee, with people from the likes of the fee-paying sector coming here asking for more resources or trying to state their case in that regard.  Teachers are also keen to maintain pay and pensions, which is their right, and the issue of class sizes is also a common theme across the education sector at primary, secondary and third level.  Most recently we had the issue of special needs etc., so there is much pressure on the education system.<\/p><p>  When I was made principal of a school, the best bit of advice I got was to dig deep into every decision and ensure it is rooted in what is best for the child.  If a decision must be made that is sometimes unpopular or unpalatable, if teachers or parents do not like it or if the board of management needs convincing, one will always win out or have a better chance of winning if the decision is good for the child.  We have already heard accusations of anti-rural agendas or that this report has an impact on one faith over another.  Fundamentally, across the political sphere we are trying to provide an education system at primary and second level that benefits children most.<\/p><p>  The committee visited Finland recently, which was fascinating as every child goes to a school in a particular district.  We met with a conservative member of Parliament who is the chair of the education committee there and she gave us a friendly lecture about the importance of equality in the education system.  The conservative Members of Parliament in Finland are far to the left of anything we have here in Ireland, as we noted when she spoke of the importance of equality.<\/p><p>  What is the value system here?  It is of choice, with a matrix of 3,500 primary schools around the country, all of which must be maintained, built and restructured by the Department of Education and Skills.  They must be staffed, lit, heated and insured.  These are schools in an urban and rural setting.  With regard to the schools in my constituency I sometimes ask where is the educational research indicating that girls' and boys' schools should be separate or that infant and senior schools should be separate, even when they are on the same campus.  Why does this make sense?  There is always a vested interest arguing that girls' or infant education is more important, for example, or that the small school around the corner should not be touched.  Ultimately, a slightly bigger school with more students will have resources feeding into it, and it is much more sustainable to have a number of schools - either in an urban or rural setting - that are easier to finance and much more sustainable in the long term, with greater numbers of staff and students in classrooms.  A greater number of educational resources can flow as a result.<\/p><p>  The biggest expense in the education system that should be questioned is not special needs, class sizes, teacher numbers or remuneration but rather our insistence on maintaining this matrix of primary and secondary schools across the State based on different patronages.  I know this is an uncomfortable conversation for people and the delegation will not agree with my comments.  I am thankful that as soon as I finish my contribution I will have to run.  Nevertheless, there must be a question over the fact that we have, as a State, outsourced education to patron bodies, with the primary ethos in our education system a religious one.  Over 90% of our schools have religious patronage, which may decide that it is right for parents to send their children to school given a certain religious background, etc.  This means that the State, in underpinning that right, must spend more money on maintaining structure.  In different rural or urban parishes, there will be a different matrix of primary schools that must maintain an identity.<\/p><p>  It is not a simple issue and I wish we could have a palace of a primary school in every parish across the nation, with a magnificent building and staff, along with fantastic resources.  Something must give, so what should the education system or the Department do?  It should not give in on class sizes, special needs or any other issues related to children.  Should it give in on having greater centres of excellence in a wider geographical area, which every child could attend and which would have the best of educational supports?  That vision may have to be provided by the educational system.  Unfortunately, part of the problem in this regard is that we may be representing measures that do not show a wider vision of what we could provide.<\/p><p>  After throwing these issues into the mix, I thank the delegation for the contributions.  I appreciate the conversation.  There was mention of the back-to-school report and I look forward to the response of the delegation to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300009#L00400","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1372856100,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Why does the Deputy not stay for some of the answers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300009#L00500","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1372856100,"counter":37,"content":"<p>There are votes taking place in the select committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300009#L00600","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1372856100,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I cannot say that I will throw any bombshells but I must also go.

I will take up from where Deputy &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in left off when he referred to the fact that something has to give.  I am a first-time Deputy and have a lifelong interest in the welfare of our young people through education, sport and the arts.  I find it very difficult to sit in meetings like this and engage in the level of discussion we are having because I know the impact the current economic and financial situation is having on society in Ireland.  I find it very difficult but this difficulty comes second when listening to some of the nauseating comments and reports made by Fianna F&aacute;il spokespersons, who are members of a political party that, more than any other, plunged us into the circumstances in which we find ourselves.<\/p><p>  I understand the Right Rev. Dr. Paul Colton referred to the responsibility on parent-teacher groups and boards of management and the voluntary sector that takes up so much of the slack.  That has always been the way even in the days when we were told the country was awash with money.  I know from my work on the ground with boards of management and parent-teacher groups how much of that responsibility was shouldered by the voluntary sector.  <\/p><p>  One of the contributors referred to how teachers are often depicted as having long holidays and short working hours.  I have been married to a teacher who became a deputy principal in recent years for over 30 years.  There is a growing awareness, which has been there for years, of that responsibility shouldered by the teacher - the long working hours, the extracurricular activities and, based on my wife's experience, working in what would be classified as disadvantaged areas.  I am fully aware of that and I think there is a wider appreciation of what is involved here.<\/p><p>  I am reminded of the issue of responsibility.  I see the Minister for Education and Science is in the D&aacute;il at the moment.  I heard a number of references this area during the earlier part of the lifetime of this Government.  To put it in context, and I am addressing not just groups in education but other groups, when we took office just over two years ago, the Government had five months' worth of money to provide education and services in health, the environment and across the board.  We are charged with the responsibility of not only saving this country but also ensuring that the measures are put in place, difficult as they may be, to ensure that children and parents in the future will have a better quality of education and life.  It would be easier for us to go over our heads, as other Governments have done in the past, but that would be very foolish in the long term.<\/p><p>  Yes, it is very difficult.  It is difficult for me as a backbench Deputy to support some of the measures that have been put in place but I trust the Minister in what he is doing.  In the context of budgetary constraints, it was said that Michael Collins had more resources available to him than the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, had two years ago.  That continues to be the case.  <\/p><p>  We have a long road to go.  My role as a backbench Deputy is to ensure that every measure taken and budget introduced is done so in the fairest and most measured way possible.  I will conclude by saying that as a measure of the concerns people had, in the run up to the last budget, no group telephoned, e-mailed or contacted me or called to my home more than teachers, principals and people working in education in the voluntary sector.  In the aftermath of the last budget, people were on balance happy with the measures taken because they were seen to be fair, particularly in the context of the pupil-teacher ratio.  We now know that additional moneys are to be taken out of the budget.  This experience today, in addition to the other experiences I have had, will challenge me to go to the Minister to ensure that the budget for 2014 will be the fairest possible in the overall scheme of things.  I thank the delegation for coming here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300010#M00400","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1372856700,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I was going to raise a question about the issue raised by Deputy &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in.

There have been many new schools in recent years but when one has parental choice as the centre of one's education provision at primary level, parents use that to confer advantage on their child, understandably so.  What happens then is that one gets segregation on the basis of class, race and so on.  We have schools in Lucan where almost 90% of students are non-Irish.  Many of them will get citizenship as time goes on.  Segregation definitely exists and it is not through the choosing of the parents or children concerned.  It is because they are being left out and must then be catered for by emergency schools.  Very often, it is the faith schools that have the best record in terms of integration of different nationalities.  That is another issue with which I would be very familiar from my community, as would others.  Parental choice can lead to separation and a more unequal system.<\/p><p>  I accept the point made by Senator O'Donnell and Ms Flynn.  I agree that small schools and smaller classes are better and I see that there is an issue around preserving rural communities.  On the other hand, we must go back to the notion that schools are for the community.  They are not just for parents and children; they are for the community as well.  My father used to say that a school is of as much interest to the man on the No. 26A bus who has no children in school as it is to the parents of children.  Schools are about the community as well.  Could the delegation go back over the questions that were asked and make their concluding remarks?  I will start in reverse with Mr. Loftus.

As Mr. Loftus said I am with the inspectorate which evaluates teaching and learning in all classrooms in all State primary schools.  By their nature, these classrooms and the schools will vary, including, as mentioned, in terms of location whether urban or rural, in terms of gender and language of instruction, school size and the profile of the pupils and their backgrounds.  In my experience and that of my colleagues in the inspectorate, the quality of educational achievement of the pupils in a school is dependent on a series of variables that impact both individually and collectively on their attainment.  The inspector would view certain key drivers as pushing educational quality and pupil attainment.  As such the inspectorate would focus on these aspects when it goes about its work.<\/p><p>  Among the aspects we focus on when we make our evaluation judgments would be the following: planning and preparation by the teacher, that is, how well they have planned and their level of preparedness for their lessons; the way they manage and organise their classrooms; the way they monitor and assess students work; and their own personal knowledge and competence, which would include the methodologies they might use.  Factors in this latter aspect include whether they are current and appropriate, and skilled in the use of bulky class teaching methodologies, including differentiation.  This is a particular methodology employed to ensure every child gets an education that is geared, programmed and tailored for their particular ability.  Additional factors include the quality of pupils' learning experience and the student voice.  We would tune into the student voice and make our judgments on it as we would on the quality of the leadership and management of the school and the level of engagements by parents and community.<\/p><p>  These are among the many factors and variables that we look at when arriving at our judgments.  I am not trying to dismiss the role of class size as an influencing factor on pupil achievement but what I am endeavouring to do is provide a more balanced and accurate representation of the many factors that are involved in pupil attainment.  In my opinion and in the opinion of much research, it would be misleading to inflate the impact of school size by comparison with the impact that these other factors and other variables would hold on student attainment.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Mr. Hubert Loftus, mentioned the value for money review, of which I was a part.  At the request of the value for money review committee, the inspectorate conducted an analysis of data it holds from its own inspection programmes to ascertain whether there is a relationship between the size of the school and the quality of the student outcome or learning, as indicated by inspectorate judgment and the views and opinions of parents and pupils that were gathered from questionnaires.  I can speak further about this in a moment if members wish but the finding was that very extremely minor differences were noted in the areas evaluated there was not a significant correlation or relationship between school size and the quality of student outcomes.  This is something that is reflected in other international research.  The benefits of small class size were found to be most prominent in the earlier years but it has also been shown to have a short-lived effect and it diminishes over a short period with the result that the majority of countries consider that investment in education is better channelled into some other competences and variables, most particularly, teacher ability, teacher competence and teacher upskilling and training rather than on reducing class size as a single variable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013070300011#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Lally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372857300,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell asked what we would like.

They have local democracy in action and management for free.  Third, I would like people to acknowledge that statistics and money are the crudest things one can use to measure what we are talking about in childhood education.  The PTR does not reveal the human story.  Fourth, I would like joined-up thinking.  What does it cost to keep a child at school currently?  I suggest it is less than &euro;1 per day, per annum.  Where can one get better value than that?  If a child drops out of that system for the want of support or resourcing or special needs being addressed and becomes a burden on the State, what is the cost of keeping that person supported in an alternative setting?  I suggest it is approximately &euro;70,000 per annum.<\/p><p>  Finland was mentioned by one of our colleagues.  So far as I understand, the Finns prioritised their education system over multi-annual budgets and said they were not to be touched because they saw that the children in schools at that time were the adults of the future to recover from where Finland found itself.  Perhaps we could learn from that.<\/p><p>  There are three other issues.  We are working on an amalgamation document and we have a discussion paper ready for patrons because we do not represent them here.  Essentially, the discussion paper is a patrons' issue but we are prepared to share it with anybody who wishes to see it.  We are also working on a document on inclusion, which we have provided to the patrons, in order that schools can become inclusive.

We do not represent patrons and, obviously, the Catholic patrons have very strong views and much to say on these areas.<\/p><p>  I accept what has been said in regard to parental preference.  Recent surveys of parents on preference show that parents have opted for the system that we have.  One thing we might suffer from in Ireland is that we always feel we are the poor relation, that we do not do things best compared to international practice in terms of our own systems.  If we look across the world, at our nearest neighbour, at France and Germany, it is clear they all have multiple systems of delivering education at primary and other levels.  The important point is that it does raise standards.

I was delighted to hear the Deputy's affirmation of parental involvement and voluntary contributions.  The reason I emphasised that they are essential and that the schools have said that they could not live without them is that this committee in its report of last month suggested they should be discouraged, if not completely prohibited.  That is not realistic as things currently stand in our experience.<\/p><p>  The other point to emphasise is that in our view the cutbacks, which we were invited to come here today to discuss, as well as the pupil-teacher ratio, are having, albeit unintended, a disproportionate impact on our minority communities.  We understand the budgetary argument but when we hear it we also hear a subtext that might be interpreted as our not being able to afford minorities in this current configuration.  When the budgetary argument is being put, which we understand, and we have do our share of sharing the pain, we wonder where minorities in the current configuration are to fit in.  The current configuration is what Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in raised.  I am sorry he is not present to hear my answer because he seldom replies to me on Twitter either.  I was looking froward to what he would have to say but the question he asked is a big one and the Chairman also addressed it.<\/p><p>  The brief we came to discuss today was the pupil-teacher ratio and cutbacks but invariably I have found of late that when we discuss education matters in this country there is always somebody who broadens the debate, sometimes it becomes a bit of a <i>non sequitur <\/i> or a red herring, and obfuscates the specific issue by saying we should not have our current education system and that we should have a different one.  There seems to be a naive implication that such a different education system would be free which of course it would not be.  I accept that Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, Senator O'Donnell and the Chairman were not saying that.  However, those are big questions.  We were invited here today to talk about the pupil-teacher ratio and cutbacks.  From my point of view, and I am sure from the point of view of General Synod Board of Education, if the State wants to discuss the bigger question, we would be happy to do that.  We would ask how do we fit into the bigger question.  The Chairman rightly identified the issue of parental choice, which is a human right that has been affirmed.  Parental choice is a driving force.  <\/p><p>  Finland was mentioned.  Religious demography very much comes into this.  It is all very well to say that a State multidenominational model is best but how do we guarantee the rights of minorities in a situation where there is an overwhelming religious demographic factor of one kind?  Finland is a good example of the inverse of that where the vast majority of the population is largely secularr, and where, in effect, the religion is a folk religion and residually evangelical Lutheran.  It is a good inverse comparison and worth studying.  I know a good deal about Finland as I have been there many times in the courser of my work.<\/p><p>  Those are all big issues which we would be open to discussing but we have not been asked to do so and we were not invited here today to discuss them.  Parental choice is hugely important.  I do not think it is the route that the Minister seems to have chosen.  Instead of consolidating that model, he has chosen a pluralisation of patronage models.  It seems he is taking a different route and I wonder if he realises the<i> realpolitik<\/i>  that we cannot get the one Tesco model.  <\/p><p>  My colleague, Dr. Fennelly, had a good point and, if I may, I will allow him conclude on that.

There is no connection among all those bodies on a policy level.  I cannot see any national policy body that is bringing those together in a strategic way, certainly at primary level.

I taught in Carysfort as a young lecturer for years and I am a great believer in the teacher being the great motivator and inspirer, no matter how many people are to one's right or left.  Perhaps we can speak about that in the future since it has been raised as an issue.  I am delighted to hear that it is so central now because it was not so heretofore and had become unfashionable.  Teachers are central to any education whether one is five or 23 years of age but that point is completely lost on universities.

The joint committee has a number of motions before it for discussion this afternoon and with the agreement of members, I wish to conclude this part of the meeting no later than 3.50 p.m.  The motions referring to the sub-committee on global taxation specifically deal with the terms of reference conferred on the sub-committee by the joint committee.  My recollection and understanding from previous lengthy debates prior to establishing the sub-committee was the joint committee had agreed the priority now was for it to examine the international taxation architecture and how Ireland interacts therewith.  The effect was to build a report that had standing and, having re-examined the tapes of those earlier discussions, I can confirm the joint committee agreed this would be the case.  It was agreed that in the first instance, the sub-committee would engage with the policy platform.  This includes the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the OECD and policy, academic and taxation experts.  It was then for the committee to decide on its next step, once this initial phase concluded.  Deputy Pearse Doherty specifically requested that witnesses not be confined to what has been termed \"forces of the State\" or forces deemed to be representative of what is termed \"statist\" views.  It was agreed that the joint committee would invite independent experts to brief the sub-committee on its examination.  However, it was clearly agreed not to invite the multinationals.<\/p><p>  The joint committee is now returning to this issue and the motions were received in the following order: the motion tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty, followed by motions tabled by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Higgins.  I also note Deputy Dara Murphy submitted an amendment to Deputy Pearse Doherty's motion.  While I will take the motions in the order in which they were submitted, the motion from Deputy Pearse Doherty and the amendment submitted by Deputy Dara Murphy will be disposed of first, followed by the motions of Deputies Boyd Barrett and Higgins, in that order.<\/p><p>  For the information of members, if a motion is agreed to, the joint committee must make a report on the matter to the Houses.

Members subsequently have witnessed investigations or hearings in both Britain and the United States and in particular, the damaging reference in the United States in which this State was named as a tax haven, together with countries such as Bermuda, which has been damaging to our reputation.  However, it does not deflect from the imperative that this issue must be discussed in our own home territory, where these companies are incorporated.  It took six months for the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to deal with the proposal I made in November and to agree to examine this issue.<\/p><p>  It has been my clear intention, which I never kept from the joint committee, that as part of this, members should invite multinationals to appear before the sub-committee to seek their views on where Ireland sits in respect of multinational corporation tax.  It is my clear view that the sub-committee to be established and which met for the first time last week, should not be barred from asking the multinational companies to appear before it and to provide information or evidence as to their perception of the corporation tax rule in the State.  However, from the previous meetings and discussions it is clear that a number of members of this joint committee wish at all costs to avoid seeing the multinational companies appear before the sub-committee, including companies such as Apple and Google, which have been named in international hearings.  It would discredit this committee's work to invite, as members have agreed at the sub-committee meeting, 17 different individuals, four from what one might call State groups, namely, the OECD, the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, as well as 13 or 14 academics, without asking a single multinational corporation.  Members must remember that some of these multinational corporations, such as, for example, Apple Operations International, have been named and in the case of the latter, has given evidence voluntarily to a Senate committee in the United States that for four years, it recorded profits of &euro;29.9 billion, which equates to 30% of Apple's entire global profits.  It is incorporated in Ireland and does not pay a single cent of tax in this State or in any other jurisdiction internationally.  Moreover, it employs no one in this State.<\/p><p>  As for having a discussion that will take a number of weeks, possibly a number of months, to deal with this issue without asking any multinational company to come before it, I note the amendment to my motion seeks to have the committee finish its work and make a report and thereafter have a discussion or possible recommendation that witnesses be brought in at a later stage.  It is my view, from listening to members of this joint committee, that they wish at all costs to avoid having the likes of Apple, Google or Facebook appearing before the committee.  However, this would be folly for members and would discredit the type of work they are doing.  If Apple is willing to come before the United States Senate and if other companies are willing to attend hearings in Britain, members should be willing to request, if it is deemed appropriate by the sub-committee, such companies to appear before them and answer questions as to whether they consider the corporation tax laws in this State and internationally to be appropriate or whether they are using the corporation tax rules to create bigger dividends for their shareholders at the expense of the Exchequer here.<\/p><p>  Consequently, I wish to push my motion and feel very passionate about this issue.  As stated previously, I raised the original motion more than seven months ago and setting up this type of sub-committee with a bar on its ability to invite multinational companies before it makes no sense or logic to me at present.  Members should not be afraid of asking questions as these corporations are major entities.  I do not single out Apple, although it has been singled out in the United States Senate.  Other corporations, which are not availing of such loopholes, should also be invited to appear before the sub-committee to seek their views.  However, these corporations have more revenue than does the entire State and their means are greater than those of this State.  They are big enough and well capable of appearing before a hearing of the sub-committee to answer questions on evidence they have given, which is already in the public domain, in the United States Senate.<\/p><p>  Other companies, which are complying completely with the laws - as is Apple because the laws allow it to do this - also should be invited to explain to members of the sub-committee their view, from a multinational's perspective, of how Ireland's corporation tax rules sit with them.  It is fine and well to have the State bodies and the academics here to give their views but the missing piece of the jigsaw concerns the multinational corporations.  A refusal to do this sends out a terrible signal, both domestically and internationally, that we do not wish to deal with the issues that have been raised at an international level.

There is merit in the joint committee seeking to discover and engage in a process of understanding how our tax infrastructure works in an international context.  My amendment largely mirrors the motion tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty that the joint committee should invite before it representatives of the OECD, which is carrying out a study of world taxation practices, the Department of Finance, Revenue Commissioners and also the Minister.  The sub-committee had a discussion on whether other groups should appear before it.  If it is to complete its work quickly and with clarity, it must have clear terms of reference.  <\/p><p>  No representative of a small company or large multinational should be put in a position of having to come to the House to discuss how it engages with our taxation system.

The company in question employs 4,500 people, many of whom live in my constituency of Cork North Central and the Chairman's constituency.

My greatest fear is that members will engage in a form of showboating.  The sub-committee has work to do in carrying out distinct research and producing clear recommendations.

To respond to Deputy Humphreys, there is no suggestion that we would speak to representatives of any multinational corporations before the Minister for Finance, officials from the Department of Finance, Revenue Commissioners and OECD and academic experts have appeared before the sub-committee.  It is proposed to have these witnesses appear first and thereafter representatives of the multinational companies would come before the sub-committee.  Despite the fact that I have been very open in stating I want representatives of some of the multinational companies that have been named in various hearings to come before the sub-committee, I would also like representatives of multinational companies that have not been accused of anything to come before us.<\/p><p>  To get to the nub of the issue, the joint committee has asked a sub-committee to do a report on corporation tax as it applies to multinational companies.  The origin of this request was the motion the joint committee passed in November.  The sub-committee's hearings can be structured and shaped in different ways.  International issues arise regarding companies located in Ireland which are aggressively involved in evading tax.  That is the reality.  We are now asking a sub-committee to do a report without allowing it to question any multinational company before the report is submitted to the joint committee.  If we proceed with this approach, the process will be a farce.  <\/p><p>  All of us wish to protect jobs and I agree with Deputy Dara Murphy's comments on the need to do so.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not seek an increase in corporate tax but we must deal with realities.  We know there are two companies which are incorporated in Ireland and not tax resident in this State or anywhere else in the world.  One of them does not have any employees in the State and even if we were to raise corporation tax to the roof, we would not get any money from it because it does not pay a cent of tax here or elsewhere in the world.

Having requested the sub-committee's establishment, I do not doubt that multinational corporations will be brought in at some point.

We agreed that the first thing we would do is understand exactly how the system works.  We said we would listen to independent parties that would be able to lay out for the sub-committee and therefore for the joint committee the mechanics of the different types of international laws in Ireland and abroad that are potentially being used for tax avoidance.  We agreed that after we had completed this phase of our work and compiled a report on it, and ensuring the full joint committee and potentially the Oireachtas had been given time to digest the report, we would move into the next phase of the process, during which the multinational corporations as a group would be brought in.  For me, there is no question of trying to avoid bringing multinational corporations before this committee or before the sub-committee.

I find it regrettable that we are back here this afternoon.  Having listened to the tapes, I have reaffirmed my interpretation of what happened in private session.  At last week's select committee meeting, different people put a different interpretation on what was agreed.  We are here this afternoon to clarify the interpretation of that first meeting.  It has been mentioned that committees in other jurisdictions have compiled their own reports.  They have done so for their own reasons, in particular, their own national reasons.  Any work that will be done by this committee will be done for our own reasons.  We will not react in a crisis-driven way to reports coming out of other jurisdictions.  Our work will suit our purpose.<\/p><p>  I can summarise what was agreed the first time we discussed this in private session by referring to a point I made on that occasion.  If one wants to discuss the offside rule because there are accusations that companies are playing offside, one should bring in FIFA and UEFA rather than Manchester United or Chelsea.  That was the point I made at the time.  However, the purpose of this meeting is to clarify what the select committee should do.  We are back here this afternoon on that basis.  We have covered this issue at length.  We are all very busy.  I am busy and my colleagues are busy.  There is a certain level of frustration about the downtime, as I call it, which is involved in having to go over background work that has been done already.  This work was done and agreed, but we are back here this evening to clarify it.  On that basis, we need to give final and utter clarification on the work of the select committee.  In keeping with Standing Orders, I propose that Deputy Dara Murphy's amendment to Deputy Pearse Doherty's motion be agreed.  Is that agreed?

I am happy to report to this committee that it has, in my view, been a very successful one for the Department of Finance and it has, in many respects, exceeded our expectations when we were planning the Presidency in 2012.<\/p><p>  I wish to give the committee an overview of the achievements of the Presidency in the past six months.  We had six formal ECOFIN Councils and one highly successful informal ECOFIN in Dublin.  Much work was achieved in these Councils in terms of getting agreement on specific files and on managing the business of the Council.  However, the Presidency is more than achieving agreement at ECOFIN - important as that is - it is also carried on in work in Council working parties, engagement with the European Parliament and engaging with the European institutions.  There is also the practical organisational work which often occurs behind the scenes.  Without all this work we would not have had such a successful Presidency.<\/p><p>  The aims of the Presidency for the ECOFIN Council were set out in our list of priorities published at the end of 2012.  We set ourselves a number of objectives under the broad thematic heading of stability, jobs and growth.  We achieved much of what we set out to achieve last January, and I consider that what we proposed to achieve at that stage was, by any standards, an ambitious package of objectives.  Indeed, in financial services we have achieved significantly more than was planned.  We planned to carry out work on economic governance &ndash; principally in the management of the European semester process and in seeking agreement on the two pack of economic surveillance measures for the eurozone.  In financial services we prioritised work on the banking union proposals designed to break the link between the financial sector and the sovereign.  We targeted agreement on the capital requirements directive, the single supervisory mechanism, and bank resolution and recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013070300010#K00300","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372862700,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Donnelly must be in the Chamber at 4.30 p.m.  With the agreement of other members, we will allow the Deputy to contribute first before resuming with the normal running order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013070300012#M00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1372862700,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and Deputy Michael McGrath for allowing me to speak first.<\/p><p>  As a member of the Opposition, I am either detached or semi-detached from the Irish Presidency, but it appears the Minister and his officials did an excellent job during the Presidency, even if one or two things did not go exactly as they may have hoped.  The Minister, in particular, has been operating in a highly constrained environment in ECOFIN given the domestic politics at play in Germany, where a general election is imminent.  I heard repeatedly from officials in Brussels that the Minister and his officials did a great job.  Those with whom I spoke were very impressed with the Irish team at a political and an official level.  I wish to acknowledge this publicly.<\/p><p>  On the bank resolution mechanism, the technical note from the European Union is dense and complicated.  I ask the Minister to request that his officials prepare for the joint committee a note explaining exactly how a resolution would proceed.  Phase one involves a bail-in of 8%, phase two involves a 5% bail-in, and so forth.  It would be useful if the Department provided one or two worked examples of a theoretical bank entering a resolution process, as it would help us to understand this complicated mechanism.<\/p><p>  Before the most recent ECOFIN meeting, I understand the Minister's position was that he would seek to have small depositors take precedence over senior bondholders.  I agree with that position, although the Minister will have to forgive me if I understood his position incorrectly.

I will try to simplify the process and perhaps it should be considered in the following manner.  The Deputy will remember the concept of an institution being \"too big to fail\".  The reason this concept was in the public consciousness, especially in the United States, was that a bank was considered to be too big to fail when its failure would bring down the sovereign.  The opening position is that banks may no longer be too big to fail, which means not every bank that goes bust must be resolved.  Instead of calling on taxpayers to bail out banks, the assets of the impaired bank will be used as a bail-in mechanism to liquify the assets to repair the hole in the bank in question.  That is the general principle.  <\/p><p>  In proceeding with a bail-in mechanism, the assets covered by the bail-in are placed in a hierarchy, starting with the equity, followed by junior bondholders and, thereafter, senior bondholders.  A guarantee will apply to deposits of up to &euro;100,000, which will be sacrosanct and, therefore, exempt from the bail-in, and preference will be given to other depositors.<\/p> <p>To distinguish between exemption and preference, up to &euro;100,000 is guaranteed and exempt and preference would apply to individuals with deposits over &euro;100,000 which would have preference, for example, over corporate deposits.  The idea is that preference would be given to what, in law, is called \"natural persons\" with deposits over &euro;100,000, that preference would also be given to SMEs with money on deposit and that the first line of deposits would be the corporate deposits of large corporations with large holdings.  That is the way it runs on the deposit side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013070300012#M00400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372863300,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Will SMEs and normal depositors with amounts over &euro;100,000 have preference over senior bondholders or will they still rank the same as senior bondholders?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013070300013#N00200","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1372863300,"counter":197,"content":"<p>They will.  The legal link and the <i>pari passu<\/i> link between senior bondholders and depositors has been broken and all deposits will move to a lower level in the hierarchy of bail-in assets, as we discussed previously, but within that hierarchy the position has been nuanced and refined more and a differentiation has been made between natural persons with big deposits, over &euro;100,000, and SMEs as against corporations.  We can get the paper that has been requested.<\/p><p>  In regard to the figures of 8%, 5% and so on, if a bank is bust and needs a rescue and cannot manage without help, there is a resolution authority which organises the bail-in.  If the level of impairment is 8% of its balance sheet, all of the rescue will be by bail-in.  If the level of impairment exceeds 8% of its balance sheet, it will move to the next phase, the next 5% of its balance sheet; an amount equivalent to the next 5% of its balance sheet can be accessed elsewhere - a resolution fund the sovereign might have or the ESM.  In a very bad situation such as in the case of AIB, where the level of impairment exceeds 8%, plus 10%, and<b><\/b>there is still a level of impairment beyond 13% of its balance sheet, it again goes back to a bail-in and the resolution authority might return to the senior bondholders for an additional haircut or the ESM could be directly accessed at that point.  In the first phase, in the case of the figure of 5%, there would be indirect involvement by the ESM because the sovereign would have to apply.  However, for the tranche beyond the figure of 13%, if such a case arises <i>in extremis<\/i>, the application could be made by the institution directly to the ESM if it required recapitalisation.  That is the general position.  I am explaining it very simply, but we will get a paper for the Deputy which is not quite as simple but not as complex as a technical paper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013070300013#N00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1372863300,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Perhaps with a worked out example to show how it works<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013070300013#N00400","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1372863300,"counter":199,"content":"<p>The Deputy can work the examples.

One is broad and the other is specific.<\/p><p>  Across the early phases of the banking union that the Minister has described, is it not likely that we could face the risk of real fragmentation within the European banking system?  Let us consider what has occurred in the sovereign debt markets.  For a while, the financial markets lent to countries as if no country could go bust.  Ireland and Germany got money at the same rate as Greece.  However, we are now going to be in a position whereby explicitly there will be a risk that banks can go bust and we will have a way of dealing with it.  Financial markets will lend to banks pricing in that risk and one bank will lend to another bank pricing in that risk.  Will we not face real pressure on the banking system during that period?<\/p><p>  My second question is specific.  A constituent who heard about the proposal on the radio put it to me that his family has all its money in a single joint bank account.  It amounts to a little over &euro;100,000.  If a bank was to go under, then, in the context of a joint or family bank account, what is the bail-in risk that a joint account would face, as opposed to the account of an individual?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013070300016#Q01000","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1372865100,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I will address the fragmentation risk first.  The European banking system is rather fragmented at present.  I have just remarked on the different price of money in the different jurisdictions as represented by ten-year bond prices, for example, and that shows the level of fragmentation.  We are trying to create a banking union with one set of supervision rules, resolution rules and deposit guarantee rules such that we remove the fragmentation.  The process will be towards a unitary banking system rather like the United States.  There will still be some variation depending on the cost bases of the banks.  Of course people will price in risk when they are dealing with banks and the banks will price in risk when they are dealing with customers, but that is normal banking.  I am suggesting that as it develops, as the European authorities insist that banks are absolutely adequately capitalised and as they carry out stress tests to measure the level of capitalisation - they will carry out stress tests again next year universally throughout Europe - the fragmentation will be taken out and, therefore, one of the primary purposes of the banking union will be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013070300016#Q01100","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372865700,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I have already given them that advice but I can go back and tell them that it has been endorsed by the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013070300017#R00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1372865700,"counter":285,"content":"<p>The Deputy can say he has a friend who told him this might be a good idea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013070300017#R00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1372865700,"counter":286,"content":"<p>On that note, I think Deputy Donohoe is advised to spread his money over four or five institutions this afternoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013070300017#R00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1372865700,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I should make it clear that I do not have enough myself to get to that point.

Ms McManus is doing very good work for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in her current role.  The 1325 Monitoring and Evaluation Group was established to track the implementation of Ireland's National Action Plan on UN Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security.  The national action was launched by the T&aacute;naiste and the former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson in November 2011.  It sets out the way that Ireland will promote and implement the objectives of the UN Security Resolution 1325 in its programme support activities, diplomatic advocacy and policy making across the interrelated areas of peace, security and development.  In May, the midterm review of the plan was completed by independent consultants who identified the progress that has been made to date and the challenges that still need to be met within the remaining 18 months of the plan.  This is an important and timely meeting as there is 18 months remaining before the next plan.  We are very pleased that Ms McManus will make a presentation.<\/p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.

I am doing very well and am very happy to be back, and to be a nuisance.<\/p><p>  This committee and the Seanad have passed resolutions on violence against women in conflict in the Congo, for example, and so on.  I am familiar with Resolution 1325.  However, I find myself increasingly irritated by the phrase \"gender-based violence\" because it is far too narrow, especially in sub-Sahara Africa and such places.  Gay people are the most immediate target and young men and boys are consistently raped, whether they are gay or not.  Then there is the appalling situation in places such as Uganda and a majority of sub-Saharan African countries where homosexuality is still a criminal offence.  Regrettably, very vulnerable people are being made political scapegoats.  It is not a revulsion or an understanding of gay people; it is just that they are convenient.  They are as convenient as the Jews were in Germany.  The shocking aspect is that they are being assisted, and there is strong collaboration, between the main Christian churches and they should be denounced for that.  If there is any central control in those churches they should be firmly told that.  Why do we not say that to the Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Brown?  That is a political office.  We should tell him we are not having that.  We are not having pronouncements from the Vatican any more.  We have a good Pope.  He has been marvellous so far with the poor.  I hope he will learn a bit about gay people but it is not appropriate for a state, and the Vatican purports to be a state, to give support or even half-hearted objections to vicious regimes.<\/p><p>  When taking gender-based violence into account it should be extended.  We should have the courage to say the most vulnerable people now include gay people who are the bottom of the pile and people like David Kato who I met in Dublin Castle with the Front Line Defenders who are wonderful.  We can be so proud of the organisation Mary Lawlor set up but within six months of that, David Kato was savagely destroyed as a result of front page headlines in the newspapers identifying him, with the support of the Christian churches.  It was truly shocking.  I hope that will be included in the witnesses' brief and that they will try to expand it to take in gay people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013070300005#D00800","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1372859400,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Does Ms McManus wish to comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013070300005#D00900","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372859400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I will ask the other two representatives to speak but I would say that we are governed by our brief, and our brief is determined by Resolution 1325, and we cannot change those terms.

That is the kick-off for the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 process.<\/p><p>  Senator Norris mentioned the concept of gender-based violence.  Conceptual thinking is wider in that respect but it is very often used as violence against women, etc.  However, academic research has widely acknowledged that it is violence against men and women, and the inequality in the structures we are working in, that are the main problem.

In her introductory remarks Ms McManus mentioned the mass rape in Syria.  We have had presentations to the committee and elsewhere in the Oireachtas on that.  Mass rape as a weapon of war in Syria is frightening, and the situation pertaining there is desperate.<\/p><p>  With regard to Northern Ireland, some months ago I had correspondence from a number of women's groups and I arranged for the Foyle women's group to make a presentation at the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Deputy Crowe and some of our other colleagues may have been present at that meeting.  The picture they painted for us was a very difficult one in terms of the desperate situation confronting many individuals and families, particularly women.  It will be unfortunate if the Six Counties, Northern Ireland, again becomes a no-man's-land that does not come under any country's Resolution 1325 policy.  <\/p><p>  Ms McManus will recall that for the best part of 20 years when policy was being developed and issues addressed regarding the North of Ireland there were common chapters in some policy documents.  There might be some way of having a common chapter in the British Resolution 1325 policy, and in the Irish one, but under no circumstances should Northern Ireland be left out.  Unfortunately, there are many difficulties in Northern Ireland.  Some of it may be confined to areas of huge disadvantage, particularly in the loyalist communities and also in some of the Nationalist communities.  It is an area in which any policy initiative that can be taken should be taken.  I hope Ms McManus might be able to address it from the point of view of ensuring, as she mentioned earlier, that it will not be ignored because the presentations were made to us, and correspondence I have from individuals and groups painted anything but a rosy picture for some communities and families, and women in particular.<\/p><p>  With regard to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013070300005#D01300","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1372859400,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Does Ms McManus want to comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013070300005#D01400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372859400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>We are keen to do what we can.

In the North support programmes exist to promote women's participation in conflict prevention, peacekeeping, peace negotiations, peace building and post-conflict transition.  It sounds good and we all support it, but the reality is that a woman who is an ex-combatant and who has served time in jail will face discrimination with regard to access to a job.  Under new legislation being introduced in this State if such a person applies for a taxi licence he or she will have difficulty.  We say we want women involved but the State has established structures which prevent women from getting involved.  We say we want them involved, but only at a certain level or a certain distance.

A lesbian explained to the committee that the churches were most unsympathetic.  Right across the board in Africa, even in South Africa, gays and lesbians are discriminated against.  We provide Christian aid through Irish Aid, Tr&oacute;caire and the missionaries, which are supposedly protecting women not just in conflict areas, but in the development field.  How is this religious content married with the cultural content of what we seem to argue is brutality, for example, female genital mutilation?  Some of us could claim that the Jewish and Muslim practice of circumcision could be deemed barbaric in certain forms.

These peace committee members whom we met had identified the problems of local markets that go on late at night in the dark creating situations where women returning from the markets in the evenings were in great danger.  It is a good example, as my colleague Ms Melanie Hoewer said, that the women came together and were able to identify the practical actions that can improve their lives.  They set up a lobby to convince all the market traders and local authorities that markets should close at 5 p.m. before sunset.  It is difficult. It does not hold because these are commercial opportunities and it is very hard for people to give up a commercial opportunity when one is living in poverty but there is a certain level of consensus and this is a significant advance.  That is a concrete action that women have taken themselves with support from the Irish taxpayers.  It is an example of the sort of impact that happens as a result of empowerment at a very local level.

Sometimes when one engages in a process of having a national action plan, one has this old fashioned notion that we in the West are developed, rich and know everything and, therefore, this is how we will apply these things in developing countries.  In regard to the comment about women parliamentarians from Africa, the parliaments of many African countries have higher levels of women representation than we do, so there is a cross-learning process here.  We could certainly learn from some of the things being done in Liberia and Timor Leste in terms of women's participation.  I say that, I suspect, more as a citizen than as a civil servant but these are things which I have discovered, as I have been working on it for the past three and half years.

Structures are place to deal with this issue and a significant amount of work was done during the Irish Presidency to advance it.  The economic partnership agreements, EPAs, were originally established in 2000.  Trying to negotiate preferential deals with the developing countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, region outside the WTO framework has been a long, arduous and painful process, which has been ongoing for 13 years.  This year, under the Irish Presidency, the European Parliament voted to set October 2014 as the deadline for concluding negotiations on economic partnership agreements between the European Union and the countries concerned.  This issue is now in the melting pot.<\/p><p>  By and large, the position of the Irish Presidency was that much has happened since 2000 and circumstances have changed.  Over the years, non-governmental organisations have expressed concern that the ACP countries would not secure as fair a deal as might be warranted.  Many of the countries in question have prospered, if that is the correct word, or made significant economic advances in the meantime and are now very much involved in the marketplace.  This is probably the last opportunity to ensure a preferential deal is done between the ACP countries and European Union outside the remit of the World Trade Organization.  If a deal is not reached by October 2014, the whole process will fall apart and move within the ambit or remit of the WTO.  There is significant momentum at present to reach deals with the various blocs, for example, the Southern Africa Development Community, SADC, the Economic Community of West African States, ECWAS, the Economic Community of Central African States, ECCAS, and individual countries.  Negotiations are ongoing and we hope a resolution will be found before the deadline provided by the European Parliament and other European institutions expires. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013070300004#D00600","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1372869600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I remind members that we are dealing with Ireland's economic and trade interests in Europe and internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013070300004#D00700","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1372869600,"counter":409,"content":"<p>It is difficult to make sense of the figures.

It is fair to say that in the world we live in now, diplomacy is largely economic.  There is a concept of economic diplomacy and if one looks at the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the past two and half years in particular, one can see it has been primarily about the restoration of our reputation, with a number of objectives in mind, including the renegotiation of the bailout arrangements and work on issues such as the interest rate premium on the loans we received; the negotiations that took place with the European Central Bank, ECB, on the promissory note; the restoration of our reputation with a view to attracting investment into the country to create employment; and promotion of our exports and our trade efforts, including the work to promote The Gathering and increase tourism.<\/p><p>  The work of our embassies and missions abroad is very much focused on achieving an economic benefit for this country in terms of employment, investment, trade and so on.  To achieve that, our objective is to bring together in as coherent and as focused a way as possible the efforts of all Departments and all State agencies that are working on those missions abroad.  Deputy Smith asked earlier if we were considering any revision of our missions.  I have said here previously that compared to countries of comparable size, we have a very small presence abroad.  We have a very small number of missions and, comparatively speaking, a small number of diplomatic staff who are serving abroad.  I said at this committee previously that once we had got through the Presidency we would be looking at our mission network and examining the best way of deploying our resources - there has been a big focus on the Presidency effort in the past six months - and we will be doing that now in the period ahead.  That will also coincide with a review of the country's trade strategy, and when that review is completed it will give us an opportunity to come here and talk about it more fully.<\/p><p>  To answer Deputy Byrne's question about how we might marry, so to speak, the issue of trade with the work of this committee, one way might be to examine the work of the Export Trade Council.  The committee might give me an opportunity at some point to make a report, perhaps specifically or as a separate item on the agenda.<\/p><p>  Deputy Crowe wondered why, if there are savings, they are not reflected in the figures, and drew attention to the programme total for 2013 on programme A.  Deputy Crowe is right in that on administration issues such as pay, we have taken the total payroll, including the payroll associated with missions, and apportioned it in accordance with the level of activity for the different programmes.  The fact that it is up on last year reflects the Presidency work.

I do not know whether that is the case, but I had to deal with the case of a young person who was called for an interview abroad.  Fortunately, we were able to get the necessary passport issued without the imposition of that particular penalty.  However, if it is correct that such a charge is applicable, I would like to see it reduced.  There are times when people need to have their applications prioritised, for example at a time of bereavement or when a person is called abroad for an interview, and such an impediment should not be put in their way.  A charge of &euro;150 is a lot of money for a person who is without work.<\/p><p>  With regard to services supporting Irish emigrants, as we all know, the cohort of people who may need support and may avail of these services consists mostly of elderly people, be they in Britain or in America.

Some leeway should be allowed because such situations do arise.

In 2012, a total of 631,947 passports were issued, which was an increase of 5.4% over the 2011 figures.  The highest increase was 8% in the number of passports for children over three and under 18 years of age.<\/p><p>  People who apply under the passport express service are given a commitment by the service that a passport will be issued within ten days of the receipt of properly completed applications.  Last year, 83% of all persons applying for a passport used the passport express service.  I stated earlier that 81% of passports are issued within ten days, while 92% are issued within 12 days and 99% are issued within 15 days.  The main reason for the current delay in a passport not being issued within the ten days - I know there were some difficulties in the middle of last year - is usually that there is some complication with the application and it has to be referred back.<\/p><p>  Great care has to be given to issuing a passport for a variety of reasons, especially when applications are for passports for children.   Considerable care has to be taken to ensure there is not anything untoward.  As Deputy Byrne has pointed out, there have been a few occasions when forgery of Irish passports has occurred.  We have improved the security standard on the passport, with the use of biometrics and so on.  We are in the process of designing a new passport book which will improve the security features of the passport even further.<\/p><p>  The issue of cost was raised by Deputy Smith.  The cost for a standard passport is currently &euro;95.  There is an administrative fee of &euro;55 for adults and &euro;30 for minors in cases where a passport is required within five working days, but that fee can be waived in cases of serious illness or health.  Emergency passports are issued but only in circumstances where the passport service is satisfied, on the basis of the application and supporting evidence, that the proposed journey is related to death, serious injury or illness abroad of a close relative or a medical emergency relating to the applicant himself or herself, and that the need to travel has arisen at short notice.  We encourage people to ensure that their passport is up to date, especially when making travel plans.  Much work has been done on that.  We have also moved to an appointment system in the passport office in Molesworth Street which is working very well.  People can telephone and make an appointment and this avoids the queueing.<\/p><p>  The issue of consular services was raised by a number of Deputies.  The type of consular activity carried out by the Department relates to cases where a death has occurred, where somebody has been killed - unfortunately we have had a number of high profile cases - where somebody is seriously injured, and where somebody is arrested and gets into trouble with the law for one reason or another.  The embassies and the consulates assist families in those cases.  We have many cases where people who have been arrested are visited by embassy officials when they have medical needs or need access to lawyers and so on.  It is very time-consuming work and it occupies a big part of what we do.  This kind of work arises most often in Spain and Australia comes after that.  The bulk of the consular work arises in countries where there is either a high holiday component or where there is a high number of young Irish people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013070300007#G00300","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372871700,"counter":432,"content":"<p>That completes programme B.

Deputy Smith raised Geneva II.  On 7 May, the US Secretary of State, John Kerry and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, announced their agreement to convene an international peace conference on Syria, the purpose of which is to revive the Geneva communiqu&eacute; of 30 June 2012 with a probable focus on the establishment of a mutually agreed government of transition with full executive powers in Syria.  Given the lack of progress on the political track in the past year and the deteriorating situation on the ground, not to mention the continuing divisions in the Security Council, this initiative remains the only serious prospect of a political solution to that conflict.  There is still a large degree of uncertainty with regard to participation of all sides in that conference.  Issues have been raised about other regional actors, particularly Iran.  There is a view that with Ramadan starting on 9 July, it may well be autumn before this takes place.  It is the only prospect in sight of getting a political resolution and it is one that we support and that the European Union supports.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Byrne, the funding for the troops in Somalia comes from the budget of the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence.  The troops do a great job.  They have been participating in the European Union training mission for Somalia.  I had the opportunity of visiting that mission last year.  They do great work.<\/p><p>  On the question of the OSCE and the parliamentary assembly, the Deputy will recall that at the OSCE ministerial meeting in Dublin in December, we agreed on the Helsinki+40 process.  The Helsinki final accord will be 40 years old in 2015 and we have put in place a process to examine the OSCE and its functioning.  The committee is aware that at the OSCE ministerial council in Dublin, the then president of the parliamentary assembly outlined his organisation's view that ODIHR was not adhering strictly to the 1997 co-operation agreement and announced that the parliamentary assembly regarded the agreement as no longer valid.  Following the ministerial council I wrote to the president and secretary general of the parliamentary assembly to express regret at that decision.  I emphasised that the prevailing view of OSCE member countries was that election observation should be a common endeavour involving ODIHR and the OSCE parliamentary assembly.  There is some overlap and sometimes there are turf wars between organisations and parts of organisations.  In an environment where taxpayers' money is involved, there is not much public understanding of the kind of turf wars that sometimes go on between international organisations and within international organisations.  I believe, and it is a view I communicated during our chairmanship of the OSCE last year, that we need to see less of that and more focus on the objective of getting the job done in the most efficient way possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013070300009#J00600","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372872900,"counter":448,"content":"<p>That completes programme D.

It reaffirms Ireland's commitment to international development and builds on the solid foundation of our overseas aid programme.  It provides a framework for the Government to prioritise further and focus even more intently on the results we and our partners are achieving in ensuring that we maintain our sharp focus on the poorest, the hungry and the malnourished, as well as those affected by conflict, insecurity and humanitarian emergencies.<\/p><p>  The new policy will guide all of Government actions and provide stronger coherence across Departments.  It provides a fresh commitment on hunger, climate change, fragile states and human rights, including gender equality, all of which were important areas for us in the past but which will now be accorded even greater prominence.  In implementing the policy the Department will seek greater prioritisation in the use of our resources, transparency, accountability and value for money.  I look forward to a continued close working relationship with the committee and I am ready to discuss any aspect of the aid programme. <\/p><p>  Before I open up the discussion, I would like to be associated with the remarks made by the T&aacute;naiste on the Irish Presidency.  It was a very intensive period, as the Chairman and members of the committee will know.  Major progress was made in this area of development, especially in hunger, nutrition and food security.  Not only did we hold a major international conference which many committee members attended, but it is now part of the Council conclusions and EU policy.  <\/p><p>  There were conclusions on resilience, which is the process of recovery, rehabilitation and sustainable development.  The Council conclusions in this regard were moved forward with the EU.  The greatest success was probably in the area of the post-2015 agenda, where we have now established the EU framework for the future, the vision, namely, the eradication of extreme poverty through sustainable development, and a lot of the priority issues to be included in that. <\/p><p>  I do not believe all of that work could have been done without the assistance of the outstanding workforce in Irish Aid in Limerick and Dublin, some of whom are here today.  I refer to Brendan Rogers, the director general of Irish Aid, Colm O'Flynn, and the secretariat involved in Brussels with the talks, trialogues and work that took place.  We discussed these matters with the Chairman and committee over the six months of the Presidency. <\/p><p>  I was impressed by the success of COSAC and AWEPA which took place last week.  Many members of the committee and members of Parliament were present.  I wish to put our appreciation for the continued intensive involvement of the committee in this work on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013070300010#K00500","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1372872900,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his compliments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013070300010#K00600","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1372872900,"counter":451,"content":"<p>The programme for ODA has a very substantial allocation and is one we all welcome.

At a previous committee meeting I mentioned the negative publicity which arose as a result of the irregularities in Uganda.  At the same time, it is important to get the message out about the success of the Irish programme and investment in those countries. <\/p><p>  The Irish Aid director gave his presentation almost a year ago on what was achieved in Uganda in terms of primary school completion rates and the development of health facilities.  At a time when the Irish taxpayer is putting substantial resources into this programme and the Irish public supports NGOs, Ministers and the Department should take the opportunity, when appropriate, to highlight the positives which have come from the investment over the years.  Such a public awareness campaign would be very important. <\/p><p>  One issue of which we can never create enough awareness is climate change.  It is an ongoing issue which has huge consequences for the global community.  We need to take every opportunity to try to improve awareness of the effects of climate change.

A former colleague of ours, Liz McManus, is studying the issue of women in conflict zones.  Support for women is a significant issue.  This committee has heard from a lesbian woman from Uganda about the situation in that country.  There is also discrimination against gays and lesbians in Russia.  Some witnesses have argued that the religious Christian groups were acting in a very negative and detrimental manner against gay and lesbian people.  The very progressive and important work carried out by our missionaries is funded to the tune of &euro;16 million.  I ask the Minister of State to reassure me that there is no conflict between the religious beliefs of those we are funding, such as Christian Aid, Tr&oacute;caire and missionary organisations, and the basic human rights of women on the issue of fertility control, family planning, and possibly abortion after rape.<\/p><p>  Good governance is a key issue.  I applaud Irish Aid because I understand it was the auditor general of the Ugandan Government who isolated the potential theft of our money.  I understand he was empowered to be as powerful as he is through Irish Aid programmes.  I understand he is to be invited to appear before an Oireachtas committee.

Deputy Smith asked about overseas development aid.  We have been endeavouring to stabilise the level of overseas development assistance.  The Government has been successful in maintaining that assistance despite the difficult economic circumstances.  The level of assistance under the previous Government, as Deputy Smith will know, reached the highest level of funding at 0.5% of GDP.  Previous taoisigh had given the commitment that we would reach 0.7%, and this is the same commitment from this Government.  The level of funding had reduced by approximately 30%, but this Government has pretty much stabilised it to slightly under 0.5%.  It is the intention to seek to reach our targets at the earliest opportunity.  These are matters to be decided by the Cabinet in the context of the budget.  The other EU member states have been very complimentary during our Presidency that despite the difficult circumstances, the effort was made to maintain that high level of overseas development aid for those who are much less well off than ourselves.<\/p><p>  Deputies Brendan Smith and Eric Byrne referred to the fraud perpetrated in Uganda involving &euro;4 million of Irish assistance and similar amounts from other countries, including Denmark and Norway.  The fraud was discovered by the auditor general whose office had received a substantial contribution from Irish Aid.  This ensured the office had the resources and expertise to conduct the investigation without fear or favour, including an investigation of the prime minister's office.  That investigation is ongoing.  The prime mover in the fraud has been convicted and is now serving a prison sentence of five years.  A number of other people will be coming before the courts presently.  I have every intention of inviting the Ugandan auditor general to Ireland at a suitable time.  He is a witness to what can be done by good governance and practice.  We are determined that no funding will be given through Ugandan government channels in the future until such time as the entire investigation and prosecution is completed.  The level of funding currently going to Uganda is approximately half what it was previously and it is not being disbursed by the Ugandan Government.  Education and health projects in the north of Uganda - in Karramoja - are being funded because it is a poor area.  No Ugandan Government agency is involved in the delivery of that aid.<\/p><p>  Deputy Crowe raised the issue of land grabbing.  This is a serious issue in many parts of Africa where ownership of large amounts of land is being transferred in one form or another to people outside the country.  The traditional mechanism of landholding is quite different from systems in the developed world.  It is a collective system and, as such, there is no individual landowner.  Nevertheless, ranches and large tracts of land have been leased long-term for bio-fuel activity in many cases.  The European Union decided that 10% of transport fuel should be bio-fuel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2013070300011#L00300","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372874100,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for State for their attendance and for dealing so thoroughly with the matters raised by Deputies.

What happens in the event that an institution adopts a policy of recruiting people who have a conscientious view of the legislation, resulting in the institution's having a diminished clinical capacity to carry out such medical procedures as may be required under the legislation?  An institution may have a religious ethos or whatever, but there will be a certain view at senior management and board levels.  The process of recruitment could be used to ensure the clinicians were of the same mind.  That would diminish the capacity of the hospital to carry out such procedures, because it would not have clinicians available to carry them out.  How could that situation be addressed in the Bill?  We have talked about licensing 19 institutions and emergency departments in hospitals, and rightly so, in view of the fact that women who require terminations will often present at an emergency department.  Suppose one has a tight group of like-minded very senior clinicians, comprising obstetricians, gynaecologists, anaesthetists and others?  Their capacity could be diminished very quickly.  My question is primarily on emergency department presentations as opposed to planned terminations due to a physical condition or on mental health grounds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300003#B01400","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1372840200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I will make two quick points in response.

What they do, simply - I should not say \"simply\", as there is nothing simple about it - is to allow for procedures to occur in certain circumstances where there is an onerous test and so on, as we have discussed, but also, it restricts the places in which such procedures are permitted to take place to certain institutions.  It simply says that it is only permissible for these procedures to happen at these institutions.  People have gone off on a complete tangent talking about compulsion and lists.  The legislation is just saying that it is permissible for the procedure to take place but it must take place in these institutions.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Kelleher's question on recruitment practices.

First, it is bad practice to include such provisions in any Bill.  There should always be a requirement for some form of approval, either by way of the mechanism suggested by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v or in accordance with my amendment.  Second, in this particular instance, the Taoiseach gave a clear commitment when the Government decision was made in December that we would have regulations in tandem with legislation that we would have the opportunity to consider those regulations.  That has not happened.  It is imperative that any regulations introduced under this particular legislation are subject to approval by the Oireachtas, whether through scrutiny by this sub-committee or by being laid before both Houses.  I urge the Minister, in light of the scale and scope of the powers assigned to him under section 4, either to facilitate my amendment or to undertake to bring forward an alternative wording on Report Stage which reflects the thrust of the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300004#C00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1372840800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>With respect, Chairman, we covered all of this last night.

I admit that one would like to be able to show how many people applied and whether they were successful or unsuccessful, but there is an issue of privacy.  I know Deputy Creed is concerned about this, but the privacy rights of the patient are the concern here.  As a doctor, I have some experience in this area and can draw a corollary for the Deputy.  If an employer asked me for all the notes for work that I had given somebody over the past three years because he had lost them, I would have no problem doing that and the patient could not really object.  However, if the employer asked me how many times the patient had sought a note for work and I had declined, I would be in deep trouble if I provided that information as that would be an invasion of the patient's privacy.  Therefore, providing the information being sought here is not doable and would not work.<\/p><p>  I understand why the Deputy might like such information to be available.  For instance, somebody could come in suicidal following an initial review and assessment and make a request.  On this second occasion the consultant concerned might form the opinion that this constituted a real risk and seek a second opinion.  Then, perhaps during the course of the second opinion, the patient's situation might change.

Section 15 makes provision for the reporting mechanism and provides for it to be anonymous.  However, in the context of governance and of being in a position to have an informed overview of the effect of the legislation, we need a record.  It is not just about the number of applications that have been certified.  The certification process will only deal with those who have been granted an entitlement, be it under section 7, 8 or 9.  We need the information in the context of being able to say we have an informed overview of the operation.

Therefore, in the context of regulations, which one would say is about the forms used, etc., these might be an appropriate vehicle to provide this record.

The argument has been made by some people that the reason suicide must be included is because of the X case judgment and that the Government's hands are tied.  It is argued that if the Government does not make specific provision for suicide it is in contravention of the judgment in the X case.  I made my point on Second Stage that I do not believe this to be the case and I have put forward this alternative amendment that facilitates what I think was the original intention of the Government to legislate and regulate.  Section 7 is a facilitating section to allow for regulation to be published and approved by the House to deal with the substantive issues as outlined in the current sections 7 and 8 dealing with emergency medical situations and non-emergency medical situations.  It can then remain silent on the substantive issue of suicide.  It does not contravene the constitutional determination in the X case.  I accept it would not be in tandem with the views of a great many Members of the Oireachtas but I know that many Members have concerns about the suicide provision.<\/p><p>  I wish to make specific reference proposals in amendment No. 15.  Subsection (<i>d<\/i>) would allow for approval of the regulations by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This would give the Oireachtas an affirmative role with regard to any regulations to be published.  My proposed subsection (<i>c<\/i>) provides that regulations under the section shall  not contravene current evidence-based medical treatment.  The consistent evidence the committee received from the witnesses in the hearings did not give any substantive evidence to support the inclusion of suicidal intent in the legislation.  I refer the committee to a typographical error in that the word, &quot;on&quot; should not be included.  If the amendment is accepted I hope that word can be removed.  The Minister in earlier contribution made the point that there is no right to terminate a potentially viable foetus and I accept his point.  The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White also clarified that point.  This particular phrase in my proposed subsection (<i>b<\/i>) ensures that this actually happens and is the reason I have included it.  If this amendment is not accepted - which is probable - I would hope the Minister would consider the wording in my proposed subsection (<i>b<\/i>) to be included in the Bill.  I have tabled this proposal because of genuine concerns raised by psychiatrists who gave presentations to the committee hearings.  Professor Veronica O'Keane made the point that if a woman presents to her with suicidal ideation or suicidal intent she has no choice but to believe that woman and deal with it on that basis because there is no way of disproving what the woman says.  That is the reality of the situation.<\/p><p>  I accept the evidence based on UK research which shows that one pregnant woman in every 500,000 will die by suicide.  However, the difficulty is that quite a substantial number of women can have suicidal ideation and suicidal intent during the course of pregnancy.  Research I referenced during Second Stage indicates that in the developed world it can be somewhere between one in eight and one in three, which is a substantial number of pregnancies.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300006#E00300","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372842300,"counter":539,"content":"<p>I speak against this amendment and dispute what Deputy Naughten stated.

Dr. Anthony McCarthy, the president of the College of Psychiatrists, who I understand is involved in maternal death inquiries - which are done in an anonymous way - would also say there are pregnant women who die perhaps for reasons of suicidality, but the results of inquiries are often recorded as open verdicts because of family considerations and sensitivities.  In addition, the chief medical officer of the Department of Health, Dr. Tony Holohan, stated that although this is rare, it happens and we must legislate for it.  I dispute Deputy Naughten's statement and oppose the amendment.

The language is pedestrian and does not demonstrate the need to act with all haste.  After the insertion of &quot;with appropriate urgency&quot;, the opening two lines would read: &quot;If practicable at least one of the medical practitioners referred to in subsection (1)<i>(b)<\/i> shall, with the pregnant woman's agreement, consult with appropriate urgency with the woman's general practitioner, if any&quot;, and continuing.

To suggest that we would set this out in law is to be prescriptive about doctors' medical practices.  Everybody knows that delayed diagnosis can make a practitioner culpable in law for negligence.  If I find out that a patient has appendicitis and the appendix bursts because I did not operate until 24 hours later, I know I will be in serious trouble.  It would be the same if I know that a patient is having a heart attack and refuse to act on it for 24 hours.  The wording is superfluous, although I understand why the Deputy would want to stipulate urgency out of concern that some doctors might delay.  I do not believe that adding these words would have that effect.  It is clear from medical guidelines that one must always act with expediency.  Just because a physician has a conscientious objection that does not mean he or she can wait a week before referring the patient elsewhere.  Once a conscientious objection has been made known, the individual concerned must act with all speed to refer the patient to an appropriate physician who can provide the necessary care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300008#G00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1372842900,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I have tabled amendments Nos. 24 to 26, inclusive, which are similar to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's amendment No. 23. \u00a0I understand the point that the Minister is making but we want to ensure there is appreciation of the urgency required in dealing with these matters. \u00a0Inserting \"forthwith\" would indicate the need for urgency in dealing with this section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300008#G00300","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1372842900,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I want to speak in favour of what has been argued. \u00a0I have always been of the view that in urgent situations nothing should delay a decision taken in good faith and based on reasonable opinion to save the life of the mother. \u00a0In regard to sections 7 and 8 and the physical threat to the mother's life, while no decision is absolute, a clearly identified threat can be evaluated.<\/p><p>\u00a0 If one is faced with that kind of situation, one has to act quickly. \u00a0It is a matter of great concern that on one occasion in Galway, issues were not addressed in a satisfactory manner. \u00a0I understand, however, that the usual practice in this regard has been of the highest calibre. \u00a0Is it currently normal practice to consult a GP where practicable? \u00a0I accept that if it is not practicable one gets on with the job and does what is required.<\/p><p>\u00a0 Given that we are dealing with the prospect of a real and substantial physical risk to the life of the mother where the only solution is to carry out a medical procedure, I cannot understand why anybody would raise a conscientious objection. \u00a0Why are we allowing for a conscience clause in such instances? \u00a0It appears to defy logic and it goes against standard medical practice in this country. \u00a0I cannot understand how any doctor would have a conscientious objection to saving a woman's life from a physical threat. \u00a0The conscientious objection provisions cover sections 7 and 9 as well as section 8. \u00a0The dilemma is in respect of section 8. \u00a0For section 7 to apply the threat to life has to be physical and significant. \u00a0It seems to me that good medical practice and ethical guidelines would require the doctor to save the mother's life and if as unintended consequence it is not possible to save the unborn life because it is unviable, that is perfectly permissible under current practice.

The whole intent of the amendments is to assist in strengthening the Bill and making it as assuring as possible.

I am happy to do so.  Legal advice has been received to the effect that the legal meaning of the term \"forthwith\" is \"immediately\".  This qualification, like other proposed phrases such as \"with appropriate urgency\" and \"immediately\", is unnecessary because this section of the Bill uses terms such as \"shall make arrangements\" which render such qualifications superfluous for the reasons I have outlined.  That is why I have urged the members of the committee not to support these amendments.  The word \"immediately\" has a very clear meaning in law.  Other things may need to be done more urgently before this needs to be done.  Those things might take just ten, 15, 20 or 35 minutes.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy White, will speak about the nitty-gritty legality of what these terms mean, and what they might mean in practice.  That is the problem.  I have no problem with the sentiment behind these amendments.  I know they are well intentioned and seek to send a message, but in so doing they could cause serious problems for medical practice.  We will all accept that in 99% of cases, medical practice in this country is excellent and is world-leading.  This small country produces doctors and nurses who are the best in the world.  That is proven by dint of the fact that when they leave this country, they go to the best of the best places and excel there.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked whether we know of a termination of pregnancy that ever took place anywhere, where conscientious objection was used in this regard.  I can say I do not know of such a case, but that does not mean it has not happened.  I do not profess to have my hand on every situation in this country or elsewhere in the world.  Without being in any way disrespectful, it is an unanswerable question.  I know what the Deputy is trying to say.  The Medical Council guidelines are very clear and they cover this.  Clearly, these issues have been raised before.  They would not be in the medical guidelines if they had not been raised before.<\/p><p>  I will not get into precisely what Deputy Boyd Barrett said or did not say.  His statement that these provisions, as explained by the legal meaning of the terms used, \"cannot do any harm\" is far from the truth.  I know he might believe they cannot do any harm.  They have a clear meaning in law.  I will rephrase what others have said.  The purpose of this Bill is to reassure people; most importantly, the women of this country who use our health services, but also the medics who have to provide those services.  That reassurance will come through the clarifications we are giving around the law now.<\/p><p>  I will restate what I said last night - we are conferring no new rights on anyone and we are not taking any rights away from anyone.  We are doing something that I, as a Minister, as a citizen and as a doctor, believe we must do.  We must clarify for women what is available to them in this country and, most importantly, how they can access it.  We must clarify for the doctors and nurses who provide this care what is legally permissible and what they are obliged to deliver.  I think that is at the core of what we are doing.  If we keep that to the fore, we will realise that while some people are very uncomfortable with this and other people do not feel it goes far enough, this is what we must do.<\/p><p>  I have to make the point that this process was in train before the terrible and tragic event in Galway.  Equally, I have to say that stipulating in law that something should be done \"immediately\" or \"with appropriate urgency\" would not have changed the outcome.  The clarity we are trying to bring to this would have changed the outcome, in the sense that any delays occasioned by a lack of certainty would not have come into play.  As we know from the reports we have received, an awful lot more than that was involved in the Galway case.  I do not want to make any further comment on it other than to say that the HSE report was comprehensive.  At an early stage during the course of the compilation of the report, the chairman, Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, made certain recommendations that were immediately acted upon.  Further to that, we were already developing an early warning score system for the maternity services.  We had brought in such a system for adult services.  We were the first country in the world to do so.  We have now done it for maternity services as well.  We are working on a system for paediatric services.  They are all different because the biology, the parameters, the biochemical markers and the clinical findings are different in all cases.<\/p><p>  I would like to confirm what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said.  I believe we have one of the highest standards of maternity care in the world here.  I say that on the basis of perinatal mortality and survival rates.  I commend the excellent men and women who have delivered that service, which I commend to the women of this country.  No matter how good things might be, I would never say they could not be made better or safer.  Better systems can be put in place, as has happened in the airline industry, to ensure the wrong thing to do becomes the most difficult thing to do.  In some situations in the past, the wrong thing to do was made easier because of the system that existed.  I could give examples of that, but I do not think it would be productive for me to do so at this forum.  I want to reassure everybody that I fully respect the intent behind these Opposition amendments.  The legal situation and the implications for practice are such that I do not believe the amendments should be supported or accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300011#K00100","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1372844700,"counter":590,"content":"<p>I want to endorse absolutely what the Minister has just said.  It captures the point very well.  There is no doubt in my mind that Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's amendments are very well motivated.  I do not say that in a condescending way.  No citizens - politicians or otherwise - would regard delay in clinical practice as acceptable.  It horrifies us all.  In some cases, it has the most dreadful outcomes.  We can all understand and see that.<\/p><p>  It comes back to what we think we can do and what our responsibility is as legislators.  As the Minister has said, when we are setting out the law as politicians, that does not involve us stepping into the clinical environment.  It cannot involve us stepping into the clinical environment for the exact same reasons I gave when we were debating Deputy Mulherin's query about why we cannot include in the legislation a requirement to exercise best practice.  I made the point that such a provision would involve including in the legislation a further definition of what best practice entails, and that would take us into a whole new area of legislating in detail for what constitutes best practice.  Best practice is set out, supervised and changed when necessary by the professional bodies, including the Medical Council.  There is a statutory basis for that.  We do not step into the clinical environment.  There must always be an arm's length between the Government and the Oireachtas, on the one hand, and the actual clinical practice, on the other hand.  That must be the case even in these really very difficult and delicate areas.  There needs to be a high level of trust.<\/p><p>  I would like to comment on the issue of delay, which has come up again.  I believe that acting in a timely fashion, quickly and expeditiously is a fundamental aspect of professional medical practice.  I am reminded of what we were saying last night.  I would regard all doctors as having a requirement to act in accordance with best medical practice, without that needing to be included in legislation by means of the use of certain words.  All doctors have to apply best medical practice and all doctors have to act in an expeditious manner.  Time is of the essence in clinical practice.  It seems to me that if we include this in legislation, we would risk it having the opposite effect.  It would almost raise - I am trying to put this in a way that does not misrepresent what I want to say - the possibility that the Legislature has a doubt in some way as to the likelihood of best medical practice, or acting in an expeditious manner, actually occurring.  I think that would be unfortunate and wrong.<\/p><p>  I agree with what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said.  He is absolutely right about the very high standards of care that exist throughout our hospital system.  It is not the case that the Oireachtas has prescribed a certain method or rule that a doctor should follow.  We have a statutory regime, through the Medical Council.  We have reliable professional bodies that uphold these standards.  We also have laws.  People have the option of bringing cases to court.  Medical negligence cases are brought when things unfortunately go wrong.  We have a very strong legislative and statutory infrastructure.  We have other ways for people to vindicate their rights if things go wrong, as they unfortunately do in a small number of cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300011#K00200","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372845300,"counter":592,"content":"<p>Is the intention of sections 7 and 8 to confirm and clarify current best medical practice as is the situation under Article 40.3.3&deg; in respect of physical risk?

Deputy Denis Naughten asked about the differentiation between induction and a medical procedure.  Of course, one would argue that an induction was a medical procedure.  One can argue the difference between surgical procedures and medical procedures.  However, the judgment in the X case is not specific in this regard.  It refers to a termination of pregnancy, whether it be medical or surgical, and mentions termination, as opposed to what some refer to as abortion, which others believe is destruction.

If a lady is suicidal and approaches a psychiatrist, having been referred by her GP, he or she will assess the risk and after a week form an opinion on whether this is really a serious risk and that in his or her opinion she should or should not be certified.  She seeks a second opinion and during the course of the second week things change.  Let us look at the scenarios.  First, she may have had a miscarriage.  Do we report this?  Second, she may have had a change of heart and, third, the psychiatrist may have decided that it was not appropriate.  The first psychiatrist who had formed the original opinion may be of a similar mind and another week having elapsed, things may have changed.  I do not believe it is practical to report in such situations.  I have had long conversations with certain other members in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300015#R00800","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1372846200,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I am thinking that the suicide issue is the most serious one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300015#R00900","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speech","time":1372846200,"counter":624,"content":"<p>In general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300015#R01000","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1372846200,"counter":625,"content":"<p>Exactly.

They felt it was necessary to clarify that such risk must not be inevitable or immediate.  That, as the Minister will be aware, is a very important qualification and really speaks to the uncertainty about what point one decides that a woman's life is really under threat.  This qualification, put in by the Supreme Court, is erring on the side of caution in relation to a woman's life and it is right and proper that it should do so.

The view behind the proposition is that the requirement for three medical practitioners in section 9 is unnecessary and unworkable and will of itself be a discouragement to presenting in the normal course within the Irish hospital system.  This will add to the sad and continuing exodus of many thousands of Irish women for terminations outside this jurisdiction.  It is believed that reducing the number from three to two will ensure there is parity between physical and mental illness, a matter my colleagues feel strongly needs to be affirmed.  For too long, a distinction has been made with regard to mental health as against physical health and the argument is that there should be equal respect and understanding of the situations that apply and of the qualifications and professional capacity of the respective practitioners to make appropriate diagnoses where women present in each of these situations.  The proposition is, in summary, to reduce the requirement from three to two practitioners where the woman's life is at risk as a result of a threat of suicide.

We have had a discussion about this, but I would like to discuss section 9 specifically.  I understand how the Minister has rearranged the section, which makes perfect sense.  The amended section 9(1)(<i>a<\/i>) states: &quot;subject to <i>section 19<\/i>, three medical practitioners, having examined the pregnant woman, have jointly certified in good faith&quot;.  I had a look back when the Minister was talking about the legal position and the issue with best medical practice, and I have a suggestion, although I do not know whether there is any merit in it.  Section 73 of the Mental Health Act 2001 is the only provision under which people must go to court to take legal proceedings against a practitioner.  It mentions within that section that the court may refuse leave to initiate proceedings in cases in which &quot;there are no reasonable grounds for contending that the person against whom the proceedings are brought acted in bad faith or without reasonable care&quot;.  Would it be worth considering the addition of a similar phrase to the Bill?  For example, the amended section might state: &quot;having examined the pregnant woman, have jointly certified in good faith, and having acted with reasonable care, that ...&quot;?  That would provide comfort with regard to best practice without in any way detracting from the provision and in keeping with legal precedent as laid down in section 73 of the Mental Health Act 2001.  It is a legal question which has resonates in sections 7, 8 and 9, but particularly section 9, and goes back to the definition of &quot;reasonable opinion&quot; in the interpretation section of the Bill, which states:<blockquote><br \/>&quot;reasonable opinion&quot;, in relation to a medical practitioner or review committee, as the case may be, means an opinion formed by the practitioner or committee, as the case may be, in good faith which has regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable...<\/blockquote>Based on my suggestion, the words &quot;and having acted with reasonable care&quot; would come after &quot;in good faith&quot; and before &quot;which has regard&quot;.  What I am doing is to examine the question of good faith to find a way to provide clarity while not in any way interfering with best practice.  Such a wording is there in legislation already.  I would like the Minister's comment on that.  My understanding is that the provisions in section 73 of the Mental Health Act 2001 are the only situation in which a patient is required to go to court to initiate legal proceedings in any shape or form against a doctor or whomever.  In this case, there are two things laid down in the legislation: <blockquote>(1) No civil proceedings shall be instituted in respect of an act purporting to have been done in pursuance of this Act save by leave of the High Court and such leave shall not be refused unless the High Court is satisfied:(<i>a<\/i>) that the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious, or<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) that there are no reasonable grounds for contending that the person against whom the proceedings are brought acted in bad faith or without reasonable care.<\/blockquote>I am not being vexatious today and simply wish to make a point.  The section continues:<blockquote>(3) Where proceedings are, by leave granted in pursuance of <i>subsection (1)<\/i> of this section [That means that the court has allowed them to proceed], instituted in respect of an act purporting to have been done in pursuance of this Act, the Court shall not determine the proceedings in favour of the plaintiff unless it is satisfied that the defendant acted in bad faith or without reasonable care. <\/blockquote>This may represent a circumstance in which good faith could be clarified by a reference to reasonable care.  Such a provision could provide comfort without in any way interfering with best practice.  I ask the Minister to address the matter from a legal perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300017#T00500","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1372847400,"counter":654,"content":"<p>Four Deputies are indicating.

It is clear after consideration of the matter - and the Government has considered it - that, given the subjective nature of the practice of psychiatry, there is a real sense that because of the absence of clinical markers such as biochemical blood tests, MRIs or X-rays, in order to give a more secure diagnosis - given the fact that the diagnosis and the certification could, in certain circumstances, lead to the loss of life of the unborn - a higher standard of certainty was required.

My amendment in today's Bill is about forming an opinion for the purpose of certification, which is different.

That is not what we are talking about in amendment No. 32 today.  As the Minister has rightly said, we are talking about a procedure put into law or legislation.  I suggest that it is quite an onerous requirement in respect of what has to be declared in order for a certification to occur.

There are certain tests outlined in that judgment.  One of the tests referred to, namely, that it is not necessary for medical practitioners to be of the opinion that the risk to the woman's life is inevitable or immediate, is not referred to in this or any other section of this Bill.  I fail to understand the reason the Minister is prepared to include the other elements of the tests of that judgment and not that one.  <\/p><p>  As stated by the Minister, we need in this legislation to provide clarity for women and medical practitioners.  That was the point of the portion of the judgment I mentioned earlier.  This Bill would be considerably enhanced if that part of the test was included, in particular in this section.  I also have concerns in regard to the provision dealing with the three medical practitioners.  It is worth reading again what the expert report states in regard to the number of medical practitioners to be involved:<blockquote>It was generally considered that two doctors with the relevant training and expertise appropriate to the case would be sufficient for making a clinical decision as to the risk to the life of the woman, whether the risk arose because of a physical or mental health condition.  However, more doctors could be involved in the process by way of informal consultation among colleagues or multidisciplinary team assessment, as often occurs in complex cases at present.  <\/blockquote>I believe that this is the better provision and it should be included in the legislation.  While it provides a requirement of two doctors it also provides for the option, as happens more nowadays, particularly in difficult cases, of having multidisciplinary teams and assessment and consultation between medical practitioners.  I believe the Bill, and in particular this section, would be significantly enhanced by the inclusion of those two elements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300018#U00900","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1372848000,"counter":674,"content":"<p>There are seven speakers remaining.

The legislate is quite clear, as was the evidence from the witnesses who attended the committee hearings, namely, if a woman has an underlying mental health condition the question that must be asked is, is there an alternative course of treatment available that could avert the suicidal intent?  The reality is, in terms of an underlying mental health condition, in the vast majority of cases there is an alternative course of action available.  Only where there is no other option to avert the suicidal intent can a person certify a termination.  The difficulty that arises is a woman who presents and has no underlying mental health condition cannot under the Mental Health Act be forced to have any course of treatment.  There is then no alternative option but to certify that the woman have a termination.  It is important to remember that Professor Veronica O'Kane in her evidence said that it is impossible to prove or disprove suicidal intent or suicidal ideation and that if a woman presents before her, which woman does not have any underlying mental health condition, and states she is suicidal her hands are tied and she must certify in the circumstances.

I have made my position clear on these matters.  This is a subjective assessment as there is an absence of biochemical and physical markers.  We believe, and it is a Government decision, that there should be two psychiatrists rather than one involved.  I will not accept an amendment to change the current provision.  Deputy Denis Naughten made this point also.<\/p><p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Conlan outlined a scenario in which a suicidal woman does not have a history of depression and refuses other treatment.  He then asked whether medical practitioners could certify in such circumstances.  We addressed this issue last night, although I accept the Deputy could not be present for the discussion.  It is very clear that the psychiatrists concerned could not certify in the circumstances he outlined because they do not meet the test.  That is an absolute and it is in the Bill.  <\/p><p>  On Deputy Colm Keaveney's question on whether a pregnant woman would be automatically committed because she is suicidal, that is absolutely not the case.  He also asked whether I can guarantee a woman would not be sectioned under section 9.  I cannot give such a guarantee because if there is an underlying serious psychosis, the woman, whether pregnant or not, would have to be sectioned and committed.<\/p><p>  To return to the Deputy's first point, the very notion that one could section a woman who is expressing suicidal ideation but is not depressed to keep her confined for the duration of her pregnancy would be utter anathema and would not be tolerated or countenanced.  It is very clear in the Bill that we are trying to clarify what is legally available and what criteria must be met before doctors can certify that someone in such circumstances would be entitled to a termination and it would be permissible for a doctor to perform a termination.  I keep returning to the point that there are three doctors involved.<\/p><p>  It is also important to point out that the duty of an obstetrician is to both his or her patients.  That is very clear.  The duty of a psychiatrist is to his or her patient.  However, in this country the duty on psychiatrists, all doctors and all citizens is to protect the life of the unborn in so far as is practicable.

It is the only law that applies in the case of any individual who is to be subject to involuntary admission.  If the conditions or circumstances that are contemplated in the Mental Health Act 2001 apply, a person may well be sectioned.  However, there is nothing in section 9 or anywhere else in the Bill that triggers the Act.<\/p><p>  I will refer briefly to two other points.  Deputy Healy raised an issue regarding an inevitable and immediate risk.  In general, it is not necessary to make provision in any legislation for a negative.  If something is not required to be the case, in general there is no necessity to include in legislation that something does not have to be the case.  The test is that positive things have to happen, in other words, a real and substantial risk to life can only be averted through a termination.  That is the other part of the test.  <\/p><p>  This returns us to the issue of best practice and how prescriptive we want to be for doctors.  In the case of a doctor applying his or her mind to a situation where he or she is asked to consider whether there is a real and substantial risk to somebody's life, there is no basis in this legislation or anywhere else for thinking that this risk must be immediate or inevitable.  It is not required for the legislation to tell a doctor that the risk does not have to be immediate or inevitable.  There is no such requirement and, as such, it is not necessary to include it in legislation.  While I have not seen the advice, I expect it is probably the advice the Minister received.  <\/p><p>  On the expert group, Deputy Boyd Barrett raised a point which, to be fair to him, he subsequently corrected.  Deputy Healy raised this issue again when he cited the expert group report.  In referring to the role of psychiatrists, the expert group stated the following: <blockquote>Finally, the role of the psychiatrist is key where a termination of pregnancy is prescribed as appropriate treatment in case of suicidal ideation\/intent.  There are recognised clinical challenges in correctly diagnosing expressed suicide intent, for instance, the absence of recognised clinical markers.  Therefore, it could be argued that this is a more subjective process and requires more safeguards to be put in place for the protection of both the woman and the unborn.  The need to keep up to date with clinical research on this issue is highlighted in the Medical Council Guidelines referred to in section 3.6.3 with a view to ensuring that the decision is evidence-based. <\/blockquote>In assessing the various options the expert group report states the following: <blockquote>There may be clinical challenges in correctly diagnosing expressed suicide intent.  Therefore, it could be argued that a risk to life from suicide warrants extra safeguards.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300019#V00900","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1372848600,"counter":687,"content":"<p>To return to the issue of treatments, we have received many assurances from the Minister that all treatment options will be explored and, as a result, abortion will be a rare occurrence.  While I accept the Minister's assurances, when I read the section, even as amended, it simply sets out a procedure whereby a woman, having her medical condition assessed, can establish her legal eligibility for an abortion.  The Minister has stated on many occasions that the use of the word \"only\" has a certain meaning.  Clearly, not everybody agrees that it has this meaning, least of all lawyers.  I agree with Deputy Conlan in this regard.<\/p><p>  At a certain point in the hearings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, Professor Veronica O'Keane indicated that she did not consider her role in that circumstance was one of providing treatment but rather one of assessing eligibility for a procedure which a woman in that circumstance would request.

It is no harm to reiterate that I intend to introduce amendments to these sections on Report Stage.  The amendments will not change the substance of the sections but will make it clear that the life of the unborn is to be protected in all instances, as well as that of the mother.  Deputy Michelle Mulherin presumes that a woman who refuses treatment will be certified.  I have already covered this issue with Deputy Se&aacute;n Conlan.  A woman who refuses treatment cannot be certified as the certifier will not be able to meet the test that all options have been explored.  That does not mean that we can prescribe in law that every woman must be committed, have counselling and a course of anti-depressants.  It means that an assessment must take place.  Proper practice requires that such assessments cannot take place over a period of one hour.  Assessment will take a period of time that is acceptable and reasonable.  It may be that, following such a period, practitioners form the opinion that there is a real and substantial risk and that the only treatment which can work, having explored the other treatments, is to terminate the pregnancy.  Treatments which are refused cannot have been properly explored and tried.  If the opinion is formed by a second psychiatrist over a period of time also, certification takes place.<\/p><p>  It has been suggested we provide for a cooling-off period.  While that applies in other areas of law in relation to certain purchases, we are discussing a life and death issue.  It will be highly prescriptive.  This Oireachtas could be responsible for the death of a woman where two psychiatrists had certified that a risk was real and substantial and she had taken her life while we were having our cooling-off period.  That is not something I am prepared to have on my conscience and it is not something we can prescribe in law.  It is overly prescriptive.  I accept that there are only good intentions behind the suggestion, but it is not possible to implement it within the law.  Certainly, it would be completely contrary to the advice of the Attorney General.  The medical profession would be outraged that someone's life could be left at risk on foot of a legal decision by the Oireachtas to prescribe a cooling-off period.  I am sorry to say it is not feasible.<\/p><p>  Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick asked who would have the obligation to inform a woman of her rights.  It will be the doctor.  The Deputy asked about appeals to the courts also.  We have sought in so far as possible in the Bill to keep this process medical.  It will involve a medical review.  The situation with legal appeals will be the same as it is in all areas.  One has a right to go to court to seek an injunction and appeal a decision.  There is that right, but it is deliberately not part of the Bill.  To make such a provision would be to suggest every woman who finds herself in a distressed state should be subject, having gone to three doctors and, perhaps, been subject to a review by another three doctors, to cross-examination by a group of lawyers.  That is not what people would consider reasonable.

We know the difficulties that exist in respect of reaching a clinical diagnosis regarding suicidal intent.  My concern relates to how this will impact on the practise of medical professionals, especially in respect of the absence of legal protection in the case of, for example, a psychiatrist who has assessed a woman and deems her not to be suicidal.  If that woman at some point in future, for whatever reason, goes on to commit suicide, where does that place the psychiatrist in terms of legal responsibility?  My concern, which I raised on Second Stage, is that in those circumstances where there is no clear legal protection for psychiatrists, is there not a real danger that the default position for psychiatrists will be to certify in those circumstances?  How do we prevent that occurring?  That is the big issue.<\/p><p>  We have been told that these cases are one in half a million, yet at the same time if we examine the experience in other jurisdictions where what seemed to be a rather strict regime developed into something entirely different.

No one can predict with certainty the outcome of a psychiatric condition and sadly, there is all too much evidence of this.  However, as long as doctors act in best faith, using the latest knowledge available to them as adjudicated by their peers, they have a protection.  As for the Deputy's concern on the issue of the chilling effect perhaps operating in the other direction in respect of psychiatrists, because of what she considers to be an uncertainty, being more disposed to certify, I do not believe it will arise because the law is quite clear in this regard.

However, the fact that the court then said in the course of the judgment, and the Deputy is right, that that risk did not have to be immediate or inevitable is not embedded as part of the actual test promulgated by the Supreme Court.

Deputy Shortall spoke about a concern, if I understand the point, that if a psychiatrist was asked to make a certification and declined to make a certification, would he or she then be in a position where they would have a concern that they might be subject to litigation in the future, having declined to make a certification.  The normal rules of medical negligence apply here.  The famous case of Dunne and Holles Street hospital is the case we all know about, which set out the basic principles of medical negligence.  In terms of the true test, it is that as long as a doctor is acting in a way where he or she is not guilty of the kind of failure that no medical practitioner of equal specialist or general status and skill would be guilty of if acting with ordinary care.  It sounds a little clumsy but that is the test well known and applied by the courts every day of the week.  The same principles apply in these circumstances as would apply generally.  One would have to prove that the doctor had deviated from a general and approved practice.<\/p><p>  We know there is a broader debate about defensive medicine, namely, that there is a concern that doctors not just in this country, but in different parts of the world, are acting in a way that always has an eye on the possibility of being sued.  We are all aware of that problem and that general challenge in medicine that it should not become defensive medicine and that doctors should not act all the time or at any time thinking about what will happen if they are sued.  It is no different here than it is in any other similar circumstances.  Deputy Shortall, or the Chairman, can correct me if I am wrong on this but the psychiatrists in the two sets of hearings raised many issues but I do not remember that issue being raised.  I say that tentatively.  I may be wrong but I do not remember any of the psychiatrists worrying that they could be sued for declining to make a certification in the circumstances outlined by Deputy Shortall.  I respect the point but the specific concern the Deputy has raised is misplaced.<\/p><p>  The last point I will make concerns what Deputy Mulherin said, and I do not want to add too much to it other than to say that we are all familiar with a commonly known phrase, justice delayed is justice denied.  It means that if a person does not get justice at the time their right has been engaged, it is just as bad as depriving them of the right.  If somebody engages a constitutional right and that right and entitlement is his or hers, delaying it is tantamount to removing that right.  We cannot do that, and it would certainly be unconstitutional.  Delay is just as bad in many circumstances as removal of the right, and we cannot do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300023#Z00600","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1372850700,"counter":730,"content":"<p>My simple question was for the medical evidence to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300023#Z00700","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1372850700,"counter":731,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett is next.

It would be a threat to women's lives if we were to take on board those suggestions but I ask the Minister to follow through on that logic when it comes to the issue of the number of doctors.  The Minister has admitted that because there is an unborn life in this equation, he is establishing a higher bar for certification as to the threat to a woman's life when it comes to suicidal feelings than would normally be the case were there not an unborn child in the equation.

She is getting second class rights because there is a pregnancy.

It must be remembered an individual with such underlying conditions would be dealt with differently and offered other treatments.  Does the Minister accept that a request for a termination of pregnancy in the circumstances to which I refer would give rise to significant ethical and legal dilemmas for the medical practitioners involved?  On one hand, many practitioners and the medical profession in general believe that there is no evidence base regarding the provision of a termination as a treatment for suicidal ideation.  On the other hand, they know that if, in some cases, they terminate a pregnancy at a particular stage, they will jeopardise either the life or the health of the unborn.

I accept that the Deputy is approaching the matter from a different angle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300024#AA01000","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1372851900,"counter":751,"content":"<p>What I am trying to say is that as things stand, and as clearly demonstrated by the X case, it is open to a doctor to perform a termination if she or he believes, in good faith, that it is the only treatment that will avert the threat to the life of the mother.  That can happen now.  We do not know if it is happening, how often it has happened or where it is happening.  There is no onus on people to report it and there is no mechanism to monitor it.  This Bill does all those things.<\/p><p>  Deputy Naughten asked about a patient who might be suicidal because of pregnancy but who has an underlying condition.  This is where the psychiatrist must use his or her clinical judgment and acumen to determine that the cause of the suicidal ideation and the risk to the woman's life is one primarily brought about by the pregnancy and not due to any other circumstance.  <\/p><p>  It might help a number of members if I state what Dr. Anthony McCarthy, who is the president of the Irish College of Psychiatrists, said.  He said there is no treatment for suicide and that the only course of action is to remove the risk and remove the underlying causes.  That is what the psychiatrist must do in clinical practice, namely, determine the underlying cause of the suicidal ideation presenting this risk.  That is what this Bill allows for.  If in the very rare circumstance it is the adjudication and the clinical judgment of the psychiatrist that the risk is indeed the continuation of the pregnancy, as opposed to any other underlying cause, then he or she must treat.  Dr. Rhona O'Mahony said she cannot be satisfied as she is not a psychiatrist, although she is an obstetrician, that this situation will not arise and, therefore, she feels it must be provided for by law.  As we know, it is provided for by law through the Supreme Court in the X case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300025#BB00100","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1372851900,"counter":752,"content":"<p>Nobody can make the case that the circumstance, where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman arising from a risk of suicide, would never arise.

Whether it is one in 1 million or whatever figure Deputy Mulherin had, I do not know what the likely outturn would be but nobody in this room or elsewhere can say it would never arise that a woman's life would not be at risk from the risk of suicide.  That case cannot be sustained and that is why we are providing for it.<\/p><p>  To answer Deputy Shortall's question on what protection is there, I say in all sincerity - I know it is repetitive - the protection is in the Bill.  The test is an extremely onerous one.  The protection for doctors acting in good faith carrying out the components of the test, which appear in the Bill, are the protections a doctor has as well as the additional protection all doctors have in regard to the general principles that apply to circumstances where there might be litigation or where their actions might be attacked afterwards.  There is protection there.  How else could we do this?  I genuinely ask Deputy Shortall and others, if they can suggest another way this can be done?  <\/p><p>  I respectfully say to Deputy Creed that I have a number of objections to the notion of having a medical advocate but the principal one is that it actually becomes circular.  If one puts an advocate into the clinical situation who is speaking up for the unborn, as Deputy Creed reasonably suggested he or she might do, it cannot change the balance of the test which must be applied, which is whether there is a real and substantial risk.  There is an added test in section 9 where we require two psychiatrists rather than one psychiatrist.  We have the added safeguards.  What would the advocate do?  Would the advocate question whether in truth there really was a real and substantial risk as found by the other two?  That is adding a third and is an argument for having four rather than three.  One would have to define what the advocate would do.  <\/p><p>  I understand Deputy Creed said a medical advocate but it has been argued in the debate that it should be some form of legal intervention, to which I would be wholly opposed.  I would not be in favour of a forensic cross-examination of a woman as to her bona fides.  That is precisely what Mr. Barnes meant in his article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  He might not have spelled out exactly what he meant but that is the only thing he could have meant.  The question of having an advocate, or having somebody to speak up for the unborn, must mean a forensic cross-examination of the woman concerned and I do not believe that could be countenanced.  That adds an extra layer and is not contemplated.<\/p><p>  The point about ethical dilemmas is addressed indirectly in the sense that the ethical dilemma doctors might have is resolved in this Bill in the provision in regard to conscientious objection.  Doctors apply the test and if a doctor has a conscientious objection to being involved in that process, he or she has an out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300025#BB00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1372851900,"counter":753,"content":"<p>I do not think anybody in this room or anyone engaged in a serious way in this debate wants to put the life of a mother at risk but I come back the Minister's acknowledgement that there is an equal right to life.

Should this committee, in the context of framing this legislation, not explore the possibility of developing a way which provides for equality of life for the unborn child, without comprising the right to life of the mother?<\/p><p>  I do not favour the point made by the former Director of Public Prosecutions in the context of legal representation.  However, it is worth exploring this possibility, although not in the form the Minister of State expressed of a forensic cross-examination by a medical advocate.  However, having certified that this entitlement exists medically, there is a question then of the advocate for the unborn child being involved in the management of the case to see how one could get to a situation, without compromising either the mother's or the unborn child's constitutional rights, where equality of life can be delivered for the unborn child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300025#BB00300","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speech","time":1372851900,"counter":754,"content":"<p>Doctors have to do both.

We have spoken about this Bill giving rise to clarity.  I have much sympathy for the Minister, the Minister of State and those in the Department in trying to formulate legislation arising from what I perceive as a flawed judicial decision 21 years ago.  Retrospectively we are trying to legislate for something that has happened.<\/p><p>  I am concerned about implementation of the legislation.  Does it not set off an alarm for the Minister that so many gynaecologists see a difficulty with this?  That is notwithstanding the conscientious objector issue and the ability to move to the next gynaecologist.  Is the Minister not saying to himself that there may be something wrong with this when the Master of the Rotunda Hospital, speaking on behalf of all his staff, has a difficulty?  What will happen in Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe when somebody arrives, goes through a process and is seen by a gynaecologist who is a conscientious objector and will not do the procedure?  How can the head of that hospital employ somebody who will do the procedure or advertise the position?  These are very important practical issues.<\/p><p>  During the hearings I sought to discover how many minors in the care of the HSE had availed of the X case decision on suicidal intent in order to have an abortion.  The Chief Medical Officer told me the executive did not have those statistics but I have since got them through parliamentary questions from the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Deputy Mulherin alluded to the six minors in question earlier.  Four of those appeared in court but two did not so why was there a differentiation?  They were signed off by a psychiatrist.  If this process is about protecting the lives of women, why did these minors go abroad for the termination?  Why did it not take place in Ireland if it was legal under the X case decision and relevant to a threat to the life of the woman in question?<\/p><p>  Deputy Creed touched on my next point, which relates to a patient who may be suicidal and does not want any treatment.  That person may be certified by the psychiatrist and the gynaecologist would intervene.  The Minister indicated that the same process happens now and the pregnancy is terminated, whether a foetus is viable or not.

The requirement is that we vindicate the right to life of the unborn and the equal right to life of the mother in the laws that we enact.  It does not remotely require us, constitutionally, to put it into each individual case where the issue or the dilemma arises, for example, separate representation.  What we are doing is we are calibrating a test in legislation, and it has been extremely difficult to do this.  We are guided by the Supreme Court but we have had to listen to everything that has been said, in the committee by members and by persons outside.  We are putting together, as best we can, a calibrated test that maintains equal respect for the equal right to life of the mother and the unborn.

There is a difference between a child being born prematurely with disabilities, but who is a wanted child, and the scenario that could arise under this legislation, that is, an unwanted child being delivered prematurely, resulting in significant disabilities.  Several questions arise out of the latter scenario, not least in respect of the State's liability, the legal and ethical responsibilities of the medical practitioners involved and the future care arrangements for such a child.  The Minister can see how this is moving towards a situation that many would find unacceptable.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy White, asked whether there was a better way.  He stated that he and the Minister were doing their best in the context of the constitutional provision and the law.  I do not doubt that for a moment, but the main problem is that there is no way of knowing what the consequences of this legislation will be.  People are concerned that, as it is not possible to prove clinically that a person is suicidal as a result of a pregnancy or the existence of an unborn child, the default position could become one in which medical practitioners, in order to protect themselves, would be reluctant to refuse to certify in such circumstances.  This could result in a significant increase in the rate of terminations.  This is the issue about which people are principally concerned.  Not for a moment am I claiming that this is what the Minister and Minister of State are setting out to achieve, but it could be the unintended consequence.  As such, it is fair and reasonable for people to ask them for an annual review mechanism that would be open and clear as regards the impact of this legislation and to give consideration-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300029#FF00800","speaker":"1178"},{"type":"speech","time":1372854300,"counter":838,"content":"<p>We are on section 9.

If someone has a better proposal as to how this can be done, he or she can tell us what it is now and we can consider it.  As regards saying we would review it, under the Constitution one cannot have a sunset clause in legislation.  One either passes legislation by voting for it or one does not.  The other thing about it is that what the Oireachtas enacts, it can repeal at some point in the future.  Therefore, I do not agree with the Deputy.<\/p><p>  As regards the test, there is a constitutional imperative for everybody involved to have regard to the equal right to life of the mother and the unborn.  Deputy Byrne asked the question succinctly and received a succinct answer.  That is at the heart of the legislation.  It is a constitutional imperative that the doctors involved must have regard to the equal right to life of the mother and the unborn.  That is why we say it is not a right to kill the unborn or destroy the foetus.  It is a right on the mother's part, in certain circumstances set out in the legislatin, to have a termination of her pregnancy.  The two are not the same.<\/p><p>  To come back to the point on whether there is another way of doing this, we cannot adjust the test downwards.  If we say there is a real and substantial risk to the mother's life, that is clear.  If it can only be averted through a termination, that is clear.  We then have a legitimate concern about what the implications might be for a viable foetus.  That is a legitimate concern to raise, but the answer to it cannot be to adjust in some way the test that the woman has already, as it were, passed - if I can use that term.  In other words, it has already been certified that there is genuinely a real and substantial risk to her life, or is it being suggested that, in circumstances where there is a legitimate concern about the unborn, we should revisit the test of whether there is a real and substantial risk to her life?  There either is or there is not a real and substantial risk to her life.  That cannot be varied as a result of something happening on the other side of the equation, if I can put it that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300030#GG00700","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1372854900,"counter":855,"content":"<p>Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al.

How does that tie in with what I asked concerning a situation where a pregnant woman refuses treatment?  One may not be able to impose a treatment, but surely one has to suggest alternative treatments to comply with Article 40.3.3o, or is that not the case?

A failure to certify will arise where the certifier cannot satisfy himself or herself that other modalities would not help to avert the risk and because the woman refuses to co-operate, although there is no underlying psychiatric illness and, therefore, no issue as to her capacity to give informed consent.  If we have a perfectly sane person, with perfectly good <i>compos mentis<\/i> ability to give informed consent, who refuses to give consent to treatment or co-operate with treatments that could address the issue, the Bill is quite clear - the certifier cannot certify because he or she has not been able to say with absolute authority that it is the only way to avert the risk to the woman's life.<\/p><p>  I will come back to Deputy Michelle Mulherin's point.  <\/p><p>  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v talked about the HSE being the authority, and he should know.  However, the problem is that the HSE is a composite of a load of different professionals and individuals.  The reality is that there is a lack of clarity in the law and they are as afflicted by this lack of clarity as anybody else.<\/p><p>  Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall raised the issue of termination of pregnancy versus the right to life of the unborn.  I am glad that she has raised that issue because it gives me an opportunity to clarify what I am saying.  Under the Bill, a woman has a right to a termination of pregnancy if that is the only treatment that can avert the real and substantial risk to her life.  It does not confer a right on her or anybody else to destroy the life of the unborn as an entity in itself.  If that happens as a consequence of the gestational period involved, it is obviously going to be the outcome.  However, if the pregnancy is 30 weeks in gestation, there is absolutely no right for the woman to seek the destruction of the child - none.  <\/p><p>  Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall also talked about the legal and ethical considerations.  They will continue to apply and will change and modified under the best practice guidelines from the various institutes and colleges.  They will also be adjudicated on and agreed to by the Medical Council.  The Deputy has said one cannot prove whether someone is suicidal and she is absolutely right.  In fairness, it is very difficult to do so with absolute authority.  It is a clinical decision, but what one can do as a psychiatrist and what he or she is being asked to do in the Bill is to assess the risk to the woman's life.  Is it real and substantial?  That being the case, is a termination the only thing that will avert the risk?  I reiterate that no one has a right to destroy the baby but only to terminate the pregnancy if it is to save the woman's life and the only treatment available to save her life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300030#GG01400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1372854900,"counter":862,"content":"<p>I agree absolutely.

The diagnostic test is whether or not she is suicidal and the only treatment is termination to avert that risk.  To be absolutely clear, the test is that this woman is of a high risk of suicide, that her suicidal intent is such that it represents a substantial and real risk to her life and the only way of averting that risk is to terminate the pregnancy.  If that pregnancy is below 22 or 23 weeks that is going to result in the destruction of unborn life but that is an unintentional effect.  If it is at 28 or 30 weeks then a viable baby may be born.

I am opposed to the section.  I articulated my concerns earlier on this and I would like to make a few brief points on it.  Suicide is a real risk in pregnancy and there is no doubt about that.  We all have to acknowledge it.  However, it is important that we note the evidence given by Professor Kevin Malone to the committee.  A balance has to be struck on the issue.  We are told that we are talking about a very small potential cohort of people, and the Minister referred to \"a handful of cases.\"  The reality is that suicidal ideation within pregnancy is quite common.   The research shows it is between one in three and one in eight pregnancies, so it is quite common.  I have no doubt that a sizeable proportion of the women who are currently going to the UK do so on the basis of suicidal ideation.  That has to be acknowledged as well.<\/p><p>  An impression is being given that there is a parity between mental illness and physical illness.  That is not the case and it is a false impression that has been given in some quarters on the issue.  The reality is that if a woman has an underlying mental health issue that provides an alternative course of treatment, then that treatment must be proceeded with and the consultant cannot certify in those circumstances.  If, however, the woman does not have an underlying mental health issue and has suicidal intent, then the consultant psychiatrists' hands are tied and they must certify in those cases.  In his last contribution, the Minister spoke about treatments for women who have no mental issue and who have suicidal intent.  The evidence we have received from the hearings is that under the Mental Health Act 2001, while the psychiatrist may suggest counselling, it is not actually a course of treatment and one cannot recommend a course of treatment for somebody who does not have an underlying mental health issue.  On that basis the psychiatrists would have to certify.<\/p><p>  There are major ambiguities on section 9 of this legislation.  It is impossible either to prove or disprove suicidal ideation.  The only decision that can be made by a consultant psychiatrist is whether or not there is an underlying issue and whether that underlying issue can be treated appropriately.  If it cannot be treated appropriately, their hands are tied on this issue.  It opens up a very complex situation in some of the issues that have already been raised, and on that basis I am opposed to this section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300032#JJ01300","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1372856100,"counter":908,"content":"<p>I already spoke on Second Stage in some detail on my objection to this section.  The diagnosis, especially the circumstances outlined by Deputy Naughten, poses huge difficulties.<\/p><p>  There seems to be major evidence from psychiatrists that they do not believe that abortion is a treatment for suicide and there seems to be some evidence that any possible saving of life would be more than offset by the higher rate of suicide for people post-abortion.  In other words, we would not be saving people's lives.  As this legislation is drafted, we could potentially leave a large number of people with severe disabilities that were otherwise perfectly healthy.  We know in recent times of the huge trauma of preventable situations that come before us now that should never have happened.  It puts psychiatrists in an impossible situation to make a judgment where they know that the rate of clinical accuracy is very low.  As the Minister himself has said time and again, there are no clinical markers here.  There are no biochemical markers here.  Except for trying to get into the mind of another person, there is nothing one can do at a physical level to assess this.  Therefore, in my view it puts psychiatrists in an impossible situation.<\/p><p>  We know that mental health grounds in other jurisdictions have been the wedge to lead to a situation where I believe the Irish have said they do not want to go, because they want to protect the equal right to life of the child.  For that reason, I will be opposing this section.<\/p><p>  There is nobody in this room who has not been touched by suicide involving somebody close to them.  It is a huge problem in our society.  If we are all honest, we do not do enough to deal with the difficulty of suicide in our society.  Whatever comes out of this Bill and whatever we decide here, if we are serious about this challenge of suicide in our society, I hope we will come back and devote the same time and resources to see how we can reduce the horrendous rate of suicide in our society, which is affecting every family in the country.  Suicide in a family will change that family forever.  Whatever differences of opinion we might have on this Bill and where the balance of good lies, I would hope that when we are finished here, we will not think that the suicide issue in society was dealt with, because that is not the case.

There is no currency for the notion that abortion is a treatment for suicidal tendencies.<\/p><p>  A woman may not have had a history of mental health issues but she, and indeed any man, presenting who is suicidal or has suicidal tendencies has mental health issues at that time.  One cannot separate the reality of a situation for a person, male or female, who is suicidal or has suicidal ideation from the need for mental health treatment.  That is absolutely the case.  That requires best practice and address across the board.  I have every confidence that the front-line service providers are doing, and will do, everything they can to give every support possible.  It would be remiss of me not to add how well they are doing despite being under-resourced and under-staffed across all these areas of mental health service provision.  That is another day's work.

In those situations and knowing the fact that such situations can and do arise we cannot as legislators blinker ourselves to that fact.  We are obliged, and it is our duty and responsibility, to face up to those situations that can and do present.  We all wish they would never arise and that the incidence of it would be zero at all times but it will not be because all too sadly there will be situations that will present.  This was affirmed in the course of the hearings that presumably all of us attended over the past few months.<\/p><p>  As a member of the Opposition and health spokesperson I support the inclusion of section 9 in this Bill because, while I wish it was not necessary, I believe that all the evidence shows that it is required to protect that small number of women who will present and need that support, and for whom the clinicians and consultants who will be entrusted to provide for their care will need the clarity and certainty that this Bill can present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300033#KK00100","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1372856700,"counter":910,"content":"<p>I confirm my support for this section.

Many people are disturbed by this and it is not generally known among the public.  I referred earlier to ethical concerns raised at the hearings of this committee, principally by Dr. Sam Coulter Smyth on behalf of his colleagues.  He is the Master of one of the busiest maternity hospitals in Europe. He said:<blockquote><br \/>First, if a patient at twenty-five weeks gestation is deemed sufficiently suicidal to require a termination of pregnancy by one or more psychiatric colleagues, the obstetrician tasked with dealing with this situation is faced with an enormous ethical dilemma.  Delivery of this baby at twenty-five weeks gestation could lead to the death of the child from extreme prematurity, could lead to a child with cerebral palsy, or with significant developmental issues for the future.  This outcome would be entirely iatrogenic and the responsibility of those clinicians who agreed to be involved in the process.  This is a source of serious concern for myself and my colleagues.<\/blockquote>Given the source of those comments we cannot continue to ignore them and that is what is happening.  It is not sufficient to get the response that &quot;you cannot limit a constitutional right&quot; because that is the line coming out.  It is wholly unacceptable that there would not be a gestational time limit in section 9 cases.  If it is not possible to do anything at this point there should, as a minimum, be a clear commitment to arranging a constitutional referendum on this specific issue and to be held with the other referenda in October and prior to the commencement of this legislation.  There is a way of doing it within a matter of a few months if there is a constitutional impediment.

Nobody has ever claimed that.  It is off the pitch in terms of being a relevant argument to what we are talking about.  The Supreme Court made the correct decision; in the case of X, a 14-year-old girl who was raped and became suicidal, to force her to continue with her pregnancy could have represented a threat to her life.  This was a real situation.  The Supreme Court made a decision and we should not second-guess that.<br \/><font color=\"#0000FF\">  <\/font>As I have indicated, this section should go further.  I mentioned that the conditions are too onerous in terms of the number of doctors and too prescriptive in that an obstetrician is required.

Section 9 refers to &quot;a psychiatrist who provides, or who has provided, mental health services to women in respect of pregnancy, childbirth or post-partum care.&quot;  That is too prescriptive and onerous, and I believe that the presence of an obstetrician is unnecessary.  We should apply the same standards that we apply to any other mental health situation, namely, by requiring the presence of one psychiatrist and a GP.  There is no medical basis for distinguishing between a medical emergency and a psychiatric emergency.  That advice comes from psychiatrists whom I have consulted.  Psychiatrists have said there is no medical basis for making the distinction.  <\/p><p>  When we have debated issues with regard to mental health and suicide in the D&aacute;il in other contexts Deputies across the political spectrum have made the point that we have to take mental health seriously, that there is a stigma, that there is different treatment for different people, and that an unfair distinction is made between mental health issues and other supposedly real medical issues.  People in other contexts across the spectrum have said we should not make that distinction.  Yet in this Bill we make that distinction.  I do not think the Minister should be dismissive when I make that point because it is one being put forward not just by me but by many other people.

They are also suggesting that a suicidal woman who would kill herself as a result of her pregnancy would have two options: she would be forced by the State to go through with that pregnancy regardless of her suicidal state, or she would be forced by the State to go to the UK without the support of her clinician, medical team and family.  If we delete this section as proposed by members of the committee, they are the two options we are presenting to women who will kill themselves because of a crisis pregnancy.  Those who propose deleting the section should think long and hard about that, and take into account the fact that it is the constitutional right of a woman whose life is at risk by suicide to obtain a termination on that basis.

The application for the review process needs to be assessed to ascertain the nature of the request and whether it concerns a section 7 or section 9 certification, as well as to identify the relevant medical practitioners, the logistical arrangements for convening them, their duty to examine the woman and her right to be heard or for someone to address the review committee on her behalf.  Reasonable timeframes are, therefore, provided for in the Bill to strike a balance between the need to vindicate the pregnant woman's right to life and the logistical requirements of the process.  During the drafting of the Bill my officials consulted with the relevant professional bodies and I am satisfied that the timeframes provided are appropriate.<\/p><p>  In addition, it must be noted that the timeframes refer to an absolute upper limit and, depending on the clinical scenario at hand, the review process may take place much more speedily.  Finally, were the pregnant woman's medical condition to deteriorate, provisions are made for her situation to be addressed through an emergency procedure under section 8. <\/p><p>  We had a long conversation on this issue at Cabinet.  I believe three days is a reasonable length of time and that seven days is too long for convening a committee.  However, this request could come in on a Friday evening.  The medical experts, all of whom have work and patient commitments, will have to be available.  In any event, the process could take less than three days.<\/p><p>  In regard to the assessment, particularly where it involves a review of suicidal ideation, we would have to leave sufficient time for a proper clinical assessment and review.  This will not be a purely desktop study nor will the reviewers be required to interview the woman if that is not her desire.

It is important to bear in mind that the treating team is under an explicit statutory duty to have regard to the need to preserve unborn human life as far as practicable.  The Bill requires the treating team to have regard to the right to life of both the woman and the unborn in accordance with Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution.  The review committee is under the same obligation.<\/p><p>  The composition of the medical team set forth in sections 7 and 9 was arrived at in order to ensure that it included appropriate expertise that would be in a position to assess the viability of the foetus and thus discharge this core duty.  Specifically, each team must include an obstetrician, who can give expert input to the other doctors.

In order for people's rights to be vindicated, or if two people are in conflict, each side is entitled to be represented and the two sides cross-examine each other and do all those things that happen in court.  That is how people's rights are vindicated and, ultimately, somebody makes a decision.  However, we are talking here about a clinical environment.  Even though the amendment does not propose a legal person, although it refers to the Attorney General, it mentions \"[a]n advocate\".  In fact, it does not say the advocate is not a lawyer.  I assume the Deputy did not intend the advocate to be a lawyer, but it does not actually state that he or she would not be a lawyer.  In fact, on second thoughts, I believe it probably would be a lawyer under Deputy Kelleher's formulation, but not under Deputy Creed's.  I think that would be all the more inappropriate and wrong.  <\/p><p>  What would this person do?  I am very taken by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's point, not necessarily for the reason he raised it but for another reason.  In this whole process we are trying to maintain the balance all the time as best we can, and the calibration of rights is maintained as best we can in each stage through protection of the life of the unborn and the equal right to life of the mother.  We are trying to maintain this all the time, meticulously, every time we go at it, in every section, every bit and every event that occurs.  That is what we are trying to do.  If one adds into the equation an advocate for the unborn, it necessarily has implications for how one is going to apply that scenario to the mother.  I believe it does upset the balance of the Bill, which is a very delicate balance in many ways.<\/p><p>  It is not clear what the advocate would do.  The fact that the Attorney General is appointing him or her seems to suggest that it would be a lawyer, and, quite frankly, I do not know what he or she would do.  This might sound a bit odd, but if one appoints a lawyer in a situation, how can he or she not cross-examine?  That is how our system works.  If somebody does not accept what the other side is saying, under our system they are entitled to ask them how do you say this or why do you say that, and say surely this or surely that.  The whole system works in this way.<\/p><p>  I will return to what the Minister has said, which I think is absolutely right.  We are internalising, if the Deputy would like to use that word.  The doctors and the review panel here are internalising within themselves the necessity to look after the rights of both parties.  It is not that we are saying that over in this corner will be somebody advocating for this and in another corner will be somebody advocating for someone else.  The doctors must comprehend the rights of both and must be able to balance them.  That is why I use the word \"internalising\".  They have to deal with it themselves.  They have to have regard to the right to life of the unborn, always with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother.  That is the proposal we have in the legislation.  Putting an advocate in on one side necessarily raises the question of what one does on the other side of the equation.  That would be wrong.  There was one other point, which I cannot remember.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300043#VV00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1372862100,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>It is stated in section 13(3), \"if the application ... was made by another person on behalf of the woman\".

As we discussed earlier, hundreds of documents are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is very important for a mechanism to be found to ensure the reports are discussed at the relevant health committee every year.  I do not know whether that should be in the legislation.  Perhaps it is a decision to be made by the committee itself.  I outlined my fear, which is shared by many people, in relation to section 9.  The Minister believes we are incorrect and does not think it will happen the way we fear.  I hope he is right.  Given that he is putting great store on this reporting mechanism as a means of ensuring what we fear might happen does not, it is important for these reports to come before this committee for discussion and debate as a matter of course, rather than merely being laid before the Houses, which as we all know simply involves being placed in the Oireachtas Library.  I do not know how many Deputies are cognisant of all the stuff that goes into the Library.  If that were to be agreed, and in view of the fact that the Minister is going to publish these reports in this way, I will not press amendment No. 70.  In such circumstances, the Minister's proposal would have the same effect as what I am proposing.  I am keen to put in place an early warning system, in case the numbers start increasing dramatically under section 9, to ensure it is possible to investigate whether the law is acting properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300045#XX00700","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1372863300,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>I support amendments Nos. 69 and 73.

I would say it should be \"referred\" to the committee.  The committees are autonomous and the Oireachtas is autonomous.  I think the Minister should be obliged to bring the report to the committee's attention.  One of the problems with providing for things to be laid before the Oireachtas is that such a provision is now being included in an increasing amount of legislation.  In the early days after this idea was first suggested, presumably everyone kept an eye on the small number of documents that were being laid before the Oireachtas.  This practice has become so prolific that it has become a problem for people to pick up on this stuff.  The same thing applies in the case of EU legislation.  It seems to me that much of the stuff that is put in the Oireachtas Library should be referred directly to one of our many Oireachtas committees, which can decide whether it wants to debate them.  The Minister could start a very good practice and move things forward by recognising that times and circumstances have changed and that there are better ways of doing things than the way we did them in the past.

I do not think it is a given.<\/p><p>  We are very clear that an institution does not have a right of conscientious objection yet it was determined that it was not necessary to put this in the Bill on the basis that as the Minister of State, Deputy White, has said on several occasions, it is not necessary always to include the negative in Bills.

It provides that \"Any person who resists or wilfully obstructs or impedes . . . a person providing medical services at or in a hospital . . . shall be guilty of an offence.\"  The term \"medical services\" includes services provided by doctors, psychiatrists, midwives, nurses, pharmacists and social care professionals or other persons providing treatment and care for persons at or in a hospital.

We should not criminalise the woman concerned and this is the point of my amendment which seeks to insert, after &quot;person&quot;, in line 25, &quot;other than the pregnant woman concerned&quot;.  The effect of the amendment would be to differentiate between the pregnant woman concerned and others who may be party to the offence.  Precedent exists for that principle and the matter was discussed at length at the hearings.  The particular precedent is in the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993, whereby the person who attempts suicide is not criminalised.  That same principle should operate with regard to this Bill.<\/p><p>  As it stands, the section criminalises, for instance, a young woman or girl who may well be traumatised and who may have been abused.  We are storing up difficulties, both for ourselves and for others.  I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.

In my own consideration I examined section 22 with regard to the arguments for and against with a view to a deletion of the section entirely.  I accept that is not an acceptable proposition because it would remove the penalties applying to those who act outside the scope of this legislation, either in approved institutions as itemised on the Schedule or those who would carry out such procedures in unapproved settings.  It is a question of how to deal with the situation of the woman.  I am of the very strong view, as is my party, that we should not criminalise the woman who seeks an end to the pregnancy.  There will be any number of reasons that might be the case.  However, she does not require to be brought through the courts to face fines and-or imprisonment for up to 14 years.  She needs support, compassion and care.  The penalties, most certainly, should apply to those who act outside the law but the woman in this instance should not be for consideration in this regard.<\/p><p>  We should not fool ourselves into believing that a case might not present itself.  If a young woman who accesses tablets on the Internet unbeknown to her immediate family or whoever, what is the situation if she were to become unwell and presents at a hospital?  It may then be determined that she had acted as I have just described.  She had accessed tablets that would induce a termination of her pregnancy.  Where does that put the clinicians and the consultants dealing with her?  The very likely scenario is that this would be reported.  A situation could then arise in the courts where a young woman in such circumstances could face prosecution with the type of prescribed consequences that section 22 provides for.<\/p><p>  Over the past week I have discussed this point and the scenario I have described with very strong pro-life advocates.  They agreed with me and said they would have no appetite for such a scenario, despite the fact that they would have very strong objections to this Bill in general.  They would not subscribe to the view that the woman should be criminalised and that there was provision for penalties of the order provided for in this section.  We need to be mindful of what is actually being allowed in this section.  We should take into account the widest opinion in society which I am certain has no wish to see women placed in that absolutely objectionable situation.

While I understand the Deputies' concern in this regard, it should be noted that, as it stands, a woman may be prosecuted for non-lawful abortion under the provisions of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 which states any such woman shall be liable to be \"kept in penal servitude for life\".  In other words, the provision in the Bill does not create a new offence for women in such circumstances but merely brings the penalty for the existing offence in line with current parameters, namely, that instead of imprisonment for life, the sentence shall not exceed 14 years.<\/p><p>  While it is recognised that the potential criminalisation of a pregnant woman is a very difficult and sensitive matter, this provision reflects the State's constitutional obligation arising from Article 40.3.3&deg;.  It would also be inequitable to have, as a matter of course, a significant penalty for the person performing a medical procedure but none at all for the woman who willingly undergoes that procedure.  It is vital to point out that the sentence to be applied in any particular case is a matter for the courts.  We are always inclined to consider the worst case scenario in these matters.  There is no intention under this section that a woman would be sentenced to 14 years in prison, but it is there in the law.<\/p><p>  There are two important issues to highlight.  First, it is very clear that a prosecution can only be brought at the behest of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The latter has discretion in this regard and I have absolutely no doubt that this discretion will be exercised.  Second, if a case does come to court, the court also has discretion at its disposal.  I cannot foresee a case where a court would inflict that level of penalty on a woman.  I share Deputies' concerns for women in difficult circumstances, potentially including minors who might be more likely to purchase certain items from the Internet.  I am confident, however, that the courts have wisdom, as well as justice, as does the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is my expectation that the type of penalty described will not be inflicted on individual women and will instead be reserved for recalcitrant operators of illicit services.<\/p><p>  In regard to the comments on suicide and how it is treated, it is important to point out that suicide is to take one's own life, whereas abortion is to take the life of another, namely, the unborn.  It would not be appropriate to equate the two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300050#CCC00500","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1372866300,"counter":1192,"content":"<p>I find it very difficult to dispute Deputy Seamus Healy's description of these provisions as \"anachronistic\" and \"inhumane\".  However, the Minister made an important point when he said this section continued the criminalisation of women already provided for in law rather than introducing a criminal sanction.  There is a difference.<\/p><p>  Deputy Michael McNamara is absolutely correct in his observation that the necessity of this provision arises from the decision of the people in 1983 to place the relevant clause in the Constitution.  The exchange between Deputies Ciara Conway, Colm Keaveney and Regina Doherty in this regard was very interesting.  There are very few people who do not baulk at the prospect of a punishment of 14 years in jail for women in the circumstances we are discussing.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, even people who are very strongly pro-life wonder how this sanction could have been included.  The bottom line is that the requirement in this regard is the stark and unavoidable consequence of Article 40.3.3&deg;, a fact which we must honestly relate to the people.  I am sorry if it sounds glib, but the people cannot have it both ways, no more than we can as legislators.  It simply is not possible to have a clause in the Constitution which protects the life of the unborn in the way that it does without having a criminal sanction along the lines of unlawful killing to penalise persons who are in breach of that law.<\/p><p>  These positions are not reconcilable, no matter how much persons moved by a common humanity might wish it were so.  I recall this issue being raised in the debate in 1983 and it has come up many times since.  In her reference to the bizarreness of the position of some of those objecting to the provision, I understand Deputy Ciara Conway was pointing to the conflict that arises.  We cannot, in short, have it both ways; it is one or the other.  The amendments are entirely well motivated, but they cannot be delivered.  We have no right to do what the Deputies are proposing because we cannot set aside the constitutional provision, as inserted by the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300050#CCC00600","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372866900,"counter":1194,"content":"<p>I appreciate how difficult delivering on the intent of the amendment would be.

It is feasible and can happen.  It is provided for.  The circumstances I have described are not so improbable because the greater number, perhaps, of young women seeking the termination of a pregnancy are resorting to the Internet to gain access to imported medications.  One may call them what one will.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a scenario such as the one I describe will arise.  I definitely do not want to see a young woman in such circumstances equated with the providers of terminations, those who would perform backstreet abortions or accredited professionals within appropriate institutions named in this Bill acting outside the law.  This is why I did not seek to delete section 22.  We all understand and accept that what I have outlined must not be.  There is a distinction to be made, however.

There is widespread support across the Oireachtas for a change to this particular provision.  One should remember that the penalty is 14 years in prison.  Any perusal of sentences in recent times will indicate that a sentence of 14 years is greater than the normal sentence for crimes such as rape and manslaughter.  The Minister states the courts will not impose such a penalty or may not do so, but we simply do not know.  The law, as it stands, provides for the penalty.

I fully subscribe to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's absolute distinction in regard to the prospect of an illegal commercially motivated procedure that would not be provided for under the legislation.  The distinction should be considered by the Minister of State.  To avoid doubt, he should positively consider declaring section 22(2) null and void.  He should consider the amendment, seek further advice and consider inserting the words \"other than the pregnant woman concerned\".

While they have wisdom and knowledge of the law, they also have compassion.  I do not believe that level of penalty will be imposed on a woman, particularly a minor.<\/p><p>  Members raised a scenario in which a women obtains an abortifacient pharmaceutical drug on the Internet but has a partial abortion and must then go to a doctor.  The patient-doctor relationship is one of absolute confidentiality.  There is no onus on a patient to explain how she came across the tablets.  They could have been obtained in the UK.  A women could have procured a termination in the UK, which is not illegal, and returned with complications.  As I have said already, we want people to avail of the services available from the Health Service Executive for after-abortion care and counselling.  The Medical Council guidelines on disclosures required by law state:<blockquote>In certain limited circumstances, disclosure of patient information may be required by law.  These circumstances are not limited to but may include when ordered by a judge in a court of law, or by a tribunal or body established by an Act of the Oireachtas, or where mandated by infectious disease regulations.  In these instances, you should inform patients of the disclosure and the reasons for it.<\/blockquote>I do not believe such cases will come under that.  The guidelines also state:<blockquote>Disclosure of patient information without their consent may be justifiable in exceptional circumstances when it is necessary to protect the patient or others from serious risk of death or serious harm.  You should obtain consent of the patient to the disclosure if possible.<\/blockquote>I do not believe a case such as we are discussing is covered by that provision, as the event has happened, the danger has passed and the damage has been done.  The guidelines state:<blockquote>If you consider that disclosing patient information is justifiable, you should carefully consider whether anonymisation of the information (sharing it without revealing the patient's identity) would achieve the same potential benefits.  You must also be careful to disclose the information to an appropriate person (or body) who understands that the information must be kept confidential.  You should only disclose the minimum information that is necessary in the circumstances.<br \/><br \/>  In the preceding instances, you should inform patients of the disclosure unless this would cause them serious harm.<\/blockquote>The guidelines also deal with disclosures in the public interest, which would not apply here because it applies to the health of others.<\/p><p>  In short, it is not necessary for the patient to reveal and not necessary for the doctor to inquire.  From my experience in practice, I noted increasingly that patients were not presenting for certain issues relating to their health as they felt they would be reported on in insurance forms.  I used to have to explain to people that insurance forms required all medical information.<\/p><p>  I do not want the message to go out that doctors will start reporting young girls or women who find themselves in difficulty following a failed termination.  It would be counterproductive.  If we have any doubt, we just have to remind ourselves of the terrible tragedy in Granard, County Longford, all those years ago.  I appreciate how members have expressed in different ways their compassion for women who find themselves in these circumstances.

It could still mean this section could result in the chill factor remaining and in the whole issue of termination of pregnancies being seen as some sort of criminal activity in the same way as other crimes.  For all sorts of reasons, although I would have think a lot about precisely how one would formulate it differently, there is a case for deleting section 22 and for dealing with this matter in a totally different way.  I want to signal the possibility of an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300055#HHH00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1372869000,"counter":1227,"content":"<p>This area is fraught and I understand what people have said and I accept their concerns.

However, as Deputy McNamara said, it could be construed as giving free rein to intentionally destroy unborn human life.  I have to take the legal advice available to me and I know that if section 22(4) was not there, section 22(1), from the Attorney General's point of view, does not present a difficulty.  I think the best thing to do, given the concern expressed here and elsewhere about this section, is that the Minister of State, Deputy White, and I would return on Report Stage with a possible amendment or solution to section 22(4).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013070300055#HHH00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1372869000,"counter":1228,"content":"<p>The general proposition in section 22(1) is that it is an offence to intentionally destroy unborn human life.

The inclusion of a specific statutory provision is not necessary to allow a court imposing sentence for any of the above offences, or any offence, to take into account aggravating factors.  It is a matter for the sentencing court to identify the mitigating and aggravating factors relevant to each case.  This is already covered in the law and including the provision in the Bill would not add anything.

The debate was not always conducted in the best manner possible.  Much of the reason for reaching this point is down to the sea change in society and public opinion.

Members will appreciate that as the board has not met and I have not visited the offices and staff of the authority, my presentation will based on personal research and briefings by the Department and CEO of the authority.  Consequently, I may not be in a position to provide as much detail as the members are accustomed to.  I have provided a written submission outlining my professional background and giving a brief update on the authority.  I will summarise this.<\/p><p>  I am a native of Dublin, where I have lived all my life.  I am married and have six adult children.  I have worked in the electronics and telecommunications industries for over 40 years and have held senior management positions in the operations and supply chain areas.  I hold a bachelor of business studies degree from DCU and a diploma in personnel management from the College of Industrial Relations.    I am a member of the Institute of Directors.  In 2010, as part of the chartered director programme, I obtained a diploma in company direction from the institute.  I am currently working towards becoming a chartered director.<\/p><p>  My most recent and relevant experience is as senior vice president of operations for Dialogic Corporation, formerly Eicon Technology, where I worked from 1992 to 2011.  My first task with Dialogic Corporation was to set up the Irish-based European manufacturing and distribution centre.  From 2001 to 2011, as senior vice president of operations, I was responsible for all aspects of operations and the supply chain in the Americas, Europe and the Far East.  During this period, the company went through an extensive restructuring programme and then, via a series of mergers and acquisitions, embarked on a major expansion programme.  As a member of the executive management team at the time, I was heavily involved in these activities.  I gained extensive experience in areas such as strategy, organisational change, change management, project management, financial management and due diligence.<\/p><p>  Before I joined Dialogic Corporation, I worked with a number of Japanese and American multinationals and with Irish companies in various positions, both technical and managerial.  I am currently a non-executive director of Parkinson's Association of Ireland and have been since 2010.  I take an active part in the workings of the board and am a member of the finance and HR-governance sub-committees.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Private Security Authority, I have not yet had the opportunity to work with the board so some of my comments are based on personal research.  The authority was established in 2005 under the Private Security Act 2004, as amended in 2011.  It is a statutory body responsible for the licensing and regulation of the security industry in Ireland.  Since it began operations, it has issued over 800 contract licenses in four major sectors and over 27,000 individual licenses in two major sectors.  Work is ongoing to extend regulation and licensing to other sectors of the industry.<\/p><p>  The role of chairman is one of leadership and guidance to ensure that the board and executive have a clear understanding of their mandates and that the skills and expertise of the board members are used to best effect for the benefit of the authority.  The role involves ensuring that the board, in accordance with the code of governance, understands its role is to provide guidance in areas such as strategy and governance, and that the authority delivers operational efficiencies and high service levels and is not a burden to the industry.<\/p><p>  Upon appointment, it will be a priority to arrange an early meeting of the new board.  The last board meeting was held in November 2012.  As I mentioned in my submission, there are a number of housekeeping items to be addressed.  A further priority will be the strategic plan.  Under the legislation, the authority is obliged to present a three-year strategic plan.  The current plan expires in 2013.  It will be necessary to prepare a new plan for submission to the Minister as soon as practicable.  I look forward to working closely with the new board and CEO after my appointment.  The ambition is to continue to roll out the mandate of the authority and to provide the highest level of service to all stakeholders.  I thank the members for this opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013070300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Lappin"},{"type":"speech","time":1372840200,"counter":1275,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Lappin and wish him every success in setting up his new board and working with the Private Security Authority, PSA.  I accept and appreciate that he has not yet begun that work.<\/p><p>  A number of electricians in my constituency and elsewhere have been expressing concern over how the authority works, particularly regarding the installation of security alarm systems.  Electricians must pass phase 6 in their apprenticeship to be qualified to work with voltages from 0 to 1,000.  Electricians claim that the authority is basically denying them the right to practise their trade when they are qualified.  They argue that some PSA members are not qualified to work on security or electrical installations as every installation requires working with main voltages.  Much of the work, the electricians argue, is not up to the standard set by the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland.  The electricians are members of various associations.  One is the Registered Electrical Contractors of Ireland, one of whose functions is to ensure that electrical contractors meet the requirements of the CER.  Electricians are also members of the Electrical Contractors Safety &amp;amp; Standards Association.  The electricians to whom I refer are members of both bodies and have insurance cover for a liability of up to &euro;6.5 million.  An electrician can join both the Electrical Contractors Safety &amp;amp; Standards Association and Registered Electrical Contractors of Ireland for a fee of &euro;300 per annum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013070300002#A00400","speaker":"1021","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372840200,"counter":1277,"content":"<p>I note Mr. Lappin's point that he had not yet been appointed officially to the post.

Given the questions I have, I was interested to hear in his opening remarks that he has a background in electronics.  The PSA's job is to regulate and license the private security industry.  I endorse Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny's points and focus on certain details.  Does Mr. Lappin accept that Irish electricians are highly certified and qualified to install alarms and other devices?  It is often forgotten that we have such a highly qualified, certified group of electricians.  They feel they are being left down by the PSA.  It is a mood out there.  One electrician has a turnover of &euro;55,000, of which the CCTV portion represents &euro;4,000.  The fees to the PSA are &euro;2,500.  Financially, that is very hard on a small business person.  If he does not pay the fee, he will lose much of the &euro;4,000 CCTV contract he gets per year.  It is an issue that must be addressed.<\/p><p>  When the PSA was looking for external inspectors, the advertisement turned up in the magazine of the Garda Representative Association.  Under the section on qualifications and experience, the advertisement said applicants must have a strong background in undertaking investigations through personal interaction with the public, including face-to-face interviewing, good administrative planning and scheduled skills.  Why was the advertisement turning up in the magazine of the Garda Representative Association?  What direct experience do these people have in the electrical and alarms business generally?<\/p><p>  Is it lawful under EU competition law for the Private Security Authority to treat small contractors with modest turnover in the same way as contractors with a turnovers of &euro;650,000 or more?  This is something we are concerned about.  I want to represent the interests of small providers as opposed to the major ones, as the former are often forgotten.  It is particularly so during a significant downturn when small, self-employed electricians are being hammered.  They are fighting for survival.  I want to represent that voice.  Is it lawful under EU law to prohibit small contracts when carrying out maintenance of alarm systems, as will be the case when the maintenance of alarm systems is included in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011?  I raise these issues, Chairman, to ensure Mr. Lappin has some feel for what is going on in the broader community.  It is my job as a Member of the Oireachtas to raise these issues and ask these questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013070300003#B00800","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1372840200,"counter":1284,"content":"<p>The Deputy does that job exceptionally well.

Technology is changing rapidly and the areas and lines between different sectors are becoming blurred, so that will be an area at which the authority must look to see where technology is going.  Increasing automation is coming in and people are being taken out of the equation.  How do we govern, for example, the fully automated building?  What happens to the staff?  They are areas about which the authority has been thinking and which it will need to address.  In respect of mandate, the authority needs to fulfil the existing mandate given the financial and personnel resources it has.  That is where I see the mandate.  PR would seem to be a resource issue.  I know matters like the maintenance of the website are an issue but where is the capacity to do that kind of work?

I know there is mention of that being rolled out in the sector in 2013.  Is Mr. Lappin aware whether that process has started or is it something he will take up when he sits with the board?  Does the authority govern private security in respect of our transport providers?  I am aware of security personnel on much of the transport in the city and wonder whether they are governed.  I assume they are but could Mr. Lappin cover that?  Could he give us a brief outline regarding the work the authority has done on private investigators?  I would be interested in hearing his thoughts on that, albeit from a researched perspective as opposed to a practical experience of it.  I have come across the issue of fees with quite a lot of the agencies set up since the 1990s.  Fees have steadily crept upwards and in the case of one or two, it is often difficult to understand precisely what it is they are charging for in the first place.

I am thinking in particular of electricians in rural areas in one or two man operations.  For them to come up with this huge fee is prohibitive and many of them do not bother because they would not make enough money installing alarms in the entire year to justify it.  I welcome the news today that this will be reduced.<\/p><p>  Would a public information campaign be a priority for Mr. Lappin?  I came across an occasion when a person used their local electrician to install an alarm and received a very strongly worded letter from the PSA about the fact that they had used an electrician who was not registered with it.  The individual did not know that they were breaking the law by employing someone they knew and trusted and who did all the electrical work for them.  I tried to find public information on this in order that the citizen would know that they would be breaking the law if they did not use a registered electrician but I could not find anything anywhere.  That is not to say that it is not out there but I certainly could not find it.  If I could not find it then how could an ordinary citizen find it?

As the committee is aware we are a three member commission and propose that each of us in turn will present some of our thoughts to the committee.<\/p><p>   We were appointed by the President on 12 December 2011, and last year we published our corporate strategy.  Timeliness in completing fair, proportionate, independent and impartial inquiries was at the heart of our approach.  We found that many of our investigations were open for far too long.  We firmly believed that this situation was not satisfactory in giving redress to the people complaining to us, nor to the garda&iacute; being complained about.<\/p><p>  The main reason for delays has been the difficulties encountered in the collection of information and evidence.  Requests to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for information necessary to advance investigations were not being completed within the timeframe of 30 days agreed in protocols concluded under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  In one case we waited 542 days for a request to be completed and the vast majority were well over the agreed time limits, often by excessive periods.  While some matters were complex, most were routine.  We take some responsibility for this; we were conscious that independent oversight is a new experience for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We had sought to achieve negotiated co-operation and did not always trigger agreed escalation processes immediately.<\/p><p>  There was also another very worrying trend in our interactions with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On many occasions, when requesting information, we were being asked to state why it was relevant to our inquiry.  That one State body, investigating another, should be asked for the relevance of a request before materials pertinent to an investigation are released is a matter of considerable concern.  I doubt that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would readily accept such demands from parties under investigation by it.  No such qualification was ever agreed in the protocols and these types of back and forward communications also added delay to an already unsatisfactory process.  This commission addressed these matters, along with others, robustly and also made sure that overdue requests were correctly escalated. We also made representations at the very highest level of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we did begin to make some headway.<\/p><p>  The current commission had been in place for 18 months and had been wrestling with these issues assertively but quietly over that whole period.  We had hoped, however, that by the time of publishing our 2012 annual report this spring we could have put any comments on these issues in the past tense.  Alas, when that date approached, there were still problems.  In fact, just prior to publication, we were again being asked to justify the relevance of a request for evidence pertinent to a complex investigation.  The commission was of a clear mind that many of the very important issues were unresolved and are still unresolved and as such we decided to make public comment on the issue in our annual report.  This was in an attempt to unblock these fundamental matters and shed light onto what had been happening.  We will, of course, be happy to take questions but I will hand over to my colleague, Commissioner Carmel Foley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Commissioner Simon O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372863600,"counter":1338,"content":"<p>We would like to acknowledge that there has been improvement in some cases in the timeliness of response by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to our requests.

This section allows us to so do when we believe it is appropriate because of the gravity of the matters that have come to our notice.  The Minister has since laid the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We submitted the report because our findings in an investigation conducted in the public interest led us to have serious concerns regarding the implementation and management of informant handling procedures, both historic and current.<\/p><p>  For reasons largely to do with the safety of persons, as outlined in our report, we are not in a position to discuss the details of the particular investigation. However, we make recommendations in our report and would like to refer to some of those for the committee.  Before doing so, we would like to make it clear that we accept that informants are an established part of policing.  However, complex issues arise regarding informants' motivations and the provision of any advantages or credit to them.  That said, we have no issues with the proper use of informants.<\/p><p>  What we found led us to conclude that there were serious deficiencies in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na management procedures regarding informant handling practices.  We found poor record keeping and non-adherence to procedures.  We found deficiencies in the implementation and management of the old system, which was replaced, following strong words from the Morris tribunal, by the current system, known as covert human intelligence sources, CHIS.  What we found led us to believe that not all the deficiencies identified by the Morris tribunal were remedied.  Our concerns are not historical; they relate to the present day.  The deficiencies point to a culture wherein the formal informant handling systems could be bypassed or ignored.  We can have a credible system, but the problem is that if a person chooses to bypass that system and run an informant \"off the books\", so to speak, there may be no way of ever even knowing that is going on.<\/p><p>  The oversight systems in Ireland do not seem to take account of this.  This is not a problem with the CHIS system.  The Honourable Mr. Justice Thomas Smyth, now retired, reports to the Minister regarding the operation of the CHIS system.  His findings have been positive.  We have no reason to question Mr. Justice Smyth's findings, nor do we.  We are saying that the oversight operated by Mr. Justice Smyth is not designed to address the possibility that informants might be run outside of the formal system.  We are unaware of oversight that might monitor this.<\/p><p>  Another major concern relates to the use of informants who may be participating in the criminal activity about which they are providing information, particularly as an individual providing the information could also be charged in regard to the alleged criminal activity.  Absence of formal procedures for the management and use of such informants creates significant risks, as it is not possible, in particular, to place parameters upon the extent to which such individuals may be authorised to participate in criminality.  We recommend that formal procedures be put in place to govern and guide the deployment and management of such informants, the extent to which garda&iacute; should interact with the Director of Public Prosecutions in regard to such informants, including what information garda&iacute; should bring to the DPP's attention and, in light of our findings of poor record-keeping, how such interactions should be recorded and filed.<\/p><p>  We are concerned that the matters we have raised with the committee are having a detrimental impact on effective independent oversight of policing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Commissioner Kieran FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1372864200,"counter":1341,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I respect the work that they are doing, but to say that there could be an improvement in the way they are being treated is an understatement.<\/p><p>  I would like to paraphrase a few things here.  In one case study the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was in possession of the information requested, but refused to supply it.  The refusal took 48 days.  It took 136 days from the request for this information to be provided.  Another case study states that it took 84 days for an information request to be complied with.  Despite writing to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on ten separate occasions requesting updates as to the progress of the investigation, it has yet to be concluded.  If I was being treated with this type of contempt, I would resign.  It is ridiculous to think that one would have to write on ten occasions looking for an answer.

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is about independent and impartial inquiries, yet nobody is answering them.  They are too big for answers.

Deputy Flanagan referred to the culture.  There is no doubt that oversight by a body which is seven years in operation is a huge shock to the system.  Until powers were granted to us under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, no body other than the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was likely to carry out a search under warrant.  The first time we entered a Garda station with a search warrant, there was some shock to the system.  The first time we arrested a garda, there was shock.  We are still at a very early stage.  That does not excuse the delays.  The Deputy's question might implicitly ask why are we not using our powers.

Following on Deputy Healy Rae's question, I would not like it to be thought that we have no outcomes or effects because, for instance, since we opened, over 150 files have gone to the DPP.  In other words, where it seemed to us that there was a case to answer in respect of criminal allegations we have secured 24 convictions in that time, 18 of which related to garda&iacute; and six to civilians.  Where somebody has knowingly given false and misleading information we have the power to send a file to the DPP for a prosecution of someone who is not a garda.  Sometimes the garda&iacute; would say that we entertain a lot of malicious allegations against them but that figure contradicts that assertion.  On occasion the court has decreed the Probation Act rather than the conviction of a garda.  Similarly, the adult caution scheme has been applied in some cases.<\/p><p>  Turning to discipline, the Garda Commissioner, who is the responsible authority for disciplining the Garda force, has applied well over 500 disciplinary sanctions.  Therefore, there has been a positive effect.  Many of our interactions, such as attending Templemore training college where we speak to garda&iacute; of all grades, and the local meetings with senior Garda management, have had a useful outcome and exchange of views with learning on both sides.<\/p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh asked about our powers.  We have proposed some legislative amendments to the Minister which the Department of Justice, Equality and Defence is examining.  For example, we would like to see many minor allegations dealt with not as disciplinary matters but as proper service.  In other words if the garda&iacute; are holding somebody's property that person does not want an individual garda to be brought up on a discipline charge, he or she wants to get the property back.  Our resources and those of the Garda force, not to mention court resources, could be better used on all fronts, rather than engage the whole cumbersome, disciplinary process - a process which existed long before we did, we were grafted on to the existing internal disciplinary process.  This would enable us to deal with, for example, matters of poor service, as distinct from a hanging offence, to ensure, for instance, that the person would get his or her property back or the information they require or whatever minor allegation is involved.  I do not mean to say that it is minor for the person involved but only in the sense that the garda is not being charged with some criminal neglect.  It does come down to consent in that, rather than our having to impose the most draconian weapons or to act in a confrontational manner, we would like to see that just as the garda&iacute; expect members of the public to interact positively and willingly with them, they would answer our questions and provide the information we require by consent.  This would be in the interests of our joint overall objective of a force and a police service in which people have confidence.<\/p><p>  Rather than having to use all of our legal powers we hope that, in the spirit in which the legislation is drafted, there would be an agreement to meet us half way and give an answer.  There are always two sides to every story.  It is only an allegation, let them tell us their stories.  Instead, people come in with their lawyers and repeat \"no comment\".  That is their legal right, if they want to take a very legalistic view.  There is a provision in the Act for informal resolution and unfortunately we find that garda&iacute; are unwilling to engage in that because they seem to think, wrongly, that by engaging we will automatically think that they have done something wrong.  Very often a person simply wants an explanation as to why something was done, why the garda shouted at them in such a manner.  I recall one very simple matter when the garda said, \"I shouted because she would not have heard me over the traffic if I had not roared at her\".  We are proposing an amendment to the legislative scheme - the provision that is there at the moment for informal resolution - because if they engage in informal resolution they could sometimes explain the allegations of what a person perceives as discourtesy, bad manners or bad language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300007#H00400","nonspeaker":"Commissioner Carmel Foley"},{"type":"speech","time":1372865700,"counter":1360,"content":"<p>Is it possible to compare the number of files going to the DPP to international best practice?

It is below average in international terms.

Without repeating ourselves I come back to the point that there is a lacuna in oversight so it is very difficult to examine these practices.  We tend to examine one or two very individual cases.  In terms of an overall approach to informant management the point we are making to this committee is that there is a lacuna in oversight so it is a difficult question to answer.

Following that, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act was passed and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was established.  All sorts of changes have taken place which have been very welcome.<\/p><p>  The most worrying aspect of the report, which was published almost two months ago, was the comment made that the lessons of the Morris tribunal had not been learned in regard to the retention of contemporaneous notes and the informant handling process.  That was the core of the Morris tribunal's concerns.  The report referred to grave concern about that.  A number of events took place in the following weeks, such as the penalty points issue and the issues which arose between the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and Deputy Wallace, who is present.  Those issues dominated the media and possibly overtook the publication of the report.  I am pleased we are discussing the report today because we want to be constructive and probe the issues involved.  The delegation has put recommendations on the table.<\/p><p>  Some two months have passed.  The Opposition has raised the issue with the Minister, Deputy Shatter.  He said he is awaiting the response of the Garda Commissioner and when he has had a chance to go through it, he will pull both sides together.  I want to establish when that will happen.  Is the delegation satisfied it will happen soon?  I am not.  It has taken two months which is far too long for something as serious as the issues raised by the report.<\/p><p>  The delegation confirmed its concerns in regard to people being handled off the books are historic and current.  We need to be very clear because CHIS is in place, as is accountability to a High Court judge.  The issue is people being handled off the books, engaging in criminality and being given a cover to do so while co-operating with the Garda.  These are matters of serious concern.  The delegation cannot be specific, but I would like it to address the general concerns around that.<\/p><p>  Immediately after the delegation published its report, unfortunately, a number of journalists ran stories quoting Garda sources.  There were attempts to discredit its work.  That is why I feel quite annoyed about the fact that two months later, there has been no definitive response from the Minister.  When the committee has completed its deliberations on this matter, we will make recommendations to the Minister on what needs to be learned.  I apologise for being long-winded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300008#J00400","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372866300,"counter":1366,"content":"<p>I will address the first question.  We are very keen for a meeting to take place between the Minister, the Garda Commissioner and our organisation.  In fairness, some might say we took four years to complete our report and perhaps someone in the Phoenix Park needs some time to ingest what it said.  We are not just talking about the management of informants in terms of this meeting which will, it is to be hoped, deal not just with the section 80 special report but the issue of time limits and how we have co-operative engagement between us and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  I return to the point made by Commissioner Foley.  We need accountability by consent.  We need people to come around the table in a spirit of co-operation.  Since the establishment of the new commission, we have spent 18 months having very positive dialogue with colleagues at the most senior level of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While we recognise time limits are a problem, we are also clear that in going public, we wanted to encourage debate.<\/p><p>  If two months have passed and colleagues present from the press take up some of these issues, we do not want to be seen as those in the corner mithering and trying to make headlines.  We want to make headway.  If we have to wait a bit longer for such a meeting to come together and it is productive, informed and everyone around the table is completely on message about what we are trying to achieve, we as a commission will feel we have done a much better job than perhaps we have done in the past. <\/p><p>  While two months may have passed, I am comfortable that the Minister is taking this matter seriously.  He is in a position to be party to the committee and chair it, which we would welcome.  We need to have a debate with members who look after their constituents.  We need to have a proper debate in an open and transparent way.  If we can get that right in the next three and half years of the commission, the committee will find us to be a commission that is willing to engage in a debate, take and receive criticism and, in an appropriate, fair and proportionate way, provide good criticism in order that the people can understand what is going on and understand not just the Garda position but also our position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300008#J00500","nonspeaker":"Commissioner Simon O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372866300,"counter":1367,"content":"<p>I will augment that point.  With regard to informant handling issues raised by the Chairman, it is important for us to make a distinction.  There is a danger that we perceive the discussion and debate to be framed in the context of State security and all informant handing issues pertaining to those very sensitive issues, about which there are real and proper rules and cautions.  We absolutely accept that. <\/p><p>  The points we made do not necessarily relate to issues which touch on those matters.  It is important to make that distinction and that sight of that is not lost in future deliberations of the committee.  One also needs to distinguish between the fact that people provide information on an informant basis, which is sometimes registered in the CHIS system and which is a form of policing.<\/p><p>  If something is off the books, we see no reason that should happen and we can find no justification for such an event to happen.  It is of concern that it is not addressed until the point at which it becomes a problem, which is usually in court, in which case everyone has a mess on their hands.  It is not good for public confidence in the entire system of justice.<\/p><p>  I draw the attention of the committee to the fact that public spirited individuals occasionally provide a piece of information to the Garda.  For example, someone may have seen someone with a set of tools going at the back door of a house.  They are not informants in the normal sense.  Rules need to be written to cover such cases in order that an ordinary garda, who is not involved in informant management at a senior or serious level, knows he she does not have to become bogged down in a bureaucratic rigmarole of paperwork overtaking such pieces of information. <\/p><p>  There is a likelihood that confusion will arise and it is important we distinguish between such cases on paper for garda&iacute; who should be properly trained.

We had a very productive meeting on Monday with some of these people.  We are introducing a Private Members' Bill to improve how the policing system works and with regard to holding it to account.  We asked for a meeting with GSOC.<\/p><p>  I wish to rehearse some of the points discussed at the meeting in order to put them on the public record.  The special report states that things could be better and that the commission could do with a bit more co-operation which would allow the Garda ombudsman to be a more effective force and increase its capacity to hold the police force to account, which is its remit, in my opinion.  I would argue that it is not getting the support it requires to hold the police force to account and which would be to the benefit of the State.<\/p><p>  On the question of admissibility, we are of the opinion that the period of six months should be extended to one year with a right of appeal in respect of GSOC decisions.  We also raised the issue of introducing an independent police board to separate the commission, the force and the Minister for Justice and Equality, in the style of the system in place in Northern Ireland.  We do not recommend an exact copy of that system because there were particular issues at play there which our State would not encounter.  An extension of the period of admissibility from six months to one year would be very helpful.<\/p><p>  In addition to breach of discipline and possible criminal offence, a new code of conduct should be drawn up to include breaches of human rights and service level complaints which would form a third ground of admissibility.  Specific incidents of non-compliance by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could be reported to the new police body.  The commission report states that new protocols are being considered.  That is all well and good but a policy on paper is one thing while making it work is another.  The commission's work is often delayed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na disputing whether information is relevant to an investigation.  It is difficult to credit how the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would see fit to decide on that matter, given that the Garda ombudsman is the body responsible for the investigation.  An independent police board acting as a mediator would allow the Garda ombudsman to report matters on non-compliance.  The issue of non-compliance is not easy to deal with.<\/p><p>  I refer to how complaints are currently handled.  Statistics from the Minister for Justice and Equality show that fewer than 1% of complaints by the public reach the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Half of these complaints are probably deemed inadmissible in the first place.  The public perception is that the Garda ombudsman struggles to hold the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to account and the public complainants are frustrated that their complaints are not resulting in a desired response in many cases.  One third of complaints to the Garda ombudsman are referred on to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na decides there has been no breach and there is no case to answer, no explanation is provided to the complainant.  This is very disappointing.  There needs to be more engagement with the complainant.  Another third of complaints are investigated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under supervision by the Garda ombudsman, while a further third of complaints are dealt with by the Garda ombudsman.  In my view, all complaints should be under some control of the Garda ombudsman.  If the State is serious about the Garda ombudsman being an effective body, extra resources must be provided to deal with the one third of complaints which are not supervised by the Garda ombudsman.  That one third of complaints are deemed to be the most minor offences, but the public perception is that it is unsatisfactory to have these complaints dealt with by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na outside of the control of the Garda ombudsman.  The chances of complainants receiving serious answers about their complaints are difficult at that stage.  Last November the UN rapporteur recommended that GSOC be permitted to initiate its own review of policies and procedures without being requested to do so by the Minister.  I ask for the commission's opinion in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300009#K00100","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1372866900,"counter":1370,"content":"<p>Do the commission members wish to respond to those questions at this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300009#K00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372866900,"counter":1371,"content":"<p>We can deal with some of those questions at this point.  I refer to Deputy Wallace's question about the police board.  That is a matter of policy.  If this Legislature brings legislation forward, we would be happy to work with any arrangement of that nature.  It is not our place to comment on what any future policy may be.  On the question of admissibility, the commission may extend admissibility decisions in certain circumstances.  However, because of our case load, complaints are normally at a very low level - I use that word in the most appropriate way.  These relate to basic service failures.  Obviously, if a more serious matter arises some time later, the commissioners consider a decision independently of each other and come to an adjudicated position as to whether we would admit that complaint.<\/p><p>  I refer to the Deputy's very good points about the Garda code of conduct and the issue of breaches of human rights.  I agree there are some areas on which we, as a commission, will want to focus.  Our five year strategy shows a focus on investigations around the death and serious injury of a person, which will be a real issue.  We are bringing forward training for our staff to ensure the commission is a proper instrument of the State which will properly investigate the death or serious injury of a person.<\/p><p>  The Deputy made some very interesting points about the number of complaints we refer to the Garda and the number we deal with ourselves.  If we can reach the point where we are getting co-operation, it will make us more efficient.  If it means a superintendent is not travelling from one district to another to investigate what is sometimes a very minor issue, if they could be picked up in some form of service issue and not be part of this very bureaucratic discipline process, then we, the commission, would not be sending so much back to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first place.  I wish to be very clear that section 94 of the legislation provides for a clear mechanism for both supervised and unsupervised investigations.  Having been a police officer prior to this life, in my view it is not right for us to take away all the disciplinary functions of a police service of the size of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am certainly very willing to talk in the next two and a half to three years about how much should be done by the commission and how much by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  We recognise the very stringent restrictions on the funding of resources.

As Mr. O'Brien stated, we extend the time in circumstances where we think it appropriate to do so.  Section 106 is certainly dealt with in the UN rapporteur's judgment and it is also contained in the legislative suggestions we have put forward in some reports to the Minister.

The notion that GSOC does not have power to access that system is just outrageous.  I imagine our guests are very much of the same mindset as I am in this regard.  This seems strange because, from the point of view of the public, the idea of garda&iacute; working within the commission does not really add up.  Perhaps our guests do not agree but that is the impression we obtain from many of the complaints we have received in respect of this matter.<\/p><p>  On the question of section 87(4)(b) of the principal Act being amended via the substitution of the phrase \"at any time before or after\" for that of \"at any time after\", this obviously relates to a situation where a case might be brought against a garda who retires before he can answer the charges.  Our guests will state that if such a person is no longer a member of the force, then there is only so much it can do in respect of charging him.  If the matter involved is criminal, I know there are ways of dealing with it.  If the garda in question is accused of causing serious harm of any sort to a complainant, does the commission have the power to hold him to account?<\/p><p>  What are our guests views regarding amending section 87, which relates to the admissibility of complaints, to cater for the inclusion of the Garda Commissioner and thereby making him answerable to GSOC if a complaint is made against him?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300010#L00500","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372867500,"counter":1377,"content":"<p>The Acting Chairman has raised quite a list of issues.  He referred to serious harm and the inclusion of degrading or inhuman treatment in custody in the definition of that.  Again, this derives from human rights, and the human rights provisions to which he referred at the outset would, by definition, almost include this if there were greater clarity around that matter.  The consideration of sexual assault in the context of what constitutes serious harm is a very interesting idea.  The definition is taken from section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act.  It is not our definition but reconsidering it to include sexual assault is an extremely interesting concept.<\/p><p>  In the context of section 87 and retiring garda&iacute;, if I understand the Acting Chairman correctly, I believe he is referring to circumstances where there is an allegation of a breach of discipline against a serving member and where he or she retires, meaning that he or she would no longer be amenable to investigation unless, as he pointed out, there is a crime involved.  This matter presents real issues and difficulties because the discipline regulations largely relate to an employer-employee relationship.  I am not quite sure how it would work if we were in a position to pursue such individuals into retirement.  Other issues might come into play in this regard and we are not sure how what the Acting Chairman refers to might operate in the context of employment law.  There might be an impact in that regard.  I understand the Acting Chairman's concern, namely, that retirement should not be used as a means to evade investigation.  I can see exactly where he is coming from in that regard.<\/p><p>  The Legislature was very clear in its own statement to the effect that the Garda Commissioner is outside the remit of the commission.  Again, it is an interesting idea that the Garda Commissioner would not so be.  However, his or her management role in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and his or her other responsibilities with regard to State security would probably be very pertinent considerations in any discussion on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300010#L00600","nonspeaker":"Commissioner Kieran FitzGerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1372867500,"counter":1378,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting but another vote has been called in the D&aacute;il.

It is unfortunate that this meeting has taken place at a messy time of year where we are in the middle of much ado about nothing in the committee room next door and in terms of many other votes and all the rest of it.<\/p><p>  I am conscious of what Deputy Healy Rae said in terms of why the witnesses are not giving out more.  I am conscious of the fact that the steps they have taken already have put this issue very much centre stage.  In some ways they have been involved in a quiet revolution in putting the message into the public domain that all is not well.  That is hugely important and they would have been negligent if they had not done that.  I appreciate it is very much an usual step for a public body to have to take, which indicates the seriousness of the issue.  I understand why they have done that and I very much compliment them on it.  It is quite a radical step.<\/p><p>  I agree with the witnesses that it is difficult to change culture.  I do not know what has been their experience but I presume nobody would go to the ombudsman commission with a complaint first off.  Presumably it is the case that in respect of the majority of complaints the first step is that the person would go to the local Garda station to try to resolve the problem and it is only when people encounter a problem there and do not perceive that the complaint is being taken seriously or consider there is a cover up that many of this complaints end up at the commission's door.  That is a cultural practice.  The approach taken in a station may be that the complainant is an irritant or a crank, rather than taking on the responsibility to get back to the person about the matter.  <\/p><p>  Part of the problem is probably that the blue wall of silence is still there and that is a systemic problem.  In our experience, and this is linked to the point that was made about the penalty points issue, internal systems to address issues raised by garda&iacute; who have problems with what is happening and in terms of whistleblowing are not in place; a vehicle in not in place for garda&iacute; to do that.  My understanding is that when the complaint in regard to that issue originally landed on the commission's desk, it did not come from the garda concerned but from another quarter; somebody else brought that to the witnesses' attention in October.  Let us just say, somebody else or some other organisation told me that they did that, but I have been curious about whether it was the case that the witnesses thought that because the information was solely based on an internal Garda matter, they decided it was more appropriate elsewhere.  There is a belief that garda&iacute; can do what they like and that investigating themselves is a problem.  <\/p><p>  At a conference held in DCU at which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the GRA were represented, I understand the GRA said that its members would prefer an external investigation rather than what they call a lease-back case where something ends up with the witnesses and is kicked back to them.  I assume what they meant is that there would be no link or no lease-back to the garda&iacute;.  From our experience we have found that people consider the idea of garda&iacute; investigating themselves not to be a good thing.  If the GRA and Garda members also believe that is not in their best interests, that is good thing which we should unleash and push from our point of view, but I wonder what the witnesses would think of that?  <\/p><p>  Why are the levels of criminal conviction so low?  Is it the case that if people have a criminal offence and it is a clear-cut case of criminality, they go to a solicitor and take the matter to court.  It strikes me that the level of conviction rates on foot of complaints and having regard to all the resources is too low.  Have the witnesses any more information on that?  <\/p><p>  Given that the commission is set up to investigate individual complaints, I do not know what sort of data the witnesses keep.  I know they cannot draw trends and that these are individual complaints but do they have access to information that would indicate, say, if there was a high percentage of complaints in Wexford that it related to particular Garda stations or is this a cultural issue throughout the organisation?  Is there a culture that complainants are perceived as being interfering busybodies with whom the garda&iacute; will not co-operate or is it that the issue of concern is that if the conduct of a garda is called into question, it would invoke employment rights issues and disciplinary rights which could have an impact on someone's career and all that big quagmire?  Is it that the procedures that are in place in that sense unleash a system which makes it cumbersome to get the matter sorted out and makes it difficult whereas if the procedures in place were different, it might be a little bit easier?  I know this is a little bit woolly but there is a contradiction, on the one hand, with the witnesses saying that they have all the powers they need and yet, on the other, there is this very big problem.  It is something they only want to contribute to a discussion on and they have usefully done that.  We believe the legislation Deputy Wallace will move later will assist in that process and in moving this forward into the public domain.  I very much accept that it is new territory.  I would like the witnesses to explore the culture a little more and the types of problems there are in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300011#M00400","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372868100,"counter":1395,"content":"<p>I will respond first to the Deputy's first points.  We are very happy to come to this committee or other Oireachtas committees.  We believe that police accountability and oversight is a very important issue for the wider Irish public and others in which to engage.  The Deputy need not worry about the time we have available today or however busy it has been; we are quite happy to come back to the committee.<\/p><p>  In terms of the culture that is in place, and picking up on some of the Deputy's later points, there are two issues involved.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act is both facilitative and obstructive.  The Deputy made the point that many people go to a Garda station to make a complaint.  In terms of the culture that is in place, and I was around many Garda stations in my last job when I was with the inspectorate, many garda&iacute; working at the hatch would say that if a person comes to the station to make a complaint, he or she would hand the person a GSOC 1, which is a form on which one records a complaint.  The garda would do so because the Act provides that as soon as someone complains, a garda must record that matter.  Unfortunately, once a complaint is recorded, it brings us into a whole bureaucratic discipline-run process, whereby as soon as a member is mentioned in a complaint that member must be told about the complaint and then we go through a whole bureaucratic process.  Coming back to our legislative amendments, it would be helpful if we could divide that first interaction whereby the first thing that would happen is that rather than a garda handing out a complaint form out, he or she would have a conversation with the person.  The garda would ask the person exactly what he or she wants to talk to us about.  We find that the vast majority of these issues are about matters such as the person concerned needs his or her car back, or the person's property is in the police station and it has been there too long, or someone was rude to the person the other day and he or she wants us to have a chat with that person.  These are the types of issues we find land on our desk time after time because the form has been completed.  As Commissioner Foley said, disciplinary relations have been there a very long time.  They are complex and, quite rightly, a garda, once a complaint is made against him or her, has all the rights he or she would want for protection under those disciplinary relations and under the Act.  We are up against some long-standing issues in terms of discipline and now in terms of the Act.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act is great in many ways but it is rather pragmatic in the way it was put together and it brings us into that legalise position with which we are stuck in terms of this process.<\/p> <p>If and when legislative amendments come forward from Members of these Houses, and there is a proper and sensible debate about them, I believe that could provide some solutions both for garda&iacute; and the members' constituents who complain about them.<\/p><p> On the whistleblowing issues, we examined that, as Commissioner Foley said earlier in her submission, and made a decision based upon what was before us at that time.  We were faced at that time with a serving Garda member making a complaint, and we were not amenable in that regard.  I would say to the members, and we have made it quite open-ended, that there are many things happening in that particular inquiry at the moment.  We just reserve our position, and I believe that is the place to be.<\/p><p> In terms of criminal convictions in regard to complaints, we never see that as either a positive or negative performance indicator for us as an oversight body.  I would much rather ask whether we are getting satisfaction in terms of confidence from the Irish people in what we are and, thus far, we have found that many people do have some confidence in us as an independent body.  We hope that these sort of engagements, and the fact that we are putting this discussion in the public domain to allow other people to comment on it, would increase the levels of confidence people have in us as an organisation and, by definition, in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in that they are seen to be accountable.  <\/p><p> We are first dealing with what are often quite minor issues of service failure.  Members will note that when we have got serious matters of complaint we have taken those forward, albeit we have reported to the members about delays.  We have had garda&iacute; going to prison, the issue of garda&iacute; being sanctioned by their own Commissioner, and garda&iacute; who have put money in a poor box because they have been found wanting in a court of this land.  However, we do not take any succour from that.  What we, as a commission, look for is whether we are providing a valuable service using our resources to the best of their ability, and gaining the confidence of people who want to come forward and make a complaint to us.<\/p><p> In many ways we will be fighting a battle in relation to a culture.  As I said to the Deputy earlier, in a previous life I was in a police service in another country in which there was no oversight when I first joined in 1978.  I was prouder of the police force I left 32 years later where we had bodies such as police authorities, an independent police oversight body and where we were called to account regarding the way our informants were used.  There was legislation over-arching that entire area.  Frankly, as far as I was concerned, the police force I joined was a closed, white, male dominated force of men and women that was outside the public.  The force I left in London was much more inclusive.  We had greater confidence but in that time we had gone through a great deal of bad blood in terms of being found wanting on a number of occasions.  That is very painful for a police service but it is a very valuable process through which every free democracy must go through.<\/p><p> If we can in some way facilitate open debate on this and other issues and if we can come before this committee or other committees and have a useful discussion with colleagues from the press, and others, when we leave this commission in three and a half or five years time we will be in a much better position.  Bringing this to the committee's light today has been our sole issue.  We do not want headlines; we want headway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300011#M00500","nonspeaker":"Commissioner Simon O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372868700,"counter":1397,"content":"<p>Does any other member want to contribute?

Until now there has been a 12 weeks, three months, period for them to complete the disciplinary investigations.  They have made the case that given the cumbersome nature of the disciplinary regulations that that is too short and that they would prefer it to extend to four months or 16 weeks.  We will agree to operate a 16 weeks interval.  However, many of the outstanding files awaiting reply go back longer than 16 weeks.  We are suspending judgment, therefore, until we see how the 16 week suggestion will operate but many of them are already over the 16 weeks.  That is on the disciplinary side.<\/p><p>  Regarding these blockages and communications coming back stating something is not relevant and we are not being given it, that is still happening.  We are escalating these queries more quickly than we used to previously.  Normally, a senior investigator in our office, when investigating a criminal allegation, has all the powers, privileges, immunities and duties of a garda.  I would have thought it sufficient that if a senior investigator is looking for an item, that ought to be enough.  As the Chairman said earlier, I cannot see garda detectives accepting someone telling them that they cannot have something and that it is not relevant.  However, we have a process of escalation whereby our acting director of investigation goes to a more senior level in the Garda and, if necessary, one of us will go to a very senior level.  We are being more robust in operating that system and keeping a very close eye on it.  That is the current position on the protocols.  As we entered the negotiations in good faith, we would want to give the new system a chance to operate.<\/p><p>  There is another issue regarding the way we are delayed in our work.  When we opened, one of the regular feeds of information to us from the garda&iacute; came through a copy of each Garda directive as it was made.  This is very important because a Garda directive instructs the Garda member on the ground, and the entire Garda force, on what they are and are not entitled to do.  The Garda directive gives them their standards of behaviour.  If an allegation is made against garda&iacute;, we need to know if that is within their powers, within the directive they have been told to operate under or if it is it something outside their directives.  However, we no longer receive the directives automatically.  We are told if we want a directive we have to ask for it.  We asked them how we will know the directives that have been signed by the Garda Commissioner if they do not at least give us the list of directives that come out, say, every month signed by the Commissioner or disseminated throughout the Garda force nationwide, but we have been told we will not get the list.  We are in this Kafkaesque world whereby we are trying to dream up the directives that might have been passed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300012#N00400","nonspeaker":"Commissioner Carmel Foley"},{"type":"speech","time":1372868700,"counter":1400,"content":"<p>When did that change?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300012#N00500","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372868700,"counter":1401,"content":"<p>This year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2013070300012#N00600","nonspeaker":"Commissioner Carmel Foley"},{"type":"speech","time":1372868700,"counter":1402,"content":"<p>We have seen some very interesting Garda directives which came out around the time the whistleblowing garda&iacute; went, as they are lawfully entitled to do, to talk to a Member of the Oireachtas.

Obviously, while we recognise the legislative burden on these Houses and elsewhere is very heavy given the economic times we are in, we would greatly welcome a debate about some of the issues we have put forward regarding legislative amendment.  Clearly, when we took the action of laying before these Houses a report about informant handling under section 80, we took that decision very carefully.  All I would say is we certainly will make sure we can summarise or highlight those issues and recommendations we consider to be highly pertinent to a free, open and democratic society, such as that the methods of covert policing must have oversight.  Methods of covert policing are absolutely vital in the fight against crime and terrorism but some openness and transparency in those areas should be given to a certain group of individuals who can look at those particular issues.  Thereafter, if we, as an oversight body received a complaint from a member of the public, we could go to that group of individuals and ask it to examine the relevant records and that would satisfy us.  That is absent at present and as a professional police officer in a former life, I believe it is really important that the issues we have put forward under section 80 are not lost in the overall debate.  While this would involve a great deal of careful negotiation - I completely understand how that must go forward carefully - not to be lost is that the exchange between us, an oversight body and the body with which we are in most contact, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, generally is about routine requests for information.  In Scotland, a new organisation that is about the same size as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has just been set up, namely, Police Scotland.

It is restricted to domestic dwellings.  It is particular in its focus.  On the question from Deputy Moynihan and Senator Brennan in regard to the farmstead as distinct from the farmhouse, etc., this instrument will apply to the farm house.  The farm is regarded as a place of work.  Paragraph 4.3 of the statutory instrument states: \"...for the purposes of the Act designated electrical works does not include...\".  Those works not included are electrical works on a construction site and so on.  I would have thought that the Health and Safety Authority would cover most of the other areas and that this regulation is particular to the domestic dwelling.<\/p><p>  The domestic dwelling is defined as somewhat extended beyond the domestic residence in the sense that if there is a business in the home that does not have resort to electricity, more than the normal usage in the home and so on, such as, for example, a surgery or consulting room, that is covered.  Anything that requires industrial scale electricity would not come under the aegis of this particular regulation. <\/p><p>  On who provides certification, the onus is on the owner of the domestic dwelling to get a certificate from RECI stating that he or she has complied and so on.  As Deputy Ellis will be aware, there is an internal system within the trade association to ensure its members are up to standard.  It carries out occasional audits and so on to ensure they are up to standard.  On penalties, these include, on indictment, a fine not exceeding &euro;15,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years, or both.  On summary conviction, the fine cannot exceed &euro;5,000.  It seems to me well judged.  As stated by Deputy Maloney, even if there is some expense attached to engaging a reputable contractor as distinct from a cowboy operator, in the interests of domestic safety and so on it is worth it.<\/p><p>  The regulation is not retrospective.

Our role is to encourage overseas leisure and business tourists to choose the island of Ireland for their trip rather than travelling to any of over 200 destinations competing for attention.  Tourism is one of Ireland's largest indigenous industries, generating revenues of over &euro;5 billion, which is approximately 4% of our gross national product.  Overseas tourism accounts for almost 60% of this revenue.<\/p><p>  The year, 2012, was positive for overseas tourism and despite the continuing economic challenges in many of our key markets, we welcomed approximately 7.3 million overseas visitors, which was an increase of 5% on the previous year and 6% in the revenue generated within the sector.  The overall sentiment for travel to the island of Ireland this year is largely positive and a very encouraging early start to the season.  The most recent Central Statistics Office figures for overseas travel to the Republic of Ireland indicate growth of more than 6% up to the end of May, with growth recorded from all the major market areas.  Considering a more detailed analysis of overseas tourism performance for the first quarter of the year, there is very good growth in holidaymakers, whose numbers were up by nearly 20%, and in overseas tourism revenue, which is up by approximately 12%.  However, it is important to point out that not all tourism businesses across the island have been sharing equally in this return to growth.<\/p><p>  Certain overseas markets are performing particularly well now, with Australia and other long-haul markets, including India and China, looking set for another record year in 2013.  North America is on course to deliver its strongest performance ever, with over 1 million visitors expected from the United States this year.  We expect these visitors will spend approximately $1 billion while on the island of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300006#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Nash","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372842300,"counter":1447,"content":"<p>The Gathering Ireland 2013 has been a major focus for Tourism Ireland over the past 18 months.  Tourism Ireland has responsibility for the overseas marketing of this initiative.  Our objectives are threefold in order to meet our target of 325,000 incremental visitors and &euro;180 million in incremental revenue.<\/p><p>  The first objective is to develop a meaningful engagement with the Irish diaspora overseas while encouraging it to organise their gatherings in Ireland.  This translated into Tourism Ireland's overseas partnership programme where we reached out to diaspora networks, Irish associations, embassies and Irish federations.  To date, this has resulted in over 500 Gatherings which have been pledged and which will bring in approximately 20,000 incremental visitors.  The next objective is to reach out to the tens of millions in the Irish diaspora overseas with a specific invitation to invite them home in 2013.  Working closely with The Gathering Ireland, Tourism Ireland has promoted those Gatherings in Ireland with the greatest potential to attract incremental overseas visitors.  This has resulted in over 85 Facebook campaigns in the year to date micro-targeting specific passion points from Harley Davidsons and GAA to comedy festivals and literature.  To date, we have created an overseas database for these festivals and Gatherings of 170,00 overseas people who are interested in these festivals.  This is a database that they can target next year and in years to come.  The final objective is to create a sense of urgency for all potential visitors to come and visit Ireland in 2013.  <\/p><p>  To ensure we deliver on all of these objectives and achieve the growth we set out, it was imperative to work closely with the associations and networks available to us.  The Institute of Directors in Great Britain provides access to 30,000 Irish people who sit on the boards of British companies.  The Federation of Irish Societies, the Lansdowne Club, chambers of commerce, the Ireland Funds and Irish embassies are just a few examples of invaluable networks we continue to work with throughout the year.  <\/p><p>  From a business tourism perspective, Tourism Ireland has achieved a number of successes including the Spar International conference, which took place in Dublin and Killarney bringing 280 incremental overseas visitors, which brought in an incremental revenue of &euro;820,000.  Alltech, with its impressive 3,000 delegates, will be worth over &euro;3 million to the Irish economy and Fujitsu, with 300 delegates, was won in Great Britain by working with an Irish enabler, Mary McNally.  The Aer Lingus-Etihad hurling Gathering taking place in Galway is another great example of a new event that was created this year to target the overseas diaspora.  The Manchester Irish Festival will bring 1,000 incremental visitors to Mayo in August.  <\/p><p>  Tourism Ireland worked very closely with our airline partners and Dublin Airport Authority in the early days as we recognised the importance of having the access in place to support the impending increase in demand.  We used The Gathering as an additional hook to ensure that Ireland stood out among fierce international competition and developed business cases to support airlines investing in incremental capacity to Ireland for 2013.  The result has been rewarding and we are delighted to see an increase in capacity from North America of 27%.  This translates into 4,000 additional seats from North America to Ireland per week during the peak season.  The Gathering has certainly contributed to this success.<\/p><p>  The four core Gathering markets are the US, Great Britain, Canada and Australia.  Early indications are that our efforts are succeeding and forward bookings from tour operators and airline carriers look very positive.  In non-core markets such as France and Germany, our message is that The Gathering is an invitation to the world to celebrate the best of Irish food, history, culture, sports, fun and lots more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Monica MacLaverty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372842900,"counter":1449,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Monica MacLaverty.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Aidan Pender, who is the director of strategic development within F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  I am here in my capacity as chief executive and as chairman of The Gathering.<\/p><p>  With the permission of the Chair, I would like to read extracts from my opening statement summarising our perspective on the current performance of tourism and setting out some of the key initiatives we are progressing to support continued growth.  If I were to sum our mission in one word, it would be \"growth\".  Growth has a particular relevance within our current strategic framework.  As we see it, our role is to guide and support the sustainable tourism growth across the country.  We are concerned with two issues primarily in growth.  The first is employment growth, given the labour intensive nature of this industry which employs 180,000 people.  We believe it has a significant role to play in jobs growth nationally, while the second is revenue growth.  In this we want to emphasise overseas revenue growth for two reasons.  Domestic demand is flat and will remain so for a couple of years and we need foreign earnings as it contributes significantly to the drive for an export-led recovery.  <\/p><p>  In terms of how is tourism faring,  Mr. Peter Nash has given much of the detail and the statistics.  From my perspective, standing back, I believe we are going through a time of transition and challenge in tourism and we are on the verge of entering a new phase for the sector.  Members will be aware from the CSO figures earlier in the week that visitor numbers are increasing from virtually all markets.  That is good news, coming as it does after four very difficult seasons.  During that period the industry experienced a significant drop in market demand along with pressure to cut prices while costs were remaining high.  In the past four years the objective of every tourism business was simply to survive.  I am happy to tell the committee that they did survive in large numbers.<\/p><p>  However, crucially, I emphasise that this current season marks something of a transition to a new phase.  We are seeing a shift from that survival phase characterised by price-cutting and a \"hold on tight\"  mentality towards a recovery in growth phase, characterised by a renewed confidence in the industry that with the right business model and sales strategy they can grow again.  This is a very positive development but it is not without its challenges.  <\/p><p>  Key overseas markets such as the United States, France and Germany and others are recovering and the performance, so far this year, is very encouraging.  However, the Irish market and British markets, our two largest tourism markets, are certainly not growing because of adverse economic circumstances in each.  If these circumstances persist, the industry will face a number of challenges.  In the first instance, there is the need to reduce its exposure to the home market.  That must be clear to every tourism business.  If we are looking for growth it will not be found at home; it will be overseas and it may not be in Britain but further afield.   For many businesses this means either making the transition to actively selling overseas, or at least increasing their understanding and awareness of such markets.  At a minimum this will require firms to develop a better understanding of those market segments where the consumer wants best fit with what their business has to offer, and also a better understanding of the various routes to markets, recognising that the online world, the Internet and social media, will play a much bigger role in this business in future.  Tourism firms will have to grapple with that and, hopefully, overcome it.  In practice, this means that firms need a more sophisticated understanding of how to access customers in places such as Germany and France and the channels through which they can be accessed.  For example, it could be traditional media, advertising, tour operators, online travel or through social media and how to engage with them.  <\/p><p>  What does that mean for businesses?  For some firms it means placing much greater emphasis on continental European markets such as France and Germany where the medium term prospects are probably better than in Britain.  For example, this type of recalibration could prompt a turnaround in the tourism fortunes of many businesses west of the Shannon, which are operating with a product which we know appeals to French and German visitors.  For far too long the west has probably been too dependent on the domestic trade.  Therefore, there is an opportunity here for that part of the country.<\/p><p>  In recognition of emerging opportunities in particular markets, we have been particularly active across a number of fronts to ensure that businesses are well placed to exploit any recovery in key markets.  We believe that Ireland&rsquo;s comparative advantage in tourism can be found in three areas &ndash; our natural heritage, our built heritage and our cultural heritage.  All of us who work in tourism need to focus laser-like on the opportunities these areas represent.  This involves recognising that visitors come to Ireland to see and do those things which add up to a memorable experience.  What does this mean?  Nobody will come to Ireland just to sleep in a bed or to eat a meal or buy a beer.  Thankfully, when they come here they do that, but what persuades them to come is a prior conviction that Ireland provides a leisure break which is unique and authentic.  In other words, they must believe that there are things they can see and do in Ireland, which can only be experienced in Ireland, and tourism businesses must make sure that expectation is realised.  <\/p><p>  This is Ireland's greatest asset and it goes back to the three legs of the stool &ndash; natural heritage, built heritage and cultural heritage.  If we become more adept at how we sell these experiences, then the consumer will realise that they can only have these experiences in Ireland &ndash; because they are unique.  In this sense, Irish tourism is a truly indigenous industry, which by definition, means it cannot be &ldquo;off-shored&rdquo; to some other part of the world.<\/p><p>  We rightly enjoy an international reputation for the quality of our hospitality sector &ndash; our hotels, restaurants and bars. We are good at that because it is in our DNA, but this next phase of growth will only be realised if we can develop this other strand in our DNA which dials up our ability to engage with the visitor in a range of things to see and do.  In essence, we are in the entertainment business - this is at the heart of Irish tourism.  Our next phase of growth therefore will require us to strengthen this entertainment strand and combine it with our existing strengths in hospitality.  This is an emerging area of focus as we work to support businesses, which is a new departure.  In the past three or four years our work has been around cutting costs, working with banks and getting value for money right.  According to independent research, our value for money ratings, as judged by visitors, is at its highest level in more than a decade.  We have regained our competitive position and, therefore, we are in good shape.<\/p><p>  The degree to which we are collectively successful in growing overseas sales will depend on a variety of factors and not least the quality and range of experiences we have to offer. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shaun Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372843500,"counter":1452,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, to address it.  I am the chief executive of the IHF and I am joined by Mr. Michael Vaughan, our president.  The Irish Hotels Federation, founded in 1937, is the national organisation of the hotel and guesthouse industry in Ireland and is a key stakeholder in Irish tourism.  Tourism is Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry and provides an estimated 196,000 jobs, equivalent to 11% of total employment in the country.  With more than 50,000 people directly employed by hotels and guesthouses in Ireland, the hotel sector has a critical role to play in job creation and the recovery of the wider economy.  We welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, that a tourism policy review will commence later in the year.  We recommend that this be integrated with national aviation policy in terms of greater air connectivity, and policies affecting our national food brand.<\/p><p>  The federation identifies the following key challenges facing Irish tourism: effective tourism product development and the marketing of Ireland abroad; the restoration of financial sustainability to the Irish hotel sector; greater cost competitiveness within the economy; and the restoration of vocational and craft training structures to the sector.  The Irish Hotels Federation collaborates with both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in the areas of product development, marketing, quality and standards, training, and registration and classification.  The federation believes it is vital to maintain the real level of funding for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s marketing budgets, including a specific budget for special events such as last year&rsquo;s Emerald Isle Classic, which was an enormous success.  It is also important that the Government maintains the tourism capital expenditure programme and continues to support F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to develop new experiential products such as the Wild Atlantic Way, Waterford&rsquo;s Viking Triangle and the Great Western Greenway in County Mayo.<\/p><p>  While tourism business levels have increased in some urban areas since the beginning of 2012, performance has been poor for hotels and guesthouses in many parts of the country, resulting in a two-tier recovery in the market.  Specific long-term marketing measures are required therefore to address this imbalance.  In particular, we would like to see a review of the regional tourism structures with a view to improving engagement between the various stakeholders and promoting better co-ordination and leverage in the development of new experiential products while ensuring maximum efficiency in use of resources.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the requirement to achieve stronger recovery in the Great Britain market, we support Tourism Ireland in its strategy to target mainland Europe as an increasingly important market for tourism that delivers more holidaymakers and revenue than Great Britain.  We also support Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to pursue improved combined UK and Ireland visa access, which has the potential to deliver additional growth from emerging tourism markets such as India and China.<\/p><p>  The onset of the debt crisis in Ireland saw a dramatic deterioration in profitability within the hotel sector.  A large number of hotels have gone into receivership or come under bank control.  It is the federation&rsquo;s policy to reverse this trend and to restore ownership to those who have a long-term interest in the industry.  With that in mind, last year the federation commissioned an independent report to identify and evaluate proposals to restore financial sustainability to the industry by attracting new equity investment.  The report was carried out by the economist, Dr. Alan Ahearne, of NUI Galway and it explored how debt restructuring could allow hotels to operate on a long-term sustainable basis.  The federation subsequently hosted an investment conference in October 2012 to promote investment in our sector, and this was attended by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.  The IHF made various submissions to Government, and the employment and investment incentive scheme was extended in the Finance Act 2013 to include registered hotels, guesthouses and other tourism traffic undertakings.  We are in the process of rolling out workshops throughout the country to promote the scheme as part of our debt restructuring agenda.<\/p><p>  The federation maintains that initiatives currently being explored to increase the availability of equity capital to the hotel sector will help put viable and otherwise viable hotels on a more stable footing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Fenn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1372844100,"counter":1454,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fenn and all the witnesses for the three enlightening presentations.  As members and as individual citizens, we all have been watching The Gathering and the issues pertaining to tourism and what the joint committee has heard this morning can be summed up in the word \"growth\", which is important to the tourism sector and to the economy.  Members also have just heard from the Irish Hotels Federation regarding the difficulties that still persist for hotels, which are key members of this drive for growth.  Before turning to the members, I note the figures suggest that 4,175 events have been organised for The Gathering but on a lighter note, I welcome that our friends in the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, in London have enabled the addition of one more such event, scheduled for 21 July.  I hope the runways at Ireland West Airport Knock will be crowded out for that event.<\/p><p>  On a more serious note, however, I wish to pick up on a number of points.  A couple of the presentations mentioned overall growth in more difficult times and less growth in the British market.  In his presentation, I believe Mr. Nash mentioned that mainland Europe is an increasingly important market for the tourism industry and has now overtaken Britain, whereas for F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Irish and British markets are still the largest markets.  I seek clarification in this regard.  My other question pertains to the observation that the recovery is uneven throughout the country, as the increases are taking place in Dublin and a number of cities.  From a Dublin perspective, I note it is harder to get a hotel room now than was the case a couple of years ago.  While that is anecdotal evidence, I also am aware of evidence suggesting the increases are not spreading as much to the rural areas in particular.  Perhaps all three delegations might articulate something in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300010#J00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372844100,"counter":1455,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman.  While my colleagues can add to my comments, when I stated the Irish and British markets were the largest, I was trying to put it into context in that although they are indeed the largest markets, they are not growing at all.  This accentuates the challenge for the trade as to make up for the downturn at home and in Britain, quite a lot of work must be done in some of the other markets.  However, as Mr. Peter Nash has indicated, and he will elaborate in respect of Tourism Ireland's strategy in Britain, there are opportunities within the British market.  However, while the extent to which we can get back to the position that obtained previously remains an open question, some opportunities certainly exist there.  The Vice Chairman is quite right that tourism is experiencing a multi-speed recovery to the extent that some parts of the country are way out in front.  Dublin is out in the lead, driven largely by conferences, festivals and events rather than by leisure.  It is followed by the other larger urban centres such as Galway, Kilkenny, Cork and Killarney and the third phase pertains to the more rurally-based operations, some of which may not be experiencing any recovery because they are heavily reliant on a domestic market that is not growing at present or perhaps they have not had the opportunity to tap into some of the international business.  Consequently, the Vice Chairman is quite right; it is very hazardous to generalise at present because not everyone is experiencing the rising tide.  However, our hope is this will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shaun Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372844100,"counter":1456,"content":"<p>If I may clarify the point regarding Britain versus Europe and their significance, Tourism Ireland's primary focus is on the attraction of the holidaymaker rather than visitors in total.  My reference was to the fact that over time, as our numbers of holidaymakers from Britain has been increasingly challenged, the growing numbers from Europe visiting Ireland as a holiday destination means that for this holiday audience, Europe is overtaking Britain as a source of holidaymakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Nash","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372844700,"counter":1458,"content":"<p>To tackle the issues in terms of the breadth of recovery, what we are seeing, and Mr. Quinn is correct, is that where we have cities that have business and conference facilities and venues such as The O2 and other venues such as in Dublin and similarly in Cork, one is getting a mix of business, but where one is talking about pure tourism business on the west coast, such as the area you represent, Vice Chairman, it is a more challenging position.  In one way the rural isolation we had when it was not that easy to get to those places was a big benefit in one sense.  The new national roads structure means the cities can be a base for a holiday where people can go and visit the attractions along the west coast and get back in the same day.  That is a challenge.<\/p><p>  I am delighted with the reference to Knock Airport because aviation is a key to this given that 90% of tourists come in by air.  Until we tackle the ability to bring mass tourism from central Europe to airports such as Knock, Shannon and Cork, we are going to be in difficulty because our main markets want to come to the west but there is a difficulty in aviation these days in the risk of bringing new services.  That was evident in Knock in terms of what needed to be done to bring in a service such as Lufthansa.  Aviation policy goes to the heart of the issue.  We must find a way to tie down the ability to bring in new air services with the needs of the airlines in order to have a guarantee on the services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Vaughan"},{"type":"speech","time":1372844700,"counter":1459,"content":"<p>Accessibility is the key.

It is helpful for us that the witnesses attend regularly to update us on their activities.  I do not see it as our duty to take the witnesses to task on their work.  They all have boards of directors who have that role.  Our role is one of support.  I would be interested to hear what more we could do from a regulatory or legislative point of view to assist the witnesses in the marketing of this country overseas.<\/p><p>  I echo the sentiments of the Vice Chairman on the distribution of tourists.  It is clear to all of us that the main centre, in particular on the east coast, is developing more quickly.  That goes back to what Mr. Nash has said about the holidaymaker versus the visitor.  The east coast benefits from visitors more so than the rest of the country.<\/p><p>  We published a report yesterday on the sponsorship and advertising of sports by the drinks industry.  Do the witnesses have any views in that regard?<\/p><p>  In terms of dealing with the structures around encouraging visitors and holidaymakers to travel to the regions, could the witnesses elaborate on the marketing structures and the structures of F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the regions?  Could anything more be done to harness more activity into the regions, promote them and encourage more tourism?<\/p><p>  Could F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland comment on what Mr. Vaughan and Mr. Fenn said about air access and port access?  I was struck by what both witnesses from the Irish Hotels Federation said about the importance of opening up to new markets.  They indicated the difficulties in the UK and the opportunities in Europe.  As the witnesses are aware, there has been much contact between Ireland and China and it is seen as an emerging market.  That is not to suggest that all resources should be directed towards marketing in China and to ignore the other markets.  Is there a strategic plan focused on the Chinese market and if so, how then would the Government support the agencies in terms of bringing together air transport and air access points?  The points raised by the Irish Hotels Federation are valid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300011#K00500","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372844700,"counter":1462,"content":"<p>I will take the questions.  In terms of sponsorship by drinks companies, the federation&rsquo;s view is that drink sponsorship by and large has been a huge benefit to the tourism industry in terms of the sporting events it has sponsored.  We see that in the communities in which the sponsorship has been available.  We support the view taken by the committee yesterday.  Other issues are stronger and more pertinent in terms of the overall argument about drink, for example below-cost selling of alcohol.  In our industry the difficulty we have in many cases due to below-cost selling of alcohol is that we have been unable to control the consumption of alcohol in some hotels because people bring alcohol into the premises and drink privately in their rooms and even bring it into public functions.  It is becoming a widespread difficulty for us.  That is something that must be tackled before alcohol sponsorship of sport.<\/p><p>  The difficulty in terms of sport is that if the alcohol companies were not available to sponsor international events in particular, there is no other State authority that would step in to do it although we have seen that when sponsorship of the Irish Open ceased, the State, through F&aacute;ilte Ireland, sponsored the event.<\/p><p>  The difficulty with regional tourism is the dissipation of spend.  County councils have a tourism function.  Leader funds are also involved.  In addition, there was the old regional tourism structure.  There has not been a confluence of all those elements.  The difficulty we have is that the co-ordination of money is critical.  Many great activities are happening but there is much duplication in the area as well.  Following on from one of the points we made earlier in the presentation, we would like to see some form of new regional tourism structures that bring together the elements of county councils and Leader programmes and co-ordinate the spend.  We are too small an island to go off in many different directions.  There is great opportunity to harness all the efforts.  One of the things about The Gathering is that it has socially activated communities that were never involved in tourism previously and now they are, and this is an opportunity for us to bring together a structure in order that we can go forward and create even better growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300011#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Vaughan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372844700,"counter":1463,"content":"<p>I wish to make one or two points.

Mr. Vaughan correctly referred to the Irish Open last weekend, but equally we could point to several other events.  Those events add colour to the tourism product.

We should work together to achieve greater liberalisation of and new approaches to visas in respect of areas from which more people will come to Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300012#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Nash"},{"type":"speech","time":1372845300,"counter":1469,"content":"<p>Has any analysis been done of product demand?

Last year, in particular, a considerable amount of detailed work was done on understanding consumer wants and needs in the United Kingdom.  This work is being extended into Germany and France and, to some extent, the United States.  What has been apparent in the past 12 months to two years is that we need to obtain better and deeper insights into consumer behaviour in our source markets than have been available in previous years.  We are actively pursuing this and have obtained a better sense of what consumers are looking for, which enables us to segment them into different groups.<\/p><p>  There has been a great deal of reflection on whether the Irish tourism product is getting tired, as Deputy Dooley noted, in terms of lakes, mountains and natural heritage.  The other way to view this issue is to decide we are where we are, as it were, and these are our lakes, mountains, coastline, culture, language and folklore.  These elements make up our heritage.  Consumers are not tiring of this and there is nothing inherently jaded about the set of Irish tourism assets.  We need to increasingly switch on to the fact that as lifestyles and consumer behaviours and interests change, we need to change the way in which visitors engage with these assets.  Although there is not a fundamental problem or flaw with the tourism asset base, the nature of engagement is shifting enormously.  The trick is to be very clever about how we allow or facilitate visitors to engage with our tourism assets.<\/p><p>  To give a simple example, if one imagines how the Ring of Kerry, a globally known tourism product, was encountered by visitors in the 1960s and 1970s, people basically travelled around on a bus and looked out of the window.  Visitors, irrespective of their age, are more active, energetic and better informed and want to engage with Ireland rather than observing it from a bus.  There are issues about allowing tourists to slow down, take their time, learn a little and immerse themselves in our tourism assets.  The asset base is in good shape.  The challenge is to work to facilitate visitors to engage with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300012#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Pender"},{"type":"speech","time":1372845300,"counter":1471,"content":"<p>As a division is under way in the D&aacute;il Chamber, we will suspend briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300012#L00600","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1372845900,"counter":1473,"content":"<p>We are resumed in public session.

I thank Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Irish Hotels Federation for their presentations to the committee.  It is a good news story that the 2013 figures to date are positive, but it is a tale of two countries in terms of tourism in many ways.  If I could be a little parochial, I live in west Cork and that part of the country is not seeing the bounce that is reflected in the figures the witnesses have put forward today, welcome as they are.   The witnesses are flying the green flag and that is as it should be.  Many of our communities who have engaged with The Gathering or who have seen for the first time the benefits of tourism do not, in an economic context, have the same options that are available to those in urban areas.  We cannot attract Enterprise Ireland or IDA investment into those areas.  For many of those communities, the only lifeline they can see to maintain economic activity is tourism or tourism-based products.  There is great frustration in this respect among small communities who do not have a built heritage but have the natural and cultural heritage on which the witnesses have put such emphasis and they do not see the same return.  It is not the job of the witnesses' organisations to build hotels or infrastructure but we have access issues.  That is a big problem along the western seaboard.  The witnesses can talk about the Wild Atlantic Way from Donegal down to the south west but if they market it to countries it will be difficult for tourists to access it.  Our national roads infrastructure has torpedoed the Cork-Dublin scheduled flights.  An interesting initiative was undertaken in west Cork some years back when the people there tried to build the Cork-Swansea ferry from scratch through community initiatives but, regrettably, that project fell flat.  Many people lost a good deal of money on it and it is indicative of the frustration that has been felt.  We recognise we have a product but we are missing the link of getting the market to the product or building on that.  How seriously are the witnesses' organisations taking on board the issue of spreading the product beyond west of the Shannon, to borrow a phrase that was used by one of the witnesses?<\/p><p>  The second big issue is that of seasonality.  The witnesses' organisations will not get the investment they require to get the infrastructure in place in areas along the western seaboard where there is only an eight-week to a ten-week season.  There is no reason the marine leisure sector could not be a 12-month product but that is not happening for some reason.  Similarly, activity-based products could fill the gap but that does not seem to be happening.  A small effort would make a massive difference to places like west Cork and Donegal where the impact would be as significant as the impact of visitor numbers to Temple Bar, Dublin, Cork, Kilkenny and Waterford.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on how those challenges could be addressed.  Those rural areas are equally entitled to get a little of the bounce and share in the welcome news the witnesses have portrayed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300013#P00500","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372845900,"counter":1478,"content":"<p>From the The Gathering perspective and to address the question on the regionality and seasonality of tourism, if we take ourselves back 12 months when we realised that access from the US was down 25% from 2007, when figures were at their peak, we realised we needed to do something to achieve our ambitious targets for The Gathering.  That was at a time when we had no events lined up for The Gathering.  There was no calendar of events for The Gathering throughout the year.  We were working with the Dublin Airport Authority and with the airlines to build a robust business case to present the opportunity to them that we were increasing business for Ireland and that there would be increased demand.  The positives they took from it was that The Gathering would - it is delivering on this - extend the season.  It is sustaining the tourism proposition during the shoulder season.  That was what was interesting for the airlines rather than having two or three headline events during the peak season.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300013#P00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Monica MacLaverty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372846500,"counter":1480,"content":"<p>The point made by Deputy Harrington is a fundamental one in the tourism debate.  It is one in which all of us need to engage more in an effort to move things along.  In this regard, we, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, talk about spatial distribution of the economic gains of tourism.  Tourism as an industry generates economic gains in Ireland, particularly when it is overseas money because as everyone will know it expands the Irish economy.  The question is to what extent can we stimulate the spatial distribution of those gains so it does not remain in only the urban centres.  <\/p><p>  As stated by Ms MacLaverty, we know from research and so on that there is a shortening of stay.  People are taking shorter breaks, which is not as much about lifestyles around Europe and North America from where many of our visitors come, but about lifestyles here with people no longer having the same luxury of time as they previously had.  As such, they are taking shorter breaks of four, five or six nights.  We need to give people alternatives.  If not prompted to do otherwise, most consumers will, because they have only a four or five day break, go to Dublin, Galway or Cork city.  The challenge always is to ensure people minded to take an urban break are made aware that access in Ireland is so good that even if they arrive at Cork or Dublin city they can be in the west coast in two or three hours, depending on where they want to go.  That is now a possibility.  As such, a five-night stay would not be compromised by the journey there and back.  We are trying to promote this idea through the Wild Atlantic Way, which ensures the west coast of Ireland becomes a compelling, attractive place.  We need to do something of this type of begin the spatial distribution.  If we think only about local areas we will not rival places like Dublin, Cork, Waterford city and so on.  <\/p><p>  The Wild Atlantic Way is an attempt to raise things up a level and ensure the west coast of Ireland is seen, in particular by people from Germany, Holland and so on, as something special.  If we can get that message out and get people here the Deputy's question of how we motivate them once in Ireland to go to the west coast, to participate, see and do, then arises.  It is the see and do that then becomes important.  For example, we have invested approximately &euro;2 million in Mizen Bridge and a further &euro;2 million in Garnish Island, which are great tourism assets which are fresh and need to be re-imagined in terms of how visitors engage with them.<\/p><p>  Another important area is that of marine tourism.  West Cork is a prime location for marine tourism.  There is a new debate in support of the spatial distribution.  In the past, when people thought about marine tourism, sailing and marinas came to mind.  We have undertaken a great deal of research in regard to consumers and marine tourism.  What we found is that most visitors and consumers come to the sea from the land.  They do not sail to the shore but are on land and travel to the coast to go surfing, kayaking, snorkelling and engage in other marine activities.  If we are to get people into the Wild Atlantic Way and motivate them to get out of the cities for their five days, critical to this will be alerting them to what they can do there that is unique.  We need to try to build not only a stay in a particular place, but an experience of a place where people can immerse themselves in that place, learn to snorkel or kayak and stay in a hotel, go out for an evening, have a few drinks and listen to some Irish music.  A whole range of things add up to an experience.  One thing on its own will not work.  That is the potential for West Cork.  It can pull all of these elements together, namely, accommodation, food, entertainment and natural heritage and the ocean.  The trick is to get all of these things into one package so that the consumer when in west Cork rather than choosing to stay in the city will opt for the package which will keep him or her busy for five days and so on.  That is where we have to get to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300014#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Pender"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372846500,"counter":1481,"content":"<p>I, too, would like to contribute to that question.  Coming from west Clare, I have a deep understanding of the issue highlighted by Deputy Harrington.  On the Deputy's question of how the State can help, we are very weak on regional tourism statistics.  The national statistics provided last week cannot be readily translated into performance in the regions.  The metrics we have used down through the years for performance in the regions have not been as robust as we require them to be.  In fairness, the Central Statistics Office has made huge leaps in terms of bringing its data up to date nationally.  While regional data collection has never been part of its remit, it could become so.  <\/p><p>  There is a statistic widely used internationally entitled the &quot;tourism satellite account&quot;.  It provides one with the information nationally.  Tourism does not appear in the national accounts.  As such, we would not be widely <i>au fait<\/i> nationally with what tourism contributes to the economy.  A national account could be created.  For example, Denmark undertakes a tourism satellite account every five years.  That is a modest ask and is something which we as a federation are calling for.  This would mean that county councils and local communities such as Deputy Harrington's could then put in place a plan based on real figures.  This should be considered nationally.  What does not get measured does not get managed.

I think it is safe to conclude at this point that The Gathering has been successful.  I hope there will be a follow on from it.<\/p><p>  While I do not mean to be critical, it seems to me that during the Celtic tiger years we all took our foot off the pedal in terms of tourism.  I am interested in the urban-rural divide.

I live in Graiguenamanagh, which is a place of natural beauty.  I am always amazed at the low cost facilities available there.

Some of the points I had intended to raise have been covered so I will deal with the ones that have not yet been raised.<\/p><p>  The Gathering has been very positive.  It has been rolled out in many communities around the country. In fact, almost every community has taken part in it.  However, Ireland has a very low rate of tourists and visitors returning to this country.  Will The Gathering impact on this in a positive way and what steps are being taken to ensure people who come here for The Gathering will return at a future date?  There is a big commemoration next year of the Battle of Clontarf as it will be 1,000 years since it took place.  What is being done to market this and to target the Scandinavian countries in particular?<\/p><p>  What is the average duration of visits to Ireland?  Does it compare positively or negatively with the rate in other European countries?  Has there been any effort to use the Irish language as a tool to draw people to Ireland in terms of language tourism and visits to the Gaeltacht?  I believe this is a substantial tool but we have not fully harnessed the potential of language tourism.<\/p><p>  The presentation from Tourism Ireland outlined some very positive aspects of the Irish tourism industry over the past 12 months, but the British market remains sluggish.  Following the visit of Queen Elizabeth last year we were led to believe that the number of tourists from Britain would increase hugely this year.  Will the witness comment on that?  Derry is the City of Culture this year and obviously that is a significant event for the north west and Derry city in particular.  Has Tourism Ireland discerned much of a benefit in the region in respect of the number of tourists attracted in the past 12 months?<\/p><p>  Clearly, there is an overlap between Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  How do they avoid duplication in carrying out their duties?<\/p><p>  Finally, I wish to comment on the JLC system.  Without the JLC system unscrupulous employers could reduce pay to the bare minimum legal limits in the current climate.  The wage rates for JLC workers are quite low, for example, the top rate of pay for a worker covered by the retail JLC prior to it being struck down was &euro;9.66 per hour.  A worker at the top JLC retail rate working a 35 hour week would earn just &euro;17,500 per year.  Despite the legally binding nature of the JLC or registered employment agreements, REA, there are employers who did not comply with them.  According to the National Employment Rights Authority 2009 report more than 70% of employers in three of the largest sectors under these agreements were in breach of their statutory obligations.<\/p><p>  Nonetheless, employers' organisations are intent on driving down the wages in this sector to even lower levels.  They are seeking the abolition of the REAs and JLCs.  They argue that the wage rates are too high, are negatively impacting on our competitiveness and holding back job growth.  They also argue that many businesses are struggling to meet wage bills and should have an inability to pay clause.  Many employers do not pay JLC or REA rates, which are not particularly high in any case.  Employers have argued that the minimum wage and the JLC and REA rates are high by European standards, but this is simply not true.  By comparison with England and when adjusted for purchasing power, the English rate is higher at &euro;7.28 compared with the Irish rate of &euro;6.28.  The business lobby groups have failed to produce evidence to support their claim that the JLC system affects job creation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300015#R00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1372847100,"counter":1486,"content":"<p>I congratulate all involved in The Gathering.

There are a number of reasons for this.  Ireland has some of the most competitive hotel stock in Europe - which is a plus - but this can have a knock-on effect on other competing sectors.  We also know that many people entered the sector for other reasons at the time, including to increase their incomes.  There is a rate of attrition in the sector at present because people are either leaving it or retiring and new entrants are not necessarily coming in.  It is a very important aspect our product.  It is part of our unique selling point, particularly as not all countries have such a sector.  Not every tourist stays every night in a bed and breakfast but it can be part of his or her itinerary.  From our perspective it is important that the sector is nurtured and encouraged to expand.  We spend a great deal of time and resources working with those in the sector.  The one positive I would take from the presentations made to the committee this morning is that the primary markets for the bed and breakfast sector are continental Europe and North America.  These markets are growing and the sector is no longer as dependent on the home market or the bridge market, which are soft.  The markets for the sector are turning and we are hoping to receive a lift in that regard.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to repeating the mistakes of the past by investing in new hotels.  Internally, we discuss the concepts of primary demand and derived demand.  In the context of primary demand, people come here for a reason.  They come here for the experience and to visit the various attractions.  They do not come here to sleep or to eat.  Looking back, I accept that the industry may have placed too much emphasis on derived demand as opposed to primary demand.  The point we are making is that, going forward, greater emphasis must be placed on the reasons people should visit Ireland in the first instance as opposed to the necessary things they need to do when they arrive here.<\/p><p>  We have responsibility in respect of the home market.  The point made in this regard is very important and we did not cover it.  Irish people take a total of approximately 8 million holiday trips in Ireland.  That almost equates to the number taken by tourists from overseas.  In terms of volume, they are important.  They might not spend as much as those from abroad but they are important.  If fewer Irish people take holidays abroad and instead remain at home, this constitutes a form of import substitution.  Again, this is important.  We put in place a year-long programme each year.  This programme includes Northern Ireland, which we target explicitly in order to attract tourists.  The programme probably has been more aggressive this year than has been the case in previous years.  This is a recognition of the value which is to be had in the industry.<\/p><p>  In the context of the VAT reduction, I very much support the sentiment to the effect that the case in this regard must be evidence-based.  I completely agree with that.  We are conducting some analysis ourselves in this regard at present.  It has been of extraordinary benefit to the trade and I am sure the Irish Hotels Federation would support that view.<\/p><p>  Deputy McLellan referred to duplication.  In the interests of saving time earlier, I decided not to outline either our functions or what we do.  However, the latter is very clear.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is a development authority which is primarily concerned with the tourism product in the context of the provision of services, building capacity and training people in the industry.  We do not engage in international marketing, which is the job of Tourism Ireland.  There is no duplication and our roles are very clear.  I can understand, however, that the position can appear confusing from an outside perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300016#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shaun Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372847700,"counter":1494,"content":"<p>The issue relating to interplay between the hotel and the guesthouse and bed and breakfast sectors can be quite complex.  For example, overseas consumers might not be clear about the difference between a hotel and a guesthouse.  In other words, terminology can get in the way.  A number of interesting aspects arise in the context of the bed and breakfast sector.  The value available in the hotel sector has had an impact on the bed and breakfast sector.  However, it has also prompted some soul-searching among those in the latter sector in the context of identifying their niche in order that they might compete.  We have done a great deal of work with the bed and breakfast sector in the past four years.  This was prompted, in no small part, by the excess stock.  The latter has encouraged other sectors to consider how they might survive the difficult years while the position relating to accommodation is adjusting and while a measure of equilibrium is being restored.  It is interesting that in response bed and breakfast establishments are marketing themselves as an Irish home or Irish family experience.

The bed and breakfast question came up.  We promote Ireland on the basis of the wonderful experiences that one can have here.  The bed and breakfast experience is a quintessential Irish experience.  The beauty about the bed and breakfast stay as an Irish experience is that it is available in all parts of Ireland.  We believe that by promoting the experience we are actually promoting the regions of Ireland and getting people to consider all parts of the island.<\/p><p>  A comment was made about Scotland.  Our experience is that in most countries where we market Ireland as a destination we are competing head-to-head with Scotland.  However, our view is that we have a different experience to offer.  We believe there is a warmth in the experience that a visitor can have in Ireland.  The two landscapes are not altogether dissimilar.  Therefore, it is the warmth of experience that the visitor can have in Ireland and the engagement with the warm and curious people of Ireland that are the points of differentiation.  Given that we have 5 million people on our side in that battle, so to speak, we believe we will win it in the medium to long term.<\/p><p>  Deputy McLellan asked some specific questions.  A visitor coming to Ireland stays here on average for seven days.  That includes the average person from Britain, who stays approximately four days.  Otherwise, essentially, the further a person travels, the more likely he is to stay longer.  People from Australia will say an average of approximately 14 days and people from the United States stay somewhere in between the two.<\/p><p>  Deputy McLellan made an observation about repeat visitors.  We enjoy a reasonable level of repeat visitation.  We live in a world of social media and recommendation.  We not only want people to think about coming back to us again but we also want them to tell their friends about the wonderful experiences they had.  We know that our promotion is valuable in terms of getting people to consider Ireland as a destination.  However, what is even more influential is their friends telling them to visit the island of Ireland.  One of the parts of the world in which are quite active is Scandinavia, which I referred to already.  Sweden is one of our priority markets within Scandinavia.<\/p><p>  Underneath all of this and what drives the success and effectiveness of Ireland as a destination that is competing with 200 other destinations is the quality of the communities into which these visitors come and the experiences they receive in these communities.  We thank the communities for providing that experience.  It is important that these communities continue to have, for example, a vibrant sporting scene, a vibrant pub scene and vibrant accommodation which, all in all, create a wonderful experience.  My colleague, Ms MacLaverty, is directly responsible for marketing in Scandinavia and she may wish to comment further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300017#TT00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Nash"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372848300,"counter":1500,"content":"<p>We have worked good deal on access in the Scandinavian market.  Some 89% of Scandinavians who come to Ireland come to Dublin and stay in Dublin.  It is a short-break market.  We have had several successes with Norwegian Air, Aer Lingus, Ryanair and SAS, which has extended its capacity.  The Viking heritage is very important.  We have worked on that aspect this year with The Gathering, through Waterford, and we have created several Viking gatherings.  Next year will see the celebration of 1014 and the Battle of Clontarf and that will be prominent in our marketing activities.<\/p><p>  Then, without wishing to repeat what has been said already, there has been great innovation in the bed and breakfast sector.  There is a category for searching ancestry which has been very popular this year, the year of The Gathering.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to some of the local festivals in Carlow and Kilkenny.  We ran specific campaigns for the Carlow arts festival and the Kilkenny cat laughs festival.  As a result, the searches for hotel accommodation in Kilkenny from overseas visitors during that month grew by 141%.  That is making its mark.<\/p><p>  A point was made about the Irish language.  It is a niche but we have been doing a promotion this year with Hibernian College, which has set up a free education module in the Irish language.  We have rolled that out to all our markets overseas and to all the travel agency networks.  It is a fun initiative to encourage people to have the c&uacute;pla focal and it has been very popular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300017#TT00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Monica MacLaverty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372848300,"counter":1501,"content":"<p>Deputy Phelan raised the issue of VAT.

We are preparing detailed economic arguments for the retention of the VAT arrangement into next year.

One of the great difficulties we have had in the sector is making a real impact on the long-term employment situation.  While we have created employment, we have not created employment that we believe we could have certainly in the hotel sector.  The Government has created various employment initiatives, including Momentum, Springboard and JobBridge.  Increasingly these have focused on ICT and the knowledge economy.  We are forgetting that in the heartland of Ireland and out in more remote areas these types of employment often cannot be created and tourism is an area that can jump in and provide work.  Youth unemployment is a huge problem in Europe as it is here in Ireland.<\/p><p>  We find that we cannot get the type of vocational training that would be needed particularly with organisations such as the VECs.  The VECs have a tremendous possibility now and we are very excited about the creation of the local employment and training boards.  However, there has been no investment in, for instance, culinary training.  They cover that to a certain extent but not to the level we need.  Some of those are structural issues.  Not every VEC will do this.  We are preparing a document to be presented to Government shortly to make a positive impact on this.  We need SOLAS to include hospitality and tourism training within its remit.  When programmes are being devised the industry needs to be involved.<\/p><p>  We had a pilot programme in Galway where we found the <i>modus operandi<\/i> of the Department of Social Protection in providing suitable individuals for the training programme was not what we expected and the outcome was not as good as it should have been if there had been real co-operation with employers.  We will bring a plan to Government outlining some structural issues that need to be changed.  We believe the VECs and vocational training represent the way forward.  Not everybody will get a degree and our industry produces the entry into employment and gives people the confidence they need.  Young people get this confidence in dealing with other people and get the skills from us.<\/p><p>  We want to see apprenticeships reintroduced for our industry as well as for other industries because, as Mr. Pender has said, young people want to earn and learn.  We believe we can provide that.  We will reduce our dependency on foreign nationals working in the industry if we can create more vocational and craft training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300018#UU00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Vaughan"},{"type":"speech","time":1372848900,"counter":1504,"content":"<p>There was mention of linking tourists to local sporting and cultural events.

If holidaymakers are staying in hotels in the area perhaps that could be linked to filling some of those extra 10,000 seats, benefiting hotels and guesthouses, benefiting the GAA, soccer or whatever it is by getting more bums on seats.

We are trying to support tourism product and refresh it and enable access to the Irish tourism product.  If we focus on the core expectation of the visitor which is to have a unique Irish authentic experience, one cannot stray too far away from the GAA, the Irish language, our heritage, our folklore, logainmneacha and other things that are uniquely Irish.  We have not explored that sufficiently.<\/p><p>  We are in discussions with the authorities in Croke Park on the skyline tour, stadium tour, etc.  It is unfortunate that the two companies doing the hop-on hop-off tours, Dualway and Dublin Bus, have not managed to get across to the north side of Dublin to Croke Park, Glasnevin Cemetery and other Office of Public Works sites.  There is a cluster of important attractions of which we could make more.  We are discussing that with Croke Park and the tour bus companies.<\/p><p>  However, the real opportunity we are missing is at local club level.  The Vice Chairman mentioned the Camp Nou.  Much of the time we focus on Croke Park.  Many visitors from Britain, France or Germany will have a 60,000 or 70,000-seat stadium in their region and so that might not be the thing.  However, some of these countries might not experience anything like 500 people around a hurling pitch on a summer's evening where two local parishes are playing each other.  That involves the following: the intensity, passion, emotion and skill of the game; the local sense of community and all that goes with that; being brought up for the tea, sandwiches and a few drinks afterwards; and the Irish music and entertainment.  This is Irish music being played by Irish people for Irish people as opposed to just for tourists allowing them to be part of something that is really Irish.<\/p><p>  That is a huge challenge.  Our interest in the GAA is to see how we can connect people who happen to be in County Clare to find that action, which is there on their doorstep.  It is a great example of product bundling or packaging.  A bed and breakfast can be packaged with a local restaurant, hotel or GAA club, fishing or some folklore.  If we could get better at that, the local GAA clubs would be a crucial part of what we package together.  Summer evenings around Ireland and GAA pitches around the west coast of Ireland represent an enormous potential that we have not yet tapped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013070300018#UU00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Pender"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1372849500,"counter":1510,"content":"<p>We have experience in the hotels in Limerick city where this type of collaboration has occurred.
