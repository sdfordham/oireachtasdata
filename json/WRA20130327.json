However, our next most important European market, Germany, produced\u00a0over\u00a0448,000 visits, an increase of 6% on 2011, while North America, our second most important market overall, grew 3% to over\u00a0a million\u00a0visits while spend grew 9% to &euro;742 million.<\/p><p>  Tourism Ireland's Business Plan for 2013\u00a0targets a\u00a0further 5.2% growth in visits, from all of our significant markets including Great Britain and Germany, and highlights the potential impact\u00a0of the\u00a0Gathering Ireland 2013. It is important to focus on markets with best prospects for growth but it is necessary to balance this and\u00a0not ignore opportunities in other markets, particularly one as significant as Britain.

In relation to matters specifically under my Department's remit, I used the opportunity of engagements with our diaspora and those with a connection to Ireland to promote Irish tourism, particularly in this, the year of the Gathering, as well as holding a briefing for the tourism trade and media in Japan. Furthermore, I held meetings with Ministerial colleagues who cover areas relating to transport, tourism and sport in order to develop co-operation in a variety of areas of mutual interest.

The 57th session of the Commission on the Status of Women took place in New York from 4 to 15 March 2013.  The priority theme for the session was the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls.  The outcome aimed for in this regard was a set of Agreed Conclusions, which are negotiated by all states and, in accordance with normal practice, adopted on the basis of consensus. <\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s official delegation to the CSW was led by Ms Kathleen Lynch T.D., Minister of State at the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality with responsibility for Disability, Equality, Mental Health and Older People.  It included officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In addition, representatives from civil society organisations were part of the delegation.<\/p><p>  The EU was represented in the negotiations on the Agreed Conclusions by the EU Delegation, supported by the Irish Presidency.  Following extensive negotiations, consensus on the Agreed Conclusions was reached on 15 March 2013.  Ireland, working closely with EU and other likeminded partners, contributed actively to what has been widely received as a positive outcome.  Previously identified national priorities are clearly reflected in the Agreed Conclusions, including a strong condemnation all forms of violence against women and girls; recognition of the linkages with gender inequality and discrimination; a commitment to end impunity; and references to women, peace and security, women human rights defenders, and the need for coordinated, multisectoral services.  New elements incorporated into the Agreed Conclusions include the role of men and boys in addressing the issue, and the role which victims and survivors can play as agents for change.<\/p><p>  The Agreed Conclusions (currently in unedited format) are available on the website of the 57th Session of the CSW.<\/p><p>  In addition to the negotiations on the agreed conclusions, the Minister of State chaired a number of side events.  The first of these, entitled &ldquo;Mobilising communities to prevent and respond to violence against women &ndash; lessons learnt from Uganda&rdquo;, looked at Irish Aid&rsquo;s work in Uganda.  The second, entitled &ldquo;Addressing Gender Based Violence in post conflict and fragile states &ndash; a case study of Sierra Leone&rdquo;, presented the results of research carried out by the Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence.  The Minister of State also participated in a European Union event, at which she outlined the National Strategy developed by Cosc, and a side event organised by the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts.<\/p><p>  Additionally, the Minister of State participated in a high-level consultation on &ldquo;Accelerating Zero-Tolerance to Gender Based Violence through the HIV response&rdquo; which was organised by UN Women and UNAIDS and co-sponsored by Ireland.  Her programme also included a series of bilateral contacts with a number of other Ministers and officials.<\/p><p>  Ireland also co-sponsored an event with Amnesty International and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which focused on the risks faced by women human rights defenders and at which our Permanent Representative in New York was a panellist.  We co-sponsored a further event organised by the Uganda-based NGO, Raising Voices, which looked at implementing an evidence-based approach in addressing violence against women and girls.  An event supported by Australia, South Africa and Ireland explored the potential of new media in supporting survivors of violence against women.  The range of side events contributed to raising awareness around these issues among those attending CSW while also showcasing Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in efforts to eliminate violence against women and girls both domestically and internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700070#WRJJJ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700070#WRJJJ00850"},{"type":"question","counter":210,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[15480\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700070#WRJJJ00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if consular or other assistance will be provided to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"977","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":211,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that this Department through our Consulate General in New York has been in direct contact with the named person&rsquo;s lawyer and the NGO Reprieve regarding this person&rsquo;s application for Irish citizenship via the Foreign Births Registration.

Concerns about Iran&rsquo;s intentions have been voiced not only by the United States and Israel but by a very wide group of countries including the member States of the European Union, Russia, China, and Iran&rsquo;s Arab neighbours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700070#WRJJJ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Transport","counter":218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700070#WRJJJ01450"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[15674\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700070#WRJJJ01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the full cost of Ministerial transport and the breakdown of this cost between salaries, mileage allowance and other travel costs for Ministers and Ministers of State in his Department for 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":220,"content":"<p>The following table provides the cost of Ministerial drivers and ground transport for Ministers of State at my Department in 2012.

We continue to urge all the parties in the Assembly to engage in constructive discussion with a view to reaching agreement on the substance of a Bill of Rights.<\/p><p>  A Bill of Rights drawn up by agreement between the main parties of the Assembly could set out precisely and formally the rights upon which a shared future for the people of Northern Ireland can be based. <\/p><p>  All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, including in Northern Ireland, the Irish language and the languages of the various ethnic communities, as part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland.  <\/p><p>  In the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed to introducing an Irish Language Act reflecting on the experience of Wales and Ireland and to working with the Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish Language.  <\/p><p>  It also called on the incoming Northern Ireland Executive to work to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language. The British legislation giving effect to the St. Andrews Agreement included a specific requirement on the Executive to adopt a strategy setting out     how it proposed to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language.  <\/p><p>  Since the restoration of the devolved Institutions on 8 May 2007, the question of an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive. In that regard, my colleagues the Minister for Arts, Heritage &amp; the Gaeltacht, Mr Jimmy Deenihan T.D. and Minister of State Dinny McGinley T.D. have had ongoing discussions on the matter with their counterpart, the Northern Ireland Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Ms Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA.  On 11 July 2012, Minister N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n launched a consultation process which concluded on 27 November on strategies for the Irish language and Ulster Scots.  Inputs from the consultation process are now being considered.<\/p><p>  Last November I visited An Chult&uacute;rlann in Belfast which is a very impressive Irish language and cultural centre.  I had the opportunity to meet with some of the city&rsquo;s leading Irish language activists and to hear their concerns regarding the promotion of the Irish language including their views on an Irish language act for Northern Ireland.  Officials in my Department maintain regular and ongoing contact with the Irish language community in Northern Ireland, most recently when they attended the official opening of Gael&aacute;ras Mhic Ardghail in Newry on Monday 18 February.<\/p><p>  The Government continues to follow developments closely in relation to the proposed Act, as well as the overall enhancement and protection of the Irish Language in Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>  The Good Friday Agreement also provided for the establishment of a Consultative Civic Forum  as a consultative mechanism in Northern Ireland on social, economic and cultural issues.<\/p><p>  The St Andrews Agreement provided that the Northern Ireland Executive would support the establishment of an independent North\/South Consultative Forum appointed by the two administrations and representative of civil society.  In September 2008 the Irish Government submitted proposals for the role, format, membership and operation of a North South Consultative Forum to the Executive for its consideration, and facilitated three consultative conferences, the most recent of which was in January 2011.  The review of the Civic Forum by the Northern Ireland Executive has not yet been completed.  At its meeting on 2 November 2012, the North-South Ministerial Council noted the current position on a North South Consultative Forum and agreed to review the issue at a future NSMC Plenary.<\/p><p>  I hope that we can take this opportunity of the 15th  Anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement to recall the vision of a shared society which inspired that Agreement and re-dedicate ourselves to the achievement of that goal.  While there are undoubtedly challenges ahead, we should not lose sight of the progress that continues to be made, including, most recently though the establishment of the North South Inter Parliamentary Association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700071#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":233,"content":"<p>Question No. 93 answered with Question No. 89.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":234,"content":"<p>Question No. 94 answered with Question No. 92.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[12519\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700071#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on recent political contacts with political leaders in Northern Ireland.","asker":"954","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>During the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period in Washington D.C., I met with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and with the SDLP leader, Alasdair McDonnell.

The introduction of a value based property tax is part of our obligation under the EU\/IMF programme. Actions for the ninth Troika review, which was to be completed by the end of the 2012, included the introduction of a value based property tax for 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  These measures are deemed necessary in order to reduce further the deficit in the public finances and so as to ensure continued adherence to fiscal targets set as part of the EU\/IMF Programme. While the Government has some scope within the Programme to use alternative methods to achieve Programme targets, the yield anticipated from the Local Property Tax could only have been achieved by other measures which would have significantly reduced overall expenditure on vital public services or increased taxation on incomes and spending.  This Government did not want to add to the already necessary cuts in public expenditure or to place additional costs on job creation.<\/p><p><br \/>  It should be noted that the arguments in favour of a property tax go beyond our obligations under the EU\/IMF programme.  The introduction of a property tax is part of a broader approach to the taxation of property. The aim is to replace some of the revenue from transaction based taxes, which have proven to be an unstable source of Government revenue, with an annual recurring property tax, which international experience has shown to be a stable source of funding.<\/p><p><br \/>  The taxation of property through a recurring annual tax is less economically distortionary than the imposition of tax on either income or capital. This is supported by economic literature and recent OECD analysis. The OECD has highlighted that annual taxes on land and buildings have a relatively small adverse impact on economic performance.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy is aware the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended by the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013) was enacted into law, following its signature by the President on 26 December 2012 with the first liability date being the 1 May 2013.  As I have previously outlined to this House, in designing the local property tax the Inter-Departmental Expert Group chaired by Dr Don Thornhill (the &#8220;Thornhill Group&#8221;) had due regard to issues such as ability to pay and considered the provision of waivers or deferrals for households unable to pay the tax or where a payment requirement would cause hardship.  For individuals on low incomes, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain cases.  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The income thresholds for a full deferral will be &#8364;15,000 for a single person and &#8364;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their income will not, &#8220;as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date&#8221; exceed these thresholds in that year.<\/p><p><br \/>  An increased income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  A deferral option in qualifying cases in this regard will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress.<\/p><p><br \/>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &#8364;25,000 for a single person or &#8364;35,000 for married persons\/civil partners\/cohabitants.  A deferral of 50% of the LPT will also be available where gross income does not exceed the above thresholds (&#8364;25,000 single, &#8364;35,000 couple) as increased by 80% of the gross mortgage interest payments that a liable person expects to make by the end of the year for which the gross income is being estimated. This type of deferral will also be available until 31 December 2017.<\/p><p><br \/>  Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred.  Interest of c. 4% per annum will apply to any amounts deferred. The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.<\/p><p><br \/>  The thresholds were based on the recommendations of the Thornhill Group. The Government accepted the income thresholds for a full deferral and adapted the income thresholds for a partial deferral so that they are &#8364;10,000 rather than &#8364;5,000 above the thresholds for a full deferral.  To determine whether deferral applies for 2013, a person is required to estimate on 1 May 2013 what his or her total gross income for 2013 will be. Gross income from all sources consists of total income before any deductions, allowances or reliefs that may be taken off for income tax purposes and includes income that is exempt from income tax and income from the Department of Social Protection but excludes Child Benefit.<\/p><p><br \/>  I appreciate that some property owners may find themselves unable to pay Local Property Tax but do not qualify for a deferral under the existing legislation.  For this reason, the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013 provides that a person who has entered into an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may apply for deferral of the LPT that is due during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect.  The 2013 Act also provides that a person who suffers both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay their LPT without causing financial hardship, may apply for full or partial deferral.  Claims for this type of deferral will require full disclosure of the person&#8217;s financial circumstances, supporting documentation and any other information required by Revenue and following an examination of the information provided, Revenue will determine whether deferral should be granted.  The detail of how this type of deferral will operate and the criteria that will be used to determine eligibility will be set out in guidelines due to be published by the Revenue Commissioners shortly.<\/p><p><br \/>  Details of the deferral arrangements are available on Revenue&#8217;s website <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.revenue.ie<\/font><\/i>, where the Commissioners have recently published a useful Guide to Local Property Tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700072#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Redundancy Payments","counter":263,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700072#WRL00550"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[15459\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700072#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he intends to engage in further discussions with Irish Bank Resolution Corporation employees regarding redundancy payments.","asker":"968","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":265,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[15562\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700072#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 99 of 20 February 2013, if, in view of confirmation from the IBOA that the Liquidator has told the union he can agree a solution to the severance terms issue provided the minister instructs him to do so under section 9 of the IBRC Act 2013, he will instruct the liquidator to restore the value of the severance terms for Irish Bank Resolution Corporation employees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":266,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 112 together.<\/p><p>  The Special Liquidators have advised me that they are highly cognisant of the issues that the IBOA have been highlighting and that significant steps have already been taken to address those concerns, including the announcement on Tuesday 19 March by the Special Liquidators that contracts of staff would be extended out to 7 August with one month&rsquo;s notice thereafter.

Section 7 of the 2012 Act provides that local authorities will be liable to pay the LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties in question are used to accommodate people with special housing needs such as the elderly or people with disabilities.  A key aspect of the work undertaken by Revenue was the development of a comprehensive Register of residential properties in the State.  The Register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue&rsquo;s own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database and data from utility companies.  Data from the various sources has been cross-checked to ensure that the Register is as accurate as possible.  The Register is being used to issue correspondence to property owners and work is still in progress to refine it.<\/p><p>  I am advised that in developing the Register, Revenue collaborated with all local authorities and social housing bodies to establish details of properties owned by these organisations in order that they could be excluded, in the first instance, from the general issue of returns, so as to ensure that tenants of local authority properties did not receive an LPT return.

The allocation process for the 2013\/14 school year is currently underway in my Department and the staffing arrangements, including the appeals process, for primary schools have been published on the Department website. The final staffing position for all schools will not be known until later in the year when the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.<\/p><p>  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools is being gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014. During this period the pupil threshold for a 2-classroom school is being increased to 20 pupils. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement. The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.<\/p><p>  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities and my Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small schools that are affected by the budget measure.

There are currently approximately 87,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;403 million for 2013.<\/p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. However, Social Welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such a landlord on behalf of the tenant.  This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department. The department official dealing with the request will take into account all the relevant circumstances of the particular case and the tenant&rsquo;s preference will be accommodated where possible. <\/p><p>  Within the timeframe available, I have not been able to ascertain whether any Court decisions have imposed a civil liability on this Department for loss or damage arising from tenancy contracts as a result of rent supplement issues or whether any associated legal advice has been received.  The Department will advise the Deputy further on the matter in due course.  <\/p><p>  It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent. Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated. Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s\/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process. <\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s circulars regarding rent supplement do not place any legal obligation in relation to decisions on the payment of rent supplement but are designed to provide guidance to departmental staff in the exercise of their powers having regard to the requirements of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700078#WRR01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Supplement Payments","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700078#WRR01550"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[15563\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700078#WRR01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason the mortgage supplement relief was reduced in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Meath ; if she will review this decision; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>The minimum contribution that the person concerned must make towards their Mortgage Interest is &euro;32 per week. <\/p><p>  As the minimum contribution payable by the person, exceeds the current weekly amount of mortgage interest payable, I regret to advise you that the person concerned has no entitlement to the Mortgage Interest Supplement at this point in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700078#WRR01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Redeployment","counter":455,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700078#WRR01750"},{"type":"question","counter":456,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[15636\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700078#WRR01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if an offer for employees of F&Aacute;S to transfer to her Department was made; if so, if it is still on the table; the current situation in relation to same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":457,"content":"<p>In March 2010 the Government decided that the employment and community services programmes of F&Aacute;S should transfer to the Department of Social Protection. <\/p><p>  All staff in F&Aacute;S assigned to the transferring activities transferred to the Department.

The commitment is to review, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, both hedgerow and scrub regulation with a view to producing guidelines to encourage best practice for hedgerow and scrub management for wildlife.

Such contracts are governed by the CER&rsquo;s guidelines for suppliers&rsquo; Codes of Practice, Customer Charter and Terms and Conditions of Supply for Household Customers.<\/p><p>  Energy suppliers have always had requirements regarding the provision of deposits in advance but, due to the general economic situation, it is possible that suppliers are strictly applying these requirements as standard, whereas in the past they may have waived them.  I understand from the CER that one of the main reasons that electricity and gas suppliers require deposits is that their customers consume the energy supplied in advance and pay in arrears.  Therefore suppliers must always meet the cost of providing the energy in advance of payment and consequently they run the risk of non-payment from their customers.  This is in contrast to suppliers of other energy products, such as heating oil or Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), as customers are required by the suppliers to pay for these products in advance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700080#WRT01600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Services","counter":511,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700080#WRT01650"},{"type":"question","counter":512,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[15566\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700080#WRT01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when will detailed postal codes be introduced here; and the reason for the delay.","asker":"1017","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":513,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to introducing postcodes across the State.

It is expected there will be an increase in the coming years in the number of vehicles falling into the lower emitting A bands as vehicle technology continues to evolve &ndash; in Band A registrations for 2009, the first full year of the new CO 2 based system, comprise 14.8% of the total CO 2   fleet. For 2012, that figure is 54.4%.<\/p><p>The estimated additional income for 2013 , derived from each of the new CO 2 bands and based on numbers of vehicles taxed at 28 February 2013 , is set out below.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>CO 2 band <\/th><th>No of vehicles taxed at 28 February 2013 <\/th><th>Annual tax -   2012 rates <\/th><th>Annual tax - 2013 rates <\/th><th>Estimated additional income based on annual tax <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>A0 (0 g\/km) <\/td><td><div>169 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;160 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;120 <\/div><\/td><td><div>(&#8364;6,760) <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A1 (1 - 80g\/km) <\/td><td><div>11 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;160 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;170 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;110 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A2 (81 - 100g\/km) <\/td><td><div>4,416 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;160 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;180 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;88,320 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A3 (101 - 110g\/km) <\/td><td><div>22,883 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;160 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;190 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;686,490 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A4 (111 - 120g\/km) <\/td><td><div>114,908 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;160 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;200 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;4,596,320 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>B1 (121 - 130g\/km) <\/td><td><div>69,958 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;225 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;270 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;3,148,110 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>B2 (131 - 140g\/km) <\/td><td><div>131,461 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;225 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;280 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;7,230,355 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><div>Total <\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;15,742,945 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700081#WRU01200","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Exemptions","counter":534,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700081#WRU01250"},{"type":"question","counter":535,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[15385\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700081#WRU01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the criteria that was applied to decide if estates are eligible for a waiver for the local property tax;

Its function is to provide accommodation and ancillary services to those who have sought international protection and who otherwise have no means of supporting themselves.<\/p><p>  In relation to the information provided below which is collated from the RIA database, it is important to note that it is not possible to specify exactly how long each person has resided in RIA accommodation.  Protection applicants are not required to live in RIA accommodation and in many cases, may move in and out of the direct provision system as their circumstances change.

Accordingly, the provisions of the EU Treaty Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice applies.  The Protocol provides that Ireland may opt-in to a measure to which the Protocol applies. Ireland did not participate in the adoption and application of the 2003 Directive and there are currently no plans to exercise an opt-in in relation to it.<\/p><p>  The principal reason for Ireland's position is the provisions of Article 11 of the 2003 Directive which deals with access to the labour market for asylum seekers. Article 11 provides that if a decision at first instance has not been taken within one year of the presentation of an application for asylum, and this delay cannot be attributed to the applicant, Member States shall decide the conditions for granting access to the labour market for the applicant.<\/p><p>  This is contrary to the existing statutory position in Ireland which provides that an asylum seeker shall not seek or enter employment.

However, I am unable to do so at this point since I have not yet obtained the Government's approval for my proposals. The proposals are in the General Scheme of the proposed Gambling Control Bill which I hope to present to the Government within the coming weeks. I plan to make the Scheme available on my Department's website once it has been approved.<\/p><p>  I can, however, say at this stage that the new legislation will strengthen the protections available to consumers generally, with additional measures being included that are aimed at protecting vulnerable persons; that term refers primarily to persons under 18 years and to persons who have developed gambling problems, including addiction.<\/p><p>  I envisage a new inspection team whose major task will be to monitor compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licence and with the new legislation generally. It will have strong enforcement powers. Licence holders, for their part, will be required to train staff on how to spot problem or excessive gambling and on how and when to intervene.There will be prohibitions on the employment of young persons, they will not be permitted to participate in gambling, there will be arrangements for age verification checks.<\/p><p>  I believe that the industry must accept greater responsibility for the down - side of gambling. One of the ways in which this will be done is to require licence holders to contribute to a social responsibility fund, the aim of the fund being to support research, education and treatment programmes. I will also be proposing restrictions on advertising, promoting and sponsoring of events by licence holders if these activities are targeted at young people.<\/p><p>  The examples I have mentioned give an indication of the comprehensive scale of the planned measures. However, we are all aware that regardless of whatever the law might provide, there will be particular difficulties in enforcing age and identity checks in the case of online gambling, much of which will be done from home. It therefore seems clear to me that the effective enforcement of rules and procedures for online gambling will require the active involvement of parents and others, particularly teachers. This may mean that parents must monitor the young person's internet and telephone usage and they must never share their PIN or similar number with anyone under 18 years.<\/p><p>  I have requested information on the number of inspections by Garda&iacute; of gaming establishments. I will communicate with the Deputy when it becomes available.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's question appears to suggest some linkage between the discharge by the Gardai of their functions and the existence of a particular unit in my Department. It is very important that there should be clarity about the respective roles and functions of the Garda&iacute; and of the named unit, or any other part of the Department. I have already referred to the creation of, in effect, a new, dedicated inspectorate under the new legislation; it will probably take over many of the roles currently assigned to the Garda&iacute; and others. However, pending the enactment and coming into force of the new systems, the enforcement of the current law will continue to be a matter primarily for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, although the Revenue Commissioners also have certain functions.The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is, of course, independent in the discharge of the duties imposed on it by law. It makes its own determinations on operational grounds, taking account of general priorities, the resources available and other relevant factors.<\/p><p>  The Casino and Gaming Control Section in my Department, on the other hand, has no function in relation to law enforcement. Its functions include advising me of developments in the sector, formulating general policy, conducting consultations, such as the public consultation in 2010, the preparation of draft legislation, as well as specific statutory functions such as the preparation of Certificates of Personal Fitness in the case of certain applicants for bookmakers' licences under the Betting Act 1931.

As I informed the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 453 on 12 March, the contract between the Courts Service and the Public Private Partnership Company (PPPCo) provides for a single monthly unitary charge payment to cover the design, construction, financing and service provision in the Criminal Courts of Justice.  The financial model underpinning the monthly unitary charge formed a central element of the extensive negotiations undertaken by the Service prior to entering into the contract with the PPPCo.  I am further informed that this information is commercially sensitive and its release would have implications for the Courts Service's negotiating position for future public private partnership projects.  As previously stated, the CCJ contract is between the Courts Service and the PPPCo and ongoing amounts paid by the PPPCo to its subcontractor G4S for the provision of services are part of their internal financial and contractual arrangements.  The services provided by the PPPCo through its subcontractor G4S include security, cleaning, maintenance, facilities management, energy and utilities management, health and safety, helpdesk and portering.<\/p><p>  Under the terms of the contract, the PPPCo has to provide the facilities and the services in the Criminal Courts of Justice to a required standard and in accordance with a performance regime as set out in the contract.  Failure to meet these standards or failure to have all or part of the Criminal Courts of Justice available for use during the course of the contract period will result in financial penalties being incurred by the PPPCo.  As the Criminal Courts of Justice will be handed over to the Courts Service in an \"as built\"&rsquo; condition in 2035, the contract provides that the PPPCo is responsible for the ongoing maintenance, including replacement costs for the fabric, contents and equipment in the Criminal Courts of Justice.  In the 2011 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the total expenditure to February 2035 was projected at &euro;625.4 million.  The current annual commitment for the Criminal Courts of Justice base unitary charge is &euro;21.9 million (including VAT).  In 2013, annual indexation provisions increased the unitary charge by approximately &euro;200,000.  In future years, any increases or decreases will depend on the CPI published by the Central Statistics Office on an annual basis.  Therefore, it is not possible to predict this in advance.  However, I understand the projected costs of the project mentioned above assumed an inflation rate of 2% over the period of the project.<\/p><p>  The total amount paid on volume related items, such as jury minding and jury meals, will be based on the usage for these items over the lifetime of the contract.  As a consequence, the Courts Service has informed me that it is not possible to predict in any meaningful manner expenditure to 2035 on such items.  Expenditure will depend on unpredictable factors such as the number and length of jury trials.  In addition, the Courts Service has indicated that it can discontinue the use of the PPPCo for the provision of such services once the contracted notice period is provided.  Expenditure on volume related items in 2012 was &euro;650,000, including VAT.  As I mentioned in my reply of 12 March, there have ongoing operational savings for other criminal justice agencies, including the Irish Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na resulting in more members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being released for front line duties, in addition to considerable savings on lease costs.  Finally, as stated previously, this PPP contract was dealt with in detail by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2008 Annual Report and was also examined by the Committee of Public Accounts in July 2010.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700085#WRAA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":690,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700085#WRAA00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Semi-State Bodies Remuneration","counter":689,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700085#WRAA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":690,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[15406\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700085#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the total cost to the taxpayer of paying the aggregate fees, salaries and any other remuneration to directors of all State bodies, to include majority State owned banks, all public interest directors, all semi-State bodies, all State agencies and so on; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"953","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":691,"content":"<p>The only body under the aegis of my Department is the Army Pensions Board.

They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing become more of a problem. <\/p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC, or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.<\/p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if we all work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, we will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.<\/p><p>  In order to ensure that we achieve this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.<\/p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  <\/p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:<\/p><p>- Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming; and<\/p><p>- Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands.<\/p><p>The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.<\/p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700085#WRBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":721,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[15629\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700085#WRBB01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the protections available for farmers whose commonages areas are being trespassed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":722,"content":"<p>Decisions affecting privately owned land are a matter for the individual owners or commonage shareholders to resolve with any person, who may be trespassing on their land.

Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.<\/p><p>  Youth Affairs Unit provides funding to the organisation in Co.

This support is provided through the provision of two targeted childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme - and the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  These support programmes are available to parents who enrol their children in childcare services which are approved to participate in the programmes.<\/p><p><br \/>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low incomes.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, middle and low income working parents may also qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive &#8364;95 per week towards full-day childcare costs.<\/p><p><br \/>  The CETS<b><\/b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services for trainees and students who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC.  Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.  The ECCE programme provides one free  pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free pre-school provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2013, the total expenditure by my Department on these three programmes is expected to be in the region &#8364;260 million.  These programmes have been maintained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare.  You may also be aware that, as part of Budget 2013, I announced with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, a joint school age childcare initiative which will provide further additional support to both the community and private childcare sector.  This initiative, which represents an annual investment of &#8364;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that quality after-school care is in place to support children's development.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy which is currently being developed by my Department.  This Strategy will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, family support, learning and development and care and education and will identify the structures and policies needed to improve early year's experience in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700085#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":745,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700085#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":746,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[15662\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700085#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the rationale for removing the administration of funding from Youth Work Ireland National Office to the City of Dublin Youth Service Board; the amount of money that this will save in 2013 and subsequent years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":747,"content":"<p>In 2013, &euro;36.358m will be distributed by my Department to 477 youth projects throughout the country.  Up to 2012 the allocations were distributed to the youth projects through 39 administering agencies\/bodies that held funding administration status.  These include VECs, national youth organisations and 11 other bodies including some county councils.  The City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB), a statutory board established in 1942, under the City of Dublin VEC, is one such body.

For these reasons, from January 2013, it was decided to transfer the administration of the allocated funding for some 30 youth projects, involving six national organisations, including Youth Work Ireland, to CDYSB.  The new administration process will be monitored during 2013 for efficiency and effectiveness for the Department and for the projects concerned.

Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person.  The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure.  The inclusion of primary care services in health insurance products is not a statutory requirement, as the primary purpose of current health insurance legislation is to provide cover for hospital treatment within an appropriate regulatory system. <\/p><p>  This Government is committed to a single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance (UHI), which provides equal access based on need, not ability to pay, and which delivers the best health outcomes for everyone.  Under UHI, everyone will be insured for a standard package of curative services comprising primary and hospital care services, including mental health services.  Health insurance will be mandatory, with a system of financial support ensuring affordability by paying or subsidising the cost of insurance premiums for all those who qualify.  The system will be founded on principles of social solidarity, including  financial protection, open enrolment, lifetime cover and community rating. <\/p><p>  The introduction of UHI will see the purchasing of primary and hospital care largely devolved to insurers.  Health insurers will commission care for their members from primary care providers, independent not-for-profit Hospital Trusts and private hospitals.  In doing this, they will have a duty to use their purchasing role to ensure that quality, continuous care is provided at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as close to a person's home as possible.  Furthermore, in line with the fundamental principle of social solidarity, neither insurers nor providers operating within the UHI system will be allowed to sell faster access to services covered by the UHI standard package of care.  While it is envisaged that supplementary insurance may be purchased for items not covered by the standard package, this may not interfere with the fundamental overriding principle of access to care being based on need. <\/p><p>  My Department is currently undertaking detailed work in relation to the preparation of a White Paper on Universal Health Insurance.  This White Paper will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with its introduction.  The work involved is both complex and technical and  demands a wide-range of specialised legal and financial expertise.

The Programme is organised at national, regional and local level and includes representatives from the health and education sectors, service providers (both statutory and non-statutory) and parents. These stakeholders are working together to see how current services can be reorganised in line with agreed policy. The HSE has stated that it is is very cognisant of stakeholder's views particularly of parents within this context. It has also worked to ensure that information about the Programme is made widely available.<\/p><p>  The Executive is working very closely with the education sector, which is fully involved in the development of the Programme, to ensure that, from the children&rsquo;s and parents&rsquo; perspective, the services provided by each sector in so far as possible areintegrated. Detailed Local Area action plans are being implemented with the following objectives:<\/p><p> - One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need,<\/p><p> - Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families, and<\/p><p> - Health and Education working together to support children to achieve their potential.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the reconfiguration of existing therapy resources is to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide health supports and ongoing therapy to all children (0-18 years) in line with their prioritised needs.  In particular, it will mean that all children, regardless of where they receive their education services will have equitable access to services based on their needs.  Decisions in relation to the local reorganisation of services will be made by Local Implementation Groups, which include representatives of all the service providers in the local area, parents and the education sector. They have a complex task which includes agreeing the principles which should underpin all disability services, mapping of existing services and gaps, consideration of the changes needed in structures and a detailed plan of how to advance.  This plan will include issues of timing and the phasing of proposed changes.

It also agreed to make appropriate amendments to the criminal law in this area.

X<\/i>, the Supreme Court considered the meaning of the Eighth Amendment in the circumstances that arose in the case.  The case concerned a girl of 14 years of age and the threat to her life was from suicide.  The Supreme Court analysed and interpreted the text of Article 40.3.3 and decided that the Constitution permitted abortion in certain limited and particular circumstances, namely, where there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman, which could only be removed by terminating the pregnancy.  Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution as interpreted in the <i>X <\/i>case judgment is the law of the State and the Oireachtas is legally bound to adhere to this interpretation.

The NOSP through regional suicide prevention services offer Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) and SafeTALK to a variety of community gatekeepers who are working with and supporting vulnerable groups including asylum seekers.  The NOSP has additional training programmes focused on self harm which can be delivered to community members.<\/p><p><br \/>  The primary care and mental health services are available to all members of Irish society.  The aim of the HSE is to build the capacity and knowledge of staff working in frontline statutory and non-statutory services to meet the specific needs of all diverse groups in Irish society.  All the frontline services from the voluntary sector funded by the NOSP including Samaritans, Pieta House, and Console should be available to asylum seekers and their families who may be in need of support or information.  In addition the NOSP funds, My Mind which is a community-based not for profit organisation, voluntary service provider that specialises in providing psychological support services at a community level through counsellors and psychologists who speak 15 different languages.  The NOSP has been able to access this service for asylum seekers looking for support or in suicidal crisis.  The NOSP has also produced a number of information resources in several languages in order to support different communities to look after their mental health.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, the Director of the NOSP welcomes a dialogue with the representatives from any group in Irish society that has evidence that members of their community may be at risk of suicide or self harm.

In addition NOSP publishes an Annual Report outlining its activities and work each year so it is fully accountable.

Priority initiatives will include the further development of existing National Mental Health Awareness campaigns to promote help seeking; increased training for GPs and practice staff; the training of acute hospital staff on suicide and self harm intervention; the development of the SCAN (Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse) model which allows for crisis interventions at primary care and continued investment in voluntary agencies providing frontline services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700085#WRFF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":843,"content":"<p>Question No. 313 answered with Question No. 15.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":845,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700085#WRFF01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driving Licence Issues","counter":844,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700085#WRFF01050"},{"type":"question","counter":845,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[15377\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700085#WRFF01100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on the risk to jobs posed by changes to driving licences and the subsequent impact on retail photographic ID providers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":846,"content":"<p>The Government decided in 2011 to centralise driver licence provision, following an examination of the options for driver licensing which found that a centralised system would offer enhanced security and consistency, and be more efficient and cost-effective.<\/p><p>  The Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012 provides for the RSA to become the central driver licensing authority in Ireland.\u00a0 This came into effect on 12 January 2013.<\/p><p>  The new system involves three outsourced elements, a card production facility, a front office for engaging with the customer, and a back office to process applications.\u00a0 All three are overseen by a &lsquo;specialist unit' based in the RSA headquarters.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The card licence is standardised across the European Union and therefore there must be consistency in the quality and standard of information used.\u00a0 The photograph is digital and is not stuck on to the card in the way it was on the old paper licence.\u00a0 The capture of the photograph is included in the fee for the licence.\u00a0 As the system develops, the SAFE2 ID standard will be implemented, at which point the only option will be the digital photo taken at the Front Office Network.

From a regulatory perspective my Department aims to ensure that there are no legal or regulatory impediments to the introduction of air services by negotiating bilateral air services agreements with third countries where necessary.\u00a0\u00a0The market for air services in and out of Ireland is highly competitive with a very significant number of airlines operating.<\/p><p>  Tourism Ireland, the agency with responsibility for the overseas promotion of Ireland as a tourist destination, continues to invest in cooperative marketing activity with airlines.  Additional capacity has been secured between Ireland and the US and current indications are that transatlantic capacity for summer 2013 will be higher than summer 2012, with up to 133 departures per week, providing just over 31,000 seats in each direction. This represents a 26.6% increase in capacity, or just over 6,500 additional seats per week, compared to summer 2012. Furthermore\u00a0 additional connectivity\u00a0 direct \u00a0from \u00a0Dublin has been achieved through Emirates&rsquo; hub in Dubai which \u00a0provides \u00a0greater ease of access to Ireland from Australia as well as the emerging tourism markets in the Middle East and Asia. <\/p><p>  I will\u00a0continue to act as a champion for improved air access to Ireland, be it increased capacity on existing routes or the development of new routes.

As I informed the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 453 on 12 March, the contract between the Courts Service and the Public Private Partnership Company (PPPCo) provides for a single monthly unitary charge payment to cover the design, construction, financing and service provision in the Criminal Courts of Justice.  The financial model underpinning the monthly unitary charge formed a central element of the extensive negotiations undertaken by the Service prior to entering into the contract with the PPPCo.  I am further informed that this information is commercially sensitive and its release would have implications for the Courts Service's negotiating position for future public private partnership projects.  As previously stated, the CCJ contract is between the Courts Service and the PPPCo and ongoing amounts paid by the PPPCo to its subcontractor G4S for the provision of services are part of their internal financial and contractual arrangements.  The services provided by the PPPCo through its subcontractor G4S include security, cleaning, maintenance, facilities management, energy and utilities management, health and safety, helpdesk and portering.<\/p><p>  Under the terms of the contract, the PPPCo has to provide the facilities and the services in the Criminal Courts of Justice to a required standard and in accordance with a performance regime as set out in the contract.  Failure to meet these standards or failure to have all or part of the Criminal Courts of Justice available for use during the course of the contract period will result in financial penalties being incurred by the PPPCo.  As the Criminal Courts of Justice will be handed over to the Courts Service in an \"as built\"&rsquo; condition in 2035, the contract provides that the PPPCo is responsible for the ongoing maintenance, including replacement costs for the fabric, contents and equipment in the Criminal Courts of Justice.  In the 2011 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the total expenditure to February 2035 was projected at &euro;625.4 million.  The current annual commitment for the Criminal Courts of Justice base unitary charge is &euro;21.9 million (including VAT).  In 2013, annual indexation provisions increased the unitary charge by approximately &euro;200,000.  In future years, any increases or decreases will depend on the CPI published by the Central Statistics Office on an annual basis.  Therefore, it is not possible to predict this in advance.  However, I understand the projected costs of the project mentioned above assumed an inflation rate of 2% over the period of the project.<\/p><p>  The total amount paid on volume related items, such as jury minding and jury meals, will be based on the usage for these items over the lifetime of the contract.  As a consequence, the Courts Service has informed me that it is not possible to predict in any meaningful manner expenditure to 2035 on such items.  Expenditure will depend on unpredictable factors such as the number and length of jury trials.  In addition, the Courts Service has indicated that it can discontinue the use of the PPPCo for the provision of such services once the contracted notice period is provided.  Expenditure on volume related items in 2012 was &euro;650,000, including VAT.  As I mentioned in my reply of 12 March, there have ongoing operational savings for other criminal justice agencies, including the Irish Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na resulting in more members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being released for front line duties, in addition to considerable savings on lease costs.  Finally, as stated previously, this PPP contract was dealt with in detail by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2008 Annual Report and was also examined by the Committee of Public Accounts in July 2010.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700087#WRAA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":929,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700087#WRAA00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Semi-State Bodies Remuneration","counter":928,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700087#WRAA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":929,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[15406\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700087#WRAA00600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the total cost to the taxpayer of paying the aggregate fees, salaries and any other remuneration to directors of all State bodies, to include majority State owned banks, all public interest directors, all semi-State bodies, all State agencies and so on; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"953","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":930,"content":"<p>The only body under the aegis of my Department is the Army Pensions Board.

They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism. However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing become more of a problem. <\/p><p>  Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission. It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC, or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC. It is my stated aim that this will be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.<\/p><p>  I readily acknowledge that it will not be an easy task, but it is achievable if we all work in a co-operative basis. If action is not taken now, the areas will continue to deteriorate and will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen, we will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, rural economy, bio-diversity and wildlife. While grazing is the only method of managing these lands, the task facing us is how to ensure that these grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.<\/p><p>  In order to ensure that we achieve this objective, as already stated, we need the input of individual shareholders. Grazing plans, at the level of each commonage, will allow for greater flexibility for shareholders and will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons. It will be matter for agreement between the shareholders &ndash; as was always the case &ndash; to decide how best to reach the stocking levels. Professional assistance will be required, in particular where the commonage has been damaged by under-grazing.<\/p><p>  The Grazing Plan will have to cater the traditional farming methods for the area, with provision made for sheep and other animals, such as cattle, providing that they are appropriate to the habitat. An appropriate time-scale will have to be put in place but the Plan should include the incremental steps to achieve GAEC. The whole concept will be output driven, in that the assessment of the Plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC or not or whether the appropriate progress has been achieved.  <\/p><p>  Apart from ensuring that the Grazing Plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including:<\/p><p>- Dormant shareholders &ndash; in the majority of cases, these persons are no longer farming; and<\/p><p>- Current claimants on the commonages, who do not farm or manage the lands.<\/p><p>The issue of whether the latter claimants will continue to be eligible for payment will have to be examined.<\/p><p>  There are other issues that will need to be considered. These include the fact that many commonage habitats have been significantly damaged by under-grazing, with resulting problems that must be addressed including land abandonment, spread of scrub and invasive species.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700088#WRBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":960,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[15629\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700088#WRBB01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the protections available for farmers whose commonages areas are being trespassed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":961,"content":"<p>Decisions affecting privately owned land are a matter for the individual owners or commonage shareholders to resolve with any person, who may be trespassing on their land.

Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.<\/p><p>  Youth Affairs Unit provides funding to the organisation in Co.

This support is provided through the provision of two targeted childcare support programmes - the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme - and the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  These support programmes are available to parents who enrol their children in childcare services which are approved to participate in the programmes.<\/p><p><br \/>  The CCS programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or on low incomes.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, middle and low income working parents may also qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive &#8364;95 per week towards full-day childcare costs.<\/p><p><br \/>  The CETS<b><\/b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services for trainees and students who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC.  Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.  The ECCE programme provides one free  pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Children aged between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September in the relevant year qualify for a maximum of 15 hours per week free pre-school provision over a 38 week period.  This is a universal programme to which all children have access.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2013, the total expenditure by my Department on these three programmes is expected to be in the region &#8364;260 million.  These programmes have been maintained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure and they represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare.  You may also be aware that, as part of Budget 2013, I announced with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, a joint school age childcare initiative which will provide further additional support to both the community and private childcare sector.  This initiative, which represents an annual investment of &#8364;14 million, will provide important support to parents in low income families wishing to take up employment, along with ensuring that quality after-school care is in place to support children's development.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy which is currently being developed by my Department.  This Strategy will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, family support, learning and development and care and education and will identify the structures and policies needed to improve early year's experience in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700089#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":984,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700089#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":985,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[15662\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700089#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the rationale for removing the administration of funding from Youth Work Ireland National Office to the City of Dublin Youth Service Board; the amount of money that this will save in 2013 and subsequent years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":986,"content":"<p>In 2013, &euro;36.358m will be distributed by my Department to 477 youth projects throughout the country.  Up to 2012 the allocations were distributed to the youth projects through 39 administering agencies\/bodies that held funding administration status.  These include VECs, national youth organisations and 11 other bodies including some county councils.  The City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB), a statutory board established in 1942, under the City of Dublin VEC, is one such body.  The CDYSB, on behalf of CDVEC, has for several years, undertaken the administration of over 50 youth projects in the Dublin City area and has developed a strong track record in managing these payments.   <\/p><p>  My Department is seeking to streamline the tasks associated with the financial management of funding for projects to achieve greater transparency and efficiency in the administration of funding.  For these reasons, from January 2013, it was decided to transfer the administration of the allocated funding for some 30 youth projects, involving six national organisations, including Youth Work Ireland, to CDYSB.  The new administration process will be monitored during 2013 for efficiency and effectiveness for the Department and for the projects concerned.

Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person.  The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure.  The inclusion of primary care services in health insurance products is not a statutory requirement, as the primary purpose of current health insurance legislation is to provide cover for hospital treatment within an appropriate regulatory system. <\/p><p>  This Government is committed to a single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance (UHI), which provides equal access based on need, not ability to pay, and which delivers the best health outcomes for everyone.  Under UHI, everyone will be insured for a standard package of curative services comprising primary and hospital care services, including mental health services.  Health insurance will be mandatory, with a system of financial support ensuring affordability by paying or subsidising the cost of insurance premiums for all those who qualify.  The system will be founded on principles of social solidarity, including  financial protection, open enrolment, lifetime cover and community rating. <\/p><p>  The introduction of UHI will see the purchasing of primary and hospital care largely devolved to insurers.  Health insurers will commission care for their members from primary care providers, independent not-for-profit Hospital Trusts and private hospitals.  In doing this, they will have a duty to use their purchasing role to ensure that quality, continuous care is provided at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as close to a person's home as possible.  Furthermore, in line with the fundamental principle of social solidarity, neither insurers nor providers operating within the UHI system will be allowed to sell faster access to services covered by the UHI standard package of care.  While it is envisaged that supplementary insurance may be purchased for items not covered by the standard package, this may not interfere with the fundamental overriding principle of access to care being based on need. <\/p><p>  My Department is currently undertaking detailed work in relation to the preparation of a White Paper on Universal Health Insurance.  This White Paper will provide further detail on the UHI model for Ireland in addition to the estimated costs and financing mechanisms associated with its introduction.  The work involved is both complex and technical and  demands a wide-range of specialised legal and financial expertise.

The Programme is organised at national, regional and local level and includes representatives from the health and education sectors, service providers (both statutory and non-statutory) and parents. These stakeholders are working together to see how current services can be reorganised in line with agreed policy. The HSE has stated that it is is very cognisant of stakeholder's views particularly of parents within this context. It has also worked to ensure that information about the Programme is made widely available.<\/p><p>  The Executive is working very closely with the education sector, which is fully involved in the development of the Programme, to ensure that, from the children&rsquo;s and parents&rsquo; perspective, the services provided by each sector in so far as possible areintegrated. Detailed Local Area action plans are being implemented with the following objectives:<\/p><p> - One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need,<\/p><p> - Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families, and<\/p><p> - Health and Education working together to support children to achieve their potential.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the reconfiguration of existing therapy resources is to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide health supports and ongoing therapy to all children (0-18 years) in line with their prioritised needs.  In particular, it will mean that all children, regardless of where they receive their education services will have equitable access to services based on their needs.  Decisions in relation to the local reorganisation of services will be made by Local Implementation Groups, which include representatives of all the service providers in the local area, parents and the education sector. They have a complex task which includes agreeing the principles which should underpin all disability services, mapping of existing services and gaps, consideration of the changes needed in structures and a detailed plan of how to advance.  This plan will include issues of timing and the phasing of proposed changes.

Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government.  <i>Reach Out <\/i>our National Strategy for Action on suicide Prevention makes a number of recommendations in relation to fast track referrals to community-based mental health services, effective response to deliberate self harm, training, stigma reduction, etc.  Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has developed a range of initiatives to support people who are suicidal and also supporting their families, friends and peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is not accurate to state that suicidal thinking in females will be legitimised by the State by legislation.  As the Deputy will know, last December the Government approved the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the <i>A, B and C v. Ireland<\/i> case by way of legislation with regulations, within the parameters of Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the <i>X<\/i> case.  It also agreed to make appropriate amendments to the criminal law in this area.  The aim of the Bill is solely to regulate access to lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution as interpreted in the <i>X <\/i>case.<\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputy is aware, Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution was inserted by the Eighth Amendment in 1983 and is as follows:<blockquote>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.<\/blockquote>In <i>Attorney General v. X<\/i>, the Supreme Court considered the meaning of the Eighth Amendment in the circumstances that arose in the case.  The case concerned a girl of 14 years of age and the threat to her life was from suicide.  The Supreme Court analysed and interpreted the text of Article 40.3.3 and decided that the Constitution permitted abortion in certain limited and particular circumstances, namely, where there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman, which could only be removed by terminating the pregnancy.

The NOSP through regional suicide prevention services offer Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) and SafeTALK to a variety of community gatekeepers who are working with and supporting vulnerable groups including asylum seekers.  The NOSP has additional training programmes focused on self harm which can be delivered to community members.<\/p><p><br \/>  The primary care and mental health services are available to all members of Irish society.  The aim of the HSE is to build the capacity and knowledge of staff working in frontline statutory and non-statutory services to meet the specific needs of all diverse groups in Irish society.  All the frontline services from the voluntary sector funded by the NOSP including Samaritans, Pieta House, and Console should be available to asylum seekers and their families who may be in need of support or information.  In addition the NOSP funds, My Mind which is a community-based not for profit organisation, voluntary service provider that specialises in providing psychological support services at a community level through counsellors and psychologists who speak 15 different languages.  The NOSP has been able to access this service for asylum seekers looking for support or in suicidal crisis.  The NOSP has also produced a number of information resources in several languages in order to support different communities to look after their mental health.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, the Director of the NOSP welcomes a dialogue with the representatives from any group in Irish society that has evidence that members of their community may be at risk of suicide or self harm.

In addition NOSP publishes an Annual Report outlining its activities and work each year so it is fully accountable.

I have no plans to establish  an organisation such as the Road Safety Authority, however, the Department of Health is currently in discussions with the NOSP to agree a strategy for suicide prevention in 2013 having regard to the increased funding available this year and the concerns around suicide generally.  Priority initiatives will include the further development of existing National Mental Health Awareness campaigns to promote help seeking; increased training for GPs and practice staff; the training of acute hospital staff on suicide and self harm intervention; the development of the SCAN (Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse) model which allows for crisis interventions at primary care and continued investment in voluntary agencies providing frontline services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700092#WRFF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1082,"content":"<p>Question No. 313 answered with Question No. 15.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":1084,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700092#WRFF01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driving Licence Issues","counter":1083,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700092#WRFF01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1084,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[15377\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013032700092#WRFF01100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his views on the risk to jobs posed by changes to driving licences and the subsequent impact on retail photographic ID providers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1085,"content":"<p>The Government decided in 2011 to centralise driver licence provision, following an examination of the options for driver licensing which found that a centralised system would offer enhanced security and consistency, and be more efficient and cost-effective.<\/p><p>  The Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012 provides for the RSA to become the central driver licensing authority in Ireland.\u00a0 This came into effect on 12 January 2013.<\/p><p>  The new system involves three outsourced elements, a card production facility, a front office for engaging with the customer, and a back office to process applications.\u00a0 All three are overseen by a &lsquo;specialist unit' based in the RSA headquarters.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The card licence is standardised across the European Union and therefore there must be consistency in the quality and standard of information used.\u00a0 The photograph is digital and is not stuck on to the card in the way it was on the old paper licence.\u00a0 The capture of the photograph is included in the fee for the licence.\u00a0 As the system develops, the SAFE2 ID standard will be implemented, at which point the only option will be the digital photo taken at the Front Office Network.

From a regulatory perspective my Department aims to ensure that there are no legal or regulatory impediments to the introduction of air services by negotiating bilateral air services agreements with third countries where necessary.\u00a0\u00a0The market for air services in and out of Ireland is highly competitive with a very significant number of airlines operating.<\/p><p>  Tourism Ireland, the agency with responsibility for the overseas promotion of Ireland as a tourist destination, continues to invest in cooperative marketing activity with airlines.  Additional capacity has been secured between Ireland and the US and current indications are that transatlantic capacity for summer 2013 will be higher than summer 2012, with up to 133 departures per week, providing just over 31,000 seats in each direction. This represents a 26.6% increase in capacity, or just over 6,500 additional seats per week, compared to summer 2012. Furthermore\u00a0 additional connectivity\u00a0 direct \u00a0from \u00a0Dublin has been achieved through Emirates&rsquo; hub in Dubai which \u00a0provides \u00a0greater ease of access to Ireland from Australia as well as the emerging tourism markets in the Middle East and Asia. <\/p><p>  I will\u00a0continue to act as a champion for improved air access to Ireland, be it increased capacity on existing routes or the development of new routes.

The overall target is to attract at least 325,000 extra overseas visits to Ireland in 2013. Tourism Ireland continues to mount a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering to people overseas that feel linked by family, friends or otherwise with Ireland.
