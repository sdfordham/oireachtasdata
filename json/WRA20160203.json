This whole of Government effort has been integrated into the Action Plan for Jobs process which aims to strengthen the enterprise base, support entrepreneurship and start-ups, regain Ireland&rsquo;s lost competitiveness and ensure the potential of the regions for development and job creation through Action Plan for Jobs-Regional is fully realised, supported by competitive regional funds.<\/p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs complements the Government&rsquo;s new Pathways to Work which sets out actions to be taken in support of those that are currently unemployed in order to help them access the labour market and new job opportunities.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s strategy is working. Since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched in Q1 2012, 135,800 more people are at work. Action Plan for Jobs 2016, the fifth Plan, was launched in mid-January and marks the transition from an economy recovering from the most severe recession to a competitive, innovative, highly productive economy providing sustainable full employment for its people. It also marks the transition to the implementation of key Government policies that plan for medium term growth. <i>Enterprise 2025 <\/i>is our ten year jobs and enterprise strategy, which sets out the roadmap to build a sustainable economy and have 2.18 million people at work by 2020, the highest in the history of the State. <\/p><p><i>Enterprise 2025<\/i>was launched in November 2015. It sets out the potential to reach 2.180 million in employment and an overall unemployment rate of 6 percent by 2020. <i>Enterprise 2025<\/i>envisages an additional 266,000 people in employment by 2020 starting from a 2014 baseline. Achieving this ambition is based on the premise of export led growth and the additional indirect jobs stimulated by the activities of exporting enterprises in the wider economy. Annualised targets have not been set out in the strategy for job creation or specifically for reducing long-term unemployment.<\/p><p>The ambition is predicated on taking the actions set out in Enterprise 2025 which are focused on supporting the productive sector, enhancing our relative competitiveness, leveraging existing comparative advantage in key sectors, addressing structural issues in the economy, improving productivity and the capacity of enterprises to innovate. <i>Enterprise 2025<\/i>is complemented by the Pathways to Work (PtW) strategy 2016-2020 that that reflects a shift in focus from &lsquo;activation in a time of recession&rsquo; to &lsquo;activation in a time of recovery and growth&rsquo;.  PtW involves maintaining a priority focus on addressing the young and long term unemployed and also aims to increase labour market participation and employment progression of people who are not currently active in the labour market. <\/p><p>In addition, the Action Plan for Jobs sets out a more detailed annualised programme of action aimed at achieving the 2020 ambition and is subject to ongoing monitoring in term of delivery of actions and resulting impact. <\/p><p>Regional Action Plans for each of the eight regions in Ireland have been developed through a collaborative process, and launched over recent months. They aim to realise employment growth throughout the country, leveraging the assets and potential of each and every region in Ireland.<\/p><p>Through coordinated action across Government and strong alignment across relevant strategies we have ensured a commitment and strong focus on job creation, on reducing unemployment and on realising our ambition for sustainable growth over the coming decade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300005#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300005#WRB00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Payments","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300005#WRB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[4489\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300005#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason for the delay in a person (details supplied) in County Cork receiving a grant under the area aid scheme; when the application will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>My Department received a 2015 Private Contract Clause application from the person named seeking the transfer of land and entitlements by lease as transferor.

In particular, the latest CSO  figures show a notable decrease of 47.4% in the number of murders recorded as well as reductions in other important crime categories such as robbery and weapons offences which were down 9.1% and 7.3% respectively.<\/p><p>The Government is tackling crime in all areas of the country by investing heavily in policing resources.  In particular, the Capital Plan 2016 - 2021 makes provision for the ongoing delivery of new Garda vehicles, as well as very significant investment in new technology and information systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, amounting to an investment of &euro;205m over the life of the Plan. In addition, the Government has ended the moratorium on Garda recruitment and Budget 2016 made provision for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; this year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; who will have been recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014.<\/p><p>  Early operational feedback from the Garda authorities indicates that the investments in policing are paying off.

Operation Thor provides for intensive overt and covert patrols and maximises all available operational resources to prevent crime, disrupt criminal activity and apprehend criminals  .<\/p><p>While the deployment of Garda resources in particular locations is a matter for local Garda management in the first instance, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Tallaght Garda District is policed by regular uniformed units, community policing units as well as District Detective and District Drug Units.

Areas of concern include cyber bullying, accessing illegal or inappropriate content, and the dangers of posting content online. <\/p><p>The Action Plan On Bullying, which was published in January 2013, clearly recognised the necessity to tackle the issue of bullying in a holistic way which saw schools as pivotal, but placed the issue within a much wider social context. Cyberbullying is just one aspect of bullying but one, given the rapid expansion of access to technology by young people, that has come much more sharply into focus. The implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying, which is being led by the Department of Education and Skills, provides the framework for the Government&rsquo;s absolute commitment to working with a broad base of interests to protect children and ensure a safer childhood.<\/p><p>The <i>Children First<\/i>National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children is also an important resource in the identification, investigation, assessment, reporting, treatment and management of child abuse, including bullying.

The &lsquo;Web Safety in Youth Work&rsquo; resource, available on the National Youth Council&rsquo;s website, provides valuable advice to young people on reporting online behaviour and on passing on concerns about the protection and welfare of a child or young person.<\/p><p>In relation to illegal content and the posting of personal content online, the important role of parents in talking to their children and providing a space for them to explore issues and voice their concerns cannot be over-emphasised. Parents also have an important function in setting boundaries and implementing parental controls to ensure that their children are not accessing age-inappropriate material.<\/p><p>The Office for Internet Safety is an Executive Office of the Department of Justice and Equality and was established by the Government to take a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children. As part of its work it holds an annual Safer Internet Day. This year&rsquo;s Safer Internet Day will be held on 9<sup>th<\/sup>February and the focus of the day is to highlight the issues around explicit self-generated images of minors being posted on the Internet, and how any image or video posted on the Internet immediately ceases to be private.<\/p><p>The Office for Internet Safety supports the Hotline.ie service, which provides an anonymous facility for Internet Users to report suspected illegal content, particularly Child Sexual Abuse Material, accidentally encountered online, in a secure and confidential way. In addition to Hotline.ie, there are a number of other websites such as Childline, webwise, Facebook and Twitter, that have the capacity to facilitate anyone to report a concern that they have come across online. <\/p><p>The second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the ratification of United Nations Treaties and I am answering on the basis that he is referring to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the United Nations Second Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. My Department has a co-ordinating responsibility for implementation of the Convention and its related Protocols. <\/p><p>The ratification of the Protocol is pending, to ensure that all arrangements are in place to fully comply with the related obligations. The substantive criminal law elements of the Optional Protocol have largely been implemented by the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.<\/p><p>On 23<sup>rd<\/sup>September 2015 the Minister for Justice and Equality published the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill.

It includes wide-ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children and vulnerable persons from sexual abuse and exploitation. These provisions include new measures to protect children from online predators. <\/p><p>When enacted, the Bill will comply with the criminal law provisions of a number of international legal instruments including the UN Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.

Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant's means exceed the prescribed threshold.  Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility, known as the Keane Report, recommended that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card and that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility.  Nonetheless, it is clear that there are people &ndash; including children - with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the Keane Report, the Clinical Advisory Group on medical card eligibility was established by the HSE to develop a framework for assessment and measurement of the burden of disease and appropriate operational guidelines for the medical card scheme.

It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in the first year of secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil and Cervarix).  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and over 100,000 girls have received this vaccine since its introduction.<\/p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use.  The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make it quite clear that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review, in which the HPRA participated, found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.<\/p>  <p>  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300006#WRC02600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Abroad Scheme","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300006#WRC02700"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[4557\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300006#WRC02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"why a person (details supplied) was denied scheduled surgery under the treatment abroad scheme while on the public waiting list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"995","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":144,"content":"<p>I am advised by the HSE Treatment Abroad Scheme office that this patient was approved via a specific mechanism authorised to address the waiting list for spinal surgery in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital.

The current roster was established in May 2013 for a period of five years.<\/p>  <p>  In 2013, two assessors external to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with a knowledge of election processes and experience of public service, undertook the independent appraisal and scoring of applications for inclusion in the new roster against the four criteria.  These were:  experience of election observation; knowledge of human rights and \/or governance issues; language skills; and experience of challenging environments.  In the cases where the assessors declared a potential conflict of interest and recused themselves from the assessment of the application in question, two officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade jointly scored the applications in place of the assessor.  The assessors were paid fees of &euro;200 per day, over ten days in total, in accordance with the relevant Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular,  E12\/1\/70.<\/p>  <p>  Following the appraisal of all 263 eligible applications, the 200 individuals who achieved the highest scores were selected to serve on the new election observation roster.  A reserve panel of the next ten highest scoring individuals was also established, from which replacements would be drawn should any members leave the roster.  Since its formation, ten members have left the roster with four replacements appointed to date from the reserve panel.  The process of appointing additional replacements is currently underway.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland actively participates in the European Commission and European External Action Service - led European Observation network, which brings together election observation focal points from all EU Member States, together with Norway, Switzerland and Canada.  The network facilitates the exchange of information and international best practice on all aspects of election rosters, and helps to ensure that the operation of national rosters conforms to the highest standards.  At the most recent meeting of the focal points, last month, the EU confirmed that Ireland continues to be have a high success rate in having its nominees placed on EU Missions.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that all applicants have been treated fairly and impartially and all unsuccessful applicants were invited to request feedback on their applications. Furthermore, the independent review process which was established has facilitated two applicant reviews.  In both cases, the reviewer judged that the scoring of both applications was fair and impartial across all four published criteria.  In light of these considerations, no legal opinion has been sought on the selection process.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the current roster is well equipped to deal with the requirements of the EU.

The regulations will be reviewed this year and the potential role of certification will be considered as part of the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300007#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Expenditure","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300007#WRD03200"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[4503\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300007#WRD03300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has reviewed the offer of &euro;2 billion from the Irish League of Credit Unions to facilitate the building of social housing; the status of the process to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1193","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":202,"content":"<p>I and my colleague, Minister Alan Kelly, met with the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) on 1 December 2015 to discuss a submission containing a proposal setting out a means by which funding could be provided to Approved Housing Bodies, by credit unions, for the development of social housing.

The Litter Pollution Acts, 1997 to 2009, provide the statutory framework to combat the litter problem. Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering is, in the first instance, a matter for local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for each local authority to determine the most appropriate course of action to tackle litter pollution locally, within the legislation provided, including the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean- up actions in relation to litter, taking account of its own local circumstances and priorities.   <\/p>  <p>  Penalties available under the Litter Pollution Acts for litter offences range from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction, and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment. The fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences. A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the Court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution. The latest figures available from my Department&rsquo;s National Litter Pollution Monitoring System, a system designed to monitor the extent, severity and composition of litter nationally, demonstrate that the litter situation is continuing to improve across the country.<\/p>  <p>  However, I believe that there is no room for complacency. Accordingly, as the Minister with responsibility for this area, I encourage a multifaceted approach to tackling the litter problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education. As such, through the Environment Fund, my Department supports several anti-litter initiatives to combat litter across the country,   including: <\/p>  <p>-  The National Spring Clean,<\/p>  <p>-  The Green Schools Program,<\/p>  <p>-  Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL) - Litter League,<\/p>  <p>-  Tidy Towns,<\/p>  <p>-  The Local Authority Anti-Litter &amp;amp; Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme, and<\/p>  <p>-  Negotiated Agreement with the Banking and Chewing Gum industries.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Anti-Litter and Anti-Graffiti Awareness Grant Scheme (ALAGS), which my Department has co-funded for local authorities since 1997, local authorities are responsible for selecting suitable projects for funding and deciding on individual grant allocations.   The scheme requires that projects selected should promote greater public awareness and education in relation to litter, including the issue of dog fouling, and since 2008, graffiti.  Under ALAGS, they should also, where possible, focus on voluntary initiatives by community and environmental groups and involve schools and young people in anti-litter and anti-graffiti action. Typically, eligible projects include local media campaigns, clean-ups, primary\/secondary school competitions, exhibitions and the production of videos, posters and leaflets. The maximum grant for a project may be up to 70% of the cost, with the balance being met by local contributions. A total of &euro;690,000 was made available to fund suitable projects under the scheme in 2015 and I have already made provision for   similar funding in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, due to specific issues in the South Dublin and Wicklow uplands, my Department has provided support for the Protecting Urban and Rural Environments (PURE) project in that area. I made funding of &euro;90,000 available for the PURE initiative in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that raising awareness of the litter problem, particularly through demonstrating by our own actions a more responsible attitude to littering, is pivotal   to educating our young people in order to effect a change in society&rsquo;s attitudes towards litter disposal in future generations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300007#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300007#WRD04800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":215,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300007#WRD04700"},{"type":"question","counter":216,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[4484\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016020300007#WRD04800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the date for the roll-out of high speed broadband for the Hermitage, Glanmire, County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":217,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.

In addition, my Department also published:<\/p><p>-  the National Intervention Strategy &ndash; updated in December 2015, which takes account of responses to the public consultation which took place in July 2015 and subsequent expert analysis; and<\/p><p>-  the High Speed Broadband Map 2020 which follows ongoing engagement with industry and public consultation. <\/p><p>The Intervention strategy sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30mbps download and 6mbps upload. It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with consumer demand. It is therefore a matter for bidders to select the technology which will show how they propose to meet these contractual requirements.<\/p><p>Given the quality of the services we wish to see delivered, and based on the current absence of significant fibre networks in many parts of Ireland, it is likely that fibre will play a major role in any proposed solution.
