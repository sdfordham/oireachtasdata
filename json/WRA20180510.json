The Defence Forces will continue to develop appropriate work-life balance initiatives to assist personnel whilst ensuring that defence capability is maintained. A range of initiatives has been introduced by the Defence Forces to assist with work-life balance.

The senior official is leading the Department&rsquo;s input to deliberations within the framework established across Government and is supported in their role by a number of branches in the Department. The senior official represents the Department on the Interdepartmental Group on EU-UK Affairs which is chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and is engaged with the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit. In addition, the Management Board is acting as a clearing house for Brexit and maintains oversight on an ongoing basis. <\/p>  <p>  In respect of the border, the potential implications in this regard will emerge during the course of the negotiations. It is this Government&rsquo;s stated goal to try to ensure that the current on-island border arrangements are maintained to the greatest extent possible. Responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate. Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners on request. The Defence Forces at all times keep operational plans under constant review and there will continue to be ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including through regular coordination and liaison meetings. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, together with the Naval Service and the Air Corps are working closely with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA), who are the competent authority on this matter, in relation to Brexit. Ongoing liaison with the European Fisheries Control Agency and with other Member States, will continue as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government Task Force (GTF) on Emergency Planning has been briefed on potential emergency planning implications\/issues that may arise from Brexit.  The GTF will continue to monitor any future impacts on emergency planning that may arise as the Brexit negotiations unfold.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is under no illusions about the complexity of these negotiations.

The cost of the presence of Defence Forces performing aid to civil power duties with regard to United States of America military aircraft landing at Shannon airport in 2018 is &euro;59,162.24 for 82 deployments. The costs relate to security duty allowance paid to members of the Defence Forces, rations and fuel.  The cost of ATCP operations are met entirely from the Defence Vote.<\/p>  <p>  For security reasons it would not be appropriate to disclose the details regarding the number of personnel assigned to each deployment.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there is ongoing and close liaison between both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces, and between my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality regarding security matters generally, including the Defence Forces ATCP roles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000047#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":70,"content":"<p>Question No. 32 answered with Question No. 25.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel Data","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000047#WRB01600"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[20211\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000047#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the steps that have been taken or are being taken to address the difficulties in both recruiting and maintaining members of the Defence Forces, including the reintroduction of the service commitment scheme, in view of the loss of trained specialist Defence Forces personnel to the private sector and the restoration of the security duty allowance payable for weekend duties to 2010 levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[20212\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000047#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the steps that have been taken to address difficulties regarding recruitment to the Defence Forces in respect of the Public Service Pay Commission report published in May 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[20426\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000047#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of personnel who have exited the Defence Forces, excluding mandatory retirements, to date in 2018; the overall number he anticipates for 2018, excluding mandatory retirements; his views on the fact that the current pay and conditions of the Defences Forces are forcing personnel to consider employment in other areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[20413\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000047#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of Defence Forces personnel who have left in each of the years 2000 to 2017 and to date 2018; the average length of the service; if an analysis has taken place to address the problems of retention; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[20428\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000047#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of personnel serving in the Permanent Defence Forces to date; the projected enlistment by the end of 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 37 and 44 to 46, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces have a higher level of turnover than other areas of the public service and this is a feature of military organisations internationally.<\/p><p>Rates of pay and conditions of employment in the Permanent Defence Force have traditionally been set by, amongst other things, reference to levels of pay across the various sectors of the Irish public service. Defence Forces' pay is increasing in accordance with public sector pay agreements. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for further increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement with the focus of the agreement once again being on the lower paid. The first 1% increase in annualised salaries due from 1 January 2018 has been paid to members of the Permanent Defence Force.  <\/p><p>In 2017, under my direction, the Department of Defence raised recruitment and retention issues as part of the submission to the Public Service Pay Commission. The Department of Defence brought the issue of certain specialists, including Air Corps pilots, to the attention of the Public Service Pay Commission in 2017. This matter is referenced in paragraph 6.29 of the Commission's report of May 2017. In a further acknowledgement of these issues the Government tasked the Public Service Pay Commission with examining these challenges in the Defence Sector in more detail. <\/p><p>The Public Service Pay Commission has commenced this work and has requested detailed information from the Department of Defence. My Department has forwarded an initial tranche of information to the Deaprtment of Public Expenditure and Reform. Further data and information in relation to the Defence sector will be forwarded in the coming weeks as the collation of data and information is completed. The Public Service Pay Commission is due to complete this work in the second half of 2018. The findings and proposals arising will be considered at that time.<\/p><p>There is also an ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Organisation, of which part is aimed at ensuring that there is an appropriate work-life balance. The Chief of Staff is actively addressing certain matters in the Defence Forces to this end. I have also initiated a number of initiatives ranging from a review of the C&amp;amp;A scheme, a review of the criteria governing contracts for enlisted personnel and a comprehensive skills gap analysis across the Defence Forces. I am also bringing forward measures to allow former members of the Defence Forces with specialist skills, to re-enter the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>There are significant recruitment opportunities currently available in the Defence Forces, at both enlisted and officer level, for eligible individuals who wishes to have a rewarding and positive career in service to the State.<\/p><p>A General Service Recruitment campaign and the 2018 Officer Cadetships competition both closed last month and the applications are being progressed. A competition for Air Corps Apprentices is currently open. The Naval Service is currently recruiting Direct Entry Officers for Bridge Watch-keeping, Marine Engineering and Electrical Engineering roles. The Defence Forces are also accepting applications from qualified doctors for careers in the Medical Corps.<\/p><p>The measures I have set out address a range of factors and are aimed at ensuring that the Defence Forces remains a career of choice, and to ensuring that the Defence Forces retain the capabilities to undertake the roles assigned by Government.<\/p><p>In the context of discussions surrounding the proposals for Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (Haddington Road Agreement), the Defence sector was required to deliver savings of &euro;10m per annum by 2015. This was to be achieved through the reduction in certain military allowances and the elimination of some other military allowances. As part of the agreement negotiated between civil and military management and the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, the Saturday and Sunday rates for Security Duty and related allowances were flat-rated, i.e. the standard Monday to Friday rate was to be payable for such duties carried out on a Saturday or a Sunday. Both PDFORRA and RACO have submitted claims for the restoration of the rates through the Conciliation &amp;amp; Arbitration (C&amp;amp;A) Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the C&amp;amp;A Scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time.<\/p><p>The following table, provided by the Military Authorities, shows the average length of years of service, by rank.<table><tr><th><div>Year<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;02<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;03<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;04<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;05<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;06<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;07<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;08<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;09<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;10<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;11<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;12<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;13<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;14<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;15<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;16<\/div><\/th><th><div>&lsquo;17<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Private 3*<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Corporal<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sergeant<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CQMS<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CS<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>37<\/td><td>38<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>34<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BQMS<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>41<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sgt Major<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>38<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>37<\/td><td>41<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>38<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>43<\/td><td>41<\/td><td>41<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lieutenant<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Captain<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Commandant<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>34<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>31<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lt.

The visit afforded an opportunity to see at first hand the tremendous work done overseas by the Irish Defence Forces in the Middle East and also by An Garda S&iacute;ochan&aacute; in Cyprus. It was a privilege to spend time with Irish forces serving abroad on our national feast day.<\/p>  <p>  The itinerary for the visit to Israel, from 14th to 15th March included meetings with the Israeli Head of Political Military Bureau Mr. Zohar Palti, in the Israeli Defence Ministry.  We discussed the current political situation in the region.  I also received briefings from the Deputy Chief of Staff of UNTSO, Colonel Tommi Paterri Kajanmaa,  the Chief of Staff of UNDOF, Colonel Mick Dawson from Ireland and the UNDOF Head of Mission and Force Commander, Major General Francis Vib-Sanziri.

In the course of my short stay, I visited the UNFICYP HQ in the UN-controlled buffer zone and received a detailed briefing from Ms. Elizabeth Spehar, Special Representative of the Secretary General in Cyprus. I also met with members of An Garda S&iacute;ochan&aacute; who are currently serving with UNFICYP and was briefed on the important liaison role being played by the Irish personnel.  The visit also afforded me an opportunity to meet with the newly appointed Cypriot Minister for Defence,  Mr. Savvas Angellides. My visit to Cyprus concluded with an address delivered at the Irish Embassy St Patrick&rsquo;s Day reception which was attended by political, diplomatic, business and community contacts and members of the Irish community.  From Cyprus I travelled to Lebanon.<\/p>  <p>  On 17 March I met with Defence Forces personnel serving as part of a joint Irish\/Finnish battalion with UNIFIL in south Lebanon.  I presented medals to personnel serving with the 111th Infantry Battalion in UNIFIL.  I received briefings on the current situation in the region and visited the Headquarters, United Nations Post 6-52 and United Nations Post 2-45 where Irish personnel are based.  I also spoke at a Gala Dinner event in Beirut to celebrate St. Patricks day.<\/p>  <p>  The following day there was a wreath laying ceremony at the Tibnin monument in honour of the 47 Irish personnel who lost their lives while serving in Lebanon. The structure is a permanent reflection of the Irish Defence Forces contribution and the sacrifice made by them to Tibnin and its people.<\/p>  <p>  On 19th March, I attended a UN ceremony in Naqoura to mark the 40th anniversary of the establishment of UNIFIL.  It was an occasion to pay tribute to the tens of thousands of UN Peacekeepers, who have served together with local communities for peace in South Lebanon.  The ceremony included a poignant and emotional tribute to fallen peacekeepers.  It was a great honour to be present while a veteran Irish Peacekeeper delivered the tribute at the ceremony.  Ex-Private John O'Mahony was injured and lost two of his colleagues - Private Derek Smallhorne and Private Thomas Barrett - in April 1980.  During the course of the visit, I had the honour to lay a wreath alongside Pte O'Mahony, at the location of the murders of Private Derek Smallhorne and Private Thomas Barrett.<\/p>  <p>  On the 20th March, I also met with the Lebanese Minister for National Defence for political consultations in relation to the security situation in Lebanon given the significant challenges in the region as a whole.  In the course of my meeting with him, I also impressed on him the concerns of the Irish Government in relation to the ongoing trial of Mahmoud Bazzi, the alleged perpetrator of the murders of Private Derek Smallhorne and Private Thomas Barrett and the attempted murder of Private O'Mahony.  Before my meeting, the Minister for National Defence honoured Privates Smallhorne and Barrett with military honours and the laying of a wreath at the Lebanese Army Martyrs Statue at the Ministry of Defence.  I also met the Commander in Chief of the Lebanese Armed Forces.  In the course of the visit I also had a meeting with our legal adviser and other contacts in relation to the Mahmoud Bazzi case.<\/p>  <p>  A comprehensive range of issues in relation to peacekeeping was discussed with Mission Leaders and political leaders in the host countries during the visit.

The commitments in the notification are political in nature and effect.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Athena, as the Deputy is aware, this is the mechanism which administers the financing of common costs of EU operations having military or defence implications, on behalf of EU Member States contributing to the financing of EU military operations. These costs can include transport, infrastructure, and medical services, as well as the Nation Borne Costs, such as lodging and fuel.<\/p>  <p>  The rules on contributions to Athena are set out in article 41.2 of the Treaty on the European Union. Member States contribute an annual share based on their Gross National Income. Therefore if common costs rise or our GNI key increases, then our contribution will rise accordingly. <\/p>  <p>  A Report from the Parliament titled 'The next MFF: Preparing the Parliament&rsquo;s position on the MFF post-2020' which may be the report the Deputy is referring to, does not reference that 2% of GDP be allocated to defence spending.  However, on 8 November 2016, the European Parliament passed a resolution on the European Defence Union where it was suggested that MS should devote 2% of GDP to defence.  Such suggestions have no implications for Defence spending in Ireland which, as I stated above, is a national competency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000047#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Army Barracks Closures","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000047#WRB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[20423\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000047#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he will report on the planned future use of Columb Barracks, Mullingar.","asker":"1250","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":92,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, since the closure of Columb Barracks in 2012, my Department has explored a number of avenues to try and secure its long term future for the benefit of the local community.

In relation to collective bargaining, the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) Representative Associations participated in the negotiations last year on the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, which were held under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. The PDF Representative Associations were afforded parity of esteem with public sector trade unions and representative associations during the negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  Both PDFORRA and RACO accepted the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 which provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement, with the focus on the lower paid. <\/p>  <p>  The Government welcomes the conclusion of the European Committee of Social Rights that the prohibition on the right to strike for members of the Defence Forces is not a violation of the European Social Charter. <\/p>  <p>  It is critically important that the Defence Forces can undertake operations, when required.

Variations in strength figures are not an unusual occurrence and, particularly in the short term, are influenced by factors relating to timings of recruit intake and how this coincides with normal retirement patterns. <\/p>  <p>  Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a relatively high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel. This is not new and the Permanent Defence Force has always had a level of turnover that far exceeds other areas of the public service. <\/p>  <p>  An analysis of data going back a number of years shows the overall numbers departing the Permanent Defence Force in recent years are broadly consistent with the long term trend, with some exceptions. It should be noted that within these figures, on average approximately 22% of General Service recruits do not complete their induction training.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence recognises that continuous recruitment is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces; providing young, motivated and enthusiastic personnel to replenish military formations for operational deployments. To achieve this there is significant on-going targeted recruitment to ensure that the Permanent Defence Force can deliver all operational outputs required by government both at home and overseas.  The recruitment plan proposed by the Defence Forces envisages 800 new entrants being inducted across all services and competition streams in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  I also continue to be aware of factors that can influence the retention of existing member of the Defence Forces and I remain dedicated to ensuring that the terms and conditions of service, while remaining appropriate to the needs of the organisation, are as favourable as they can be. <\/p>  <p>  The pay of the Defence Forces is increasing in accordance with public sector pay agreements. The pay of a newly qualified 3 star Private has increased by 25% in the last twelve months and at &euro;27,257 is very favourable when compared to entry rates across the public service. The starting rates for newly qualified Officers is &euro;35,000 and for new graduate Officers is in excess of &euro;40,000. These amounts are inclusive of Military Service Allowance. This compares favourably to the average starting pay for graduates across other sectors of employment. <\/p>  <p>  As I have previously outlined, there are shortages of certain specialists in the Defence Forces. These include pilots, engineers and certain technicians. As the Deputy will be aware, under my direction, the Department brought the issue of recruitment and retention of specialists to the attention of the Public Service Pay Commission.  My Department has forwarded an initial tranche of information to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Further data and information in relation to the Defence sector will be forwarded to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the coming weeks as the collation of data and information is completed.  <\/p>  <p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, the Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000047#WRB04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":100,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 44 to 46, inclusive, answered with Question No. 33.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Meetings","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000047#WRB04600"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[20415\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000047#WRB04700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he will report on the recent informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>The Defence Ministerial Informal Ministerial was held in Sofia on the 4th and 5th of May. The meeting was hosted by Bulgaria who currently hold the Presidency of the EU. <\/p>  <p>  There were two working sessions over the course of the meeting which was chaired by the High Representative, Ms Federica Mogherini.  The two sessions dealt with a range of ongoing developments in relation to EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP); specifically aspects of PESCO and a discussion of Perspectives on Crisis Management. <\/p>  <p>  The PESCO session involved a discussion on the implementation of PESCO and the governance rules for PESCO projects.  It was clear at this session that the focus should and will be on positive outcomes for the people of Europe. The work ahead to implement PESCO focuses on two critical success factors. The first is the fulfilment by the participating Member States of the more binding commitments. This will be achieved through annual National Implementation Plans, underpinned by a credible assessment process. The second success factor is the quality and delivery of PESCO projects, both capability-related and operational. <\/p>  <p>  The discussion on crisis management reflected on the current security challenges and the role of the EU in support of international peace and security. This session was attended by UN Under Secretary General for Peacekeeping and the NATO Deputy Secretary General. This facilitated a reflection on operational cooperation and mutual support between the EU, the UN and NATO both at the strategic level and also on the ground where operations from each may be deployed in the same theatre of operations.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the process under way to review the long-standing and important UN-EU Strategic Partnership on Peacekeeping and Crisis Management. I look forward to close engagement with my Ministerial colleagues in this space.

It is only used in limited circumstances where there is a strong justification because it can cause difficulties for the efficient and effective management of the public finances. Furthermore, it also exposes specific expenditure dependent solely on a hypothecated revenue to any volatility associated with the revenue source in question. The Department of Finance is generally opposed to the hypothecation of revenue funds as it reduces the flexibility of the Government to prioritise and allocate funds as necessary at a particular time. Taxation and expenditure decisions should be driven by their overall effectiveness in line with sound and sustainable budgetary principles. Accordingly, ring-fencing revenues may constrain expenditure decisions and can distort the allocation of resources resulting in reduced value for money. It is often argued that hypothecation may increase public support for new or existing taxes though linking the tax or charge to a specific objective and by ring-fencing the revenues that arise from the charge for a number of specific purposes. However, the tax base can be volatile and\/or erode over time - particularly in the case of health or environmental taxes designed to prompt behavioural change.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless there are a number of instances where an approach of this nature has been adopted. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible within the format of a single PQ reply to list all previous taxes or levies in tax history that have been ring-fenced for a specific purpose.

This charge is collected by the Revenue Commissioners and used to fund the Social Insurance Fund which is administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which pays for various social welfare benefits and pensions. 0.8% of certain employer PRSI contributions goes to the National Training Fund, another separate fund that is available to the Department of Education for higher education and further education and training.<\/p>  <p>  - Section 157 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended,\u00a0provides for the Minister for Finance to pay from the Central Fund into the Local Government Fund (&lsquo;LGF&rsquo;) an amount equivalent to the local property tax paid into the Central Fund during the financial years 2014 to 2017.\u00a0 Following the enactment of the Water Services Act 2017, the Revenue Commissioners are now required to pay directly into the LGF an amount equivalent to the local property tax received by them, commencing with the year 2018. These accounting mechanisms are not strictly a form of hypothecation, as while the legislation specifies where the LPT funds are to be transferred, local authorities retain discretion as to how their LPT allocation is spent. The only exception to this applies to those local authorities that receive a greater level of LPT funding than was previously allocated in the form of general purpose grants. Those authorities, of which there are nine, are required to use a portion of their LPT funding to self-fund certain housing and roads programmes in lieu of exchequer funding.<\/p>  <p>  - The community rated private health insurance system is underpinned by the Risk Equalisation Scheme. The Scheme involves a community rating levy collected as a stamp duty by the Revenue Commissioners from insurers in respect of all health policies written. All of the monies collected are paid over to the Risk Equalisation Fund administered by the independent regulator - the Health Insurance Authority. The Authority then redistributes the fund back to the market through credits payable to insurers in respect of insured lives to offset some of the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy members. The Scheme is Exchequer neutral, neither a cost nor a benefit to the State.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;168 million of the Tobacco Products Tax has been paid as an Appropriation-in-Aid to the Department of Health since Budget 1999.<\/p>  <p>  - Motor Tax was paid into the Local Government Fund (this was the case up until end 2017, motor tax is now brought to account in the Exchequer).<\/p>  <p>  - Section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 provided that the Horse and Greyhound Fund would each year be financed by an amount equal to the revenue from excise duty on off-course betting in the preceding year or the year 2000 funding levels increased by reference to the Consumer Price Index, whichever was greater. This formula applied for the years 2001-2008. However since 2009, the level by which the Fund is to be increased has been decided by the Minister for Agriculture.<\/p>  <p>- The Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) was established under the Insurance Act 1964, as amended, in order to provide a certain minimum level of protection for policyholders particularly where an insurer goes into liquidation. In essence the ICF is a consumer protection mechanism which is also found in Member States across the EU and elsewhere. The ICF is currently maintained and administered under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the Accountant of the Courts of Justice. The ICF is funded by a levy on non-life insurance policies. There are some exclusions to this such as health and marine insurance policies. The current ICF levy has been in place since it was re-introduced on January 1st 2012 and was put in place because of the insolvent nature of Quinn Insurance and the need to protect the policyholders of the company. Prior to its re-introduction, the levy was applied once before, between 1984 and 1993, to meet the liabilities of an insolvent insurer following the collapse of PMPA. On the 4th November 2011 the Central Bank of Ireland published a levy notice requiring non-life insurance companies to pay a 2% levy on insurance premiums in respect of new business and renewals with an inception date on or after 1st  January 2012. This notice remains in force until amended by a further notice. The 2% levy is calculated as a percentage determined by the Bank based on the aggregate of the gross premiums\u00a0paid to insurers in respect of policies issued in relation to risks in the State.\u00a0The current ICF levy generates in the region of &euro;70 million per year. To date, the Exchequer has advanced in excess of &euro;1 billion to the ICF on which a commercial rate of interest is applied.\u00a0 Until all advances outstanding from the Exchequer to the ICF are fully repaid, continued financial support for the ICF in the form of a levy\u00a0will be required.<\/p>  <p>  - Lighthouse dues are collected by Revenue (&euro;6m in 2017) and sent to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p>  <p>  - For the environmental levy on plastic bags &ndash; provided for under Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment legislation &ndash; Revenue collected &euro;7m in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000049#WRD01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Knowledge Development Box","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000049#WRD01250"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[20613\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000049#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of SMEs that have applied for and been successful, respectively, in their applications under the knowledge development box; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>There are a number of features in the Knowledge Development Box (&ldquo;KDB&rdquo;) which are specifically included to encourage claims by SMEs.

Parts or accessories are also liable to VAT at the standard rate. There is no provision under existing VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced rate or zero rate to the supply of such products.

Not does it include staffing implications for schools outside of mainstream teachers (e.g. special needs, administrative support etc.).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000050#WRE04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000050#WRE04700"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[20704\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000050#WRE04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the budgetary projection within his Department due to demographic change for the years 2018 to 2028.","asker":"1280","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>An analysis of demographic cost pressures from 2017 to 2027 is set out in the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service staff paper &lsquo;Budgetary Impact of Changing Demographics 2017 &ndash; 2027&rsquo; published in September 2016 by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.\u00a0 This paper is available at: <i><i><\/i><\/i><\/p><p>This paper is based on figures from Census 2016 and focuses on the areas of education, health and social protection expenditure, which are particularly affected by the changing age profile of the population.\u00a0<\/p><p>An allocation to cover certain demographic costs pressures is included in my Department's pre-budgetary expenditure ceilings from 2018 to 2020\u00a0in the\u00a0following amounts:<\/p><p>2018 - &euro;57m<\/p><p>2019 - &euro;49m<\/p><p>2020 - &euro;58m <\/p><p>These allocations cover the costs associated with providing for increased numbers of teachers and capitation, arising from increased student numbers in schools, as well as provision for demographics in higher education.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000050#WRE04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Training Provision","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000050#WRE05000"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[20709\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000050#WRE05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the details of the announcement he made on 3 October 2017 in relation to the entry requirements into primary teacher training programmes; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this can disadvantage students who sat the leaving certificate in 2017 and are now on undergraduate degree courses in the four teacher training colleges in view of the fact that they will have to resit some leaving certificate examinations in order to apply for a master's degree in three years time; if the case of a student (details supplied) which has brought to the attention of his Department will be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy. The background to this case is that in October 2017, I announced changes to the minimum entry requirements into primary teacher training programmes, as follows:<\/p>  <p>  Entry 2018 - Irish: H5, English: H7\/O5, Maths: H7\/O6<\/p>  <p>  Entry 2019 and entry\u00a02020 - Irish: H4, English: H7\/O4, Maths: H7\/O4<\/p>  <p>  The changes that\u00a0I\u00a0introduced\u00a0took account of advice to me provided by the Teaching Council, which had engaged in a consultation process around a number of matters relating to entry to initial teacher education. Many of the issues identified were complex and the Council commissioned the ESRI (Economic and Social Research Institute) to carry out research to inform its deliberation. <\/p>  <p>  Having relatively high minimum entry requirements (MERs) in core subject areas of Irish, English and Mathematics are one of the key policy levers that help ensure quality teaching and learning in primary schools.\u00a0 The 2011 Literacy and Numeracy Strategy and subsequent review identified the need to raise standards of achievement and included decisions to raise the entry requirements in the core subjects over time. <\/p>  <p>  Students with a wide variety of backgrounds and studies apply for the\u00a0Professional Masters in Education (PME) which is a consecutive qualification for primary teaching undertaken by students who already hold an undergraduate degree. While some undergraduate courses may have more direct relevance to education than others, there is no course provided by any college that is recognised by the Department or the Teaching Council as being a necessary or natural precursor to taking on the PME. <\/p>  <p>  In determining the revised\u00a0entry requirements, care was taken not to disadvantage those students who have already commenced the senior cycle and who intend sitting the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2018.\u00a0 Accordingly, I decided that the minimum entry grades for primary Initial Teacher Education programmes should be increased for 2019 rather than from 2018. However, to have applied this criterion to undergraduate students who might wish to apply for the PME at some time in the future would mean\u00a0deferring the changes for four years or more. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of graduates who do not meet the entry requirement in Irish, English or Math, it is open to the person to repeat the Leaving Certificate Examination\u00a0or pursue a course of study leading to the one of the alternative qualifications\u00a0in the subject(s) concerned\u00a0outlined in the published Entry Requirements and Procedures for 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000050#WRE05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000050#WRE05300"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[20711\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000050#WRE05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the timeframe for the opening date of a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1332","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":297,"content":"<p>The building\u00a0to which the Deputy refers had been scheduled to open in September 2018.\u00a0 However, a slight delay has been occasioned due to a High Court challenge to planning permission for elements of the project.\u00a0 This was unforeseen given that the building was well under construction before the legal challenge was taken.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The project is devolved for delivery to the local authority and my Department is working with\u00a0that agency to ensure that the project is completed in the shortest timeframe possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000050#WRE05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Data Protection Regulation","counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000050#WRE05600"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[20753\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000050#WRE05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the support his Department is providing to schools to deal with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Bill 2018.","asker":"1225","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>My Department is considering how best to provide support to schools taking into account the views and assessment of the relevant school management bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000050#WRE05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000051#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[20770\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000051#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the funding available through his Department for a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":304,"content":"<p>I understand from the details supplied by the Deputy that the property in question belongs to the parish.

There are also\u00a014 Garda Reserves and\u00a036 Garda civilian staff attached to the\u00a0Donegal\u00a0Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed\u00a0Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. 32\u00a0members of this cohort have been assigned to the Donegal Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Donegal Division.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that the\u00a0allocation of resources is been kept under constant review in line with operational and security demands including any possible policing requirements post Brexit.<\/p><p>I am further advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is acutely aware of the ongoing complex negotiations regarding Brexit and is committed to ensuring the organisation is prepared for all possible outcomes and any possible policing implications and challenges arising. I understand that a high level team composed of managers from across the organisation has been established by the Commissioner and that scoping exercises in anticipation of Brexit have been conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>My Department is engaged on an ongoing basis with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the deep and detailed work being undertaken right across Government and the public sector in response to the UK decision to leave the EU.\u00a0 Furthermore, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is represented at a senior level in the ongoing discussions between my Department and the UK Home Office in relation to the operation of the Common Travel Area. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that there is close and ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing, with a particular focus on combatting security threats and cross-border crime. The Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, who are responsible for operational policing cooperation, have repeatedly emphasised the scope and the value of the close and high quality cooperation between the two police services in combating crime, protecting community safety and saving lives. The two police services operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island. <\/p><p>I would also point to the Annual Cross Border Conference on Organised Crime and the Biennial Cross Border Organised Crime Threat Assessment, jointly produced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\u00a0 The conference provides the opportunity to assess and address changing trends in crime, and to build upon and enhance the operational actions already being undertaken.\u00a0 The Threat Assessment provides an insight into organised criminal activity on both sides of the border together with an assessment of the cross border nature of such criminality.\u00a0 All of this serves to inform operational strategies and resource allocation decisions. <\/p><p>I am confident that this cooperation will continue post Brexit and I and my officials are in regular contact with counterparts in the UK and with the EU Commission to ensure that crime and security cooperation along the border is not undermined by Brexit.\u00a0 In its approach to the Brexit negotiations, the Government has ensured that a very high priority has been given to protecting the gains of the Peace Process and the avoidance of a hard border - nationally and by our partner Member States and by the EU Commission.<\/p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out below in tabular form the number of Garda&iacute;, as provided by the Commissioner, assigned to\u00a0the Donegal Division\u00a0as\u00a0of 31 December 2014 - 2017 and the 31 March 2018.<table><tr><th>DONEGAL DIVISION GARDA STRENGTH 2014 &ndash; 31 March 2018*<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>2015<\/td><td>2016<\/td><td>2017<\/td><td>2018*<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>397<\/td><td>392<\/td><td>382<\/td><td>386<\/td><td>388<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000051#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[20538\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000051#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of sergeants and inspectors in the Dublin North Garda division; the locations of the stations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly. <\/p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that on the 31 March 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 13,667. There are also 567 Garda Reserves and more than 2,270 civilians attached to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the\u00a0year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.\u00a0 I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.\u00a0 To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division. <\/p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the following table the Garda stations to which new recruits have been allocated to from 2016 to date in 2018\u00a0as advised by the Commissioner.\u00a0<\/p><p>Probationer Garda Allocations by Division and Station  2016 - 2018<table><tr><th>DIVISION<\/th><th>STATION\u00a0<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

This applies for example in relation to staffing requirements across the sector. The Programme for Government commits to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement and provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. In July 2016 the Government agreed overall vision for the Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In relation to the Department, there is a formal workforce planning exercise every three years to identify the number of staff and the skills required to deliver the Department's strategy. The workforce plan is reviewed on an annual basis to ensure emerging issues are incorporated.\u00a0 Staff demographics are considered within the workforce plan to inform effective succession planning.<\/p>  <p>  The recently published National Development Plan provides for capital allocations for the Justice sector from 2018 to 2022 and the main areas of capital investment for the sector in the period to 2027 are outlined in the Plan. \u00a0It also recognises that increased population growth in the next ten years as envisaged under the National Planning Framework will also create new demands in terms of the current accommodation stock across the sector including in relation to policing , prisons and courts.

Indeed it must be emphasised that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity and the OPAP clearly acknowledges this. <\/p><p>The policy prescribed 'Ten Steps Forward' that would be taken to prevent overweight and obesity. A new Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group was established in October 2017.  The current position with implementing these is as follows:<\/p><p>1.  <i>Embed multi-sectoral actions on obesity prevention with the support of government departments and public sector agencies<\/i><\/p><p>An Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) has been established under the Chair of the Department of Health. It is comprised of representatives from the following Departments and Agencies: Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Department of Children and Youth Affairs; Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; Department of Education and Skills; Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government; University College Cork; the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; the Health Service Executive (HSE) - including the National Clinical Lead for Obesity; and Safefood.  The OPIOG held its inaugural meeting on the 19th of October last with further meetings arranged at agreed intervals for the purposes of providing oversight to the implementation of the national Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP).  The OPIOG will identify processes for engaging with networks of stakeholders.  It will elaborate on this aspect of its functions over the course of its work to implement the OPAP that runs up to 2025.<\/p><p>The OPAP recommended that proposals be developed relating to the rollout of evidence based fiscal measures, including a levy on sugar-sweetened drinks, in support of healthy eating.  As the Deputy is aware the Sugar-Sweetened Drinks Tax commenced on the 1st of May.  It represents a positive step in our national policy to deal with the problem of obesity.  Consideration of any other relevant and similar fiscal measures - including the type of research referred to by the Deputy or relevant agricultural policies of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine - can take place within the context of the work of the OPIOG.<\/p><p><i>2.  Regulate for a healthier environment<\/i><\/p><p>The development of legislation for calorie posting to support people to make healthy choices is underway by the Department of Health. Currently, a behaviour study on how best to make the posting of calories meaningful to customers and more likely to impact on their behaviours is being carried out by the ESRI. In addition, actions in this area are being progressed through engagement with other Government Departments to support the work of stakeholders involved in planning and developing the built environment. The question of establishing a sub-group of the OPIOG for the built environment will be kept under review by the group; but in the meantime the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is represented on the OPIOG.  In line with Actions 31 and 59 of the National Physical Activity Plan, which commit to developing guidelines and support materials for those working in developing the built environment in order to promote the importance of physical activity (31), and to develop a programme of on-going stakeholder communication and engagement to ensure delivery of the Plan (59), it is intended to hold a Stakeholder Forum in 2018.  The planned Forum will focus on the theme of the Built Environment.<\/p><p><i>3.  Secure appropriate support from the commercial sector to play its part in obesity prevention<\/i><\/p><p>At its inaugural meeting, the OPIOG agreed to establish two sub-groups for Reformulation and Healthy Eating.  Further sub-groups will be established as required. Both sub-groups have already met and agreed their Terms of Reference.<\/p><p>The Reformulation sub-group will be technical in its work programme. The work of the sub-group will primarily set targets on reformulation of food and drink.  It will include work feeding into a methodology for measuring the efficacy of the Sugar Sweetened Drinks Tax. It will also make recommendations on addressing reduction of portion sizes and on monitoring and validation procedures.<\/p><p>One of the priority actions under Step 3 of the OPAP was to &lsquo;Establish a forum for meaningful engagement with industry on best practice initiatives towards a healthy food environment&rsquo;.  It is intended to progress this action under the auspices of the OPIOG in 2018.<\/p><p>A code of practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship has also been developed involving representatives from the food industry, advertising sector, statutory agencies, and various Government Departments.  It was chaired by the former CEO of the statutory Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The Codes of Practice concerned were published in February.<\/p><p>4.  <i>Implement a strategic and sustained communications strategy that empowers individuals, communities and service providers to become obesity aware and equipped to change, with a particular focus on families with children in the early years<\/i><\/p><p>A new child obesity campaign from <i>safe<\/i>food and the HSE was recently launched. It's called the START campaign and it aims to inspire, empower and support parents to start building and persist with healthy lifestyle habits in the family to prevent childhood obesity.  The first phase of the campaign advertising features on TV, radio, video on demand, outdoor and digital platforms.  The next phase of the campaign was launched in April.<\/p><p>5.  <i>The Department of Health, through Healthy Ireland, will provide leadership, engage and co-ordinate multi-sectoral action and implement best practice in the governance of the Obesity Policy and Action Plan <\/i><\/p><p>As referred to at step 1 above, the establishment of an Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group is well advanced. New Healthy Eating Guidelines, Food Pyramid and supporting resources have already been published, disseminated and communicated in 2017, including dissemination of the new Guidelines to all primary and post-primary schools. <\/p><p>Work has also commenced on developing Healthy Eating Guidelines for the 1-5 year old age group.  As a first step in this work, the Scientific Committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) is currently developing scientific recommendations for food based dietary guidelines for 1 to 5 year olds.<\/p><p>New Nutrition Standards for schools, with an initial focus on school meal programmes funded by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, have also been developed.  These Nutrition Standards were published in September 2017.  The Nutrition Standards were developed by the Department of Health with the assistance of <i>safe<\/i>food and the Health Service Executive, in cooperation with the members of the School Meals Programme in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills.  And it is in the context of further discussions with both of these departments that the question of extending the Nutrition Standards to more schools will arise.<\/p><p>6.  <i>Mobilise the health services to better prevent and address overweight and obesity through effective community-based health promotion programmes, training and skills development and through enhanced systems for detection and referrals of overweight and obese patients at primary care level<\/i><\/p><p>A Healthy Eating, Active Living Programme has been established as a Policy Priority Programme within the HSE and a three-year plan for the programme has been finalised.  The GP contract for the provision of free care to children under 6 years, already provides that the medical practitioner shall take an active approach toward promoting health and preventing disease through the provision of periodic assessments to child patients. <\/p><p>The HSE is also implementing a Breastfeeding Action Plan and a new Making Every Contact Count brief intervention framework which aims to capitalise on the opportunities that occur every day within the health service to support people to make healthy lifestyle choices.<\/p><p>7.  <i>Develop a service model for specialist care for children and adults<\/i><\/p><p>Professor Donal O&rsquo;Shea was recently appointed the National Clinical Lead for Obesity.  This appointment will be important in further advancing the implementation of many of the recommendations in the OPAP including the development of a national integrated service model for the health and social care of overweight and obese people and for developing quality assurance guidance for obesity services. <\/p><p>8.  <i>Acknowledge the key role of physical activity in the prevention of overweight and obesity <\/i><\/p><p>'Get Ireland Active! The National Physical Activity Plan for Ireland' (NPAP) is one of the key developments arising from Healthy Ireland, and implementation of that Plan is well underway in collaboration with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a range of other stakeholders.  <\/p><p>9.  <i>Allocate resources according to need, in particular to those population groups most in need of support in the prevention and management of obesity, with particular emphasis on families and children during the first 1,000 days of life<\/i><\/p><p>The implementation of the Healthy Eating and Active Living Plan within the HSE will begin to address this action area, with a particular focus on supporting parents and families.<\/p><p>10.  <i>Develop a multi-annual research programme that is closely allied to policy actions, invest in surveillance and evaluate progress on an annual basis<\/i><\/p><p>The establishment of the national oversight structure referred to earlier will foster developments under this step of the OPAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000054#WRJ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":483,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000054#WRJ03900"},{"type":"question","counter":484,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[20580\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000054#WRJ04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount spent by his Department and the HSE on campaigns and educating persons to change lifestyle as a preventive measure against chronic disease relating to tobacco in tabular form; the amount spent on Tobacco Free Ireland; the amount spent on promoted social media advertisements and content by amount spent per campaign and social media platform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":485,"content":"<p>Tobacco Free Ireland addresses a range of tobacco control issues and initiatives and contains over 60 recommendations.\u00a0 The recommendations include a variety of measures, for example, legislation, awareness, taxation, enforcement and smoking cessation.\u00a0 Many of these measures specifically seek to prevent our young people from starting to smoke which is one of the key priorities of the policy.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As the Health Service Executive ('HSE') delivers cessation services and has responsibility for tobacco control media campaigns I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy on these questions.

The proposal is to utilise Section 12 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 to formalise a new model for collaborative working between Government departments and to place it on a statutory footing.

There is agreement that participating Departments will cover the costs of their own seconded staff and that Departments will be allowed to backfill seconded posts, subject to DPER approval.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.<\/p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.<\/p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.<\/p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. In the case of a negative decision, the treating clinician can appeal the decision. <\/p>  <p>  As of 1 May 2018, there have been 6,250 online applications from clinicians requesting the reimbursement of\u00a0lidocaine patches for a patient. Of these applications, 1,451 patients (over 23%) have been approved. Of 807 online appeals, over 70% of patients have been approved for reimbursement. The MMP has sought further information on another 71 appeals. Accordingly, since 1 September 2017, 2,019 patients have been approved for reimbursement of lidocaine plasters, based on the clinical case made by their GP or consultant.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE notified prescribers and pharmacies of the introduction of the new system in August 2017. This advice was re-issued recently, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website at\u00a0www.hse.ie\/yourmedicines.<\/p>  <p>  This reimbursement decision is a matter for the HSE.

The programmes are implemented by Bord Bia and overseen by my Department.<\/p><p>Table: EU Promotion programmes currently run by Bord Bia are as follows:  <b><\/b><table><tr><th>Title<\/th><th>Target markets<\/th><th>Duration<\/th><th>Total budget<\/th><th>EU   % Contribution<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&ldquo;European   Lamb &ndash; tasty, easy, fun&rdquo;<\/td><td>Ireland, UK, France, Belgium, Germany, Denmark<\/td><td>3 years<br \/><br \/>28\/01\/2015 &ndash; 27\/01\/2018<\/td><td>&euro;6,451,464m <\/td><td>50%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&ldquo;Potatoes   &ndash; more than a bit on the side&rdquo;<\/td><td>Ireland, UK<\/td><td>3 years<br \/><br \/>13\/07\/2015 &ndash; 12\/07\/2018<\/td><td>&euro;4,600,000m<\/td><td>50%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&ldquo;European   Beef and Lamb &ndash; Excellence in Food Safety &amp;amp; Sustainability&rdquo;<\/td><td>China, Japan, Hong Kong<\/td><td>3 years<br \/><br \/>01\/02\/2017 &ndash; 31\/01\/2020<\/td><td>&euro;3.7m<\/td><td>80%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mushrooms Complement Everything<\/td><td>UK, Ireland<\/td><td>3 Years<br \/><br \/>01\/02\/2018 -31\/01\/2021<\/td><td>&euro;2.025m<\/td><td>70%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sheepmeat<\/td><td>Ireland, UK, France, Germany<\/td><td>3 years <br \/><br \/>January 2018 -2021<\/td><td>&euro;10.56m<\/td><td>70%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000056#WRL04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Applications","counter":599,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000056#WRL05000"},{"type":"question","counter":600,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[20511\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000056#WRL05100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of an appeal by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":601,"content":"<p>An application under the 2017 Flood Damage Relief Measure was received in this office on 28\/09\/2017 from the representative of the estate of the above named herd.<\/p><p>An official from my department has\u00a0been in\u00a0direct contact with the\u00a0representative and requested further documentation pertaining to the administration of the\u00a0estate.\u00a0 Upon receipt of this\u00a0documentation\u00a0the case will be reviewed further and a decision made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000056#WRL05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"TAMS Payments","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000056#WRL05300"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[20536\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000056#WRL05400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the issues regarding TAMS payments under the dairy equipment scheme will be resolved as promised in view of the fact the penalties being imposed are grossly unfair; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>To date over 1,100 payments valued at over &euro;14.7m have issued under the Dairy Equipment measure under TAMS II.

It is widely accepted that the system is overly complicated, relying too heavily on the manual transcription of lengthy identification numbers of sheep at various stages of production.<\/p>  <p>  My Department commenced a review of the current NSIS in\u00a02015 when my officials met with the stakeholder representative and outlined the preferred option to improve the system. I also met stakeholders in the context of developing the Sheep Welfare Scheme and sheep EID was discussed in that forum. <\/p>  <p>  The new rules are being introduced requiring all sheep sold from 1 October 2018 onwards to be identified electronically. This timeframe will allow farmers a reasonable period of time to use up stocks of tags on hand. EID will provide a more robust sheep traceability system and will further support the development and sustainability of the sheep industry. This measure will significantly reduce the record keeping requirements for sheep farmers moving sheep to livestock marts, slaughter plants and export assembly centres. There is the potential\u00a0of decreased\u00a0cross compliance issues following the provision of a printed list to producers\u00a0detailing the electronic tag numbers presented\u00a0by them to marts and factories approved as Central Points of Recording (CPRs).<\/p>  <p>  I will be providing a one off support measure of up to a maximum of &euro;50 per keeper for the first purchase of EID tags. Electronic tag readers and associated software are included as eligible investments in the Targeted Agriculture Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) scheme to assist sheep farmers in flock management.\u00a0 The move to full EID and the inclusion of EID readers as an eligible investment in TAMS will make the recording of the movement of lambs off farm much more convenient and will greatly simplify the paperwork involved for sheep farmers.<\/p>  <p>  This enhancement of the current sheep identification system will allow\u00a0the sheep sector to further develop and build on its impressive performance supporting some 35,000 farm families directly in addition to supporting several thousand jobs indirectly in rural area.<\/p>  <p>  The improved traceability system will assist in maintaining existing markets and in securing new international outlets for Irish sheep meat.\u00a0 Ireland has market access for sheep meat to 45 countries at present, compared to our beef access to 65 countries, and exports of dairy products to almost 180 countries. Opening new markets for sheep meat access, including potentially valuable markets such as the USA, Japan and, in due course, China is therefore a key concern, as some of these markets have identified lack of EID as a barrier to access.<\/p>  <p>  The extension of EID to all sheep is a critical requirement to provide the required traceability demands across the market place, serving to protect public and animal health in line with the highest international standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000057#WRM01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Waste Management","counter":630,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000057#WRM02000"},{"type":"question","counter":631,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[20775\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000057#WRM02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of anaerobic digesters producing biogas in operation nationally by county, in tabular form; his plans to increase the uptake of farm waste to convert into biogas; and the steps he is taking to increase the production of biogas from farm waste.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":632,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[20776\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000057#WRM02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his officials have examined the 2017 SEAI report, Assessment of Costs and Benefits of Biogas and Biomethane in Ireland.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":633,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 248 and 249 together.<\/p><p>The agriculture and forest sector has a critical role to play in contributing to our national climate change ambitions, and bioenergy represents a key component of that contribution.<\/p><p>The EU report entitled the &lsquo;Optimal use of biogas from waste streams&rsquo; indicated 31 AD biogas plants for Ireland in 2014.

Regulation 1307\/2013 regarding the number of years a successful applicant under the Young Farmers Scheme (YFS) can receive payment.\u00a0 The relevant amendment is in two parts.\u00a0 The first part of the regulatory amendment provides that YFS applicants may receive payment for five years starting from the first submission of an application for payment, provided that the application takes place within five years of the commencement of farming.\u00a0 This period of five years also applies to farmers who had received payment under the scheme in respect of applications prior to 2018.\u00a0 The second part of the regulatory amendment provides that it is optional for Member States to extend the provision to young farmers who set up a holding in the period 2010-2013, and who had received payment under the YFS in respect of applications before the 2018 scheme year.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has applied the maximum 2% of the national ceiling to create a YFS fund of &euro;24 million annually.\u00a0 Ireland has also utilised the option to overestimate the BPS ceiling in order to take account of unused YFS funds and this funding was used to allocate entitlements to young farmers and new entrants under the 2017 National Reserve. \u00a0Therefore the allocation of &euro;24 million is fully utilised in Ireland.\u00a0 If Ireland opted to implement just the first part of the amended regulatory provision it would result in a windfall gain for some Young Farmers Scheme applicants who had commenced farming between 2010 and 2013 and who have already received payment based on the regulatory provisions applying at the time.\u00a0 It is estimated that the additional cost of implementing just the first part of the regulatory amendment in Ireland would be in excess of &euro;5.5 million in 2018 and &euro;7.5 million in 2019 which would result in a requirement for a linear cut to all farmers&rsquo; basic payments in order to fund this additional spend under the Young Farmers Scheme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is for this reason that Ireland will implement the relevant regulatory amendment in Regulation 2017\/2393 in full.\u00a0 This will provide for a situation where with effect from the 2018 scheme year, successful applicants under the Young Farmers Scheme who commenced farming from 2014 onwards and submit their first YFS application within five years of commencement of farming may receive payment under the YFS for five years.\u00a0 Young Farmers Scheme applicants have been notified of this position in the Terms and Conditions of the 2018 Young Farmers Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000057#WRM05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department

significant step change in how the EU and its Member States approach the Cyber Security of critical infrastructure and key online services. Once fully implemented, Member States will have a formal and binding set of arrangements in place around Critical Infrastructure, adapted to the needs of each State. These arrangements involve the State identifying certain key critical infrastructure operators in sectors like energy, transport, healthcare provision and digital infrastructure, and requiring these operators to meet a set of binding security requirements and to report incidents. The Directive also requires all Member States to apply and police a new unified regulatory regime on Digital Service Providers (DSPs), which include cloud computing providers, search engines providers and providers of online market places.<\/p>  <p>  The Directive also places obligations on the State itself, with a view to ensuring that States can cooperate and share information in the event of a large scale incidents affecting several countries and to ensure that every State has significant capacity of its own. These requirements include the adoption of a national strategy, the designation of a National Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) with responsibility for risk and incident handling and the requirement to designate a National Competent Authority (NCA) for the purposes of the Directive.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, the National Cyber Security Centre in my Department has been working on the transposition for a considerable period of time and will be the National Competent Authority. The unit has identified a set of critical infrastructure operators and in November, published a set of draft security measures to apply to these.

Expenditure for the school meals programme for the last five years is provided in the attached tabular statement. Funding is based on a rate of payment per meal, per child, per day.  The maximum rates of payment and the number of students currently availing of each meal option is also provided in the tabular statement.<\/p><p>The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them. The Deputy will be aware that &lsquo;<i>Nutrition Standards for School Meals<\/i>&rsquo; published in September 2017 under the auspices of Healthy Ireland, is a valuable resource to enable and promote healthy eating and healthy lifestyles in schools. These standards complement and strengthen the healthy eating guidelines that were already in place. The standards were introduced commencing from January 2018 and all schools participating in the school meals scheme are expected to fully comply with these standards from September 2018. <\/p><p>The requirement to implement these nutrition standards is met by the schools and organisations who are responsible for the the delivery model and choice of supplier to be used. The scheme can be delivered in a variety of ways and depends on the needs, capabilities and resources, including infrastructure, of the schools or groups.  Delivery models can range from the provision of full canteen services to the purchase of pre-prepared meals from specialist school meals suppliers or local suppliers. The physical infrastructure in schools is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills. <\/p><p>A number of different agencies have a role in food safety and environmental health services in Ireland. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is the central competent authority with the overall co-ordinating role for food safety.<\/p><p>In terms of assessing or auditing the types of meals provided under the school meals scheme, schools and organisations must reapply for funding in advance of each school year and are required to submit detailed records at the end of each school year.  Expenditure on unhealthy food items is deducted from the funding allocation. In addition, the Department initiated an on-site inspection programme in 2012 to ensure that the scheme rules are being adhered to including an assessment of the type of food provided. My Department recently introduced service level agreements with all participating schools and organisations which sets out the responsibilities of participants.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p><p><b>Table 1: School Meals Scheme Expenditure 2014 &ndash; 2018<\/b><\/p><p><b>Allocation<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>&euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>16.6*<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>38.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>36.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>46.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>54 allocated<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>*Accounting adjustment which did not impact on the service provided in schools<\/b><\/p><p><b>Table 2: Rates of Payment for school meals scheme and number of pupils availing in the 2017\/18 Academic Year <\/b><table><tr><th>Meal <\/th><th>Max Rate of Payment (per child per day) <\/th><th>No. of Pupils<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Breakfast\/Snack<\/td><td>&euro;0.60<\/td><td>163,660  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lunch\/Afterschool<\/td><td>&euro;1.40<\/td><td>152,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dinner<\/td><td>&euro;1.90<\/td><td>22,930<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000058#WRN06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Review","counter":727,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000059#WRO00400"},{"type":"question","counter":728,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[20597\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000059#WRO00500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a comprehensive review of a carer's allowance which was recently withdrawn from a child's (details supplied) parents even though this child has very complex needs will be undertaken; if it will be reinstated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":729,"content":"<p>Carer's allowance (CA) is a means-tested social assistance payment made to a person who is habitually resident in the State and who is providing full-time care and attention to a person who has such a disability that they require that level of care.<\/p><p>It is a condition for receipt of CA that the applicant&rsquo;s means are less than the statutory limit which in this case is &euro;265.10 weekly.<\/p><p>CA was in payment to the person concerned from 2 May 2013 to 9 May 2018.

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The most recent figures for the period January to April 2018 are 29.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.3 weeks for a summary decision.<\/p><p>The appeal processing times for each social welfare payment for the period 1 January to 30 April 2018 are set out in the following table.<\/p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the higher courts and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  <\/p><p>Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p><p>In addition, a number of new appeals officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past year, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.  This changeover in staff led to longer times to conclude appeals in 2017 and this has continued in the first four months of 2018.  However, the Chief Appeals Officer has advised that she is hopeful that processing times will improve over the course of 2018.<\/p><p>Finally, it should be noted that an appellant can claim supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of their appeal and that any favourable decisions are backdated to the original date of the claim. <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Appeal Processing Times by Social Welfare Payment 01 January 2018 - 30 April 2018<\/b><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Summary Decisions<\/th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Oral Hearings<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Blind Pension<\/td><td>15.7<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance<\/td><td>24.1<\/td><td>27.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Benefit<\/td><td>21.1<\/td><td>30.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Child Benefit<\/td><td>35.3<\/td><td>41.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance<\/td><td>19.8<\/td><td>25.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit<\/td><td>30.0<\/td><td>37.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Partial Capacity Benefit<\/td><td>32.2<\/td><td>22.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care Allowance<\/td><td>31.3<\/td><td>38.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>30.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Farm Assist<\/td><td>46.2<\/td><td>42.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Working Family Payment *<\/td><td>29.4<\/td><td>30.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension<\/td><td>25.0<\/td><td>22.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit<\/td><td>25.5<\/td><td>38.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Paternity Benefit<\/td><td>22.9<\/td><td>20.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment<\/td><td>23.4<\/td><td>35.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)<\/td><td>37.3<\/td><td>49.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Contributory)<\/td><td>29.6<\/td><td>38.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit<\/td><td>38.1<\/td><td>44.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension<\/td><td>33.9<\/td><td>28.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Contributory)<\/td><td>30.7<\/td><td>31.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non- Contributory)<\/td><td>10.4<\/td><td>37.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)<\/td><td>31.2<\/td><td>36.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Payments)<\/td><td>24.8<\/td><td>30.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Back to Work Family Dividend<\/td><td>25.5<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Transitional<\/td><td>17.6<\/td><td>27.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pre-Retirement Allowance<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>29.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit<\/td><td>23.4<\/td><td>24.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant  **<\/td><td>23.8<\/td><td>29.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>29.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare Allowance<\/td><td>22.2<\/td><td>25.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension <\/td><td>39.2<\/td><td>15.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s (Non-Contributory) Pension<\/td><td>30.0<\/td><td>23.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widowed Parent Grant<\/td><td>35.8<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><\/table>  * Previously called Family Income Supplement<\/p><p>** Previously called Respite Care Grant<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000059#WRO03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":755,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[20757\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018051000059#WRO03200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the percentage of decisions overturned on appeals for each social welfare payment by written and oral appeals in tabular form;
