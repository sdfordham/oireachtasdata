We have the largest cohort of people <i>per capita<\/i>who suffer from cystic fibrosis, and all the challenges that presents.  We have had some great testimonies from people with cystic fibrosis in terms of how it affects their lives and, in particular, the impact of the latest and very effective medicine, Orkambi, which can have a transformative effect.<\/p><p>I ask the Taoiseach to read an article in the Irish Independent today by Jillian McNulty, who lives with cystic fibrosis.  It is heart-rending, brilliantly written and conveys better than anybody else the impact of the illness and the transformative effect of Orkambi.  She writes:<\/p><blockquote>CF is a lonely, traumatising, unforgiving, frightening illness yet there's one thing that has made a difference to my life... Orkambi...  Before Orkambi I was approximately eight months of the year in hospital, in the last three years I've spent just 12 weeks in hospital.  Incredible.<\/blockquote><p>There was an attempt to denigrate the drug, which we saw in leaks from the HSE and others.  We now know that Orkambi has received the drug discovery of the year award from the British Pharmacological Society and the French Prix Galien award in 2016 for the most promising rare disease medicine.<\/p><p>The manufacturers of rare disease medicines and orphan drugs, as we call them, are challenging for countries all over the world and we need to change how we deal with cystic fibrosis in this country, something for which I have asked on previous occasions.  The bottom line is that the drug has a significant impact on quality of life, the longevity of people living with cystic fibrosis, hospital admissions, lung function and so forth.<\/p><p>There is no doubt about the effectiveness of the drug.  Agreement has been reached in Germany, Austria and the United States so that people with cystic fibrosis in those countries can avail of the medicine.<\/p> <p> There has been engagement with the company for more than a year and this was ramped up in the past month or so.  My understanding is that this has gone through the drugs committee and to the HSE directorate and that the new offer from Vertex to the HSE is far more significant, perhaps, but different from the previous offers in terms of reduced pricing and, more critically, covering future pipeline medications that would cover the cohort of people with cystic fibrosis who have the F508del mutation.  In other words, future and better medications will be part of the deal, there is a long-term dimension to it and it covers Kalydeco as well.<\/p> <p> I have a basic question for the Taoiseach.  People have been patient and Cystic Fibrosis Ireland and its chief executive officer have been very reasonable.  Will the Taoiseach let the House know when we can expect a decision on facilitating the availability of Orkambi to people in this country with CF who would benefit from it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488369900,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The article is well written.  It is one of a series of articles written in recent years about the impact of drugs on the quality of life of cystic fibrosis sufferers.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, met personnel dealing with cystic fibrosis during the week.  Deputy Martin is accurate when he states that Orkambi is a drug that impacts on the quality of life of a patient with cystic fibrosis, but it is not the Minister who determines the value of that quality of life or how it is measured.  In this case, it was done by Professor Barry, who has commented on this issue in the past.  The Minister for Health has had to shift the emphasis to major pharmaceutical companies so that there is an understanding that there is a limit to how far one can go in getting the balance between having that quality of life for cystic fibrosis sufferers and having the taxpayer pay the exorbitant amounts of money being demanded in respect of the drug.<\/p>  <p>  It is true that Vertex has made an offer.  However, the Minister is trying to bring about a situation where we are not going from year to year uncertain about what the future holds for any category of patients.  In this case, it is cystic fibrosis sufferers.  That is why the Minister wants to do a deal with the companies in respect of Orkambi, Kalydeco and any other future drug that may be beneficial to the quality of life of cystic fibrosis sufferers.  He is right in that regard because we do not want a situation where Orkambi, for instance, is being made available to patients at a certain price based on the improvement in their quality of life and find that the situation changes six months or 12 months down the line.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is putting together a future certainty for cystic fibrosis sufferers to deal with a pipeline of drugs, be those drugs Orkambi, Kalydeco or new drugs that come on the scene, which happens every year.  I expect that the Minister will be able to conclude his deliberations inside a couple of weeks and bring about certainty for all the cystic fibrosis patients in the country of whom we have many of them, and more than most other countries.  This will give a certainty to those cystic fibrosis sufferers, whether it is in terms of Orkambi, Kalydeco or new pipeline drugs that may come on the market to treat cystic fibrosis.  It is a good thing to do and the right way to go and I hope that, when it is reached, the decision will provide certainty for those with cystic fibrosis in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100004#B00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1488369900,"counter":9,"content":"<p>That essentially has already been done.

My point all along has been that, given the large number of people in Ireland with cystic fibrosis, we should be at the vanguard of this research and leading the charge on this issue.  A month has passed since the offer was made.  The Taoiseach described it in terms of what the Minister is seeking but it is what is being offered.  Has the HSE directorate made a recommendation to the Government following the offer made more than a month ago?

In respect of cystic fibrosis patients, the article today expresses very clearly the impact on their lives of both Kalydeco and Orkambi.

For weeks we have been listening to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, saying it has nothing to do with him, but the fact is that Bus &Eacute;ireann is fully owned by the Government on behalf of the people of Ireland, with ownership of the company being vested in the Minister.  We have heard that Bus &Eacute;ireann is facing possible insolvency and we know that its staff are standing on the brink of an all-out strike.  Such a strike would make the already perilous financial position of the company even more acute.  This has come about because management reneged on its existing deal with workers.  We hear through the media that even some of the Taoiseach's colleagues are growing tired of the Minister abdicating his responsibility in the matter.  He is a man with a title who will not take on the job he was given.  I have asked repeatedly the Taoiseach to do something about this.  We all know that these issues can be resolved but only through intervention and dialogue.  I have asked the Taoiseach several times to ensure the Minister and the National Transport Authority, NTA, sit down with management and the trade unions in Bus &Eacute;ireann to begin formulating a solution.  Standing back is patently making matters worse and all the more difficult to reach the solution that has to be found.<\/p>  <p>  The situation at Bus &Eacute;ireann is another example of the Government's cack-handed approach to industrial relations.  Nobody is saying a Minister should be involved in every meeting or intervene immediately in every industrial relations dispute.

We now have a Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport who simply will not engage.  Apparently, he is waiting for a solution to fall from the sky.  That will not happen.  Will the Taoiseach direct the Minister to sit down with the NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann and the trade unions before this matter reaches the point of no return and significant damage is done not only to a valuable State company, but also to the hundreds of thousands of people who depend on Bus &Eacute;ireann and other public transport companies to get to work and carry out their lives in a normal fashion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100007#E01300","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488371100,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The Minister, Deputy Ross, gave a full and thorough briefing to the Cabinet yesterday on the situation here.  Clearly, today's media coverage carries a number of the issues that the NTA has come forward with in terms of its analysis of the services currently provided on a number of the routes that are suggested to be changed, with further facilities and access on one of those routes in the west.<\/p>  <p>  It is true that a solution will not drop out of the sky.  The Deputy is absolutely correct, but the Minister, Deputy Ross, has been very strongly in support of a situation where unions and management sit down together at the WRC and work out a solution for the nub of the issue where there is a loss of income to the company on a daily basis.  I think an intervention by the Minister directly is not what is required now.  There is still an opportunity for unions and management to get together.  The Minister has been in touch with the Minister in the Department of Social Protection both in respect of the access and the assessment of the free travel scheme, about which there was a perception that it was going to be taken away, which is not true.  Obviously, the NTA itself has spoken out and guaranteed connectivity for areas in rural Ireland that would be affected by any change in the Expressway service.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to unions and management to use the facility available to them now, with the full support of the Minister and the Government, to work out a solution and an outcome in respect of the issue here.  Nobody wants to see this happen.  Unemployment is down to 6.6%.  Our country is facing a number of challenges both internationally and in respect of Brexit.

The Government is fully supportive of the public service transport entity.  We want to see that continue.  This is an issue that needs to be dealt with and that is the place to deal with it.

It is for Ministers who own the company in the people's interest not to stand back and allow it to collapse.  It is time for an intervention.  If the Minister will not intervene, I will briefly raise the issue of funding.  The Taoiseach will recall that, in the last budget while we were in office, we increased funding for the free travel scheme by &euro;3 million.  In this Government's budget in October, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, failed to provide any increase in funding for the scheme.  An increase would indirectly assist the company.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection will make savings from the point that the Taoiseach just made, namely, the thankfully declining unemployment rate.  Will the Government deploy a modest part of those savings to increase the subvention to the free travel scheme so as to increase it to something like the actual cost of provision?<\/p><p>That would ease the problem somewhat.

The subvention, through the PSO, has been increased.  This year it increased by 11% and last year it was 13%.  Bus &Eacute;ireann itself benefited from a 21% increase in the subvention in 2016.  As Deputy Howlin is aware, that is provided for PSO services only and not for commercial services.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the free travel issue Deputy Howlin mentioned, the Minister, Deputy Ross, has had discussions and has written formally to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar.  They have both instructed their officials to report back very quickly on their examination of the funding levels of that particular scheme.  This is a very short, focused and prioritised piece of work and it is progressing very well.  I understand that as soon as the officials report back, the Ministers expect to have discussions to resolve that particular issue satisfactorily.  As I said yesterday, no amount of ministerial intervention will sort this out without the two sides having direct dialogue and the opportunity to do that lies with the WRC.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to note that the NTA has backed up what it said it would do in terms of assessing the connectivity and the requirements that might arise if the Expressway service is altered in any way.  The PSO funding to Bus &Eacute;ireann has been 24% for the rural transport programme.  It is increasing.  I am pleased the NTA has said we can cover connectivity for those areas that might be so affected.

This year will be different because women all over the world will participate in co-ordinated actions against sexism and for reproductive rights.  For the first time in history there has been a call for a global strike on International Women's Day.  Participants are asked to strike, to either take a day off work or wear black, as I am doing today, and to assemble to demand rights that are being denied.  There will be a huge focus on this country because the strike will centre on the need for repeal of one of the cruelest abortion bans in the world.<\/p><p>Three events will take place next week.  On Monday, the Bus 4 Repeal will travel, providing access to safe medical abortion pills that are banned in this country but are considered essential medicine by the WHO.  On Wednesday, the Strike 4 Repeal will assemble at 12.30 p.m. on O'Connell Bridge and a march for repeal will take place at 5.30 p.m., which is organised by the Coalition to Repeal the Eight Amendment.  The coalition is made up of a huge number of groups, including the National Women's Council and others.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach's failure to hold a referendum to repeal the eight amendment has been raised with him many times.  It does not look like we will get anything different from his two potential replacements because there has been generational change in attitudes on abortion and while there will be generational change in the Fine Gael leadership it does not look like there will be generational change on abortion.  The Taoiseach's two apprentices are old heads on young shoulders.  They are still stuck in the past on this issue and neither of them believe in women's bodily autonomy, which means they are very divorced from the generation they represent.  In Ireland, the movement's hashtag is &quot;We Won't Wait&quot;.  The mantra from Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and now the Independents is that women should just dutifully wait for the Citizens' Assembly to give its verdict but in the real world crisis pregnancies continue.  Does the Taoiseach have advice for a young woman who sent a message to my Facebook page yesterday?<\/p><blockquote>Please help me with advice if u can.  I'm in a really really bad situation.  I can't sleep at night with worry... I've taken so much time off work because all I do is cry... every day...  It's destroying me and I feel so trapped...  I'm at a dead end with this pregnancy.  My partner was so violent and he's completely abandoned me.<\/blockquote><p>What is the Taoiseach's advice to that woman?  Is it to suck it up and wait for the Citizens' Assembly?  Women and young people are not prepared to wait any longer for bishops to pontificate at the Citizens' Assembly, as they will next week.  Young people who will march next week will not be told and tone policed.  Why did it take only two and half years for the so-called pro-life amendment campaign to get a referendum that nobody wanted and that was sectarian and mediaeval but five years after the death of Savita Halappanavar in October 2012, we still do not have a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment?

Many others may have a different point of view.

The Citizens' Assembly is proving itself to be a very conservative talking shop from which anybody with a view is eliminated and is not even discussing the central issue of health as cornerstone and basis for any change on abortion in this country.  It has not even got around to discussing it, which is incredible five years on from the death of Savita Halappanavar.  The other issue about the Citizens' Assembly is that next Monday, a load of people, including bishops, will line up to tell women how they should feel about what is really a personal decision.  International Women's Day will be very different.  It is good that it is returning to the tradition on which it was founded, namely, struggle and working-class and ordinary people demanding their rights.  It is very clear that things are going backwards for women under capitalism.  Look at Donald Trump, etc.  The women who took the contraception train - the Taoiseach was 20 at the time so he should know something about it - were also told that they were being shrill.  They were told to tone it down and that their tactics were deplorable.  Who would say now that they did not make a historic change?

A fair return for primary producers is a central plank of the agricultural policy of Fianna F&aacute;il and is vital to the long-term survival and success of the horticulture, beef, sheep, liquid milk, peak, tillage and poultry sectors.  The Bill proposes to amend consumer law to provide for a food ombudsman and the protection of primary producers in national law.  It also signals how my party is putting forward measures to safeguard the position of farmers in the food chain, in particular as we approach a hard Brexit.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il is committed to protecting and developing agriculture for the 140,000 farming families in Ireland as the main driver of the rural economy and custodians of the Irish countryside.  The agrifood sector is not only Ireland's most important indigenous industry, it also lies at the heart of social and economic life throughout much of our country.  Clear imbalances are undermining its long-term sustainability.  Especially important is the manner in which family farms are finding it increasingly difficult to receive fair prices for their produce.  Action is now required to ensure that producers can earn a decent living as part of a dynamic and innovative sector.  The future of the family farm unit and long-term food security is reliant on producing goods at a profit.  Farmers are currently struggling to make a sustainable income in the face of ongoing price erosion by large multiple retailers.<\/p><p>The proposals in the Bill will give a legislative basis for the first time for an office of national food ombudsman.  The Bill would establish an office of national food ombudsman as part of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, to enable the holder of that office to mediate and investigate disputes between relevant grocery goods undertakings engaged in the retail or wholesale of grocery goods in the State and suppliers of those goods, and provide for related matters.  This will ensure that suppliers that may be subject to any unfair trading practices by retailers or wholesalers would have direct recourse to an independent food ombudsman within the CCPC.<\/p><p>The office holder would retain the power of the CCPC, which would include investigating and resolving disputes relating to the grocery goods and undertaking regulations.  Where the regulations are found to be breached, the ombudsman will be empowered to commence investigations which could result in fines and penalties.  The National Food Ombudsman Bill 2017 will safeguard a fairer future for farmers, ensuring that primary producers' position is strengthened in the food chain with direct recourse to an independent ombudsman.  Fianna F&aacute;il will continue to fight to support our rural communities which are being left behind.  I look forward to introducing the Bill in Private Members' time and encourage Deputies across the floor of the House to support this farmer focused Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100017#P02200","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1488375300,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Is this Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100017#P02300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1488375300,"counter":164,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100017#P02350","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488375300,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1488375300,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100017#P02500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1488375300,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100017#P02600","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488375300,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Sale of Tickets (Sporting and Cultural Events) Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1488375300,"counter":169,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100017#P02800"},{"type":"speech","time":1488375300,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to regulate the selling of tickets for certain sporting and cultural events; and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>The aim of the Bill is to tackle ticket touting while at the same time protecting ordinary customers and charities.  I am introducing the Bill because many people have been enraged by their inability to access tickets for events while seeing the same tickets on sale, often at the same prices or, in many cases, at prices that are multiples of the original ticket price.<\/p><p>The main concern I have in drafting the Bill is to ensure that those who buy tickets with the intention of attending events but who later find themselves unable to attend are protected, while at the same time ensuring that those who purchase tickets for events which they have no intention of attending but who want to resell tickets, often to generate significant profits - basically, ticket touts - are disincentivised and face substantial fines for so doing.  Ticket touting and the secondary sale of tickets for events such as music concerts, sporting or cultural events has been a source of major concern and anger for many people.<\/p><p>People are perplexed as to why tickets for events with are supposedly sold out are for sale, in some cases by companies owned by the primary seller, for multiples of the initial cost.  Clearly, people are very angry about this.  There have been a number of attempts to regulate the resale of tickets over the years, but the problem has not been tackled and continues unabated.  If enacted, the Bill will have the potential to make the resale of tickets unprofitable, which would, therefore, have a major impact on the problem and make most ticket touting pointless.<\/p><p>The Bill will deal with designated events where 300 or more tickets would be sold and how they would be regulated.<\/p><p>It will ensure that ordinary people who need to resell their tickets for genuine reasons will be facilitated but that those seeking to sell tickets at hugely exorbitant prices will have the profits from those sales eradicated, making their efforts pointless.  Taking the profit away from secondary ticket sellers and ticket touts is the only way to address this problem.  Therefore, the Bill will ensure that those who engage in the shameful business of ticket touting face fines of up to &euro;5,000.  The Bill will allow secondary sales of tickets to a maximum of 110% of the initial value of the ticket and it will also have a specific exemption for regulated charities.  The Bill will also ensure that the relevant Minister consults with venue operators and ticket sellers to ensure that a voluntary code regarding ticket refunds to consumers is established.<\/p> <p> That is the outline of the Bill.

We are proposing the Bill because there are 500,000 people living in this country who are not citizens.  These people live and work in our communities and their children go to our schools.  They pay taxes to the State and are affected by all of the national decisions taken in this House, yet most are not permitted to vote in elections to the national Parliament, which sets the taxes that they pay, the laws that they must live by and the policies around key issues such as employment rights, wage rates, education, health and housing.<\/p><p>The 2016 census data on nationality is not due to be published until later this year so I will refer to the 2011 figures.  According to the 2011 census, almost 12% of the State's population is made up of people who are not citizens of the State.  These people are not represented although their representation would be the equivalent of 18 Deputies.  Most shocking, 26.4% of 25 year olds to 44 year olds are not citizens of this country, which means that one in four of people in that age bracket do not have full voting rights.  This is the age group that is most affected by the issues such as those that I mentioned, including workers' rights, housing and the eighth amendment.  Some 9.5% of our population does not have a vote in D&aacute;il elections.  For me in Dublin West, in particular, this has huge resonance because the constituency I represent is probably the most diverse in the country.  According to the 2011 census, almost 23% of those living in my constituency were not born in the country, 18% of its population is made up of people who are not citizens and 16% of Africans and 9.3% of Asians in the State live in Fingal.  We have a hugely diverse population.  All of these people are living and working here long term and many are in relationships and are married, etc.  Every time I canvass during an election or referendum campaign in Dublin West, it is evident that whole areas, such as Ongar and Tyrrelstown, are effectively disenfranchised.  I have campaigned on many policies in Dublin West including the repeal the eighth and marriage equality campaigns.  People are affected by those issues but they do not have a vote.  Brexit will also have repercussions because it will remove the right of British citizens who live here to vote in European elections.  Our Bill would retain that right.  <\/p><p>It is often asked why people do not get citizenship or become naturalised so that they can vote.  There are a couple of issues with it and the first is the cost involved.  It is very expensive.  For example, it costs Europeans who live here more than &euro;1,100 to get citizenship just to vote.  Further, people should have the right to keep their citizenship and, in my view, should not have to take on another citizenship to vote.  We do not expect Irish people to become British citizens in order to vote there.  There is another real problem that has not been tackled.  Those who become citizens do not know that they must upgrade their entitlement to vote from an entitlement to vote in local elections to an entitlement to vote in D&aacute;il and European elections.  Therefore, they often do not do it and there seems to be no effort on the part of local or State authorities to ensure that they know how to do it.  This means that these people are effectively being disenfranchised.<\/p><p>I am mindful that our Bill would not give people a right to vote in referendums, as this would require a constitutional change, but it should be considered.  If we can point to countries that allow this such as New Zealand, where people who are resident there for a year are allowed to participate fully and to have full voting rights.  We should do the same because we have a huge problem.  When we look around the Chamber, we see that we have a very white, male and older representation.

I have moved two of those on Second Stage during Private Members' time but both of them were rejected by the Taoiseach and his party.  At some point in the future, I hope to move that this Bill be read a Second Time during Private Members' time and, for the sake of workers, I hope that it will be third time lucky and that the Taoiseach will support it.<\/p><p>We have lots of tea and sympathy for workers when they find themselves in difficult circumstances.  On 12 June 2015, the 130-strong workforce of Clerys was sacked without notice and another 330 workers employed by the store's concession outlets were locked out of their jobs and left facing an equally uncertain future.  At the time, those workers received an awful lot of tea and sympathy from the Taoiseach's side of the House and from the Taoiseach himself, but what they need is legislative solutions.  We need to ensure that the type of tactical insolvency that we saw in Clerys does not happen again, which is what this Bill seeks to do.  Clerys was bought by Natrium some time between midnight and 1.15 a.m. on that day and was declared insolvent that afternoon.  The workers did not receive the statutory redundancy lump sum from the new owners and nor were they paid moneys owed <i>in lieu<\/i>of redundancy and holiday pay.  In fact, many of them found out through social media that their jobs had been lost rather than hearing it from the company.  The State was obliged to pay those debts under the insolvency payment scheme.  A company that made tens of millions of euro was away on its toes and the workers and the State were left high and dry.<\/p><p>The problem, of course, was that none of this was illegal, but we can introduce legislation to prevent a similar situation happening again.  It is our responsibility in this House to do just that and it is the Taoiseach's responsibility to ensure that there are sufficient protections in place to ensure that workers are not left high and dry.  The Clerys workers were effectively locked out and the manner in which they were treated was appalling and unacceptable, which the Taoiseach has acknowledged.  These people have families and dependants as well as mortgages, loans and bills to pay like everyone else.  The Taoiseach is aware that we have been here before with Waterford Crystal, TalkTalk, La Senza, Lagan Brick and Vita Cortex.  In many cases, workers have been frustrated, locked out of their jobs and denied their basic rights and redundancy entitlements.  Public outrage ensued and the leaders of all the main parties in government and in opposition as well as Independents condemned the closures and stated that something needed to be done.<\/p><p>What has happened since?  What legislation has the Government proposed in this area?  The answer is &quot;None&quot;.  The then Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation commissioned a report into the closing of Clerys.<\/p><p>The report was written by Ms Nessa Cahill, BL, and Mr. Kevin Duffy, chairman of the Labour Court, who presented their findings on 26 April 2016.  I have drafted a Bill to give legislative support to the main recommendations in the Cahill-Duffy report.  It would provide protection for employees in collective redundancy cases where the employer is insolvent, give power to the High Court to return assets which have been improperly transferred and give preferential status to employees.  It would also require a 30-day consultation period in cases where it is known that a company's liabilities are such that they will trigger redundancies.  <\/p> <p> The mandate given to Ms Cahill and Mr. Duffy was to focus on ways of ensuring that limited liability and corporate restructuring are not used to avoid a company's obligations to its employees.  The phrase \"a company's obligations to its employees\" was used frequently in the report and it is these on which the Oireachtas must focus. <\/p> <p> As I stated, this is the fifth Bill I have introduced in the area of workers' rights.  I hope it will be supported by the Government.  I note the Taoiseach offered support to the Clerys workers in the past and I hope he does not want a repeat of that case.  We cannot have companies engaging in what are known as tactical insolvencies, whereby they break a company up into different components, sell off the parts that are profitable, walk away with the money and leave the operational parts intact and the State and workers having to shoulder all the liabilities.  This is no way for workers to be treated or for companies to operate.  If companies are allowed to operate in this fashion, some will do so and it is our job to address the issue. <\/p> <p> I hope that on the third occasion that I move a Bill to enhance workers' rights, the Taoiseach and his party will see fit to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100018#Q01500","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488376500,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100019#R00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1488376500,"counter":190,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100019#R00300","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488376500,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1488376500,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100019#R00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1488376500,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100019#R00600","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488376500,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions","time":1488376500,"counter":195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100019#R00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1488376500,"counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100019#R00900"},{"type":"question","time":1488376500,"counter":197,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[8463\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100019#R01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he or his officials have spoken to the Scottish First Minister since her last visit here in January 2017.","asker":"1224","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1488376500,"counter":198,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[8523\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100019#R01100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the economic assessments his Department or any other Department have or which are going to commission in relation to Brexit.","asker":"1224","askee":"1245"},{"type":"question","time":1488376500,"counter":199,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[8771\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100019#R01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his speech to the Institute of International and European Affairs on 15 February 2017, in particular the reference to the social dimension of the EU respect for human rights, workers' rights and equality;

I will try to get through them as quickly as possible.  On contact with the Scottish First Minister, while the British Government has established extensive consultation processes with the devolved administrations, there is so far no evidence that the concerns of these administrations are being listened to in any way.  Representatives at the civic dialogue meeting on Friday last sent out a strong message that the collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive has left Northern Ireland without a coherent voice at a crucial time in Europe's history, in particular with regard to Brexit.  Unlike the Northern Ireland Executive, the Scottish Executive has been very clear.  While Ireland is not in a position to make demands on behalf of Scotland, when the United Kingdom Government refuses to seek any mitigation of a hard Brexit for its devolved administrations we can speak up for the principle that Scotland should be speedily admitted to the European Union if it seeks membership.  Unlike some parties in Northern Ireland, there is nothing opportunistic about the Scottish National Party's long-term commitment to the European Union.  The SNP has been a euro-positive party for more than four decades and Scotland has shown time and again that it values its European identity.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that our formal contacts with Scotland will increase during the Brexit negotiations and in subsequent years?<\/p>  <p>  On the economic assessment of Brexit, the Taoiseach stated at the all-Ireland dialogue on Friday that studies have been commissioned.  Why has the Government not asked for input into the content of these studies?  It would have been reasonable to request suggestions for specific scenarios and mitigation ideas.  Have detailed sectoral assessments been completed and, if so, are they being used to shape our negotiating position on fiscal policy?  Will the Taoiseach provide us with such sectoral analyses as may have been undertaken by his Department? <\/p>  <p>  Will the Government publish a White Paper on Brexit?  The Taoiseach appeared to suggest last week that a White Paper would be done.  Will he detail the structure of any proposed White Paper?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100019#R02500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1488376500,"counter":213,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's final question, we cannot answer all the questions that are being asked until the British Government issues its letter of intent to leave the European Union.  As soon as the letter has been written, sent to the Commission and enters the public domain, the Government will respond.  We have done analysis on the 14 sectoral areas and a briefing on these is available to the Deputy at any time.  We can also supply whatever information he wishes to have.  The Government will respond clearly and directly once it becomes clear what relationship Britain is seeking in respect of trading relations with the European Union and, by implication, Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  We have set out our priorities and outlined them on many occasions.  I agree with Deputy Martin in the sense that business people from Northern Ireland who spoke to me at the civic forum in Dublin Castle were very pleased to make direct contact because they know what are the implications of negotiations being conducted from the side of the 27 EU member states.  Some are very concerned about their future livelihood and income base.  For example, farmers currently receive support through the Common Agricultural Policy and they are very concerned about what will happen in the meantime.  Others made a case in respect of INTERREG and PEACE funding and cross-Border activities. <\/p>  <p>  As we have already pointed out in respect of major infrastructure such as the A5, which is the road link to Derry, in the review of our capital programme we must make arrangements on an all-island basis.

In regard to the meeting which the Taoiseach has already indicated he will be attending at the end of May, as I understand it some of the headings which Mr. Juncker proposes to lay out for discussion at that meeting include: carrying on - not much change; nothing but the Single Market; those who want more do more; doing less more efficiently; and doing much more together.

Sarah-Ann is suffering from scoliosis and her situation is deteriorating while she awaits an operation.  Karen is now wondering whether the Government has simply decided to ignore her daughter's situation and her own plea that the Government not only help Sarah-Ann but go further by introducing a preventative programme of screening to avoid the same happening to other children in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Another case of extreme suffering is that of Ms Vera Twomey and her daughter, Ava.  Yesterday the Taoiseach misinformed the D&aacute;il that no application had been submitted for the use of a medicinal cannabis product to alleviate Ava's suffering.  That is not true, as I have double checked with Ms Twomey to confirm.  An Irish-registered doctor submitted the application, which is what the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, told us on 15 November was necessary to be done.  Furthermore, the paediatric neurologists who are treating Ava wrote in support of that application, stating their opinion that the product being sought is alleviating Ava's suffering.  Why has the Taoiseach moved the goalposts in this regard and why is he playing politics with Ava Barry's very serious condition?  Why is he playing politics in terms of progressing the legislation which is clearly necessary given the chill factor that is preventing medical practitioners in this country from prescribing health products that could alleviate the suffering of people like Ava?  All this is down to the refusal to lift the ban on those products.  Will the Taoiseach ensure the Minister for Health issues a licence for Ava Barry to avail of the product her doctors have requested?

One can only imagine the level of pain she is suffering and the difficulties for her family.  The Taoiseach or the Minister must explain in detail precisely what is being done to tackle this issue.

We are not getting any answers from the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise the issue of the children's hospital building project, which is very relevant to the issues referred to by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  The management of the project has stated that one of the reasons the costs have escalated so dramatically is the rise in annual construction inflation from 3% to 9%.  Apparently, the estimated cost increase, potentially from &euro;1 million to closer to &euro;2 million per bed, is because of this inflation.  I have searched the available construction data and can find no evidence of an inflation rate of 9%.  In fact, I cannot even find a reference to 3%.

I do not know who they are.<\/p>  <p>  Whether St. James's Hospital or Connolly Hospital is chosen as the location for the children's hospital - there has been expert advice to the effect that the latter would be much cheaper at this point - in both cases, the sites are free.

There seems to be a complete absence of any framework in terms of engagement with the social partners or considering how we retain standards in public services and enhance and improve them in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute is one example of a breakdown in such a framework and dialogue.  The absence of a proper manpower policy and the decline in human resource capacity in the health service is also reflective of the lack of social dialogue or engagement.  The haemorrhaging of people from the health service has been quite dramatic, in particular in terms of nurses and doctors.  In some cases it has been catastrophic.  There has also been a high turnover of staff.<\/p>  <p>  The Bus &Eacute;ireann issue has given rise to the fundamental point facing public services in general.  Notwithstanding the need for some reform and efficiencies is the fundamental point about getting bus drivers in the public sector down to very basic minimum wage-type conditions?  That is the belief.  It is not just about the Expressway service.  The document that was issued two weeks ago refers to back offices being recentralised, for example.  There was reference to eliminating entire tiers of supervisors and inspectors.  The changes are much wider than to the Expressway service.  There was also reference in the document to redundancies.<\/p>  <p>  All that is happening in the absence of a proper vision or perspective on where we want public services to go.  Taking globalisation into account, the big ticket item facing societies all over the world is the fact that incomes are going down.  The number of people on low-level incomes is rising as an overall percentage of the working population.  Some politicians do not understand the reason for the dissatisfaction and unhappiness that exists but it is basically because of the ongoing downward pressure.

CSO small area data based on the 2016 national census will be available on 20 July 2017 and will facilitate an update of the identification model from that data.  <\/p>  <p>A further strength of the new identification process is its capacity to be regularly updated and to be responsive to significant change in pupil demographics which might impact on the level of concentrated disadvantage present in a particular school.  My Department's primary and post-primary online databases are updated annually by schools and the relevant national census data is updated at five yearly intervals.  In this respect, the identification process is subject to ongoing update and this is as it should be.<\/p>  <p>  If any school considers that the outcome of the identification process is inaccurate, it may make an application for a review to verify the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort to my Department.  Information on how this can be done is available on the DEIS section of my Department's website.  Verification will include a check of the school data supplied by individual schools and a check of the application of the data to ensure that no administrative error has occurred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100024#W00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1488379500,"counter":307,"content":"<p>The truth is that the Government did not have its act together on this project.

The group produced an interim report which was published in July 2015.  The interim report identified the significant challenges in developing a model of workforce planning for teachers in Ireland.  Among the difficulties identified were gaps in data in the dispersed Irish model, the mixture of pathways into teaching and the significant levels of migration.  The group also observed that it is a more complex task at post-primary because there is currently no central mechanism for matching the overall subject need requirements of schools with output from the education providers and, in addition, schools have significant autonomy in relation to the mix of subjects and choices they provide for students.<\/p>  <p>  At that point the group indicated that it was too early to make recommendations.  The technical working group continued its work and submitted a final report, which included 14 recommendations, together with some additional advice by the council, to my predecessor, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, in December 2015.  The report sets out an approach to planning which scopes out the work necessary to develop a model for teacher supply in the medium to longer term.  The approach provides for the identification, collection and validation of data from a range of sources to be followed by a period in which a model for projecting demand and supply of teachers is developed and tested.

Funding for the network was withdrawn in 2015 because Tusla wanted to take direct control of the data collected by the centres.  This potentially includes significant personal data associated with rape survivors.  Tusla has essentially made funding dependent on the rape crisis centres sharing the data of rape survivors who present to them.  The agency has since entered into individual service level agreements with each centre in which it tied funding into the provision of data.  Furthermore, the centres must compel consent from rape victims, which is ironic in the most horrific way.<\/p><p>There are serious concerns that the information used to generate statistics could inadvertently reveal the identities of rape survivors.  These concerns are genuinely held by the rape crisis centres and many survivors who are fearful of identifying themselves to the rape crisis centres, not to mention Tusla.  It is important to note that the same contracts that are being forced on rape crisis centres are also being forced on domestic abuse centres and similar organisations, although these are probably fewer in number.  It is understandable that the centres are worried about highlighting this new requirement for data sharing as they fear it may scare victims away from using their services.  However, this fear must be weighted against their desire to make people fully aware of how their data may be used.  Given that this information is highly sensitive and personal, concerns about how it is used are legitimate. <\/p><p>A European Union directive on victims specifically states that victims of sex crime must be afforded an independent non-state option for assistance and contact.  Tusla is trying to circumvent this requirement through its contracts.  Writing recently in<i>The Irish Times<\/i>, the executive director of the Rape Crisis Network Ireland pointed out that while the State had a duty of care to survivors, &quot;critically, the State itself at times presents risks to survivors - a principle acknowledged in EU laws on victims' rights&quot;.  This appears to have been totally ignored with the introduction of these new contracts by Tusla.  <\/p><p>The RCNI seeks the restoration of its funding, as I do, in order that it can continue to use the database it developed for this specific purpose more than a decade ago.  The database has been recognised by the European Institute for Gender Equality as a model of best practice in data collection and protection.  Given recent grave revelations regarding how data were treated in Tusla, it is understandable that people will be reluctant to provide such sensitive data to Tusla and trust in the organisation will need to be rebuilt.  <\/p><p>Serious question marks arise regarding the reason Tusla is seeking this data and the Rape Crisis Network Ireland has not been satisfied with the reasons given thus far.  The entire process has been fraught and certain aspects of it have been difficult to believe.  I had to double check when I learned that Tusla had used the SurveyMonkey tool to collect some of the data from rape crisis centres.  <\/p><p>Notes of an internal meeting released in response to a freedom of information request reveal that when asked if it should consult the Data Protection Commissioner regarding its new regime, Tusla's response was &quot;that there was not necessarily advantage in making contact with the Data Commissioner as it would largely depend on the view of whoever responded and that there may not be a black and white view on all aspects of the query&quot;.  In other words, Tusla decided not to ask because it might not like the answer.  This is a worrying development. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100033#FF00700","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1488384900,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising this issue.  She and I both support the work carried out by rape crisis centres nationwide.  I am very pleased that this year an additional &euro;1.5 million will be allocated to domestic, sexual and gender based violence services.  In my instructions to Tusla for its 2017 business plan, I highlighted these services as a priority for me and the Government.  This brings funding for 2017 to &euro;22.1 million.  This funding is much needed and a step in the right direction following cuts to these vital services in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence, whether in the context of the family or otherwise.  In this context, it allocates funding to 16 rape crisis centres, which are part of a network of 60 organisations providing services and includes 20 services providing emergency refuge accommodation to women and children and 24 community based domestic violence services. <\/p>  <p>  It is my job as Minister and Tusla's job as the agency responsible to ensure that limited resources are targeted in order that vulnerable people who find themselves in desperate circumstances get the support they need.  We cannot do this without data and information about where and what the need is and what services are available to address this need.  Public money is being used to support citizens and we have a duty to members of the public and an obligation to those in need to ensure, in as far as it is possible, we meet those needs.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla is developing its information capacity to do this and working with the organisations which support people in crisis to help us to get the right information to improve our services.  All organisations need to count the same thing.  We will only provide the right services to the right people in the right place at the right time if we have standard data gathering and reporting mechanisms.  We need better quality data.

As has been previously outlined in the House, Tusla made a decision not to renew funding to the RCNI in 2015.  The agency was concerned that the RCNI database was not representative of all rape crisis centres and did not collect all of the data required by Tusla.  This is a matter for the parties involved.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, Tusla established a project to address its data and information needs in respect of these services.  The goal is to improve the data and knowledge systems.  This will result in evidence based services being provided and will enable Tusla to meet national reporting obligations and forthcoming international obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla is very aware of the importance of striking the right balance between the rights of individuals to privacy and the ability of organisations to use data for the purpose of improving their services.  It is important to highlight that Tusla only gathers aggregated data from funded services and does not require provision of personal data.  I am sensitive to the concerns raised by the Deputy and other organisations and I have asked Tusla for further reassurance relating to concerns about anonymity.<\/p>  <p>  My interest and energy are centred on maintaining a focus on the provision of services to the individuals and families who need them.  Tusla is also planning for next year and the year after.  We need to get it right for those who, unfortunately, will need these services in 2018 and thereafter.  I will continue to prioritise the development and improvement of services to victims of domestic and sexual abuse.  I am open to suggestions from Deputy Catherine Murphy who has been committed to the improvement of these services for many years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100033#FF00800","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1488384900,"counter":443,"content":"<p>The Minister and I both know how difficult it is for a person to present to a rape crisis centre.

This would have to be done very sensitively, in a way that does not scare people and assures them that the data they provide will be safely held by the provider.

The drug Respreeza is suitable for treatment for approximately 40 more patients than the 21 currently in receipt of it on a compassionate ground.  As campaigners, we welcome that the company has made the drug available for a further two months, in March and April, but this means that late next month we will be again faced with a deadline set to expire, leaving patients facing the same anguish.  This matter must be resolved.  We are also concerned to learn that price is not the only reason for the non-reimbursement of Respreeza.  It is claimed that Professor Barry from the National Centre of Pharmacoeconomics, the NCPE, believes that Respreeza does not work.  Professor Gerry McElvaney has been doing research in the US on Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency since the early 1980s.  He has continued that research here since then.  He is the leading authority here and one of the top experts in Europe on Alpha-1.  He has set up a research centre and done all of the work for the clinical trials.  He also worked very hard on the purified protein that was used but all of this work appears to have been dismissed and disregarded by someone who has not even looked at the positive results of the 21 people who are being treated with Respreeza.<\/p>  <p>  The United States Food and Drug Administration and the EU have not only approved Respreeza, the EU is reimbursing it for patients.  It defies logic that Respreeza works everywhere else in the world but not in Ireland, apparently.  We know from the clinical trial conducted in Ireland and in over 12 other countries that Respreeza has been life-changing for Alpha-1 patients.  Not only has it been conclusively shown significantly to slow down the progression of the disease by 34% and, therefore, increase life expectancy, we know from research of patients in Ireland in receipt of it that it has made a huge difference in their daily lives.  Irish people on Respreeza strongly believe that the drug has stabilised their condition, with almost 84% reporting an improvement in general symptoms.  This was supported by a reduction in the frequency and severity of chest infections and associated hospital admissions.  Chest infections per annum dropped by 68% while hospitalisations as a result of chest infection decreased by 69% per annum.  People also reported improvements in their ability to work and to lead an active and fulfilled family and social life.<\/p>  <p>  This form of therapy is already available for patients in eight European countries, including Portugal, Italy and Spain and in the United States.

I thank Deputy Brassil for raising the issue.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  In reaching its decision, the HSE examines all of the evidence which may be relevant in its view to the decision, including the dossier submitted by the company.  The HSE will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which may have been sought by it at its sole discretion, for example, from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, the NCPE.  Under section 19(4) of the Act, the HSE is prohibited from making a decision to reimburse a medicine \"except in accordance with the criteria specified in Schedule 3\" of the 2013 Act.  In the interest of time, I do not propose to read out the statutory criteria.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the statutory assessment process the HSE has confirmed it has received a request from the manufacturer of Respreeza for maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults.  The NCPE, following a health technology assessment, determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug at the price submitted and did not recommend it for reimbursement.  Respreeza was also considered by the HSE drugs group and it did not make a recommendation for reimbursement.  The HSE considers the NCPE assessment, the drugs group recommendation and other expert advice as part of its decision-making process.  The HSE leadership team has accepted the drugs group recommendation.  In line with the 2013 Act, the HSE is required to provide formal written notice of its proposed decision to the company.<\/p><p>Following receipt of the notice, the company may make further representations to the HSE if it so wishes and the latter will consider any such representations in advance of a formal decision.  As the statutory process is still ongoing, the company will have the opportunity to have further discussions with the HSE.<\/p> <p> I note the decision by the manufacturer, CSL Behring, to extend the compassionate access scheme by a further two months.  It is important to point out that the operation of such schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers.  However, the Minister, Deputy Harris, has previously stated that any attempt by manufacturers to link continued access for patients already being treated with a new medicine with decisions under the statutory reimbursement process is both inappropriate and unethical.  Manufacturers should operate such schemes in a compassionate manner and not on the basis of commercial motivation.  There should be no link between compassionate use schemes and reimbursement decisions, and manufacturers should be upfront with patients and clinicians from the outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100034#GG00500","speaker":"1307","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488386100,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I can only express my extreme disappointment at the weakness of the Minister of State's reply.

However, every other source of information, including recognised experts such as Professor McElvaney, have found to the contrary.  There seems to be a disconnect in terms of how the NCPE assesses drugs.  We had the same situation with Orkambi and it is difficult to understand.  There may be a broader discussion to be had as to how we reimburse high-tech drugs in general.  Consideration might be given, for example, to funding research on the basis that any breakthrough drugs would be subsequently provided at a low cost base. However, that is a discussion for another day.  <\/p>  <p>  We are talking in this instance about 21 people who are being denied the lifestyle to which they, like everybody else, are entitled.  The company is taking a humanitarian approach by making the drug available for a further period.  I reject any suggestion its actions are being done on some sort of lobbying basis.  The people who are suffering from this debilitating condition are living from month to month and it is not acceptable.

That failure is affecting 38 towns throughout the country, including Cork city, Fermoy, Mallow, Midleton, Ballincollig, Ringaskiddy, Youghal and Rathcormak in County Cork; Gweedore, Killybegs and Ballybofey in County Donegal; Tipperary, Roscrea and Thurles in County Tipperary; as well as, among others, Kilkenny, Dundalk, Enniscorthy and Killarney.  Ireland had until the end of 2005 to ensure any urban area with a population base of more than 15,000 had adequate sewage treatment facilities to prevent discharges from those medium-sized towns into rivers, lakes and estuaries.  It is a public health issue.<\/p>  <p>  We are experiencing some turmoil in this House at the moment on the issue of water charges.  In that context, I am concerned there may not be enough capital funding available to complete sewage and wastewater treatment plant upgrades.  Irish Water has estimated that all sewage treatment plants will be upgraded by 2021, at a slated cost of &euro;1.2 billion.  In the current climate, however, with the ongoing debate on water charges, it seems likely there may be slippage on that target.  Will the Minister give an assurance to the affected towns that they will have access to reliable, adequate and safe wastewater and sewage treatment plants?  Will he further guarantee there will be no slippage in the budget line and that the targets which need to be met by 2021 will continue to be met?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100035#HH00400","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1488386100,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and allowing me to clarify the issues he has outlined.  The urban wastewater treatment directive mandates the required standards for the collection and treatment of wastewater from urban areas.  The various deadlines for meeting the requirements of the directive passed some time ago, with the latest deadline being 31 December 2005.  By that date, secondary treatment of wastewater should have been provided for all agglomerations with a population equivalent of more than 2,000 where the treated wastewater is discharged to rivers, lakes or estuaries.  As such, the issue of compliance with the requirements of the urban wastewater treatment directive is a long-standing problem.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission commenced an infringement process against Ireland regarding its implementation of the directive in September 2013.  This was followed by a supplementary letter of formal notice in September 2015.  A reasoned opinion was then sent by the Commission on 30 September 2016, with the case being referred to the Court of Justice of the EU on 15 February 2017.  The supplementary letter of formal notice of September 2015 identified compliance concerns for a total of 82  agglomerations.  However, communications with the Commission as part of the infringement process have satisfied it that 44 of those 82 agglomerations should be removed from the case.  While this indicates some progress has been made in improving compliance, 38 agglomerations remain of concern to the Commission and have been referred to the Court of Justice of the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Since taking over responsibility for water services in January 2014, Irish Water has put in place a prioritised range of projects to deal with the historic deficits and lack of investment in wastewater collection and treatment across the country.  Irish Water has identified key projects, in both its current and recently approved future capital investment plans, to address all instances of non-compliance in its wastewater treatment plants by 2021 for each of the areas identified by the Commission.  The cost of these works is estimated at &euro;1 billion.  With regard to the specific locations to which the Deputy referred, in some cases, such as Fermoy, Mallow and Ballincollig, wastewater treatment is in place and resulting in compliant effluent.<\/p><p>However, works on the wastewater collection systems are planned by Irish Water to ensure that the collection systems convey all wastewater for appropriate treatment.<\/p> <p> The Cork lower harbour main drainage project is of particular significance.  Operations commenced at the new treatment plant in Shanbally at the end of 2016, providing full treatment of wastewater from Carrigaline, Crosshaven and Shanbally.  The areas of Cobh, Passage West-Monkstown and Ringaskiddy will also be served by this new treatment plant at various dates in the future.<\/p> <p> Investment by Irish Water in ensuring compliance with the requirements of the urban wastewater treatment directive is only one aspect of what is required in terms of the provision of wastewater services.  Further significant and sustained investment will be essential to ensure ongoing compliance, facilitate future population and economic growth and protect the environment and human health.<\/p> <p> The Deputy is right to raise the matter, as the House will debate the future of water in March and April on foot of the committee's report, which is due soon.  Often, we forget that this issue also involves wastewater.  People say that there is a right to water, but there is also a responsibility to deal with wastewater.  It is a major cost.  It is important that the investment plan that has been agreed with Irish Water is continued.  There is a commitment from the Government, with the House's support, to continue that investment plan regardless of the debate on charges.  The EU is conscious of the fact that our investment plan through Irish Water is helping us to address the issues that arise, which is essential for environmental purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100035#HH00500","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488386700,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for engaging with me on this issue and I recognise that blame is laid at successive Governments' doors.

We must ensure that the capital expenditure is locked down regardless of the outcome of the committee's deliberations when it reports to the House.

The idea of introducing a single water utility in the form of Irish Water was to drive the necessary investment in the water and wastewater infrastructure that had been lacking for many generations.  Thankfully, the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government and the current Government of Fine Gael and Independents supported by Fianna F&aacute;il and others have recognised the importance of having a single water utility to drive the agenda of continuing investment in key, necessary infrastructure in the right parts of the country.  I am happy to say that this will continue, given that the single water utility is protected and, with the agreement of the House, will continue its work separately from the arguments around charges and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Establishing a utility was also meant to ensure the capacity to raise money via charges and taxation and in the form of borrowings that would be repaid through general taxation and people's contributions towards the cost of water.  The polluter pays principle drove that.  Under it, those who used water excessively or wasted it would contribute towards its cost, and rightly so.  I referred to this matter last night.<\/p>  <p>  Our capital investment requirements reflect the amount of water that we need and consume.  If we found ways to conserve water, reduce consumption and encourage people to respect water better, which is often helped by having a metering system of some sort as well as a charge for excessive use, it would drive down the capacity requirements.  In many areas, 40% of water is lost to the system through leakage and, in some cases, wastage.  If we had a proper regime in place that could monitor and measure that, we would be able to prevent it and, therefore, invest less money in the capacity generation of water and water treatment plants.  Investment in wastewater treatment is essential, but the requirement for that would be lessened if we could reduce water wastage.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that investment be protected.  I share the Deputy's concerns about there being no mechanism to guarantee it, but this Government has committed to it and other Governments might follow suit.

Following the collapse of Setanta Insurance more than 1,600 people with outstanding claims are none the wiser today than when the company collapsed in April 2014.  That is a disgraceful position.  The Government sat on its hands and shafted those people.  They are the forgotten people.<\/p><p>I spent this afternoon ringing all the individual claimants for whom I had contact details who were in touch with me or the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in recent years.  Some of the stories I heard are absolutely harrowing.  In one case the accident concerned goes back to October 2010.<\/p><p>Setanta Insurance contested that claim so it was not dealt with by the time it collapsed in April 2014 and it is now caught up in the liquidation of Setanta Insurance and the legal dispute about who is ultimately responsible for settling that claim.  Another case involved an accident that happened in December 2012 where a driver was hit from behind.  He has been in and out of work since then with very serious injuries and has undergone a number of medical procedures.  Again, there has been no clarity for him or his family as to when that claim will be settled.  He has not yet received a red cent arising from an accident that happened in December 2012.  I have a number of such cases that I could read into the record of this House.  We must collectively deal with this situation urgently.  It is not acceptable that almost three years on from the collapse of Setanta Insurance, we are awaiting a court decision to deal with the issue.<\/p> <p> What we are calling for in this motion is for the necessary funds to be provided by the insurance compensation fund to the liquidator of Setanta Insurance to deal with the outstanding claims and to look after the people who are caught up in this.  The Supreme Court judgment will go one of two ways.  It could find that the insurance compensation fund is responsible in which case, if the Government accepts our motion, the Government will already have paid out and the people will be looked after.  Alternatively, the court could find that the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, is responsible in which case, the insurance compensation fund can recoup those funds from the MIBI.  <\/p> <p> Last year saw the collapse another firm called Enterprise Insurance.  This company had a smaller presence in Ireland but is important nonetheless with about 14,000 policyholders and outstanding claims estimated to be over &euro;6 million.  Even today, as we are here on 1 March 2017, there is no agreed framework in place to deal with a scenario where a motor insurance firm collapses.  The motorist caught up in the collapse of an insurance firm in Ireland faces a situation where the maximum payout they will get for their claim is 65% under the insurance compensation fund subject to an overall limit of &euro;825,000.  The balance is not being provided for and they will be seriously out of pocket.  That situation potentially exposes every single motorist in this country because the notion of the collapse of a motor insurance firm is not that far-fetched.  It has happened a number of times in this country over the past number of years.  The Government published a new motor insurance compensation framework in July 2016 but no agreement has been reached with the industry, there has been no legislation to put those proposals into effect and so we are still in limbo.  That is a crazy situation for this Government to stand over and it must be dealt with.  The manifestation of that is there for all of us to see in the cases of Setanta Insurance and Enterprise Insurance.  Heaven forbid if any other company was to collapse.<\/p> <p> The other dimension to this is the fact that Setanta Insurance was regulated in Malta and Enterprise Insurance was regulated in Gibraltar.  If one looks at the list of motor insurers on the MIBI list of those allowed to sell into Ireland on a freedom of services basis, one will find 23 firms according to our research.  Those firms are prudentially regulated in another EU member state but are allowed to sell business into Ireland.  For some reason, ten of them are prudentially regulated in Gibraltar.  We know that the Central Bank has raised concerns with the authorities in Gibraltar about the ongoing licensing of firms there thereby enabling them to sell business into Ireland and other EU member states.  This EU-wide system of regulation of motor insurance companies will only work if a common standard of regulation is consistently applied across all the member states.  There is no evidence that this is the case.  Why else would the Central Bank raise such concerns with the authorities in Gibraltar?  We have Solvency II and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority but I am not satisfied that there is a common standard of regulation in Ireland today.  This issue needs to be dealt with.<\/p> <p> Consumers here are not being made aware of the distinction between firms that are prudentially regulated in Ireland and those that have their regulation passported in.  When we all hear the advertisements saying that a motor insurance company is regulated in Ireland for conduct of business purposes, we assume that firm is regulated here, the Central Bank is crawling all over it and everything is okay but that is not the case.  If the firm is only regulated here for conduct of business purposes, the Central Bank is not the prudential regulator and is not assessing the underlying financial health of that insurance company, its solvency and whether or not it has put sufficient reserves aside to deal with future claims.  The Central Bank needs to conduct an awareness campaign to ensure that motor insurance consumers in Ireland are fully informed of that distinction.  It needs to raise at a European level the issue of a common standard of regulation across the EU and deal directly with authorities in Gibraltar and any other member state where it has a concern about the nature and standard of the regulation.  <\/p> <p> We are calling for the Government to intervene and look after the people who are caught up in the collapse of Setanta Insurance and Enterprise Insurance.  We are calling on the Government to finalise the motor insurance compensation framework to ensure that we have certainty and clarity in the event of the collapse of another motor insurance provider otherwise we are all exposed and will be dealing with many more individual cases down the line.  We want clarity on how long the insurance compensation fund will require a 2% levy from all non-life insurance consumers in respect of the cost of Quinn Insurance.  <\/p> <p> The overall issue here concerns people in limbo.  They are watching this debate hoping for answers.  They are hoping against hope that this Government will finally act and help them.  It is completely unacceptable that several years after the collapse of an insurance company, there is no certainty about who is paying out.  I have heard of cases where solicitors on behalf of the liquidator of Setanta Insurance have advised Setanta Insurance policyholders that they could be held personally liable for the cost of that claim in the event of there being an ultimate shortfall in the liquidation.  It is not good enough and must be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100037#MM00200","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488387600,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputy Michael McGrath for putting down this motion.

The lives of the people involved in these claims are on hold.  They find it very difficult to move without financial help.  When we think of insurance, we are very conscious of the cost of it and how the premiums have increased.  Very few of us think about who regulates the firms we insure our cars with.

This motion calls on the Central Bank to conduct an awareness campaign so that consumers are informed as to who regulates the motor insurance firms with which they have their policies.  Firms can pass themselves off as being Irish because they are selling their services in Ireland but many of them are only regulated here for conduct of business purposes.  This needs to be made known to the consumer, loud and clear.  When people hear in an advertisement that such a financial services is regulated here for conduct of business purposes, they assume it means the service is fully regulated here in Ireland.  However, this is not the case.<\/p>  <p>  It is planned that the role of the supervisory authorities will be significantly enhanced, including provision for more co-operation between member states.

We keep not learning the lessons.  If we had learned the proper lessons from PMPA, Setanta or Enterprise would not have happened.  We need to draw a line under that period of insurance and offer certainty to those who are buying insurance products, particular motor insurance, in this country.  We need to offer answers in relation to the ten companies that trade in Ireland but are registered in Gibraltar.  What protections will be in place for customers after Brexit in terms of the companies' standing and their responsibilities?<\/p>  <p>  We also need to shine a light on the motor insurance sector.  Why are costs rocketing?  I looked this morning at yesterday's report from the Central Bank on motor insurance which stated the sector has room to improve.  If one is being targeted with a 40% to 50% premium rise, as are many people with no claims histories, full no-claims bonuses and no changes in their circumstances, there is more than room to improve.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for enterprise and for employment, Deputy Breen, needs to shine a light on the practices in the same way that one of his predecessors, the former Minister of State, Mr. Noel Treacy, did many years ago, bringing a change to the cost of premiums and certainty to consumers.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to give proper standing to returning emigrants.  There is no sense in the Government encouraging emigrants to come back and take up careers in the country when they will be creased by insurance costs and not given any credit for a no-claims bonus from any other part of the world.  In fact, insurance is one of the issues that is prohibiting and discouraging emigrants from coming back here to take up positions.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance is a major issue, and a major cause of concern and worry.

The matters raised are very important and I would like to state that while the Government will be abstaining from the vote on the motion for reasons which I will explain, there are elements of the motion with which we can agree.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that the insurance sector in Ireland has undergone a period of instability.  The liquidation of insurers selling insurance into Ireland has had a major impact on consumers.  The placing into liquidation of Setanta in 2014, and the subsequent legal action, The Law Society of Ireland <i>v.<\/i>the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, highlighted weaknesses with the current insurance compensation framework in Ireland.<\/p><p>Prior to this litigation, the insurance compensation fund, ICF, was expected to have met the third party claims up to a limit of 65% and a ceiling of &euro;825,000 per claimant.  However, the High Court and the Court of Appeal held that the MIBI was liable for compensating third parties.  Should this decision be also upheld by the Supreme Court, virtually all Setanta claims will be paid in full.  The Supreme Court appeal was heard in October 2016, and we are now awaiting its judgment on this matter.<\/p><p>Inquiries have been made by officials to try to establish when the decision will be handed down, but no indication has been given as to the timeframe involved.  Until we receive the judgment, it is unlikely that third party motor insurance claims can be processed, as currently MIBI is liable and the industry, which finances this arrangement, will not pay out unless confirmed by the Supreme Court.<\/p><p>The Government recognises the reason this motion has been brought and in broad terms is sympathetic to many of the issues raised by the Members today.  The very legitimate concerns about the lack of accountability of the Maltese authorities for the liquidation of Setanta are acknowledged.  The delay in settling claims also has been unfortunate.  However, it must be stressed that this aspect is completely outside the control of the Government because of the ongoing court case regarding which body should pay the compensation.<\/p><p>From the perspective of the consumer, much of what is outlined in the motion is not unreasonable.  However, the Government has two concerns.  The first relates to providing the necessary resources from the ICF to ensure the liquidator can address outstanding claims without further delay.  The difficulty is the fact that the High Court and the Court of Appeal have found that the ICF is not liable for these claims.  Instead, they have found the MIBI liable.  Consequently, compensating policyholders from the ICF would be directly conflicting with the decision of the courts and could be interpreted as undermining their authority.<\/p><p>The second relates to giving consideration to taking legal action against the Maltese and Gibraltar authorities.  This would involve engaging lawyers in Malta and Gibraltar to seek further information in respect of the failures of the regulators to uphold their legal duties to establish whether a valid claims arises.  The advice from the Department of Finance&rsquo;s legal unit is that there is insufficient likelihood of a successful action to justify the costs which would be incurred in taking this course of action.<\/p><p>In terms of what is being done, there are a number of items in the motion I would like to address.  In regard to Setanta, I understand there are 1,658 open claims.  It is acknowledged that this figure is decreasing slowly but that is due to the ongoing court case.  Once the Supreme Court rules on where liability falls, progress on outstanding claims can be made.<\/p><p>With regard to enterprise, I am advised that a letter has been received from the Government of Gibraltar outlining that there are currently 233 live claims from Irish policyholders with a reserve value of &euro;7.4 million.  However, the reserve figure is under review.  Wrightway Underwriting Limited has been appointed to manage claims to enable the liquidator to adjudicate and admit them as insurance claims in the liquidation.  The letter details the work that is ongoing within the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission to reduce the live claims and notes that the commission maintains a positive working relationship with both the Central Bank and EU authorities.  Claims are, therefore, being actively managed.<\/p><p>It is acknowledged that, with the failure of Setanta and the uncertainty that followed, the whole compensation area needs to be reviewed.  Consequently, a review of the framework for motor insurance compensation was initiated and a report was published in July 2016.  It is expected that a legislative proposal to implement the report will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months and this will bring clarity on the respective roles of the ICF and the MIBI in the event of a future collapse of a motor insurer.<\/p><p>The motion asks for an urgent update as to the final bill for the collapse of Quinn Insurance.  I understand this is estimated to be in the region of &euro;1.1 billion before any potential recovery from the court action Quinn Insurance is taking against its former auditors.  It is not possible to give an exact timeframe for the final bill, but it is unlikely to be before 2020.<\/p><p>The issues which the motion asks the Central Bank to carry out are a matter for the bank to consider.  However, the bank has indicated that it is conducting a thematic review and inspection of managing general agents, MGAs, that have been appointed to carry out business on behalf of insurance undertakings from other member states operating in Ireland on a freedom of service basis.  This review is of relevance to the request for the Central Bank to undertake an awareness campaign.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has confirmed that it fully participates in EIOPA in the establishment of high quality common regulatory and supervisory standards and procedures.  The Central Bank has an ongoing engagement with relevant European authorities in order to ensure common standards are applied consistently.  I am advised that the bank has engaged with EIOPA on the specific issues raised in this motion.<\/p><p>With regard to the issue of regulatory shopping by UK based financial firms seeking to preserve access to the EU following Brexit, this is an issue which the Government has serious concerns about and which has already been discussed in the House.  At a political level, we have been in communication with our European partners on this matter.  We believe that it is important to have a transitional arrangement to protect the security of our financial system because of its importance in underpinning day to day business.  A transitional arrangement would allow negotiations to take place in a calm and safe environment and would ease concerns about other jurisdictions potentially giving consideration to making commitments on the level of regulation and supervision to such financial firms.  We must ensure that the level playing field is protected across the EU.<\/p><p>With regard to Brexit, it is important to note that the implications of Brexit are unclear.  After the negotiations have concluded, the issue of passporting in from the UK and Gibraltar will be clearer.  However, ultimately, should the position of passporting not be satisfactorily resolved, insurers which currently have branch operations or which conduct freedom of business into the State will have the option of applying for an authorisation from the Central Bank to conduct business in the State.<\/p><p>The Government understands that there is frustration with the slow pace of progress on the Setanta liquidation.  However, once the Supreme Court judgment is issued, and I hope that will happen in the next few months, it should be possible for claims to be paid out either through the MIBI or the ICF within a reasonable period of time.  Unfortunately, as I mentioned already, we do not believe it is possible to pre-empt this decision by paying such claims through the ICF immediately.<\/p><p>Finally, as indicated at the outset, the Government will abstain from the vote on this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100040#PP00200","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1488388800,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I too welcome the fact this issue has been raised.  In my inaugural speech I said it was the issue raised with me by people on the doorsteps.  It was highlighted for me when, as a returning emigrant, I was hit with the news that I no longer had a no claims bonus.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome what the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has done in recent months regarding the generation of the report, the tasks on hand, the priorities set and the timeline that has been put down.  We are trying to tackle and change the overall industry so it is a big ship to move, notwithstanding our responsibility to consumers who are feeling the pressure from this in that any disposal income they are earning, with an improved economy and more jobs being created, is starting to be etched away by the rising cost of car insurance.<\/p>  <p>  It must be highlighted that there are a number of discrepancies within the industry in that products can be priced differently when people are seeking quotes on the telephone.  A major problem highlighted to me is that an insurance company can take a product, put a different name on it and sell it at a different price.  It is the same risk, the same policy and the consumer will get the same return but it is sold at a different price, and the consumer does not know that.  That is the first issue I want to highlight.<\/p>  <p>  I find it difficult to get my head around the issue of the cost of insuring older cars.  The owners must do an NCT every year but because their cars are ten, 12 or 14 years old they are told they must pay a higher insurance premium.  I do not understand the risk with regard to the car because it passes the NCT.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the improved economy vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2016 were 68% of what was sold in 2012.  That market is much more buoyant.<\/p>  <p>  The final issue I want to raise is non-disclosure of previous claims.  It is often the case that people are denied claims because they may not have disclosed previous claims but many of the questions being asked by the insurers are vague.  That issue must be tackled also.<\/p>  <p>  I understand there is a responsibility on the Government to drive this issue and that is the reason I welcome the motion, but there is a responsibility on the industry also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100040#PP00300","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1488388800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate and thank Deputy Michael McGrath for bringing forward the motion and allowing us to discuss it.  I will be sharing my time with my colleagues, some of whom have yet to come into the Chamber.  I understand the Ceann Comhairle has the list of names.  This debate focuses attention on the thousands of customers who have been left in legal limbo after the collapse of Setanta Insurance.<\/p><p>I know some of them personally.  Some of them are my friends.  Some of them want to start their own businesses but have to wait for the settlement to which they are entitled and are eagerly awaiting the court's decision.  They should never have been in this limbo in the first place.  It is clear they are innocent victims of a bigger battle and we need to take them out of the battle, which is why Sinn F&eacute;in will support the motion.  This is a farce which has been rumbling on for far too long and I hope the Supreme Court will soon make its decision.  In the meantime, the Government has put forward a proposal to deal with cases such as this, but they are cases which will happen in future.<\/p> <p> This is in large part a mess of the Government's own creation.  Not for the first time has the Attorney General provided what two courts have since found to be the wrong answer to the question asked.  The Attorney General's advice has been wrong in this case and this is worth noting as another committee is discussing the issue of water charges.  The Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, has appealed twice and at no point was there anything stopping it from paying out these claims without prejudice.  It initially accepted it was liable but then backtracked on legal advice, including advice from the Attorney General.  Instead of challenging this, the Government rolled over and accepted it.  This was back in 2015.  I believe that in all likelihood when the Supreme Court makes its decision we will be back in the same position we were when the Minister, Deputy Noonan, told me on 30 April 2015 that MIBI would pay out and it would be the body responsible for making good the claims.  As things stand, the High Court and the Court of Appeal have stated they agree with the Law Society that the MIBI is liable.  This is the interpretation of the law as it currently stands, and it is law as it stands until the Supreme Court rules one way or the other.<\/p> <p> In reality, the motion is asking us to make an exception.  I welcome the focus on this issue, which is why I will support the motion.  The motion asks that the Government ensures the Insurance Compensation Fund, ICF, pays out.  The legislation is quite clear it is the President of the High Court, upon application, who will make this decision, but nonetheless there should have been a remedy before now.  For many years we have argued the Insurance Compensation Fund would have been the remedy.  While the MIBI and the Insurance Compensation Fund can argue the toss, the fact is that ultimately it is the consumer who will pay for Setanta, one way or the other.  The MIBI and the Insurance Compensation Fund are ultimately funded by the industry or the consumer but, at the end of the day, whether it is through increased premiums or a direct levy it will be the consumer who pays.  The advantage of the Insurance Compensation Fund paying the liquidator is it can stretch the payments over a long period of time and we can see this with the Quinn Direct bill of &euro;1.1 billion.  I note the Fianna F&aacute;il motion speaks about regulatory failures and taking action against regulatory failures.  The &euro;1.1 billion which must be paid by insurance consumers for the next 20 years happened on Fianna F&aacute;il's watch.  This is why we were labelled the wild west.  It was not with regard to the banks but insurance the quote was attributed to this country and it is disgraceful that insurance consumers will continue to have to pay the bill for many years to come.<\/p> <p> The motion does not deal with the fact the Insurance Compensation Fund is limited to paying out 65% of a claim or up to &euro;825,000, whichever is lower.  There are people with claims against Setanta Insurance which run to multiples of the upper limit because they are in serious life-limiting circumstances as a result of an accident.  Full compensation should be paid out.  If people are due &euro;100,000 the payment should not be &euro;65,000.  We are very clear and for many years we have argued the Insurance Compensation Fund legislation should be altered to allow for 100% of the claims to be paid out in the case of Setanta Insurance.  The motion before us does not deal with this issue.  It is the core issue on which we should focus because if the Supreme Court overturns the High Court and the Court of Appeal and decides it is the Insurance Compensation Fund which must pay out, let us remember that claimants will receive only 65% of what they are due.  In my view this is wrong.  While the Department proposes to abolish the cap, it would still apply in cases such as Setanta where a company is in liquidation and insolvent.<\/p> <p> I wish to discuss some of the myths in the motion.  We reject the notion implicit in the Fianna F&aacute;il motion that this contributes in any way significantly to increases in the cost of insurance.  Even if the industry had to pay out the entire &euro;19 million bill tomorrow, it would only be a drop in the ocean of the increases introduced in recent years.  This is a myth peddled by the industry.  When I met representatives from the industry privately and when they came before the committee it was at the top of their agenda, but it does not stand up to scrutiny and no report commissioned by the Oireachtas committee or the Government stands over this claim.  Without doubt, the industry needs clarity on the legal situation, but to present this as a means of tackling the rip-off of recent years is false.<\/p> <p> There is also an insinuation it was fully down to lax foreign regulators but this is not the entire story.  Setanta Insurance was an Irish company with an Irish director and Irish shareholders right up to the end.  The Maltese certainly should have done a better job, but the Irish Central Bank allowed the company to continue to sell insurance for a number of months after it knew of issues.  I know this through freedom of information requests.  It is not unprecedented that an Irish insurer would behave recklessly and go bust.  We have a terrible track record in this country and &euro;1.1 billion is the cost.<\/p> <p> I ask Fianna F&aacute;il to let us know whether it no longer supports the passporting of financial firms throughout the EU, because this would be a major shift in policy by the party and it is not clear from the motion.  My big concern is nothing will happen.  The Government will abstain and the ICF will not pay out.  It is good we are drawing attention to it, but this should have been sorted out several years ago.  We should have amended the legislation and allowed for the ICF to pay out.  Doing it in the mouth of a Supreme Court ruling is not the time to do it, but it is a welcome focus on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100040#PP00400","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488389400,"counter":477,"content":"<p>The main focus of the motion is Setanta Insurance and I am very conscious of it because in my constituency I have come across many people who were caught out.  Many people who were insured by Setanta Insurance were farmers, people with Jeeps and vans and sole traders.  This was mainly the market it targeted and these people have been badly affected.<\/p>  <p>  It must be our priority that claimants receive their compensation as soon as possible and it should be paid out without any cap.  It is very strange to have a 65% cap on the Insurance Compensation Fund.  It is not sufficient because people in this country must ensure their vehicles.  The State makes people get insurance.  It is not optional and people must do it, but when something goes wrong the State has put in place a situation whereby people can only receive 65% of what they rightly deserve as part of their claim.  This is a huge issue.<\/p>  <p>  It is not good enough that people who are legally obliged to have insurance are not protected when something goes wrong.  This is the nub of what this is about.  This is not the first time an insurance company has gone bust and left customers in the lurch.  As has been stated, there are many instances of this and there need to be safeguards to prevent it in future.  Providing these safeguards does not mean the cost of insurance premiums must rise.  People are fed up listening to so-called justifications for the rising costs of insurance from an industry which likes to pretend its only motivation is to provide insurance.  Its real motivation is profit but it pretends it is not.  The increases introduced by the insurance industry in recent years would more than cover the &euro;90 million it would cost and the people do not want to hear any more whingeing from the insurance industry.<\/p>  <p>  Setanta Insurance may have been based in Malta but it was an Irish company and there is no justification for blaming poor regulation abroad for this situation.  It is not as if Irish companies have not behaved carelessly and gone under previously.  The nub of this is the consumers are those who can least afford to suffer and be left without compensation.<\/p>  <p>  We also have the issue, which was mentioned earlier by Deputy Neville, regarding young drivers.  They cannot get insurance that does not cost thousands.  We have a situation in rural areas where many people with a car of more than ten years of age will not be quoted for insurance, but the car has an NCT and is supposed to be roadworthy according to the State.  Many issues need to be dealt with.  The no claims bonus issue is a big problem for people who return from abroad.  If people are abroad for more than three years their no claims bonus is gone and they cannot bring it home, although they may have been driving in a much more dangerous part of the world than here.  These rules have been put in place by an industry which wants to cripple the public with more costs.<\/p><p>Many people who had Setanta Insurance were owners of small commercial vehicles and vans, the loss of which would mean, for some of them, a loss of their business.  Not many people with small businesses would have the cash to replace a vehicle while still waiting for the payout of an insurance claim.  This is not to mention those who are waiting for the repayment of their premiums, which they bought in good faith but then had to go out and insure their vans again.<\/p> <p> It is not good enough for people to be left hanging on while the Supreme Court makes a judgment.  The insurance industry cannot be allowed to call the shots and the Government must step up to defend clients and ensure people get their compensation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100041#QQ00200","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488390000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an r&uacute;n seo.  Is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuilimid ag labhairt ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; &aacute;rachais ar&iacute;s.  Is &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach, consp&oacute;ideach agus achrannach &eacute; le tamall anuas.  I welcome Deputy Michael McGrath's motion.  I also acknowledge the thousands of people, former customers and claimants, who have been left high and dry and in legal limbo following the collapse of Setanta.  They have been shafted, have unjustifiably lost money and found themselves in positions of extreme hardship, with 1,600 open claims unsettled at an estimated cost of &euro;95.2 million.  They need this issue to be resolved.  The poor handling of this issue has further complicated and aggravated the situation as well as their frustration and the Government is partially to blame.  As stated by Deputy Pearse Doherty, the MIBI has appealed twice, having initially accepted it was liable before reversing its decision.  It is difficult to understand why the Government did not challenge this.  The MIBI could have paid out without prejudice and it is likely that it is liable, pending the Supreme Court action.<\/p>  <p>  I support the motion to provide the necessary resources from the insurance compensation fund to ensure the liquidator can pay out all outstanding claims and I hope this expedites the payment as required.  I support the call for there to be no cap, because some people have sustained grievous injuries and are in a position of extreme hardship whose full costs need to be met.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of who underwrites insurance and in which country a company is regulated is important.  International companies coming from states with poorer regulatory frameworks than Ireland to provide insurance by passporting it into Ireland is problematic.  We have had enough difficulties with locally-based companies and do not want the added problem of people coming from countries with even weaker regulatory frameworks.  We do not accept the idea that the Setanta problem was solely the fault of weak foreign regulation - Malta in this case.  Setanta was an Irish company with Irish directors who must take responsibility for what happened to that company and for its recklessness, for which consumers have been left to pay.  We do not accept that this is the reason for the enormous and outrageous increases in motor insurance in recent years, with drivers seeing average increases of 60% in the cost of premiums since late 2013.  There are examples of increases of 200% and 300% and cases such as Setanta cannot be considered as solely responsible for the outrageous increases in insurance premiums.  The market is being distorted by the greedy behaviour of insurance companies.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister needs to recognise the driving records of returning emigrants.  If we are happy enough to allow companies from states with very weak regulatory frameworks to provide insurance to Irish companies, why are we not willing to allow Irish motorists to have their driving records recognised when they return from abroad?  I have come across cases of people being quoted between &euro;4,500 and &euro;6,000 when they come home, having spent a number of years abroad, to set up businesses here and restart their lives in Ireland.  One man told me he was practically ready to get back on the flight to Australia after a quote such as this.  In a response to a parliamentary question, the Minister said actions were being taken to establish a protocol but that will not be until the end of 2017, effectively the start of next year.  These people have already waited far too long for this issue to be dealt with and many more returning emigrants will be faced with outrageous premiums.  I ask the Government to ensure the protocol is brought forward as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100042#RR00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1488390000,"counter":480,"content":"<p>We support the motion.  Setanta's collapse has left in its wake 1,700 open claims for compensation, which remain unsettled at a cost of approximately &euro;95.2 million.  The collapse of Enterprise Insurance has left 14,000 motorists with &euro;6 million outstanding.  One company was regulated in Malta, the other in Gibraltar.  Of the 39 insurance companies listed as members of the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, 11 are domiciled in Gibraltar when one excludes the Lloyds list.<\/p>  <p>  The proceedings before the Supreme Court allow interested parties to hide until such time as the Supreme Court has found in favour of one side or the other.  The Government may also be hiding behind the Supreme Court decision because, although it announced the extension of the insurance compensation fund in July 2016, it seems the Minister is now saying a legislative proposal to implement the report will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months.  He did not use the words \"heads of a Bill\" and there seems to be some slippage already in the timelines for legislation to provide certainty in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  The finance committee has done much work to tackle the issues articulated by Deputies Neville and &Oacute; Laoghaire on the particular circumstances in which motorists find themselves, particularly those who have been priced out of the market by virtue of the fact that they had to emigrate and are now returning home.  We require certainty to plug the glaring lacuna in the legislation around this matter.  If it is not addressed, there is the prospect of motorists having loading costs on their premiums of up to &euro;80.  The MIBI documentation contains estimates that the cost of claims for their members, against uninsured and untraced drivers, is north of &euro;58.4 million.  The MIBI states that Setanta poses a liability of &euro;90 million, the impact of which is an additional &euro;52.<\/p>  <p>  The Supreme Court has to iron out how Irish law understands the responsibility of MIBI.  Other Members have referred to timelines but this goes back to September 2015 and the first High Court judgment.  The latest instalment was the October 2016 reserve judgment.  I am delighted that the Government is abstaining on the motion because there is agreement on the broad principles of the motion.  The consumer demands are very clear.<\/p><p>They want transparency and easily accessible information on the products they are purchasing.  They also want to know, in a simple format, if the liquidity and provisioning arrangements for those insurance houses, from which they are purchasing products, are robust so as to offset the risk of non-payment of claims in the future.  Consumers quite simply demand transparency and easily accessible information, which is something that will have to be dealt with.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge what the Minister said about the Central Bank conducting a thematic review and inspection of managing general agents or MGAs.  However, we need further information and clarity on what that means.<\/p> <p> While we support the motion, it is important to have legal certainty on the Setanta issue and other insurance houses.  Motorists with legitimate expectations have been waiting too long for justice, despite having judgments in their favour for recognised claims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100042#RR00300","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488390600,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I will probably not take all my time because I have to rush off to a Right2Water meeting at 6 o'clock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100043#SS00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1488390600,"counter":483,"content":"<p>We will take the Deputy's time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100043#SS00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1488390600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>It is raining heavily outside.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100043#SS00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1488390600,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Yes, I know, and still some people want to charge for it.  It is extraordinary, is it not?<\/p>  <p>  I support the proposals in the Fianna F&aacute;il motion relating to the collapse of Setanta Enterprise Insurance and generally unregulated motor insurance firms and the measures needed to deal with the consequences.  In particular, I support the importance of compensating those who have been affected.  It is reasonable to pursue the authorities of the jurisdictions that did not seem to regulate properly to try to recoup some of the money it will cost us to ensure, as we should, that those who have been affected by this are compensated.  They are victims of a failure of the authorities in Europe and here to have a properly regulated insurance industry.  That is what it comes down to.<\/p>  <p>  I support the proposed measures but we would go a lot further.  This all relates to a race to the bottom that one gets in just about every area, including insurance, as a result of unregulated, free-market globalisation.  We got it with banking, multinational corporate tax evasion and insurance.  There is always somebody who is trying to get around the regulations for profit by under-provisioning.  They have an unsustainable business model which means that when they get into trouble and are not making enough profit, they decide to go out of business.  The poor customers, or more widely the general public, pick up the bill when the profit-seeking entity goes bust.<\/p>  <p>  Failures of regulation and the inadequacy of pre-established compensation structures mean that we must deal with the consequences.  The problem is that we then move to close the door after the horse has bolted.  We keep doing this in the case of insurance.  In so far as we must compensate the innocent victims, we create another problem because we must load levies on everybody else's insurance.  Insurance thus becomes unaffordable and people get screwed on premiums or are not getting insured at all, as is increasingly the case.<\/p>  <p>  Last week we talked about cohorts of people seeking insurance.  Some taxi drivers, who require insurance cover to make a living, cannot get it because costs have risen so much.  We cannot get credible information, or in some cases any information at all, from these insurance companies to justify their premium increases.  One aspect is the cost of the collapse of other private entities, but they also throw out all sorts of other excuses, including legal costs and, as they see it, the unnecessarily high level of awards.  They blame juries or fraud, but we do not really know the truth of the matter because we cannot get the actual information from insurance companies.<\/p>  <p>  How therefore do we resolve this matter in such a way that the situation does not continue to get worse?  While the proposed measures before us are some response to the immediate situation, are we going to be back here again fairly soon?  Following a particular crisis, like the collapse of a few insurance companies or the collapse of the banking sector due to light touch regulation, we say we are going to regulate, let us have more regulation and it will never happen again because we are going to regulate.  Shortly after the commitments to regulate, however, we have bleating by the for-profit institutions, be they insurance companies, banks or multinationals, saying we are going to have to lighten up this regulation because it is not viable for them with that level of regulation, or else they will have to jack up premiums.  We are in this vicious cycle where we end up toing and froing between picking up the cost of not having enough regulation or the adverse consequences of compensation packages, and trying to regulate these guys.  And so it goes on.<\/p>  <p>  Our answer to this conundrum is a State insurance company.  That is what is needed.  What is the advantage of that?  First, we would not need to have committees sitting for weeks on end trying to find out the truth of what is going on in the insurance company.  We could actually access the information because we would have it.  I am not saying that all State bureaucracies are perfectly transparent in terms of the availability of information, but at least notionally we are entitled to the information.<\/p>  <p>  It would work as long as we did not have this arm's length nonsense whereby we own a bank but have no responsibility for what it does and cannot in any way influence its decisions.  That is what we do when we have banks, insurance companies or any other public enterprises, including semi-State companies.  We are told that is because we have to maintain the commercial independence of these entities, but that is not what we should be doing, particularly when the public always pay.  The public pay higher premiums, general taxation and compensation claims when these institutions collapse.  It seems to me that if the public pay every single time when anything goes wrong, maybe the public should run them.  Then, at least, they would get the benefit of any profits they generate, as well as having some influence over the policies they set for premiums, business models and necessary provisioning.<\/p>  <p>  I am absolutely convinced that would be better, more efficient and cheaper.  I recently brought to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, the example of a Manitoba insurance company which was established directly after a series of hearings, just like the ones we had on motor insurance.  Unlike our ones, where we have 77 recommendations that basically do nothing except try to perfect a market which is not perfectible, the Manitoba authorities set up their own not-for-profit insurance company to provide affordable, basic third-party insurance for everybody.<\/p><p>It will eliminate discrimination against particular cohorts of drivers.  It will base risk on individual assessments of those drivers and penalise them if they turn out to have a bad record but not penalise whole cohorts, as these insurance companies do on spurious reasons in order to make money.  That is what I think we should do.  Otherwise we will be here again.  We will not resolve the dilemma and it will just keep going around.  In a year or two we will be debating the collapse of some other unregulated entity, or for that matter, even a regulated one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100043#SS00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488391200,"counter":487,"content":"<p>For me the whole area of insurance should be about assurance and reassurance and that, in the event of an accident, an injury or a fatality or, with property, in the event of theft, damage or vandalism, people feel assured and reassured that their insurance will cover them.  What we are seeing in the insurance industry recently, however, is this whole spiralling.  The word I would use to describe it is \"excessive\".  There is a subtle form of blackmailing to have insurance for every possible eventuality.  We are seeing claims being sought and claims being granted by insurance companies that are highly controversial and really defy all common sense, with the result that everybody's insurance premiums increase.<\/p>  <p>  I want to look at three groups in particular.  I know we are talking about Setanta and Enterprise in particular, but these particular groups have been in touch with me to a considerable extent.  Taxi drivers are one such group.  They use their cars to make a living.  Numerous constituents who are taxi drivers cannot afford to work now because of the insurance increases.  These are drivers who have completed their public service vehicle tests, they have kept their vehicles up to stringent standards by completing all the service vehicle checks and they have to deal with increased anti-social behaviour.  The increases are making it increasingly difficult for them to work.  A couple of them have said that they have been quoted excesses of &euro;10,000 per year.<\/p>  <p>  Pensioners are another group.  Many insurers will not insure persons over the age of 75, full stop.  They are not even looking for medical documentation.  We know the reasons that pensioners can rely on their cars: for getting about, a sense of independence and leisure activities.  For some of them their cars are a necessity, sometimes to pick up grandchildren.  In the case of retired people on State pensions who cannot afford to insure their car we are talking about increasing isolation and loneliness.  One particular constituent saw a 70% increase in her insurance premium this year.  This was a lady who had a no claims bonus for more than 20 years and had not changed her car.  She is now unable to use her car and she lives in an area that is not best served by public transport.<\/p>  <p>  We see the working poor and the low and middle income families.  These, again, are families who rely on their cars for everyday use, whether it is for dropping children to school, for appointments or for work.  The increase in the cost per annum is just phenomenal.  We know that part of the problem is companies like Setanta and Enterprise, foreign registered companies, going into liquidation.  It is quite astonishing that the whole industry is taking collective responsibility.  As somebody pointed out, it is somewhat like one supermarket going bust and the rest of them coming in to bail it out.<\/p>  <p>  The choice of the insurer is for the individual but there has to be a real knowledge and awareness regarding the companies and where they are regulated.  There is a need for common standards across all the jurisdictions in the EU.  We have to acknowledge that very often cheapest is not the best value.<\/p>  <p>  With these massive increases we are seeing an increase in people not taking out insurance.  We see that in recent figures from the Garda.  That is, of course, creating even more problems.  We especially see that with young drivers when accidents occur.  One of the recommendations in the report is to establish a fully functioning database which would allow garda&iacute; to check insurance compliance through technology like automatic number plate recognition.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the individual is doing his or her best in terms of insurance but I do not see the insurance companies meeting people half way.  We know the discrepancy between what the legal profession is saying and what the insurance industry is saying regarding costs.  I am sure the truth lies somewhere in between.<\/p>  <p>  We are seeing staggering amounts paid out by insurance companies.  Some &euro;1 billion yearly in 2011 and 2012, slightly less in 2013 and &euro;1 billion in 2014.  There is a need to tackle these overly generous awards.  They are not proportionate to the claim.  We have to get out of this compensation culture that so many are in because it is not fair to those who have genuine claims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100044#TT00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1488391200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for tabling this motion.  I have no hesitation in supporting it.  I want to say there is quite a lot of merit in what my colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett, has said in respect of a State insurance company.  It should be looked at.<\/p>  <p>  Since the 1980s, the compensation fund has advanced moneys to the former PMPA, to the former Insurance Corporation of Ireland, to Quinn Insurance and lately we are looking at Enterprise.  Outside of housing and health, the rise in the cost of insurance is the issue causing most concern to people.  The figures are staggering.  They are not sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  Into that comes the narrative of the insurance companies.  I have to disagree slightly with my colleague here, much to my reluctance, but I believe the narrative of the insurance companies is to put the blame on the claimants as opposed to looking at what are the problems.  In this regard I have previously quoted the former chairperson of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, Dorothea Dowling.  She points out, in respect of the narrative being spun by the insurance companies, it is only because of the existence of PIAB, with whom all injury cases must be registered, that we know the total average number of claims is 31,576.  She said PIAB can only account for 9,046 between the courts and PIAB.  There are 22,530 claims on which only the insurers have the information on who is getting what.  That should be borne in mind when listening to the narrative from the insurance companies as to what is leading to increased costs.<\/p>  <p>  Separately and entirely, there are 151,000 people on our roads without insurance.  Separate from that again, four out of every ten accidents involve alcohol.  They are some of the reasons leading to insurance claims, in addition to the failure of the insurance companies themselves to give information.  In respect of the review of the framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland, published last July, which I have read and downloaded, none of it has been implemented.  We hear tonight that something is going to happen in the next few months.  There were four very specific recommendations.  I do not know what the delay is in implementing them.<\/p>  <p>  If we go to the motion in respect of Setanta itself, in a previous life I had experience on the ground of the absolutely appalling suffering of victims of car accidents who find themselves in the position of having no cover.  Setanta got into trouble in 2014, which is three years ago.  We have this framework, published last year, but absolutely no action on it. <\/p>  <p>  There is a number of things we can do.  First, I welcome the motion and all of the recommendations in it.  Second, I am looking at the framework and I specifically ask the Minister what accounts for the delay in implementing the recommendations of that review.  Why has it not been done, in particular in relation to the database?  I see absolutely no reason for a delay.  That is one of the specific recommendations of the report.  It has not been touched.<\/p>  <p>  I will leave it at that.

I would like to be allowed use this opportunity to speak in general about what is happening in the insurance world today and about the fact that premiums in Ireland for our young people and business people are spiralling out of all control.

Debates such as this one create a feelgood factor, but it is ordinary people who are suffering from the consequences of high insurance right around the country.<\/p>  <p>  We debated the issue of water this week, while at the same time people are losing &euro;500, &euro;600 or &euro;700.  Businesses are losing up to &euro;25,000 - insurance hikes in the lorry industry have been as high as that.  We need to address this problem rapidly.  We are losing businesses to other countries, in particular in the transport sector.  Businesses are going to Bulgaria because they can get insurance for about one tenth of what they have been quoted here.  Insurance for farms and houses is also increasing.  I have not heard the issue of flooding mentioned during the debate.  Deputy McGrath is involved in the issue.  <\/p>  <p>  If all sides of the D&aacute;il are willing to solve this problem, we will need to deal with the bill of quantum.  The issue of scam claims has to be addressed.  Unless we do that, we will not bring down the cost of insurance.  We need a bill of quantum that does not award people astronomical sums of money for hurting their big toes, fingers or whatever.  We cannot keep going the way we have been because there is a finite number of people in the country.  <\/p>  <p>  We cannot handle the insurance companies; rather, we have to make sure that we handle the court system so that the craziness does not continue.<\/p><p>People and businesses that paid &euro;20,000 last year are being asked to pay &euro;35,000 and &euro;40,000 this year, but they are not getting any more themselves for their work.  In fact, they may be pricing work tighter.  Unless we do something about this, we will see them leaving the country, which is no good to us because they will not be paying their taxes here.<\/p> <p> Young drivers are being screwed at the moment.  I have raised this issue on numerous occasions, including today at the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We can make sure that a car will not travel at any more than 50 km\/h or 60 km\/h.  It is the same as a lorry.  This ability is in all lorries and buses in the country.  Why can we not do something positive such as that and give young people insurance for the same price as those who have been driving a few years?  If they then have a crash, tough luck.  However, if they know that they are getting the chance they deserve to start off in life at the normal rate, they will mind themselves.  We need to do such simple things and ensure that we attack the likes of the book of quantum.  We can talk about it until the cows come home but insurance companies will do what they like.  Insurance companies in other countries came here and then left people high and dry.  These people were paying monthly and some had borrowed money to pay these companies.  However, they ended up with no insurance and all they were told in the media was to go and get other insurance.  If this keeps happening to people, they will get fed up with it.  <\/p> <p> The number of people who are uninsured needs to be clarified.  This issue has been written about in a few newspapers but the number needs to be questioned.  I do not think that many people are uninsured.  People are scraping together the cost of insuring vehicles.  However, many people might have an old car that they did not deregister thrown in the back of the yard and, because it is still registered, it is showing up as being still on the road.  The figures contained in these great surveys from the so-called experts might not be as accurate as we think.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100045#UU00600","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488392400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Aindrias Moynihan, who is sharing time with Deputies Eugene Murphy, Anne Rabbitte, &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Kevin O'Keeffe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100046#VV00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1488392400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>The issue of motor insurance is severely impacting people throughout the country and we need to see the Government take action that will reduce insurance premiums.

For many people, despite the fact that they are driving the same car, the increases have been well over 50% over the past three years.  It is the same risk for the same person, but the insurance premium has dramatically increased.  This is not right and should not be allowed to continue.<\/p>  <p>  People are finding it difficult to insure cars that are more than ten years old or are being denied insurance outright.  This hits younger drivers who are trying to put their first car on the road to get to work or college much harder than others.

It should undertake an awareness campaign to ensure that motorists are fully informed about the different regulatory status of firms selling motor insurance, formally raise any concerns it may have with the relevant European authorities so as to ensure that the system of regulation of insurance firms across member states involves common standards which are applied consistently, and address any staffing and resourcing issues which may currently restrict its ability to supervise and regulate the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that the collapse of an insurance company causes great distress to motorists.

I thank my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, for bringing this Private Members' motion to the floor of the House.  The fact that it is three years since the collapse of Setanta Insurance and 1,666 claims remain unsettled at a cost of up to &euro;95 million is wholly unacceptable.  The report of the Department of Finance that was published in July 2016, which reviewed the future framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland, seems to carry little interest for those who run the motor industry.  That the insurance industry appears to have made little or no attempt to implement its proposals is further evidence that it seems happy to ignore the will of the House and that of the Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  The behaviour of the insurance industry as a whole in this country over the past number of years can be compared to that of the drug cartels.  In the case of Setanta Insurance, it was selling its services here while it was supposedly regulated in Malta.  The behaviour of the insurance industry has seen individuals and families lose their independence as a result of the inexcusably high premium rates for insurance and driving will soon become a luxury for the wealthy.  It is also one of the reasons little public transport is available in rural areas.  Hackney services cannot afford to pay for the insurance required to run a service in these communities.<\/p>  <p>  The insurance industry as a collective entity needs to be reined in by the Government.  Legal action must be taken against any nation that fails to properly regulate an insurance company that is registered within its jurisdiction and selling insurance in Ireland.  The failure of the authorities in Malta and Gibraltar to adequately regulate Setanta Insurance and Enterprise Insurance has cost Irish customers more than &euro;100 million and affected more than 15,000 people.<\/p>  <p>  This Private Members' motion is vital as it will provide clarity for customers in the event of another insurance company folding.  It seeks to hold to account those who were accountable for the collapse of Setanta Insurance and to address all outstanding claims as a result of its collapse.  Those affected have been waiting three years.  They need our support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100046#VV00500","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speech","time":1488392400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>The big problem is sympathy with no action.  I congratulate my colleague for bringing this motion before the House.  The idea that people have been waiting years for compensation for accidents is not sustainable and, at the end of the day, responsibility for these issues rests with Government.<\/p><p>Governments should always look after those who are hurt through no fault of their own.  People bought insurance in good faith and when they were involved in accidents and the other party involved took a third party claim against them, it transpired that, despite being clearly in the right, the third party was left out to dry by the Government.  It is not good enough to abstain from or vote for the motion.  What we need is action because the challenge presented by insurance must be addressed. <\/p> <p> The other day, I was contacted by an individual who has a clean driving record and previously held a taxi licence, for which he took out taxi insurance.  He later left the industry for four years to attend university and better himself but was unable to find a job afterwards and decided to resume driving a taxi.  The individual in question was quoted - I saw the quotation - &euro;13,000 for taxi insurance for one year, despite having a clean driving record and having held private insurance on a private car for the four previous years.  Mature women with an impeccable driving record and full no claims bonus are being quoted &euro;1,200.  We are all aware of younger people who have been quoted &euro;4,000, &euro;5,000 and &euro;6,000 for motor insurance.  This issue must be addressed.  People wonder about pressure on wages but it is no good putting money in one pocket if it is coming out of the other pocket at such a fast rate. <\/p> <p> Former policyholders with Setanta Insurance should be compensated and the money recouped by the State.  The sum involved is negligible for the State in the greater scheme of things but a substantial amount for the individuals concerned.

We had an interesting discussion and there is an understanding on all sides of the significant impact that the liquidation and administration of insurance firms has had on policyholders in recent years.  As explained by the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Pat Breen, the Government will abstain from the vote on the motion.  However, I emphasise our agreement with elements of the motion.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State detailed, the liquidation of Setanta Insurance in 2014 highlighted weaknesses with the current insurance compensation framework.  This weakness has led to a delay in the processing of the claims of Setanta policyholders until the outcome of the court case between the Law Society and the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, is known.  Prior to this case, the Insurance Compensation Fund, ICF, would have been expected to meet the third party claims up to a limit of 65% and a ceiling of &euro;825,000 per claimant.  However, in September 2015, the High Court ruled that the MIBI was liable for the third party claims in respect of Setanta Insurance, a ruling which was upheld by the Court of Appeal.  The MIBI appealed this decision to the Supreme Court in October 2016 and judgment has been reserved.  It is unclear when the judgment will be delivered.  Officials from the Department of Finance made inquiries but have been unable to get confirmation as to when this will happen.<\/p>  <p>  The Government understands the position of Fianna F&aacute;il in regard to these issues and the reason the motion has been tabled.  As the Minister of State acknowledged, the Government is in broad terms sympathetic to the issues raised in the motion.  However, I propose to make brief reference to the Government's two key concerns with it.  The first issue relates to requiring the Insurance Compensation Fund, ICF, to compensate Setanta policyholders in advance of the Supreme Court decision.  This is a sensitive matter, as the High Court has found that the MIBI, rather than the ICF, is liable for these claims.  Consequently, to compensate policyholders from the ICF would be in direct conflict with the decision of the courts and could be interpreted as undermining their authority.<\/p>  <p>  It must be stressed that until the judgment of the Supreme Court is delivered, there will be a delay in processing outstanding third party motor insurance claims as the MIBI will not pay out on these claims unless it is confirmed by the Supreme Court that it is liable.  I am sure my Opposition colleagues understand that the timeframe for the delivery of a court judgment is not something that can be interfered with.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue relates to giving consideration to taking legal action against the Maltese and Gibraltar authorities for losses arising from inadequate regulation of Setanta Insurance and Enterprise Insurance.  This is an understandable request given the impact the liquidation of these companies had on consumers in Ireland.  In addition, it is of concern to the Government that the failure of such firms can have a direct effect on the price of insurance here.  Notwithstanding this, the advice received on this issue is that there is insufficient likelihood of a successful action to justify the costs that would be incurred in taking this course of action.<\/p>  <p>  Aside from these concerns, there are other elements of the motion on which I propose to comment.  The Minister of State provided an update on the position regarding Setanta and Enterprise, with 1,658 claims outstanding in the case of the former company and 233 claims outstanding in the case of the latter company.  While there has been little change in the outstanding claims figures for Setanta in the past year, progress can be accelerated once the liability issue has been settled by the Supreme Court.  In the event that the Supreme Court finds the ICF is liable, the necessary resources will be made available, which will allow the liquidator to address without further delay all outstanding claims, subject to the limits in the legislation.  Should the High Court decision be upheld, the industry will be responsible for meeting the outstanding third party claims.<\/p>  <p>  While the litigation is ongoing, the Department of Finance is looking to the future by working to finalise the implementation of the motor insurance compensation framework.  This will provide clarity on the respective roles of the insurance compensation framework and the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland in the event of the future collapse of motor insurance firms selling in Ireland.  This work involves amending primary legislation and it is expected that a legislative proposal will be brought to government for approval before the end of the second quarter of 2017. <\/p>  <p>  On the suggestion that the Central Bank undertake a consumer awareness campaign, this is a matter for the bank to consider.  However as indicated by the Minister of State, the bank is conducting a thematic review and inspection of managing general agents appointed to carry out business on behalf of insurance undertakings from other member states operating in Ireland on a freedom of service basis.  The Central Bank has also indicated that insurance undertakings and their appointed managing general agents must disclose in full all relevant material information in a way that best informs the consumer.  This includes making it very clear as to who is underwriting an insurance policy.  The Central Bank has also engaged with EIOPA, the European regulatory body for insurance, on the issues raised in the motion to ensure common standards are applied consistently across member states.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there is uncertainty for the insurance sector as a result of Brexit.  The issue of whether UK based financial services firms will have access to the European Union's Single Market post-Brexit will form part of the negotiations once Article 50 is triggered.  Prior to the conclusion of these negotiations, however, there is no way of knowing what will be the position.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State noted, if the position of passporting is not satisfactorily resolved, insurers which currently have branch operations or conduct freedom of business into the State will have the option of applying for an authorisation to conduct business in the State from the Central Bank.  As regards what has been described as regulatory shopping, it has been made clear that the Government is taking this issue seriously and there has been communication on the matter with our European partners.<\/p>  <p>  The motion refers to the European Union freedom of services rules, under which an insurance company can be prudentially regulated in any member state and avail of the passporting provisions to sell insurance business in Ireland.  It is worth noting that this is an important aspect of Ireland's obligations as an EU member state.  While there have been cases that have caused difficulty, for example, Setanta Insurance, Ireland has also positively benefitted from these EU rules, in particular through our large life insurance sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has acknowledged the matters outlined in the Private Members' motion.  There is no doubt that the liquidation process is very difficult and frustrating for persons who have been waiting for a long period to have a claim resolved.  Deputy Michael McGrath spoke of persons who have been out of work for a number of years as a result of accidents and are faced with mounting expenses which cannot be dealt with until their claim is finalised.  Unfortunately, there are matters at play which are outside the control of Government.<\/p><p>While I understand the call for claims to be paid out without delay, we are not in a position to pre-empt the decision of the Supreme Court.  Once the Supreme Court decision clarifies the question of liability for third party Setanta Insurance claims, more progress can be made for claims to be paid either through the ICF or the MIBI.  In addition, we have outlined the steps we are taking to address this issue.  Legislation to address it is being progressed and it is proposed to bring the heads of a Bill to amend the current ICF legislation to implement the framework for motor insurance report by the end of the second quarter of this year.  This legislation will ensure that there is clarity as to the respective roles of the ICF and the MIBI.<\/p> <p> As indicated by the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, the Government will abstain from the vote on this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100047#WW00200","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1488393600,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Pat Casey is sharing time with Deputies Lisa Chambers, Eamon Scanlon, Jackie Cahill and Michael McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100048#XX00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1488393600,"counter":510,"content":"<p>This motion is welcome.

I know of a commercial business in Arklow that is being held hostage by the failure of this Government to tackle the insurance industry.  Its story perfectly illustrates the unacceptable monopoly of the insurance industry in Ireland.  This long running family business has seen a rise in its commercial motor insurance of almost 45% this year alone.  This cost increase to this company, which is an excellent employer in Arklow, is threatening the viability of the business.  The obvious response is to tell this company to shop around for a competitive quote.  Not only can this family business and local employer not get a competitive quote, it cannot get a quote for the same cover from any competitor in the insurance industry.  The only alternative quote would not provide cover to its employees which, in effect, makes it meaningless.  This business, as in the case of many other businesses, is being held hostage by the insurance companies which can charge what they like as they know there is no option other than to close the business.

I would welcome more details in that regard.  The lack of regulation in other jurisdictions has a serious negative impact on Irish consumers.

For the Government to sit back and abstain from the vote and not to deal with the issue or take on board the sensible and reasonable suggestions from across the Houses shows a serious lack of commitment on its part to tackle and address this issue.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the Minister of State's statement that the advice that has been received on this issue is that there is insufficient likelihood of a successful action to justify the costs which would be incurred in taking this course of action, I ask that she present that advice to the House and allow Deputies to assess it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100048#XX00400","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1488393600,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il has identified 23 insurance companies regulated in other European jurisdictions but allowed to sell motor insurance to Irish customers.  These companies are similar to Setanta Insurance and Enterprise Insurance which collapsed last year, affecting 14,000 motor insurance customers with over &euro;6 million in claims outstanding.  The liquidator for Setanta Insurance has said that the number of open claims was 1,678 as of 31 May 2016.  I understand that the claims reserve position stands at &euro;95.2 million.  More than 70% of claims will not be covered by the liquidation.  Following the collapse of Setanta Insurance approximately 75,000 motorists here were left without cover.  This motion calls on the Government to provide the necessary funding to the Insurance Compensation Fund to resolve the Setanta case pending the decision of the Supreme Court.  It further calls on the Government to consider taking legal action against the Maltese and Gibraltar authorities for the losses arising from inadequate regulation of Setanta Insurance and Enterprise Insurance, respectively, and to finalise the motor insurance compensation framework so claimants are protected in the event of the future collapse of motor insurance firms selling insurance in Ireland.  Consumers may assume they are buying insurance from Irish companies but in reality they may be buying foreign insurance products sold through Irish brokers.  Consumers do not have the expertise to analyse whether a firm is likely to get into difficulty.  Even those charged with that responsibility find it difficult to determine that.<\/p><p>Following the collapse of Setanta Insurance, it was impossible for consumers to correspond with the liquidator or to attend meetings as they were all held in Malta.  The failure of foreign regulated motor insurance companies is directly increasing the cost of insurance for motorists in Ireland.  Consumers have effectively been told to accept these extortionate increases without any explanation.  Premiums have increased by more than 50%, on average, in the last two years, with many drivers quoted increases of up to 100% to renew their cover.  The outstanding claims caught up in Setanta Insurance and Enterprise Insurance need to be resolved.  Consumers should be made aware of the different regulatory firms selling business into Ireland.<\/p><p>I know of a young man who had to go to England to work, prior to which he had a 16 year no claims bonus in Ireland.  He worked in England for four years, during which time he had motor insurance and no claims.  When he returned to this country and sought insurance cover he was told his no claims bonus was invalid because he had broken his insurance record.  That is disgraceful.  No insurance company should be allowed to do that.  <i>Confused.com<\/i>carried out a survey in Northern Ireland which showed that insurance premiums for young male drivers aged between 17 and 20 living in Northern Ireland have decreased by 24%, which is equivalent to a decrease of over &pound;700.  Female drivers of the same age within that region reported a 12% decrease in motor insurance premiums, which is equivalent to a decrease of &pound;260.  I do not understand how insurance companies in this country are getting away with what they are doing.  This is wrong and it should not be allowed to continue.  People are being put out of business because they cannot get public indemnity insurance and people who need a car to get to work, particularly people in rural people, are unable to afford the cost of car insurance and thus they cannot get to work.  As I said, this cannot be allowed to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100048#XX00500","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1488393600,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I will be brief to allow Deputy Michael McGrath, who brought forward this motion, time to sum up.

We need to tidy up the mess of Setanta Insurance and Quinn Insurance and to address the future of the compensation levy.  The rising cost of insurance must be tackled because it is crippling individuals and industry across the country, be that young drivers, small businesses, hackney or taxi drivers and so on.

I would have more respect for the Government position if it opposed the motion.  The only reason it is not doing so is that the Government does not want to suffer another defeat on a D&aacute;il vote.<\/p>  <p>  The people who were caught up in the collapse of Setanta Insurance and Enterprise Insurance want action by Government to address their situation, but we have not had any assurance this evening from the other side of the House that those people will not be left out of pocket.  The Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, seems to have copied and pasted extracts from the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, into her contribution.  That is simply not good enough.  We have been told that the heads of a Bill on a new motor insurance compensation framework will be brought to Cabinet in the second quarter, but that is a full year on from the publication by Government of the report on the new compensation framework.  Not only are we continuing to leave the people affected by the collapse of Setanta Insurance and Enterprise Insurance hanging in limbo, but the message we are sending out to everybody else with a motor insurance policy is that if their insurance company collapses, they, too, will be left in limbo.  There is apparently no intention to address the gap in the legislation and the lack of clarity on these matters.<\/p>  <p>  At this late stage, and as we await the Supreme Court decision, there should be renewed efforts by the Government to engage with the insurance industry.  Every attempt must be made to come up with a practical solution to assist the people whose lives have been put on hold and who have been, told through legal letters, that they could be personally responsible for the shortage in terms of outstanding claims that may arise out of the liquidation of Setanta Insurance.  In other words, they are facing the prospect of having judgments made against their family homes.  The Government has failed those people and it is not acceptable.  I plead with the Minister, even at this late stage, to engage with the industry, seek to resolve the issues and work to put in place a comprehensive motor insurance framework to deal with any future collapses that may occur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100049#YY00100","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488394200,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1488394200,"counter":516,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 6.50 p.m. and resumed at 7 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Traveller Ethnicity: Statements","time":1488394500,"counter":517,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100050#ZZ00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1488394500,"counter":518,"content":"<p>We will resume with our programme of business for the evening, statements on Traveller ethnicity.

Robbie is a 17 year old young man, the apple of his mother's eye, his future is ahead of him and the world is at his feet, yet he walks with his head down.  No more.  His mother, his family and his Traveller community want Robbie to feel the same sense of hope and opportunity as every other young person in this country.  So do I.  So does this D&aacute;il, this House of public representatives.  Today's statement of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group will go some way to ensuring Robbie and his entire Traveller family have a better future with less negativity, exclusion and marginalisation.<\/p>  <p>  As the House is aware, the Traveller community has for many years campaigned to have its unique heritage, culture and identity formally recognised by the State.  In this State, Travellers make their contribution as garda&iacute;, doctors, members of the Defence Forces, prison officers and in other occupations, so there should be no surprise that a person can identify as Irish and as Traveller.  This is a deep and personal issue for many Travellers.  On 6 February last, I invited representatives of the main Traveller organisations to the Cabinet committee on social policy to discuss the matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, and other senior Ministers.  They said it took 30 years for a Government to listen to them across the table.  The representatives spoke passionately about how this strong message from the State would be a very important symbolic and positive step in acknowledging the uniqueness of Traveller identity.  They felt it would resonate strongly among the community and help counter the stigma and shame felt by many, particularly young people, and increase feelings of respect, self esteem and inclusion.<\/p>  <p>  I was deeply moved as members of the group spoke of their own personal experiences, including their personal hopes and dreams for their children to live their lives and fulfil their ambitions.  We all want the same for our children, namely, to grow up and thrive in a society where we are all free to be who we truly are.  No one should have to hide their religion, sexual orientation, race or culture to be respected or even accepted in society.  As we discussed at the meeting, there are also darker elements across society that challenge the law of the land that must be tackled.  The Traveller community is not immune from that.  I hope that today will create a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and Government together in seeking sustainable solutions which are based on respect and on honest dialogue.<\/p>  <p>  That recent engagement and these statements from all party leaders in the House will further help generate mutual recognition and respect between the Traveller and settled communities.  For some time Ireland has implicitly recognised Travellers as having a distinct ethnic identity.  We have done so by reporting since 2000 to the Council of Europe on the situation of Travellers in Ireland in our periodic reports on the Council's Framework Convention on National Minorities.  We have also done so by reporting on the situation of Travellers to the UN and the Council of Europe in our periodic reports on the main international conventions and monitoring bodies against racism.  We have further done so by explicitly naming Travellers as a protected group in equality legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Since the 1980s, Pavee Point, together with the Irish Traveller Movement, the National Traveller Women's Forum and Minc&eacute;irs Whiden have campaigned strongly on behalf of Travellers.  They have worked hard with the community to improve living conditions, promote health and education and access to services.  They have sought to empower Travellers and have not been afraid to help them address some of their own internal challenges.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is also finalising a new national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy which will be published shortly.  The inclusion strategy is intended to bring about important changes to the lives of the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  The campaign for recognition of Travellers in Ireland as a specific ethnic group of the Irish nation, with its own unique heritage, culture and traditions has of course been part of the discussions for the new strategy.  It does not surprise us, in the context of relationships and self identities within the island of Ireland that a person can identify in different and sometimes overlapping ways.  We recognise as part of the Good Friday Agreement that a person can identify as Irish, Northern Irish or British and that this self identification can vary with greater emotional commitment to one or other element depending on the circumstances.  Under the same Good Friday Agreement, we formally recognise the identity of people of Ulster Scots heritage, including in the three Border counties, and we support the development of their unique heritage and culture, without prejudice to their equal citizenship in and loyalty to this Republic.<\/p>  <p>  Our Traveller community is an integral part of our society for over 1,000 years, with its own distinct identity - people within our people.  It a great privilege for me to be the person that has the honour of making this statement.  I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, at the Department of Justice and Equality and the national Traveller organisations who undertook substantial work to bring clarity to the debate, and all of the other public representatives who have assisted in any way in the work that brought us to this point.  Together, we agreed that recognition of Travellers could have a transformative effect on relations between Travellers and wider society, and will create no new individual, constitutional or financial rights.  Because, of course, Travellers already enjoy all the human rights and responsibilities that are afforded all people under the Constitution and laws.  The acceptance and implementation of those rights and responsibilities has to work both ways in order for society to function effectively, inclusively and with mutual respect for all citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030100051#AAA01600","speaker":"1245"}]
