It is my intention to publish this document in the coming weeks.  That is not to say that no policies are in place as things stand.  On the contrary, every year the immigration authorities process significant levels of family reunification applications with variations in potential eligibility depending on the circumstances.  However I believe there is a need to overhaul our policies in this area.  I believe we can provide a more comprehensive set of rules and regulations so that applicants and practitioners can have a better understanding of likely outcomes and our own officials have more complete guidelines to help them in their work.  In addition I think it would be helpful for the State to explain the rationale for its policies.<\/p><p>  Family reunification is a matter of considerable importance within the immigration system and accounts for a substantial proportion of the work of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  It is entirely natural that families would wish to be together as a unit and indeed family reunification contributes in a positive sense to integration of the family members in the host country.  Moreover both the Irish Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights recognise the importance of the family.  Of course this does not equate to a right to family reunification but it has nevertheless a significant bearing on the policy choices that the Government of the day will make<\/p><p>  The Government has a duty to control immigration in furtherance of public policy, including operation of the Common Travel Area.  Ultimately family reunification policy is a question of finding the appropriate balance between the legitimate aspirations of the family and its members to reside together in Ireland and the interests of the wider society, including those relating to the economy.  Sometimes these interests will coincide and in some cases they may not. The document will focus on those areas where family reunification is a matter of national policy.  Accordingly the focus will be on family reunification both where the sponsor is an Irish national and where he\/she is from outside the EEA. Family reunification for the non-EEA members of the family of an EU national who as moved to Ireland in exercise of free movement rights are governed by EU law. The policy document will include guidelines on all the main issues involved in determining an application for residence in Ireland on the basis of family reunification including eligibility, the concept of sponsorship, dependency, financial resources and personal requirements.  <\/p><p>  To date there less than 50 visa applications worldwide in respect of family reunification awaiting consideration in anticipation of the introduction of this new policy.   It should be noted that most of the normal family caseload is not impacted.  It is only those cases of particular complexity that need to be held at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200048#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Support Services","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200048#WRA01050"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[20697\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200048#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he intends to replace the direct provision system or put a system in place that would allow asylum seekers the right to work and live independently, which would save the State a considerable amount of money; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1094","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>The Direct Provision system managed by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department remains a key pillar of the State's asylum and immigration system and I have no plans to end it at this time.

That is not so. There are no cheaper alternatives to the Direct Provision system. A key finding in the 2010 Value for Money Report on the Direct Provision system was that if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, far from saving the State money, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system.<\/p><p>  I do accept that the length of time spent in direct provision and the complexity of the asylum process itself is an issue which needs to be addressed.

The joint Cross Border Policing Strategy includes sections dealing with Operations; Cross Border Investigations; Intelligence-sharing and Security; Information and Communications Technology; Training; Human Resources, and Emergency Planning.  The two police services are jointly engaged in implementing initiatives in all these areas.<\/p><p>  I meet and maintain contact very regularly with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, to address matters of mutual concern and enhance effective co-operation and co-ordination on all criminal justice matters.  Under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Co-operation on Criminal Justice Matters we operate a structured framework to further develop this co-operation.  Officials from our Departments meet regularly to assess and report to us on developments in a number of areas where co-operation is pursued.<\/p><p>  The two Justice Departments, the police authorities and the public prosecutors North and South have jointly developed and put in place a Joint Manual of Guidance for use in criminal investigations with a cross-border element.

The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI who have responsibility for operational policing co-operation have repeatedly emphasised that the close and high quality co-operation between their forces has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives.

As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Legal Services Regulation Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature. On that occasion, I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  Such an approach can incorporate the many anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues, several of which have been of concern to Members, including that of a streamlined, single application procedure and that of an appropriate appeals procedure. This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee. Work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis, including in cooperation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General while also taking account of any relevant rulings by the Courts.

Since its inception, notable developments in this regard have been the establishment of a  Bureau Analysis Unit within the Bureau and the ongoing training and recruitment programme for asset profilers. There are now in the region of 200 asset profilers in place throughout the jurisdiction providing an asset profiling service to the Bureau.  <\/p><p>  With regard to future developments, an Expert Group, established under the auspices of my Department, is currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the Proceeds of Crime legislation with a view to identifying possible improvements which would serve to strengthen the operation of the Bureau. <\/p><p>  At international level it is recognised that well developed systems for the confiscation of criminal assets, together with law enforcement cooperation in tracing, identifying and seizing such assets, is vital to the targeting of organised crime activity. <\/p><p>  Internationally, the Bureau continues to liaise and conduct investigations with law enforcement and judicial authorities throughout Europe and worldwide in pursuit of assets deriving from criminal conduct. <\/p><p>  All monies collected by the Bureau are returned to the Exchequer in accordance with the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime legislation.

Following the Report of the Task Force on Policy Regarding Emigrants of 2002, the Irish Abroad Unit was established in 2004 to address the needs of our most vulnerable emigrants abroad and to provide greater strategic direction to the Government's engagement with the Diaspora.<\/p><p><br \/>  In partnership with our Missions abroad, the Unit works to support the most vulnerable of our emigrants, pursue appropriate legal avenues for emigration, support Irish immigration centres and new arrivals, address issues which facilitate assimilation in new home, manage our diaspora recognition programmes and engage the key influencers and leverage their experience and expertise as we work towards economic recovery.<\/p><p>Today, our Diaspora engagement policy has two key strands.  First, through the Emigrant Support Programme, we work with almost 200 Irish community organisations in over 20 countries to provide support to Irish emigrants.  Since 2004, Irish groups ranging from those providing front line services to those most at need including the elderly, isolated, vulnerable and new arrivals to those working in the culture and heritage space have received grants of over &euro;104 million under the Programme. Details of all grant recipients since 2006 can be found on my Department's website at <i>.<\/i>  I am pleased that, despite the difficult financial situation we face, the Government has maintained the 2013 funding for the ESP at &euro;11.59 million, the same level as 2012.  In addition to supporting the most vulnerable of our diaspora, we have in recent years enhanced our engagement with communities dealing with large numbers of new emigrants, particularly, in Australia and Canada.  In Canada, we support the new Irish Canadian Immigration Centre in Toronto, which I opened during my visit to Toronto in March 2012, while in Australia, the main welfare bureaus in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane all secured additional funding in 2012.  Projects aimed at supporting the needs of new emigrants will be the focus of the 2013 programme which has just closed. <\/p><p><br \/>  The second element of our policy is focussed around the work of the Global Irish Network, a group of over 300 of the most influential Irish connected business figures drawn from 40 countries.  Over the past three years, the Network has proved particularly effective in the following areas: as a source of structured advice from key players in priority markets, sectors and within multinational companies; the facilitation of high level access to decision makers in major corporations for the Government and Irish companies; a direct role in job creation through high level FDI Forums (such as the President Clinton &#8220;Invest in Ireland&#8221; roundtable n February, 2012), formal involvement in developing trade missions and Connect Ireland; over 100 members have signed up to support exporters under the Global Irish Contacts Programme providing expertise in 32 markets across 14 sectors; support and assistance with our work to build a strong international reputation; and participation in a number of new initiatives including the Gathering, the Farmleigh Fellowship, the Irish Technology Leadership Group and within the agri-food sector.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to the above programmes, the Department also works closely with our missions in the United States to address the position of the undocumented Irish and to reform our migration arrangements with the US and manages our diaspora recognition programmes such as the Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad and the Certificate of Irish Heritage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200051#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consular Services Representations","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200052#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[21082\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200052#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the representation he has made to the Lithuanian authorities in relation to a person (details supplied) who is in prison in Lithuania;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":127,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that the Embassy of Ireland in Lithuania and the Consular Assistance Section in Dublin has provided consular assistance to the person in question since that person&rsquo;s initial detention in Lithuania.

In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes. These include long-term payments such as Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment, as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  As a result of maternity benefit payments becoming liable to income tax for all claimants, from 1 July 2013, a number of possible tax outcomes could arise:<\/p><p>1. An individual may pay no income tax on their maternity benefit payment as their tax credits will be sufficient to reduce their tax liability to zero.<\/p><p>2. An individual may pay income tax on some or all of their maternity benefit payment solely at the standard rate.<\/p><p>3. An individual may pay income tax at the standard rate on a portion of the maternity benefit and the higher rate on the balance of the maternity benefit payment.<\/p><p>4. An individual may pay income tax on all of their maternity benefit payment at the higher rate.<\/p><p>  I am fully aware that some employers do not pay a top up payment to their employees whilst on maternity leave.  However, in such circumstances many mothers will not be subject to income tax on their maternity benefit payments as their personal credits will ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself. Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case, depends on the total level of income that the individual or couple concerned has in the relevant tax year or years.  <\/p><p>  I would point out that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI. <\/p><p>  Given the current budgetary constraints I have no plans to introduce a tax exemption along the lines proposed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200053#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Debt","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200053#WRF00550"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[20909\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200053#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a detailed breakdown of the debt repayments and interest repayments for Ireland for 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1023","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":149,"content":"<p>The most recent General Government interest expenditure estimates covering the period 2014-2019 are set out in the table below.

In addition, the full implementation of the new insolvency frameworks will shortly come on stream and the Government also provides mortgage interest supplement support to particular borrowers in difficulty and more general support through the taxation system to mortgaged borrowers.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is making significant progress to address the problem of mortgage arrears and believes that the ingredients of a transparent resolution process for borrowers are now in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200054#WRG01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200054#WRG01450"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[21025\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200054#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is concerned that errors in compiling the list of liable persons for the local property tax could result in Revenue making an incorrect deduction from a person's salary or State benefit payment from 1 July; the procedure that will apply to correct such occurrences if they arise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>A key aspect of the work undertaken by Revenue for the Local Property Tax (LPT) was the development of a comprehensive Register of residential properties in the State.  The Register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue&rsquo;s own databases, the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) database and data from utility companies.  Data from the various sources has been cross-checked to ensure that the Register is as accurate as possible.  As previously indicated to the House, the Register was used to issue LPT correspondence to property owners.  While the Commissioners have made every effort to correctly match residential properties to owners, they have clearly stated that, in a small number of cases, some individuals who are not liable persons will have received LPT Returns in error.  This may have occurred, for example, where landlords are not registered with the Private Residential Tenancy Board which caused the tenant to receive the Return; in cases where a person paid the Household Charge for another person; or in cases where a person's address on Revenue's database is out of date.  <\/p><p>  The Commissioners have stressed the importance of not ignoring the LPT Return.  A person who received an LPT Return but who is not the liable person in respect of the stated property, has been advised to notify Revenue in writing that they are not the liable person, who the liable person is, and to provide supporting documentation where available.  This will ensure that the LPT Register can be corrected and no further correspondence will issue to the person in respect of the LPT liability for the property.  I am advised that individuals who have received LPT Returns in error are contacting Revenue and the Register is being updated accordingly. <\/p><p>  However, where individuals fail to notify Revenue, they are likely to be included in the compliance campaign which is expected to commence in the second half of June with a view to deductions beginning in July. The compliance campaign will initially focus on pursuing payment of the Revenue Notice of Estimate through mandatory deduction at source from employment income and occupational pensions. <\/p><p>  Prior to any such mandatory deductions taking place, individuals who have not engaged with the LPT process will receive a compliance reminder.  Individuals who receive a compliance reminder from Revenue in June, and who are not the liable person in respect of the property but have failed to notify Revenue of this, will have a very short final opportunity, probably no more than a few days, to contact Revenue to provide the details of the liable person and to allow Revenue to update the Register.<\/p><p>  Some public comment suggests that non-liable persons may be deciding, or may be being advised or even encouraged not to contact Revenue and not to tell Revenue who is the owner of the property.  I consider this to be irresponsible advice.  The law provides that if a person is on the LPT Register s\/he is liable for the tax.  Furthermore, from a practical point of view, this is not a good idea.   As long as Revenue continues to connect an individual with a particular property, s\/he will be pursued for payment.  Against a background of non-engagement, or engagement which is simply too late, mandatory deduction at source will inevitably take place in some cases where the person is not liable for LPT. <\/p><p>  The Commissioners have assured me that where an incorrect mandatory deduction at source has commenced, arrangements will be made in due course to cancel it and to refund the LPT deducted, once details of the correct liable person are advised to them and have been validated.  Clearly, this is a situation which Revenue would prefer to avoid.  It will create unnecessary inconvenience for people who are not liable, unnecessary work for employers and Revenue and arrangements for refunds will take time.<\/p><p>  However, I am very satisfied that as part of Revenue&rsquo;s communications around the general issue of LPT Returns, the Commissioners sought to forewarn taxpayers that errors may occur and to provide very clear guidance on the steps that should be taken in these cases.  I am also satisfied that opportunities are being provided to individuals, who receive an LPT Return and who are not liable persons, to notify Revenue of the correct liable person so as avoid an incorrect deduction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200054#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2014 Issues","counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200054#WRG01650"},{"type":"question","counter":180,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[21026\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200054#WRG01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to publish a medium term fiscal statement in advance of Budget 2014; if this will update the planned fiscal adjustment over the period 2014 - 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>Under the draft regulations known as the &ldquo;two-pack&rdquo; which are expected to be formally adopted in May or June, a common budgetary timeline is being introduced for all Euro area member states.

The number of lending restrictions is a reflection of the Registrar of Credit Union&rsquo;s concerns about lending practices in the sector.<\/p><p>  There are currently about 58% of all credit unions subject to lending restrictions.  Almost all credit unions with a lending restriction in place have a maximum individual loan size restriction.  Of the credit unions with lending restrictions, over 71% can lend &euro;20,000 or more to an individual member, which is a sizeable amount and should cover most circumstances.<\/p><p>  Fewer than 2.5% of credit unions are restricted to issuing loans of less than &euro;10,000 to an individual member, and fewer than 1% of credit unions are restricted to issuing loans of less than &euro;5,000 per member. These are the cases where the Registrar of Credit Unions has the more significant concerns in terms of risk to members&rsquo; savings. However, the individual credit union lending restrictions currently in place are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether they are still set at appropriate levels.<\/p><p>  The Report of the Commission on Credit Unions sets out the loan to assets ratio of the credit union sector for each year from December 2006 to December 2011. The loan to asset ratio has reduced from 40.81% in December 2011 to 36.33% in December 2012, based on Central Bank Prudential Returns. The Report also states that Irish credit unions appear to be significantly under-lent. This is due in part to the overall reduction in demand for personal loans. <\/p><p>  The Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 will see the introduction of a flexible regulatory and supervisory framework for credit unions in the form of a tiered regulatory approach. This approach will assist credit unions in determining the business model they wish to adopt and will allow some credit unions to offer a greater range of services while complying with additional regulatory requirements. The Central Bank is to set out more detailed regulations on lending in the context of this tiered approach. However, the need for prudent lending with analysis of all loan applications to ensure a credit union member&rsquo;s credit worthiness will remain a vital element in safeguarding credit union members&rsquo; savings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200055#WRH00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Excise

Revenue Sheriffs, County Registrars or their officers operate for the purposes of enforcement of tax debt). It equates geographically with &quot;county&quot; while also providing separate breakdowns for &quot;city&quot; and &quot;county&quot; in the case of counties Dublin and Cork. The figures for these bailiwicks have been amalgamated to merge the results for city and county in each case.  The available information for the years requested is shown in the following tables.<\/p><p>In considering the data it should be noted that the amount of tax attributed to a county may not necessarily be an indication of economic activity in that county for any of the following reasons:<\/p><p>1.The liability of a trader to VAT is generally dealt with by reference to the location of the trader&rsquo;s registered office even though the economic activity may be carried on in another county.<\/p><p>2. An employer&rsquo;s liability for PAYE is normally attributed to the county in which wages and salaries are paid, even though the employees may work in different counties.<\/p><p>3. Companies are associated on the tax record with the county address of the head-office or branch with which contact is established for tax purposes, which may be different to the city or county addresses of other branches. The distribution of corporate tax between regions can also vary from year to year as companies relocate.<\/p><p>4.

for the Revenue Commissioners.  Firstly, I would like to briefly comment on Revenue&rsquo;s approach to tax collection and in particular its overall compliance and debt management approach.<\/p><p>  Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that every individual and business complies with the responsibility to pay the right amount of tax or duty including interest and penalties, which are due, in full and on time. That is an appropriate and correct focus for Revenue and one that I fully endorse. Delays in the collection of tax revenues properly due, adds to the level of Government borrowing and public debt interest and confers an unfair competitive advantage on non-compliant businesses. Remedying late or non compliance is preferably achieved through engagement with the business or taxpayer, but when that engagement is only partially forthcoming, or perhaps not at all, then Revenue has no option but to utilise measures such as the charging and collection of interest or the deployment of effective enforcement measures to secure payment of the tax debt and to encourage future voluntary timely compliance.<\/p><p>  In regard to the case to which the Deputy has referred, I am informed by Revenue that the Collector-General&rsquo;s office has tried unsuccessfully to engage with the person in question on a number of occasions about his outstanding tax debts, much of which was identified during a Revenue audit. While the person did previously commit to sell a foreign property to meet his tax debts unfortunately no progress was made in this regard, nor has there been any further meaningful engagement from the person. As a consequence Revenue was left with no alternative but to refer the outstanding tax for enforcement.<\/p><p>  To date the person in question has refused to engage with the enforcement agents nor has he given any instruction to his own tax advisor in this regard. Given the complete lack of engagement Revenue has no option but to continue with enforcement proceedings to secure payment of the outstanding tax. I would recommend that the person or his advisor immediately contact the enforcement agents to bring matters to a conclusion and prevent further escalation.<\/p><p>  Finally, from the Deputy&rsquo;s representation it seems that the person in question has ceased trading with effect from 4 May 2012. That being the case the person should contact Revenue to cease the relevant registration numbers, which are currently generating tax estimates and inflating the outstanding debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200055#WRH01400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200055#WRH01450"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[21083\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200055#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason participants on the T&Uacute;S scheme are not entitled to the job assist tax credit; the legal basis for this decision; the reason for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>Sections 472A and 88A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provide tax incentives for both employees and employers, to help the long-term unemployed to return to employment.

Employers are entitled to claim a double deduction in computing the profits of the trade or profession in respect of the first 3 years wages paid to qualifying employees. This double deduction may also be claimed in respect of the employers PRSI contribution on such wages.<\/p><p>  In order to qualify for the Revenue Job Assist scheme, an individual must be unemployed for at least 12 continuous months prior to the date of commencement of the employment.

As part of this group's work and following a tendering process in spring 2012, a report was commissioned from MacDougall Consulting, UK to examine a number of relevant issues regarding HPC services and demand in Ireland.  The consultant undertook a series of meetings with a range of stakeholders, including higher education institutions, relevant Government Departments and Agencies, and key industry personnel and presented a report to the Steering Group in October, 2012.  The consultant's report was prepared to assist the Steering Group in its internal deliberations rather than publication per se. <\/p><p>  Following consideration of the report, my Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation agreed that they would jointly provide core funding to the Irish Centre for High-End Computing (ICHEC) to enable it to continue to provide a strategically important high performance computing service nationally.  The Departments also decided that ICHEC would continue to be hosted by NUI Galway. <\/p><p>  The joint-funding from both Departments will amount to &euro;1.4m annually over the period 2013 to 2015, with &euro;0.7m coming from my Department.  The annual funding provision to ICHEC is subject to a range of conditions and targets involving the provision of a detailed annual business plan; ensuring best practice corporate governance arrangements; demonstrable alignment with national strategies and actions such as the Action Plan for Jobs and a national e-Infrastructure policy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200057#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":255,"content":"<p>Question No. 92 answered with Question No. 87.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teachers' Remuneration","counter":256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200057#WRK01150"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[21019\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200057#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the criteria for reaching the fifth point on the pay scale for a primary teacher who entered at point three on the pay scale in 2010.","asker":"1091","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":258,"content":"<p>Primary Teachers appointed to permanent or fixed term positions progress up the incremental salary scale to the next incremental point having completed 365 days service.

Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum. This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.<\/p><p>  Progress has been made on several of the actions for procurement reform contained in the Public Service Reform Plan. The Government agreed on 12 June, 2012 to implement mandatory arrangements in respect of the centralised purchasing frameworks organised by the National Procurement Service (NPS).<\/p><p>  Following that, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The report of the review, which was published in September, found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model. <\/p><p>  In December 2012, arising out of recommendations in the report of the review of the central procurement function the Minister announced the appointment of a Chief Procurement Officer to lead a key element of the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform agenda. The new approach to public procurement will involve:<\/p><p>- integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office;<\/p><p>- strengthening spend analytics and data management;<\/p><p>- much greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value for money;<\/p><p>- examining the specifications set out for goods and services;<\/p><p>- evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and<\/p><p>- strengthening supplier and category management.<\/p><p>  Since the appointment of Paul Quinn, CPO, on 28 January 2013, he has initiated and completed a series of engagements (workshops and one-to-one meetings) with key stakeholders within the public sector and their representatives in relation to the development of the proposed governance structures, implementation plan, transition arrangements and savings targets for the procurement function. The following sectors were engaged in workshops \/ meetings: Health, Education, Local Government, Defence, Justice, and other Central Government Departments.<\/p><p>  Further consultation will be undertaken with employees and workers&rsquo; representatives as the new Office for Government Procurement is established.

Globally, supercomputers are playing an ever increasing and critically important role in a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields of relevance to cloud technologies, big data, climate research, weather forecasting, oil and gas exploration amongst others. <\/p><p>Since 2005 the main, though not exclusive, HPC provision in Ireland has been through the Irish Centre for High End Computing <b>(<\/b>  ICHEC) which is hosted by NUI Galway. Other universities, such as Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin and NUI Maynooth also possess HPC expertise and facilities. Since its establishment in 2005 ICHEC has primarily received funding supports from Science Foundation Ireland and the Higher Education Authority.<\/p><p><br \/>  During 2012 a small steering group comprising senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) was established to assess a number of issues regarding Ireland's future HPC service provision needs and structure.  <\/p><p>As part of this group's work and following a tendering process in spring 2012, a report was commissioned from MacDougall Consulting, UK to examine a number of relevant issues regarding HPC services and demand in Ireland. The consultant undertook a series of meetings with a range of stakeholders, including higher education institutions, relevant Government Departments and Agencies, and key industry personnel and presented a report to the Steering Group in October, 2012. The consultant's report was prepared to assist the Steering Group in its internal deliberations rather than publication per se. <\/p><p><br \/>  Following consideration of the report, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation accepted the strong recommendations that continuation of HPC services in Ireland was a strategic priority; that a centralised model of high-performance computing provision was needed in Ireland; that there was an increasing demand for HPC services by industry; and that ICHEC was the preferred centralised option at this time. In light of the consultant's recommendations, the Departments jointly agreed to the continuation of core funding support to ICHEC which previously had been provided through SFI and the Higher Education Authority. The funding will amount to &euro;1.4m annually over the period 2013 to 2015, with &euro;0.7m coming from each Department. The Departments also accepted the recommendation that ICHEC should, on balance, continue to be hosted by NUI Galway in the medium term.<\/p><p><br \/>  The annual funding provision to ICHEC is subject to a range of conditions and targets involving the provision of a detailed annual business plan; ensuring best practice corporate governance arrangements; demonstrable alignment with national strategies and actions such as the Action Plan for Jobs and a national e-Infrastructure policy. ICHEC will also be subject to independent review over the period to 2015 and will be expected to leverage additional funding from industry, the EU or through national competitive research funding calls.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Recently ICHEC was successful with a bid for supercomputing equipment in the 2012 SFI Infrastructure Call. ICHEC currently has a tender out for this supercomputing equipment. This will enable ICHEC to provide leading edge computing power to a range of industry players and our higher education sector which in turn will further enhance Ireland's HPC capacity internationally. It will also assist Ireland's &#8220;Big Data&#8221; ambitions and the Government's &#8220;Disruptive Reform&#8221; agenda where we seek to be a world-leading location for big data and data analytics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200059#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Guarantee Scheme Application Numbers","counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200059#WRM00750"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[21035\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200059#WRM00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of applications for funding received to the credit guarantee scheme since it has been established; the number of approved loans; the amount that has been paid out to date; the feedback that has been received on job creation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) began operations on 24th October 2012.

Irish Water, a new State-owned water company to be established as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, will be responsible for the metering programme.<\/p><p>  The Government has also decided to assign responsibility for the economic regulation of the water sector, including the setting of charges, to the Commission for Energy Regulation. The primary role of the regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to them. An appropriate approach to charging those customers who may not be metered when charges are introduced will be put in place. The approach to charges for both metered and unmetered properties will be included in a public consultation that will take place as part of the regulatory process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200063#WRQ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200063#WRQ01750"},{"type":"question","counter":418,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[20926\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200063#WRQ01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the extent to which any evaluation has taken place of the serious local authority housing shortage with particular reference tot the total numbers of persons registered as being in need of local authority housing by way of housing lists currently registered on a county basis; if it is envisaged to adopt any particular strategy to address this issue, mindful of the cost of rent support in the absence of an adequate local authority housing stock; if he will consider a short to medium term plan to address the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[20931\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200063#WRQ01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the extent to which he has quantified the local authority housing requirements in each local authority area by reference to the number of housing applicants recorded by each authority; if it is intended to take any specific steps to address this issue in the short and medium term thereby alleviating some of the cost of rent support currently incurred annually; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":420,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[20932\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200063#WRQ02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the extent to which his Department has accessed information from the Department of Social Protection to accurately identify the number of housing applicants on local authority waiting lists who continue to be forced to rely on rent support in lieu of local authority housing; the extent to which rent support costs have been identified in full with a view to initiating a public housing campaign on a graduated basis thereby replacing some of the annual rent support costs by way of capital expenditure on housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":421,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149, 151 and 152 together.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support. I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme optimises the delivery of social housing and the return for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.<\/p><p>  My Department does not have access to information from the Department of Social Protection in respect of Rent Supplement demand or associated costs. However, when applying for social housing support, households\u00a0are required to confirm to the relevant local authority whether they are in receipt of Rent Supplement.<\/p><p>My Department also does not hold information on the number of households on local authorities&rsquo; waiting lists. This figure continuously fluctuates as households are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support. Detailed information on the latest statutory assessment of housing need which was carried out in March 2011, including a breakdown by authority and category of need, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.environ.ie.<\/p><p>or on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website www.housing.ie. \u00a0A summary assessment is due to be carried out in May 2013 and the results will be published in autumn 2013.<\/p><p>In terms of addressing the demand for social housing, the social housing capital budget has been reduced from &euro;1.535 billion in 2008 to &euro;287m in 2013 and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes. The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing. I am monitoring expenditure under my Department&rsquo;s housing programme for 2013 , together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.<\/p><p>  In spite of the challenging circumstances within which local authorities must operate the final outcome for 2012 is expected to be in the region of 4,000 to 4,500 housing units. Given the current volatility of the market and different challenges to the channels of supply it is difficult to estimate the likely output of new units for social housing this year.\u00a0However, it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2013.<\/p><p>Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government&rsquo;s objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). My Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure delivery of housing units for social purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200063#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services Provision","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200064#WRR00100"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[20927\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200064#WRR00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the progress made to date towards the implementation of a modern water policy to take account of the current and growing demands in terms of storage and transmission; the extent to which he expects to be in a position to meet the necessary targets within a reasonable timeframe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[20940\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200064#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the extent to which any evaluation has been done of the domestic and industrial water requirements on a regional basis throughout the country; the extent of the provision being made to meet such requirements over a specific period in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 160 together.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The overall strategy for investment in water services is to ensure that the timing and scale of investment facilitates economic and other development, achieves compliance with statutory requirements and promotes environmental sustainability objectives. The main vehicle for achieving these objectives for public domestic water supplies is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2013.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme provides for the commencement of contracts with a value of over &euro;800m in relation to water supply infrastructure. This includes contracts to address deficiencies in the quality of supply, to improve the overall capacity of the system and an accelerated programme of mains rehabilitation. The Programme also provides for the advancement of a further range of schemes through planning, for progression to construction in future investment cycles. The investment in water services since 2000 has led, <i>inter alia<\/i>, to an increase in drinking water treatment capacity and additional drinking water storage capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of some 1.4 million and 1.9 million, respectively.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The Programme is based on an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services, undertaken by each water services authority, which were subsequently appraised by my Department. In preparing their assessments, water services authorities were required to take into consideration key environmental and economic criteria in prioritising contracts and schemes to be progressed in their areas. The development of the Programme was strongly influenced by reports by the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water quality, and an assessment by Forf&aacute;s of the requirements of enterprise in Gateways and Hubs, as well as River Basin Management Plans. In addition, a detailed project appraisal is undertaken during the planning phase of each scheme, which determines issues such as the appropriate source of water, projected future demand and the most cost effective solution to meeting needs. There is, therefore, a strong evidence base, from technical assessments, environmental monitoring and policy studies to underpin the strategic direction of water services capital investment. <\/p><p><br \/>  The series of reforms being advanced in the water sector by the Government is designed to support additional investment in the sector. An implementation strategy is in place to deliver on these reforms. This strategy is available on the Department's website. As part of this strategy, a specific work-stream is considering the matters arising in the proposed transfer of the responsibility for capital programme delivery from the 34 local authorities to Irish Water. This includes the development of a capital transition plan to manage the orderly transition from current arrangements to the new arrangements to be put in place by Irish Water. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200064#WRR00400","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":427,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 151 and 152 answered with Question No. 149.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Service Issues","counter":428,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200064#WRR00500"},{"type":"question","counter":429,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[20933\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200064#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he is satisfied regarding the adequacy of structures of the fire services part-time and whole time throughout the country; if any particular weakness exists which might affect the ability of the services to respond in particular emergency situations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":430,"content":"<p>The provision of fire services in a local authority area is a statutory function of individual fire authorities.

In this regard, I published <i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland<\/i> in July 2012, setting out a range of measures which will significantly revise the current regulatory regime to ensure, <i>inter alia<\/i>, that waste collected is managed in accordance with the waste hierarchy, that mandated service levels are delivered and that Customer Charters are put in place by all waste collection providers.  Customer Charters will be required to clearly set out information for customers including charging structures, procedures for dealing with arrears and arrangements for switching from one waste collector to another.  Following the publication of the new waste policy, I\u00a0 wrote to the waste management industry in September and October, 2012 in relation to the development of such charters and I understand that a number of waste collection providers have already put in place a Customer Charter ahead of the development of the new regulatory regime.

Regulation 4 of the regulations places a requirement on local authorities, on or before <b>24 March <\/b>each year, to identify bathing waters in relation to the bathing season in that year and to notify the EPA of the bathing waters so identified and the reason for any change compared to the previous year.

However, the overall number of identified bathing water sites has increased from 131 in 2008 to 136 in 2012.  The additional bathing waters are in the Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Fingal local authority areas.  The 2008 Regulations require, inter alia, that bathing waters to be identified are to be all elements of surface waters where the local authorities expect a large number of people to bathe.  The term '<b>large number' <\/b>  is not defined by the Directive. In 2010 my Department issued guidance to local authorities on the identification of bathing waters, and advised them to use their own discretion in deciding a threshold for a 'large number' of bathers.  The guidance notes that this number will vary due to numerous factors, including proximity to urban areas, ease of access by road, scenic amenity, tradition of bathing at the site and proximity to recreational \/ tourism amenities. <\/p><p><br \/>  Local authorities are required to ensure that appropriate measures have been taken in relation to encouraging public participation in the process of establishment, review and updating of bathing waters. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200065#WRS01000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":457,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200065#WRS01050"},{"type":"question","counter":458,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[20975\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200065#WRS01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if there is any scheme in place in his Department for former council tenants or those on low incomes to avail of financial assistance to carry out essential home repairs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":459,"content":"<p>In the case of privately owned properties, grants are available under my Department&rsquo;s Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People With a Disability to assist households to have necessary repairs, adaptations or improvement works carried out in order to meet the accommodation needs of an older person or a person with a disability.

While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 as it was in 2012 (and 2011). Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service is currently running a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board from which appointments, both temporary and permanent, will be made within the next month or so.<\/p><p>  In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:<\/p><p>  - The Board has been piloting a 'triage' approach in its law centres to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the 'waiting list'. There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were overwhelmingly satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved.<\/p><p>  - In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres. This is a &lsquo;start to end&rsquo; system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services;<\/p><p>  - In November 2011 the Board took responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service. A key reason for transferring this responsibility to the Board was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also. Steps are now being taken to replicate this initiative in a number of other locations including Cork and Naas;<\/p><p>  - With the drop in demand for asylum services the Board has taken steps to integrate its Refugee Legal Service into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased;<\/p><p>  - The Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court;<\/p><p>  - The Board has continued to engage with other key players in the justice \/ legal area with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.<\/p><p>  I am currently considering a package of proposals from the Board for the revision of the financial eligibility and contributions provisions governing the granting of civil legal aid. These provisions may have some impact, albeit relatively marginal, on the demand for legal services and the resources available to the Board.<\/p><p>  I am very conscious of the difficulties that delays in accessing legal aid can give rise to and I am aware that the Board is also keenly aware of those difficulties and is working to ensure the delays are minimised to the greatest extent possible. I have noted some of the steps that it has taken and I know that it is constantly keeping the delivery of its services under review with a view to getting services to those most in need of them as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200067#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200067#WRW01100"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[21077\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200067#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding reform of the legal profession; the extent to which negotiations are continuing with respective interest groups; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":562,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government 2011-2016 undertakes to &quot;establish independent regulation of the legal profession to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&quot;.

Funding of some &euro;53.498m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. This funding allocation includes<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> an amount of &euro;1 million for fit-out, refurbishment works or building enhancement projects for the start-up of new Youth Caf&eacute;s. It also includes <\/font>&euro;1.35m for a Local Youth Club Grant Scheme<i><\/i>which supports youth work and youth activities in local communities.  The funding for the local youth clubs grants has not been cut in 2012 or 2013.  These grants are made available to all local youth clubs and groups through local Vocational Education Committees. <\/p><p>The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m on the funding that was available for the provision of youth services in 2012. Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of these necessary reductions in funding.  <\/p><p>A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and this report is expected later this year.  It is anticipated that this report will inform the provision of funding for youth programmes\/services going into the future.<\/p><p>In addition, my Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year.  The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote coordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.<\/p><p>The EU Youth Conference held in March in Dublin was the highlight of Ireland's EU Youth Presidency and almost 180 young people and policy makers from all 27 Member States jointly discussed social inclusion challenges that impact on young people's lives such as employment and social supports as well as the role of quality youth work. <\/p><p>The Conference, which was organised by my Department in partnership with the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) also provided a major opportunity to showcase the talent and innovation of Ireland's young people and youth sector and almost 100 young people from youth organisations and clubs around the country were involved in supporting the Conference.<\/p><p>I propose that the conclusions from the Conference will be progressed at national level, through the development of the Youth Policy Framework.  At EU level, they will inform the policy document on the importance of quality youth work to young people's development which I will bring to the Council of Youth Ministers meeting on 16 May 2013. They will also be progressed under the Lithuanian and Greek Presidencies and will form the basis of a Council Resolution on Structured Dialogue with young people at the end of the Greek Presidency in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200067#WRY01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200067#WRY01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Promotion Board","counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200067#WRY01250"},{"type":"question","counter":624,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[20988\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200067#WRY01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the role of the Food Safety Promotion Board; when the Board last reported to the North South Ministerial Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":625,"content":"<p>The Food Safety Promotion Board, FSPB, is one of six North-South Implementation Bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement in 1999.

There is no national register of FASD, therefore the number of cases of FASD, Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), and Alcohol Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND) in Ireland are unknown.  This reflects the situation in many countries in Europe.<\/p><p>  A study partly funded by the HSE is underway in the Coombe Women's Hospital in Dublin.  The study initially screened women for alcohol intake in pregnancy with a view to counselling them accordingly.  The study examined the records of 61,241 women who booked for ante-natal care and delivered between 2000 and 2007.  The study found that 81% of women reported alcohol consumption during the peri-conceptual period; of these 71% reported low alcohol intake (0-5 units per week), 9.9% moderate intake (6-20 units per week) and 0.2% high intake (over 20 units per week).  There was one case of FASD in each of these three categories of peri-conceptual drinkers.  As well as this retrospective case note study a prospective study is currently underway to examine the incidence of foetal alcohol effects on a longitudinal basis.  I have requested the HSE to provide me with an update on this study and I will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy knows the Report of the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group recommended that labels of alcohol products sold in Ireland should include health warnings in relation to consuming alcohol in pregnancy.  In relation to Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) the Report recommended to:<\/p><p>- Implement policies and clinical protocols in all healthcare settings to prevent, assess and respond to issues arising in relation to pregnant women affected by alcohol use;<\/p><p>- Strengthen FASD surveillance in maternity hospitals through the Eurocat Reporting system and promote greater awareness among healthcare professionals of FASD so as to improve the diagnosis and management of FASD.<\/p><p>   Real and tangible proposals are currently being finalised on foot of the recommendations in the National Substance Misuse Strategy report. These proposals cover all of the areas mentioned in the report, including the labelling of alcohol products and prevention and intervention activities on alcohol.   The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has considered these proposals and I intend to bring forward specific proposals for consideration by Government as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200067#WRBB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":697,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200067#WRBB00850"},{"type":"question","counter":698,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[21020\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200067#WRBB00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"in view of the fact that the new Health Service Executive access protocols should ensure that all 16 year olds are treated in a CAMHS facility from 1 January 2013 and all 17 year old from 1 January 2014, if the majority of the first tranche of an additional 150 child and adolescent community mental health team, posts have been put in place; if he will provide an update on same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1056","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":699,"content":"<p>In 2012, a special allocation of &euro;35m was provided for mental health to be used primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children's mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, and to facilitate the transfer of mental health service users from institutional to community based care.   414 posts were approved to implement the &euro;35m package of special measures. <i><\/i><\/p><p>As at 29 April, 122 of the designated 150 posts for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services have been either been filled, are under offer or awaiting clearance.

In addition, there have been reductions in average length of stay for patients and targets in relation to the number of people waiting nine months or longer have been met. I  visited a number of areas in the hospital, including  the Telemedicine Unit,  a fantastic facility that enables doctors in Tallaght to advise doctors in more remote locations like Naas, Mullingar or Portlaoise on stroke patient care,  examine  CT Scans and interact with the patient.

While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 as it was in 2012 (and 2011). Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service is currently running a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board from which appointments, both temporary and permanent, will be made within the next month or so.<\/p><p>  In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:<\/p><p>  - The Board has been piloting a 'triage' approach in its law centres to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the 'waiting list'. There is or has been a &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were overwhelmingly satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved.<\/p><p>  - In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres. This is a &lsquo;start to end&rsquo; system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services;<\/p><p>  - In November 2011 the Board took responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service. A key reason for transferring this responsibility to the Board was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also. Steps are now being taken to replicate this initiative in a number of other locations including Cork and Naas;<\/p><p>  - With the drop in demand for asylum services the Board has taken steps to integrate its Refugee Legal Service into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased;<\/p><p>  - The Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court;<\/p><p>  - The Board has continued to engage with other key players in the justice \/ legal area with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.<\/p><p>  I am currently considering a package of proposals from the Board for the revision of the financial eligibility and contributions provisions governing the granting of civil legal aid. These provisions may have some impact, albeit relatively marginal, on the demand for legal services and the resources available to the Board.<\/p><p>  I am very conscious of the difficulties that delays in accessing legal aid can give rise to and I am aware that the Board is also keenly aware of those difficulties and is working to ensure the delays are minimised to the greatest extent possible. I have noted some of the steps that it has taken and I know that it is constantly keeping the delivery of its services under review with a view to getting services to those most in need of them as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200069#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation","counter":775,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200069#WRW01100"},{"type":"question","counter":776,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[21077\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200069#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding reform of the legal profession; the extent to which negotiations are continuing with respective interest groups; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":777,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government 2011-2016 undertakes to &quot;establish independent regulation of the legal profession to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints&quot;.

Funding of some &euro;53.498m is available in 2013 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities. Targeted supports for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects. These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. This funding allocation includes<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> an amount of &euro;1 million for fit-out, refurbishment works or building enhancement projects for the start-up of new Youth Caf&eacute;s. It also includes <\/font>&euro;1.35m for a Local Youth Club Grant Scheme<i><\/i>which supports youth work and youth activities in local communities.  The funding for the local youth clubs grants has not been cut in 2012 or 2013.  These grants are made available to all local youth clubs and groups through local Vocational Education Committees. <\/p><p>The savings required under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in respect of 2013 amounted to &euro;5.393m on the funding that was available for the provision of youth services in 2012. Having regard to the savings requirements identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, my Department has tried to ensure that, in the determination process for the allocations, the front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people are protected as far as is possible from the impact of these necessary reductions in funding.  <\/p><p>A comprehensive Value for Money and Policy Review of youth funding has been commenced in my Department and this report is expected later this year.  It is anticipated that this report will inform the provision of funding for youth programmes\/services going into the future.<\/p><p>In addition, my Department is developing a new youth policy framework for publication later this year.  The new youth policy framework will aim to enhance the provision of youth services and activities and it will, inter alia, promote coordination between government departments and youth sector organisations with a view to maximising the effectiveness of the State funding available to support services for young people in future years.<\/p><p>The EU Youth Conference held in March in Dublin was the highlight of Ireland's EU Youth Presidency and almost 180 young people and policy makers from all 27 Member States jointly discussed social inclusion challenges that impact on young people's lives such as employment and social supports as well as the role of quality youth work. <\/p><p>The Conference, which was organised by my Department in partnership with the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) also provided a major opportunity to showcase the talent and innovation of Ireland's young people and youth sector and almost 100 young people from youth organisations and clubs around the country were involved in supporting the Conference.<\/p><p>I propose that the conclusions from the Conference will be progressed at national level, through the development of the Youth Policy Framework.  At EU level, they will inform the policy document on the importance of quality youth work to young people's development which I will bring to the Council of Youth Ministers meeting on 16 May 2013. They will also be progressed under the Lithuanian and Greek Presidencies and will form the basis of a Council Resolution on Structured Dialogue with young people at the end of the Greek Presidency in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200071#WRY01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":839,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200071#WRY01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety Promotion Board","counter":838,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200071#WRY01250"},{"type":"question","counter":839,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[20988\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200071#WRY01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the role of the Food Safety Promotion Board; when the Board last reported to the North South Ministerial Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":840,"content":"<p>The Food Safety Promotion Board, FSPB, is one of six North-South Implementation Bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement in 1999.

For these reasons the diagnosis of FASD is difficult and is frequently either misdiagnosed or unconfirmed.  There is no national register of FASD, therefore the number of cases of FASD, Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), and Alcohol Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND) in Ireland are unknown.  This reflects the situation in many countries in Europe.<\/p><p>  A study partly funded by the HSE is underway in the Coombe Women's Hospital in Dublin.  The study initially screened women for alcohol intake in pregnancy with a view to counselling them accordingly.  The study examined the records of 61,241 women who booked for ante-natal care and delivered between 2000 and 2007.  The study found that 81% of women reported alcohol consumption during the peri-conceptual period; of these 71% reported low alcohol intake (0-5 units per week), 9.9% moderate intake (6-20 units per week) and 0.2% high intake (over 20 units per week).  There was one case of FASD in each of these three categories of peri-conceptual drinkers.  As well as this retrospective case note study a prospective study is currently underway to examine the incidence of foetal alcohol effects on a longitudinal basis.  I have requested the HSE to provide me with an update on this study and I will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy knows the Report of the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group recommended that labels of alcohol products sold in Ireland should include health warnings in relation to consuming alcohol in pregnancy.  In relation to Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) the Report recommended to:<\/p><p>- Implement policies and clinical protocols in all healthcare settings to prevent, assess and respond to issues arising in relation to pregnant women affected by alcohol use;<\/p><p>- Strengthen FASD surveillance in maternity hospitals through the Eurocat Reporting system and promote greater awareness among healthcare professionals of FASD so as to improve the diagnosis and management of FASD.<\/p><p>   Real and tangible proposals are currently being finalised on foot of the recommendations in the National Substance Misuse Strategy report. These proposals cover all of the areas mentioned in the report, including the labelling of alcohol products and prevention and intervention activities on alcohol.   The Cabinet Committee on Social Policy has considered these proposals and I intend to bring forward specific proposals for consideration by Government as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200074#WRBB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":912,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200074#WRBB00850"},{"type":"question","counter":913,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[21020\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013050200074#WRBB00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"in view of the fact that the new Health Service Executive access protocols should ensure that all 16 year olds are treated in a CAMHS facility from 1 January 2013 and all 17 year old from 1 January 2014, if the majority of the first tranche of an additional 150 child and adolescent community mental health team, posts have been put in place; if he will provide an update on same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1056","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":914,"content":"<p>In 2012, a special allocation of &euro;35m was provided for mental health to be used primarily to further strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both adult and children's mental health services, to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention, to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, and to facilitate the transfer of mental health service users from institutional to community based care.   414 posts were approved to implement the &euro;35m package of special measures. <i><\/i><\/p><p>As at 29 April, 122 of the designated 150 posts for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services have been either been filled, are under offer or awaiting clearance.
