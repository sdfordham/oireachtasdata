Within this overall figure, both Cork housing authorities recorded a significant decrease in their figures, with a reduction of 2,000 in the City Council and a reduction of 563 in the County Council area .  The decreases in the Cork figures cannot be attributed to any one factor.  The reduction of 2,000 households on the Cork City council list was due to the interaction of a number of factors.  A significant factor would have been the work by the City Council to bring vacant council properties back into use and on the acquisition of new social housing units. Across all the build, voids and regeneration and acquisition programmes, over 730 social housing units were delivered by the City Council over 2015\/16. In addition, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) was introduced in the City Council area in June 2015.  Furthermore, Choice-Based Letting was introduced in the city in 2015 and, as part of the roll-out of this programme, households on the housing list were asked to confirm whether or not they were still seeking housing support.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, no one single factor can fully explain the reduction of 563 households in the figures for the County area.  However, given that HAP was introduced in the County Council area in September 2014, it has made a significant contribution to meeting the housing needs of applicants.  In addition, a total of 296 vacant social housing units were brought back into use by Cork County Council during the 2015-16 period, with 112 other properties being delivered for social housing use over the same timeframe.   <\/p>  <p>  As part of the process, households which were found to no longer qualify for social housing support were removed from housing lists.  For example, a large number of households in Cork and elsewhere have had their housing need met through the provision of a housing support such as RAS or HAP.  Another smaller number (approximately 5-7%) were found to have incomes that exceeded the eligibility thresholds.  Where a number of attempts had been made to contact a household (comprising at least two letters and other measures at the discretion of the authority) without success, then the household&rsquo;s application could be closed by the housing authority.  However, as has been the practice on previous occasions, where a household subsequently contacts the authority with the required information within a reasonable timeframe, then the application may be re-activated without affecting the original date of qualification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300053#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":8,"content":"<p>Question No. 10 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage to Rent Scheme","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300053#WRA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[8836\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300053#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his Department's involvement in reforming or designing a successor to the mortgage to rent scheme with the Department of Finance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, I recently published the Review of the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.

I recently published the first Status Report on Social Housing Construction Projects which shows a strong pipeline of direct construction projects that will contribute to the delivery of 26,000 new homes by 2021, and the 11,000 existing units that will bought directly from the market either at scale, using the Housing Agency&rsquo;s purchase of property portfolios, or at local level by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  It is the intention to update progress on the schemes on a quarterly basis.   <\/p>  <p>  The capacity of the private market is also being harnessed by maximising the Part V requirements on new residential developments; bringing privately owned vacant units back into productive use for social housing using the new Repair and Leasing and Buy and Renew Schemes; and harnessing the private investment interest in long-term leases or other contractual arrangements with local authorities for the supply of high quality social housing. <\/p>  <p>Rebuilding Ireland also sets out an ambitious set of targets for the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), which supports households who wish to live in high quality rented accommodation with the security of knowing that their HAP support will continue even if their household income increases.  While the level of supply in the rental market is challenging, 300 new tenancies per week have been supported by HAP so far this year and 18,250 households in total are currently supported under the scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  A number of financial and economic studies carried out either during the development of the original schemes or subsequently have supported the rationale for the provision of social housing through mechanisms such as the leasing and renting of privately owned accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  I continue to keep all of the social housing delivery mechanisms under review to ensure that they remain relevant and are responding effectively to housing needs while also ensuring value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300053#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":17,"content":"<p>Question No 15 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":18,"content":"<p>Question No. 16 answered with Question No. 14.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Accommodation Provision","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300053#WRA01800"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[8833\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300053#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 159 of 8 February 2017, if he will not be setting up any sort of hostel type accommodation for families experiencing homelessness in order to meet his target of ending the use of commercial hotels to accommodate homeless families by July 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>It is fully recognised that the period of time that homeless families spend in hotel accommodation should be minimised.  This is reflected in the commitment in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness that by mid-2017, hotels should only be used in exceptional circumstances as emergency accommodation for families.  It is intended that the long-term housing needs of homeless families will be met through a range of social housing supports, such as the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, and general social housing allocations.  The increases in Rent Supplement and Housing Assistance Payment levels from 1 July 2016, along with the recent rent predictability measures which include designated rent pressure zones, are playing an important role in terms of supporting families to remain in rented accommodation.  The Dublin Region homeless pilot of HAP saw over 800 independent tenancies created for homeless households in 2016.  A further 1,200 tenancies are targeted for 2017 across the Dublin Region and this is on track for delivery, with over 300 tenancies for homeless households having been put in place since 1 January 2017.

Indeed, a range of measures have already been taken to reduce the monthly repayments of these borrowers.  An innovative Shared Ownership Restructuring Option has been available to Shared Ownership borrowers from 1 April 2016.  This new restructuring option for SO borrowers involves rolling up all outstanding debt under a SO arrangement into a single annuity loan &ndash; i.e. the new restructured loan principal will comprise any outstanding annuity loan balance, rental equity balance, plus any arrears &ndash; with an all-sums-owing mortgage charge applying to the property.  The term of the annuity loan will be determined by the amount of the monthly repayment deemed to be affordable and sustainable for each SO borrower.  This restructuring option allows the borrower to have a regularised, restructured repayment solution which is more easily understood.  The restructuring option can lead to full home ownership for the borrower and as such allows for up\/down sizing to suit household needs.  This arrangement may be of particular benefit to those SO borrowers who are nearing the end of their annuity term but who have not made sufficient provision for the repayment of their rental equity balance.  The option may not be appropriate in all cases. For example, in some instances continuing with the current SO arrangement may be the best option for both the SO borrower and the local authority. In other cases where the outstanding debt may not be sustainable for the borrower in the long-term, the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) option might ultimately be the appropriate solution.<\/p><p>Details on the measures available to borrowers with Shared Ownership arrangements are available from their local authority. <\/p><p>Overall, local authority borrowers are encouraged to engage with their local authority at the earliest opportunity if they are having difficulty making the repayments on their Shared Ownership arrangement.

It sets out over 80 actions that the Government is taking through new policy, new legislation and innovative Budgetarymeasures to achieve that aim. <\/p><p>Pillar 4 of the Action Plan committed to development of a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector and this was delivered, with the publication of the <i>Strategy for the<\/i><i>Rental Sector<\/i>on 13 December 2016, which identifies high and rapidly rising rents as the key driver of accommodation insecurity for tenants and a factor in the termination of tenancies.  To address this situation, the Strategy introduced a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where the imbalance between demand and supply of rental accommodation is driving rent levels upwards most acutely.<\/p><p>The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 gave effect to, and provided for the immediate implementation of, the Rent Predictability Measure.  Areas of the country satisfying the statutory criteria will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones and rent increases in those areas are generally capped at 4% per annum for a period of 3 years.  The measure was introduced with immediate effect in the four Dublin Local Authority areas and in Cork City. A further 12 Local Electoral Areas were designated as Rent Pressure Zones on 27 January 2017.<\/p><p>The provisions limiting rent increases in rent pressure zones apply both at the commencement of a tenancy and at each rent review. In addition, at the beginning of a tenancy, there is a statutory obligation on a landlord in a rent pressure zone to provide a tenant with details of the rent under the previous tenancy of the dwelling, together with a statement as to how the new rent has been calculated.  The purpose of this provision is to allow a tenant to ensure that their rent complies with the legislation.  The existing prohibition on charging a rent above market rent continues to apply in all areas.<\/p><p>The Act provides that in confirming whether or not the criteria have been met, the information relating to the area concerned must be determined by the information used to compile the RTB Rent Index quarterly report.  Statistics in the report referred to in the Question are based on asking rents for those properties which are advertised on that company's website, as opposed to the RTB figures which are based on rents paid in all registered tenancies.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the latest report referred to in the Questions relates to rent price inflation in the period prior to the introduction of the Rent Predictability measures and the Rent Pressure Zones.  The data in the report underline the need for and the relevance of the Government's measures. <\/p><p>The Government's Rent Predictability measures limit rent increases to a maximum of 4% per annum - less than one third of the rate of rent inflation reported by the company referred to in the Question.  Tenants in Rent Pressure Zones can now expect to see significantly smaller rent increases than those they have seen recently - or would have faced if the measures had not been introduced.<\/p><p>The prolonged under-supply of new rental units is the key factor underpinning rent inflation.  This is borne out by the company's figures on supply, which indicate that there were fewer than 4,000 homes available to rent nationwide on 1 February, just over 1,600 of which were in Dublin. In designing the Rent Predictability Measure, the Government has sought to moderate rent increases, without negatively impacting on new investment in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300054#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payments","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300054#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[9042\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300054#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on whether changes to the housing assistance payment could be beneficial in tackling the housing crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is a key Government priority and the accelerated roll-out of the scheme on a national basis is an important early action for completion in the   Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.<\/p>  <p>  At this time, HAP is available to all households who qualify for social housing support in 28 local authority areas, with over 18,000 households currently being supported by the scheme.  The final   phased implementation of the HAP scheme will be completed with the scheme being made available to all qualified households in the administrative areas of Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council areas from 1 March 2017, subject to the necessary regulations being in place.  Since February 2015,   the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) is also managing a HAP Homeless Pilot for the four Dublin local authorities.  The focus of this pilot remains the transitioning of qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies. <\/p>  <p>  The statutory phased roll- out of the HAP scheme has proved to be an effective approach.  In this context, my Department maintains regular contact with the local authorities in order to learn from their experience of the scheme, and to address operational issues as they arise. <\/p>  <p>  The Government increased the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) (and Rent Supplement) rent limits in every local authority area, taking account of geographic variations in market rents, with effect from 1 July 2016, meeting its stated commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government and in Rebuilding Ireland.  Furthermore, additional flexibility above the existing HAP rent limits was made available to all local authorities operating HAP from the same date.  These changes have had the effect of providing further targeted supports to those households in most need; providing prospective HAP recipients with access to a greater number of properties in the market; and reducing the number of households falling into homelessness.   <\/p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. Monthly HAP payments are made directly to landlords on behalf of tenants in respect of rent, subject to rent limits and the conditions of the scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  The HAP scheme is a demand led scheme funded through a combination of Exchequer funding and tenant differential rents.  The provisional Exchequer outturn for the HAP scheme in 2016 was in excess of &euro;57 million. This funding supported both   the on-going costs of tenancies established in 2015 that continued into 2016, and the costs of the 12,075 additional households supported by the scheme nationally in 2016. Some &euro;14 million of these costs related to tenancies established in the four Dublin local authority areas.  Budget 2017 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;152.7 million, in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of supporting an additional 15,000 households to be supported by HAP in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  However, I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300054#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme Funding","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300054#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[4242\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300054#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if the investment of &euro;37.5 million as outlined in point 50 of the Action Plan for Rural Development to implement the social inclusion and community activation programme is in addition to the funds previously committed by the Department of Social Protection to the programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":56,"content":"<p>The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) was rolled out across communities, both urban and rural, in April 2015 and will run until 31 December 2017.

The RTB may make a declaration as to whether the rent set complies with the legislation and, if it does not comply, may make a declaration as to what amount would comply.  The rent cannot be increased pending the determination of the dispute.  Where a landlord carries out a rent review, a notice of new rent must be served on the tenant.  A notice of new rent must be in writing and include information in relation to the dispute resolution procedures that a tenant can pursue through the RTB if they do not believe the new rent is valid, e.g. if the rent is above market rent or above the permitted increase in a rent pressure zone.  The notice of new rent must also be accompanied by information in relation to the rents of 3 other similar dwellings in the area.\u00a0 The purpose of this provision is to ensure that tenants are adequately informed in relation to prevailing rents and are aware of their rights under the Act. In a Rent Pressure Zone, the landlord must also include information and calculations in the notice of new rent that demonstrate that any rent increase is not more than the maximum amount allowed since the rent was last set.  In addition, the new legislation provides for a statutory obligation on a landlord at the beginning of a tenancy to provide a tenant with details of the previous rent under a tenancy, and a statement as to how the rent has been calculated under section 19(4), so that a tenant can ensure that the rent set at the start of a tenancy complies with the legislation.   <\/p>  <p>  Both landlords and tenants are notified by the RTB when a tenancy has been registered.  This notification advises both parties of their rights and obligations in relation to the setting and review of rent, security of tenure, the termination of tenancies, and of the dispute resolution procedures that are available through the RTB.\u00a0 On-going education and awareness is an increasing focus of the RTB, educating tenants and landlords in relation to their rights and obligations.  One of the objectives of this approach is to encourage compliance with the law through measures which encourage best-practice and promote understanding rather than by means of sanctions and offences. <\/p>  <p>  A landlord may not terminate a tenancy under Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 except on clearly defined grounds which are set out in the Table to section 34 of the Act.  These grounds include that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, that the landlord wishes to change the use of the dwelling, and that the landlord requires the dwelling for a family member.  A landlord may not terminate a tenancy arbitrarily in order to charge a higher rent to a new tenant.     <\/p>  <p>  Amendments introduced in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015   strengthen the protections around tenancy terminations by providing for measures that guard against, for example, landlords falsely declaring that the property is needed for a family member, or that it is going to be sold.  In addition, the Act provides for graduated increases in the notice periods that must be given to tenants of the termination of a tenancy so that a landlord must now give a tenant up to a maximum of 224 days&rsquo; notice for tenancies of 8 years or more. <\/p>  <p>Where there is an abuse of the termination procedure, section 56 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides that a tenant may bring a complaint to the RTB that they have been unjustly deprived of possession of a dwelling by their landlord. On the hearing of the complaint the RTB, it if considers it proper to do so, may make a direction that damages are paid to the tenant; that the tenant be permitted to resume possession of the dwelling, or both.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300054#WRB04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing","counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300054#WRB04600"},{"type":"question","counter":84,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[8992\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300054#WRB04700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to amend the Residential Tenancies Acts to bring local authorities tenants under the terms of the acts and Residential Tenancies Board in order that they will have access to the same rights as private rented sector tenants and tenants of associated housing bodies.","asker":"1215","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":85,"content":"<p>The issue of the regulation of local authority housing, and the application of the Residential Tenancies Act to that sector, was carefully considered during the drafting of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015.

Local authorities do not source accommodation for HAP supported tenancies.    However, a dedicated placement team, the Dublin Placefinder Service, has been established to engage directly with property owners and support homeless households to find suitable tenancies under the Homeless Pilot of the HAP scheme which is being operated in the Dublin Region on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Cork City Council has established a Cork City Homeless Placefinder Service which will entail a dedicated resource that will operate together with the established HAP delivery team in the local authority. It will be charged with seeking out potential properties suitable for households currently identified as homeless by Cork City Council by establishing relationships with local property agents and landlords and liaising with individual households to establish their specific housing needs. The Service will also support homeless households to negotiate the tenancy agreements and where necessary, secure a deposit and up-front rent payment. I have no plans currently to expand this service beyond Dublin and Cork.   <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the recruitment of staff for the operation of the HAP scheme, under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive of a local authority is responsible for staffing and organisation arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. In this regard, it is a matter, in the first instance, for Chief Executives, to ensure that the appropriate staffing and staffing structures are in place.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department works closely with all local authorities and all have been invited to submit staffing sanction requests to facilitate the delivery of housing services. Each staffing sanction request is examined, on a case by case basis, having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints. <\/p>  <p>  To date, My Department has approved 83 staffing applications from local authorities in relation to the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme. This includes sanctioned posts related to staffing needs of the central transactional shared service being provided by Limerick City and County Council to all local authorities operating the HAP scheme. The HAP Shared Services Centre, which is the primary administrative support to HAP local authorities, is responsible for a range of functions including monthly payments to landlords and the collection of weekly differential rent from tenants and provides a range of efficiencies in the operation of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  In order to cover staffing and administrative costs arising from the operation of the HAP scheme in their area, local authorities are provided with a direct once-off administrative payment of &euro;150 per household set up under the HAP scheme. Some &euro;1.8m was paid by my Department in HAP administration costs directly to local authorities in 2016.

The UN Committee had expressed concern at the housing situation in Ireland, and noted in particular the limited supply of social housing and the level of homelessness amongst families and children. <\/p>  <p>  However, as I indicated previously, the UN Committee&rsquo;s observations were made on the basis of the position at the end of 2015. Since then the Government has published Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. Urgent action is being taken to deal with the challenges that currently exist in the housing sector and which were referred to by the UN Committee.  The Plan sets out a clear roadmap to achieve the Government&rsquo;s goals to significantly increase and expedite the delivery of social housing, boost private housing construction, improve the rental market, and deliver on the commitment to see housing supply, in overall terms, more than double to some 25,000 new homes every year by 2020. With regard to social housing, 47,000 new social housing units will be provided by 2021 at a cost of &euro;5.35 billion.   <\/p>  <p>  The Plan has a particular focus on meeting the housing needs of the most vulnerable members of Irish society.

Over the period 2016 to 2021, it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme and I have committed to making &euro;140m available over that period. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in Waterford and Carlow in early October 2016, on a pilot basis, and my Department is now working with local authorities to prepare for the wider national rollout of the scheme.  While an amount of &euro;6m had been made available for the scheme to deliver 150 units in 2016, I announced earlier today that I am now providing a further &euro;26m to support the delivery of 800 units under the scheme in 2016.

The scheme is underpinned by Part 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  This is distinct from other forms of social housing support where the tenant may not always find their own accommodation and instead are allocated a dwelling in accordance with Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  <\/p>  <p>  A key principle of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is that eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, which best suits their needs in their area of choice.  The local authority is not party to the tenancy agreement underpinning a HAP supported tenancy. <\/p>  <p>  As HAP is deemed to be a social housing support under section 19 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, as amended, households in receipt of HAP are not included on the local authority waiting list for social housing support.  However, HAP recipients may access other forms of social housing supports by applying to go on the local authority transfer list.  A statutory Ministerial Direction was issued in Q4 of 2014 instructing local authorities to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefitting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through the transfer option.  Furthermore, HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.  In practice, housing authorities inform HAP recipients in writing of their entitlement to apply to go on the transfer list when they are approved for HAP.    <\/p>  <p>  Tenancies supported by the HAP scheme are governed by the terms of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended) and are afforded the same protections available to all private rental tenancies, which were recently enhanced.  The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  In the case where a HAP supported tenancy comes to an end, the tenant can find alternative accommodation and retain their eligibility for HAP support or the local authority may decide to offer another form of social housing support to the tenant in accordance with their scheme of letting priorities.   <\/p>  <p>  There are more than 18,200 households supported by HAP currently in 28 local authority areas, including homeless households being supported by the DRHE operated scheme for the Dublin Region, and the scheme is working well for the households who are benefitting from the security of the long-term housing support that it offers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Rents","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD01350"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[8828\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if carer's allowance is assessed as income when local authorities are determining rents to be charged under the differential rent scheme.","asker":"1232","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>The making and amending of rent schemes is the responsibility of local authorities as an integral part of their housing management functions, subject to broad principles laid down by my Department in Circular letter HRT 3\/2002 of 6 March 2002.

Therefore, decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual local authority to consider in accordance with their own rent scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 allows the Minister to make regulations in respect of various matters to be included in a rent scheme.

This very substantial investment in personnel is driven by our commitment to ensuring that all citizens have the reassurance of a visible, responsive and effective policing service. <\/p>  <p>  At present there are approximately 2,000 civilians in the organisation carrying out senior management, administrative and technical roles.  4,000 civilians will effectively double this figure and represents a medium term target of 20% civilians over the next 5 years.  This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained police men and women, are available for and utilised in operational areas.<\/p>  <p>  To support the implementation of this vision, Budget 2017 has provided funding for 800 Garda trainees, 300 Reserves and up to 500 civilians.  The recruitment and appointment of these additional civilians will facilitate the Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional levels, and also to begin the phased redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front-line policing roles.   These additional resources will make an important contribution to the delivery of the ambitious reform agenda set out in the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 and will facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has agreed that the 20% target will be achieved through a twin-track approach: firstly, the identification of Garda&iacute; filling roles that could be done by suitably qualified civilians of whom the Garda Inspectorate has indicated there may be in the region of 1,500, and secondly, the application of a \"civilian by default\" policy.  Under this policy all new posts, other than operational policing posts, and non-operational policing posts that become vacant, will be filled by civilian staff with the appropriate skills and expertise.  Having regard to the Policing Authority's statutory functions in relation to approving the number and grades of civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and making senior appointments, I have requested the Commissioner, in conjunction with the Authority, to prepare a 5 year plan to achieve the 20% target through the rigorous application of these policies.  Work is underway on this plan and I am informed by the Authority that of the 500 civilians to be recruited this year, Garda management has indicated that some 30% will lead to redeployment opportunities which is a very welcome start on a road that has the potential to make a huge contribution to ensuring that we have an effective and efficient police service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Retirements","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD02950"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[9153\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the total number of garda&iacute; likely to retire in the course of 2017 and 2018 in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency; the likely number of replacements on completion of training; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.<\/p><p>I am assured that Garda management keeps the allocation of resources of a Regional Divisional and District level, under continual review taking into account of a range of factors including retirements, in the context of crime trends, and policing needs to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.<\/p><p>Retirement of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by statutory provisions which set the mandatory retirement age for all members at 60 years of age.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b>Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who joined the organisation prior to 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension once they have served for at least 30 years and they have reached 50 years of age.

It is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, the burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend.  Indeed, the most recent CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q3 of 2016 show a decrease of 31% in burglary for the twelve months ending 30 September 2016 compared to the previous twelve month period.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.  If we look at the first nine months of 2016, the figures for the Sligo Leitrim Garda Division show a reduction in Burglary of 38% compared to the same period in 2015. <\/p>  <p>  If I might illustrate the scale of Garda activity against burglary and property crime &ndash; under Operation Thor we have seen 38,894 crime prevention patrols and in the order of 50,823 targeted checkpoints nationwide.  There have also been in the region of 3,053 arrests and 3,733 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. <\/p>  <p>  We have also seen the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015.  These provisions are now available to Garda&iacute; in relation to prosecutions arising from the concentrated drive against crime which is being implemented under Operation Thor, which is supported by very significant investments in Garda resources.  The reduction in burglaries as a result of Operation Thor will not of course be indicated in the detection rate statistics when they become available for the relevant period but the prevention of crime is always preferable to crimes having been committed which must then be detected.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act was commenced a year ago and introduced the DNA database, which provides Garda&iacute; with investigative links ('hits') between people and unsolved crimes including burglaries.  It is anticipated that this should significantly assist in improving detection rates for burglary over the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, Operation Thor and the drive against burglary is supported by the commitment to increase Garda numbers to a Force of 15,000 as well as the very significant resource allocations which the Government has made to ensure by a strong and visible police presence throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Closed-Circuit Television Systems Provision","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD03550"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[9174\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there are any capital funding streams for the provision of new public CCTV systems; if there are any current funding streams to assist garda&iacute; with the monitoring of such systems; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1294","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":214,"content":"<p>I am very conscious of the value that communities, especially rural communities, place on CCTV as a means of deterring crime and assisting in the detection of offenders.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to providing investment in CCTV systems and that I have secured &euro;1 million in Budget 2017 to begin a new round of community CCTV schemes in line with the Programme. <\/p><p>My Department is currently developing a framework for the scheme and, while applications are not being invited or considered at this time, I expect to make an announcement in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":215,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD03750"},{"type":"question","counter":216,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[9176\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if consideration will be given to the need for an independent complaints mechanism for those persons living in direct provision; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":217,"content":"<p>I have agreed that the remit of the Offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children should be extended to allow them to receive complaints from persons residing in State provided accommodation.

The transitional arrangements apply to certain applications for refugee status and subsidiary protection which were made before the commencement date (31 December, 2016) and were not finalised for processing by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).<\/p>  <p>  The planning for the commencement of the Act took place during 2016, involving consultation with Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and correspondence with applicants alerting them to the transition arrangements.  I am informed by the Chief International Protection Officer that, as is required by the 2015 Act, in late January\/February 2017 the IPO, in addition to placing advertisements in the national media, wrote to approximately 3,000 applicants whose cases were not finalised by the ORAC or the RAT, to inform them of the commencement of the relevant provisions of the 2015 Act and how the transitional provisions would affect their applications.  All applicants received the following documents with the mailshot:<\/p>  <p>   - Information Note - Transitional Arrangements (IPO 12),<\/p>  <p>   - Information Booklet for Applicants for International Protection (IPO 1) and,<\/p>  <p>   - Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2).<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the relevant mailshot was sent on an incremental basis initially to both adult applicants in Direct Provision and to those with private addresses. That information was sent out first in English followed by material in 17 other languages.  Forms are currently being sent out to minors who have applications in their own right.<\/p>  <p>  On 30 January 2017, the IPO wrote to all legal representatives on record, providing comprehensive information on the new legislation.  In addition, notices were circulated to Direct Provision centres in relation to the mailshot.<\/p>  <p>  I am also informed by the Chief International Protection Officer that he has held a number of meetings with NGO's and the UNHCR over recent months, through the IPO Customer Liaison Panel, to brief them on the arrangements for the commencement of the Act and for the notification of applicants in relation to the transitional provisions and how these will be operated in practice.<\/p>  <p>  Early access to legal advice is a recognised success factor in the operation of a single applications procedure and the position in with regard to the Legal Aid Board and its role is set-out in my response to PQ Number 87 also for answer today.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure applicants had sufficient time to familiarise themselves with this new system, there is no deadline, statutory or otherwise, set in any correspondence sent out by the IPO.  I can inform the Deputies that the information sent to applicants in January\/February 2017 made clear in Paragraph 7.3 that the Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) should be returned \"if possible, no later than 20 working days from the date of the covering letter\".  The next paragraph 7.4 went on to state clearly that opportunities to add to the information supplied exist up to two weeks before the scheduled interview.  The word deadline or statutory deadline does not exist and no negative consequences for failing to meet an 'if possible' time frame were included or implied.  The twenty working day time frame reflects the willingness of the IPO to begin work on the new single procedure as soon as possible in respect of legacy applications.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to restate that this is purely an administrative time-frame and NGOs and service providers have been informed of that throughout the planning process.  Flexibility is being provided by the International Protection Office, a call centre is available to answer any queries and if extra time is required for its completion, as the wisdom of accessing legal advice is stressed in the questionnaire, no impediment or disadvantage exists to prevent the careful filling out of the new single application form.  I understand, so as to remove any false impressions that may be circulating abroad that the 'if possible' time-frame is some sort of statutory deadline, the IPO has again written to the members of the Customer Liaison Panel in the past few days to confirm the arrangements and that similar clarification is being provided on the IPO website.<\/p>  <p>  Applicants have also been clearly advised, as referred to above, that should they or their legal advisors need to provide supplementary information to the International Protection Office after the they have submitted the questionnaire, they can also do so, up to two weeks prior to the date of their scheduled interview, if possible.  This timescale will facilitate the translation of documents if required and ensure that the IPO interviewer has all their papers available and considered in advance of the interview date.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the processing of cases, when the application for International Protection Questionnaire and other supporting documentation is returned by applicants, I am advised by the Chief International Protection Officer (CIPO) that he intends to schedule applications in the IPO primarily on the basis of date of application (oldest cases first).  The prioritisation of international protection applications is provided for in the International Protection Act 2015 subject to the need for fairness and efficiency.  The CIPO intends to publish a Statement shortly on the planned approach to prioritisation, having consulted the UNHCR and relevant NGO's on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  There are over 100 staff assigned to the IPO at present all of whom have been authorised to perform the functions of international protection officers.  These staff will be used to support the single procedure process and in undertaking a variety of functions such as the registration and fingerprinting of applicants, the issue of Temporary Residence Certificates, the scheduling of cases for interview as well as interviewing applicants and preparing and issuing international protection recommendations and decisions in relation to permission to remain.  The permanent staff are supported by a Panel of some 35 persons with legal expertise who are retained on a contract for service basis to undertake interviews and prepare international protection recommendations and permission to remain decisions.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of training, Deputies will wish to be aware that all staff employed in the IPO, as well as Panel members, have previously served in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner so they have considerable expertise in the protection area.  In addition to this expertise and training already provided, case processing staff and Panel members in the IPO have received substantial training on the assessment of applications in the context of the introduction of the single procedure process and more training is planned over the coming weeks.  Such training is provided by a combination of in-house experts in that Office as well as by the UNHCR. In this regard, UNHCR protection and training experts have been located in the ORAC for the purpose of supporting the protection determination process there for a number of years.  In the context of the single procedure, a UNHCR expert from Canada with considerable expertise in the operation of a single procedure process is currently working in the IPO for the purpose of developing internal procedures, providing protection training and supporting quality assurance systems.  That international expert is supported by other UNHCR experts as required.  <\/p>  <p>  You will appreciate that the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015, which provides for the introduction of the single application procedure, represents the most fundamental reform of the international protection process in the State for nearly two decades.  Therefore it is essential that no statutory deadline is imposed on applicants by the IPO.  The single procedure process, unlike the previous process which involved multiple bodies and procedures, will result in a more streamlined approach contributing to the determination of status for applicants at a much earlier stage than has been the case to date, and consequently, shorter stays in the Direct Provision system.<\/p>  <p>  While it is recognised that, for a transitional period, applicants will be required to become familiar with the new arrangements, I can assure the Deputies that support will be provided by the International Protection Office and other relevant State authorities to ensure that clarity is available to applicants on the new arrangements and how they will impact on individual cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[9184\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300056#WRD04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the resources that have been made available to services such as the Legal Aid Board to assist asylum seekers with the lengthy IPO 2 forms; the means by which asylum seekers have been made aware of such steps; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>I am informed that since the commencement of the International Protection Act, the Legal Aid Board has committed to providing all international protection clients with early legal advice on all aspects of their application (including, for example, Asylum, Subsidiary Protection and Permission to Remain).

The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply and works closely with dedicated Divisional Drugs units and other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.

The Government also included in the scheme the laundry that was attached to Stanhope Street Training School and later also decided to include a 12th institution, the Training School in Summerhill..<\/p><p>The Quirke Report recommended that the Magdalen women should receive the same range of medical services as those provided to women who were infected by Hepatitis C as a result of State actions.  This has happened.  In his report Judge Quirke noted that not all of the services provided to the Hep C victims may be directly relevant to the Magdalen women and, so for example<i>,<\/i>Hep C-specific medicines and treatments do not apply to the Magdalen women.<\/p><p>Judge Quirke made no mention of alternative therapies in his report nor are they mentioned in the<b><\/b>Health (Amendment) Act 1996 or the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act, 2015, which made specific medical provision for Hepatitis C and Magdalen women respectively.  The question of alternative therapies has been raised before, including in a D&aacute;il Question from this Deputy on 24 March, 2015.  If a case were to be made for the provision of effective and proven alternative medical therapy services for Magdalen women, such provision being on an administrative basis outside of the aforementioned legislation, I would consult with my colleague the Minister for Health on the request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300057#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Sales Legislation","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300057#WRE02600"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[9385\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300057#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to amend licensing laws to allow vintners the option of normal trading on Good Friday; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":264,"content":"<p>The position is that the statutory provisions relating to the sale of alcohol on Good Friday, which have historical origins, will be examined in the context of the forthcoming Sale of Alcohol Bill.

As such, I do not intend to remove this requirement to register or to allow the rebate be paid directly to the first time buyer when they are purchasing a home from a contractor.  <\/p>  <p>  The Help to Buy scheme is a generous incentive that facilitates the purchase of a new home by a first time buyer.  For new builds, the rebate is payable on signing the contract to purchase the property rather than upon completion of the sale.  This means that it is necessary that details of the planning permission and ownership of the land are provided to Revenue.  This information is completely within the control of the builder\/developer.  The other key condition is that of tax clearance\/tax compliance.  If a contractor is not tax compliant, in order to participate in the scheme, he or she should engage with Revenue to bring his or her tax affairs up to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300057#WRE06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Private Partnerships","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300057#WRE06900"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[9108\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300057#WRE07000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the rationale for the imposition of a restriction on public-private partnerships whereby private investment cannot be more than 10% of the final project cost; and his views on whether this poses a barrier to making use of the European Fund for Strategic Investment to increase investment in State infrastructure projects.","asker":"1335","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":307,"content":"<p>I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who has responsibility for national policy on Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), that PPPs offer an alternative model for delivering infrastructure that can be effective in particular circumstances.  He adds, however, that the long-term nature of the financial commitments arising under PPPs require that the use of such arrangements must be carefully planned in order to ensure that they are used to address infrastructural needs in a manner that is sustainable in the long term and which the public finances can afford.  <\/p>  <p>  It was for this reason that the Government introduced an Investment Policy Framework for PPPs in 2015.  The purpose of the framework is to limit the extent to which PPPs should pre-commit future funding available for capital investment relative to the overall aggregate Exchequer capital allocation available in any individual year.  This includes unitary payment charges in respect of existing PPPs and up-front costs associated with new PPPs, in recognition of the reality that, PPP procurement is a minority procurement option.  There is no limit on the percentage of a PPP that can be privately funded.  In fact PPPs are generally 100% privately funded as off balance sheet projects.  However, it has been agreed that, taken together, costs in respect of PPPs should not pre-commit more than 10% of the overall aggregate capital funding available to future Governments in any individual year.  <\/p>  <p>  The European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), to which the Deputy refers, is the joint initiative of the EIB Group and the European Commission aimed at mobilising private financing for strategic investments through loan funding.  Since EFSI's inception, Ireland has seen the main potential beneficiaries of EFSI are likely to be commercial investment projects (including PPP Companies).  In this regard, I am pleased that the Department of Health's Primary Health Care Centres PPP has successfully drawn down EFSI funds.  <\/p>  <p>  EFSI is an important additional funding possibility alongside others such as the EIB's normal lending, the State's borrowings through the NTMA and other mechanisms such as PPPs and off-balance sheet vehicles.  However it should be remembered that each EFSI loan entered into by the State pre-commits funding for the repayment of such loans, and has to be considered in the context of the expenditure benchmark under the EU's fiscal rules.  The answer, therefore, is not simply about spending more; it is about matching the most appropriate source of funding with investment needs, and ensuring that taxpayers' money is spent wisely.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government's Capital Plan is also\u00a0overseen by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  In accordance with this, that Minister has responsibility for the approval of Exchequer capital projects, PPP projects and borrowing-led investment, within the broader context of considering the full range of available funding options for State investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300057#WRE07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Fund for Strategic Investments","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300057#WRE07200"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[9109\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300057#WRE07300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 164 of 22 November 2016, if he will expand on the statement (details supplied)","asker":"1335","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>The repayment of EFSI loans, entered into by the State, constitutes general government expenditure and, therefore, needs to be taken into account from a fiscal rules perspective.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that the Government is fully aware of the importance and need for capital investment and is implementing a number of measures to provide additional public infrastructure.  For instance, in the 2016 Summer Economic Statement, the Government set out plans to invest an additional &euro;5.14 billion over the period to 2021.  This increase is reflected in the gross voted capital projections.  The outturn for 2016 of &euro;4.24 billion will increase to nearly &euro;7.3 billion per annum by 2021.  This increase in\u00a0gross voted capital relies to a large extent on\u00a0the capital smoothing feature used in the expenditure benchmark, an in-built flexibility designed to support capital investment.  So the Government is making use of the flexibility in the fiscal rules.  <\/p>  <p>  I would also point out that my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform,\u00a0is undertaking a capital review this year to ensure that capital spending is fully aligned with national economic and social priorities.  <\/p>  <p>  At EU level, Ireland supports the European Commission's &euro;315 billion Investment Plan for Europe,\u00a0which includes the\u00a0European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI).  EFSI commenced operations in July 2015 from which time\u00a0it has been possible for any project promoter, either public or private, to engage with the European\u00a0Investment\u00a0Bank regarding the possibility of receiving loans or guarantees under EFSI\u00a0for particular projects.  <\/p>  <p>  Since inception, Ireland has seen the main potential beneficiaries of EFSI as being in the private sector including entities such as PPP companies.  In this regard, I am pleased that the Department of Health's Primary Health Care Centres PPP has successfully drawn down EFSI funds.  In addition, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has successfully engaged with European Financial Instruments such as the COSME and the InnovFin Guarantee Programme, both of which are made available under the EFSI SME Window.  These support the financing needs of SMEs and aims to\u00a0ensure that there is an adequate supply of affordable and appropriate credit to meet their needs.  <\/p>  <p>  President Juncker launched a Commission proposal to extend EFSI both in terms of time and financial capacity on 14 September last and Ireland is fully engaged in the discussions towards securing an agreement that will continue to support investment across the EU including in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Sustainable public finances are a pre-requisite for continued strong economic growth.  My view is that the fiscal rules should not be seen as inhibiting policymakers - they are about ensuring sustainable improvements in living standards for all our citizens.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, and as the Deputy will be aware, approval of Exchequer capital projects and PPP projects are the policy responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and, in this context, he\u00a0engages with each line Department on an ongoing basis to consider and assess projects and the full range of available\u00a0funding options.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300057#WRE07400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Legal Cases","counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300057#WRE07500"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[9110\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300057#WRE07600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of companies or officers of companies that have been prosecuted for delivering to the Revenue Commissioners incorrect accounts in connection with corporation tax whereby a period of six years has expired from the date of the delivery of these accounts to the date of the commencement of this prosecution between the years 2007 to 2016; the number of these prosecutions that have proceeded summarily in the District Court; the number of these prosecutions that have proceeded upon indictment in the Circuit Criminal Court; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[9277\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300057#WRE07700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of companies or officers of companies that have been prosecuted for delivering to the Revenue Commissioners incorrect information in connection with corporation tax where a period of six years has expired from the date of the delivery of this information to the date of the commencement of this prosecution between the years of 2007 to 2016, both years, inclusive; the number of these prosecutions that have proceeded summarily in the District Court; the number of these prosecutions that have proceeded upon indictment in the Circuit Criminal Court; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":314,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 118 together.  <\/p>  <p>  It is an offence, under section 1078(2)(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to knowingly or wilfully deliver an incorrect return, statement or accounts or knowingly or wilfully furnish any incorrect information in connection with any return.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, between the years 2007 and 2016, there were no prosecutions in respect of the delivery of incorrect accounts or incorrect information in connection with corporation tax.

These restrictions arise from the European Union excise regime which governs the production, processing and holding of excisable products under duty suspension, within each Member State. This regime also governs all intra-Union movement of excisable products. The key features as they apply to mineral oil imports from Northern Ireland are set out below; <\/p>  <p>  Mineral oil for use as motor vehicle fuel<\/p>  <p>  Persons bringing mineral oil fuel for vehicles into the State from Northern Ireland must pay excise duty (Mineral Oil Tax) on that fuel at the rates specified in Mineral Oil Tax law (Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Finance Act 1999).\u00a0 Certain exceptions apply to this requirement \u00a0where the fuel is present in the fuel tank of a vehicle at the time that vehicle is brought into the State or where the fuel is in a single portable vessel with a capacity of not more than 10 litres that is in that vehicle at the time of coming into the State, and where the proper UK excise duty applicable to the use of that fuel in the vehicle involved has been paid in that jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of natural gas used for use as vehicle fuel, the liability to excise duty does not arise at the time the gas is brought into the State, but rather where the gas is supplied to a person who supplies or intends to supply it to the tank of a vehicle.<\/p>  <p>  Mineral oil fuels for use other than as motor vehicle fuel<\/p>  <p>  Persons bringing fuel into the State for use other than as road vehicle fuel (for example for heating use, or for agricultural tractors or stationary motors) also must pay the Mineral Oil Tax on that fuel. In the case of gas oil or kerosene, where a person wishes to pay only the reduced rate applicable to those fuels when intended for use other than as road fuel, the oil must be marked with the fuel markers prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, all commercial movements of mineral oil into the State from Northern Ireland are subject to a movement control system.\u00a0 Movements of duty-suspended mineral oil are subject to \u00a0an EU-wide electronic system (known as the Excise Movement Control System or \"EMCS\").\u00a0 In the case of movements of duty-paid oils, such movements may only take place under an equivalent paper-based control method.<\/p>  <p>  Where a person also intends to sell or deal in mineral oil for use as motor vehicle fuel or in gas oil or kerosene for use other than as road fuel, the appropriate Mineral Oil Trader's Licence, issued by the Revenue Commissioners, must also be held.<\/p>  <p>  Solid Fuel<\/p>  <p>  Mechanisms have been put in place by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment for control of supplies of solid fuel coming into the State.\u00a0\u00a0Regulations issued by that Department govern the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels, require the registration of coal traders and establish higher environmental standards for coal supplied in the State compared with Northern Ireland.

This comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.

Its role is to complement the other measures in the Action Plan. The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases. Therefore, the impact of the Help to Buy incentive on property prices cannot be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply.<\/p>  <p>  I have already committed to commissioning an independent economic impact assessment of the Help to Buy incentive which will look at, among other issues, the impact on property prices.

The DEIS Plan 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy. <\/p><p>A key element of DEIS Plan 2017 Plan is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.  <\/p><p>The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, social class composition and labour market situation. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools. Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at<\/p><p><i><\/i>\/.<\/p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.<\/p><p>Schools included in the list published by the Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.<\/p><p>Schools which have not been included at this stage, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model which is fair and objective.<\/p><p>The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social_inclusion@education.gov.ie<\/p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. <\/p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.<\/p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.<\/p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.

This informed approach will help to reduce the incidence of obesity in our young people.<\/p>  <p>  The SPHE syllabus at both primary and post-primary levels contains modules which educate students on the elements of a balanced diet and the importance of healthy eating for physical and mental well-being.<\/p>  <p>  The Government published \"Healthy Ireland - A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013 - 2025\".  \"Healthy Ireland\" aims to improve the health not only of our students, but also of our nation.

At the same time, the Department of Health published updated guidelines for post primary schools on the development of healthy eating policies.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle.  The programme is supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services which provide training and advice for schools and also a resource directory.  Physical Education also forms a mandatory part of the primary curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  At primary level, one of the SPHE strand units 'Taking care of my body' specifically addresses the need for regular exercise and activity as well as the area of nutrition and food and the need for a balanced diet.  This unit is built upon from Infants classes onwards.  By Fifth and Sixth classes children are encouraged to realise and accept responsibility for making wise food choices and for adopting a healthy, balanced diet, and in that, exploring and examining the food pyramid.  Many primary schools operate healthy eating policies with the support of parents.<\/p>  <p>  Elements of this strand are supported by the \"Food Dudes\" programme which encourages children to eat more fruit and vegetables both in school and in the home.  The programme is managed by Bord Bia and funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries and also by the EU through the School Fruit Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  At post-primary level, SPHE for Junior Cycle builds on the primary SPHE Curriculum.

I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS.<\/p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.<\/p><p>Once this work\u00a0has been\u00a0completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.<\/p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300060#WRH05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Study Opportunities","counter":521,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300060#WRH05300"},{"type":"question","counter":522,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[9257\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300060#WRH05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if an Irish citizen, enrolled on a course of study in an Irish university, should be subject to the same fees in an institution in another EU member state when undertaking a year of study at that institution with the support of the Irish university with which he or she is enrolled.

I am in favour of leaving the decisions on what is offered to the discretion of the school, and of students having as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Because the total number of full subjects which can be done for assessment in junior cycle is ten, it is likely that schools will retain most or all of their current subjects in their junior cycle going forward.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, over 90% of students choose History, although it is compulsory only in voluntary secondary schools, not much more than half our post-primary schools. Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle.<\/p>  <p>  Schools across all sectors offer History. History teachers attract students to their subject through their own love and passion for History, and by engaging the natural curiosity of their students in, for example, the lives of people, the origins of the modern world and in objects and documents from the past.  History is generally the 5th most popular subject in the Junior Certificate examination.<\/p>  <p>  I have every confidence that, through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle the place of History will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.  A new specification for Junior Cycle History is being developed by the NCCA.  This involved extensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public, which finished recently, during which over 200 submissions were received.  The new specification will be available for implementation in all schools from September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate History syllabus attracts about 25% of the total cohort of students.  The aim is to make the new specification for Junior Cycle History more attractive, so young people can see it as a realistic option, rather than focusing on learning content by heart.  Many people believe that uptake in senior cycle could be improved if the junior cycle History was made more attractive, more relevant and perhaps less of a race against time.<\/p>  <p>  In the new Framework for Junior Cycle, all schools are expected to provide opportunities for students to achieve 24 statements of learning over the period of junior cycle.  These statements include valuing local, national and international heritage and understanding the importance of the relationship between past and current events, the forces that drive change, and understanding the origins and impacts of social, economic and environmental aspects of the world around them.  Even where students do not take History as a full subject, it is to be hoped that opportunities to achieve such statements through other forms of historical study can be provided to them.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum time allocated for subjects such as History will be 200 hours over the three years of junior cycle, or the equivalent of three 40-minute periods per week over three years.  For many schools, this will lead to an increased time provision for History as a subject, and it will no longer be nominally linked to Geography as previously.<\/p>  <p>  This new minimum time stipulation for History as a subject should allow not only for a deepening of a student's historical knowledge but also of his or her ability to analyse, interpret, write and develop historical skills more thoroughly.  Those skills and attitudes can be hugely important in ensuring that students are able to understand and interpret all forms of history, news and current affairs too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300060#WRH06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Records","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300060#WRH06300"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[9305\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300060#WRH06400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the cost per year for the past three years for the retrieval and return of hard copy files stored at off site locations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":533,"content":"<p>The cost per year for the past three years for the retrieval and return of files from the Department's off-site location is outlined as follows.

This new model will be a fairer and better way to allocate resources to support children with Special Educational Needs. <\/p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been\u00a0provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  This substantial additional provision will ensure that up to 1,000 schools will receive additional allocations, where the new model indicates additional need.\u00a0 No school will receive an allocation of resources less than the allocation they received in the 2016\/17 school year.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Special Education Home Tuition scheme provides a compensatory educational\u00a0service to children with a significant medical condition which is likely to cause major disruption to their attendance at school on a continuing\u00a0basis.\u00a0 Eligibility\u00a0under this provision is assessed with reference to a completed medical\u00a0report and attendance records supplied by the school in which the pupil is\u00a0enrolled.  The maximum allocation of home tuition\u00a0hours for children with a medical ailment is 10 hours per week, with the allocation reflecting the age of the child and their level of attendance. <\/p>  <p>  In\u00a0some instances access to Special Needs Assistant (S) support may be\u00a0provided for children who do not have an assessed disability, but whose\u00a0medical condition is such that they require access to care support in order\u00a0to be able to attend school.\u00a0 If a school or parent considers that\u00a0their child has care needs arising from the medical condition\u00a0Narcolepsy, such that they might require access to S support in order to\u00a0attend school, the school may assist the pupil from within their existing\u00a0S allocation or make an application to the National Council for Special\u00a0Education (NCSE) for S support for their child.  The NCSE is responsible,\u00a0through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs),\u00a0for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (Ss) to\u00a0schools. <\/p>  <p>  Post\u00a0primary school students with special needs may have special arrangements\u00a0made for them while sitting State examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate. Candidates with disabilities can apply through their school for reasonable accommodation during examinations. <\/p>  <p>  Students with Narcolepsy can access the\u00a0Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) scheme, which is\u00a0 a\u00a0college\/university scheme which offers enhanced access routes to third level education for pupils with disabilities.

This additional investment in 2017 means that delivery under the scheme can be accelerated and up to 800 vacant properties can be brought back into use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists this year.

Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an approved housing body (AHB).  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease. <\/p>  <p>  A property owner can either choose to arrange a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead.

The most effective way to reduce and stabilise rents in the long term is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for the private and social rented sectors. <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, aims to increase and accelerate housing delivery across all tenures to help individuals and families meet their housing needs.  It sets out over 80 actions that the Government is taking, through new policy, new legislation and innovative Budgetary measures, to achieve that aim.<\/p><p>Pillar 4 of the Action Plan committed to development of a comprehensive rental strategy and this was delivered, with the publication of the <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector<\/i>on 13 December 2016.  The Strategy identifies high and rapidly rising rents as the key driver of accommodation insecurity for tenants and a factor in the termination of tenancies.  To address this situation, the Strategy introduced a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where the imbalance between demand and supply of rental accommodation is driving rent levels upwards most acutely.<\/p><p>The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 gave effect to, and provided for the immediate implementation of, the Rent Predictability Measure.

The scheme is funded from the social insurance fund.<\/p>  <p>  Up to 2013, the State paid a rebate to all employers who provided statutory redundancy payments, regardless of a company&rsquo;s ability to pay.  As a result, very significant amounts were paid out in redundancy rebates to employers from the social insurance fund.  This expenditure peaked in 2011, when the total cost of redundancy rebate payments to employers was in excess of &euro;214m.

This scheme further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.  The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to access independent expert financial and\/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.

The increase in demand is driven by a number of factors including a general increase in the number of Irish residents travelling abroad, a growing population, as well as a significant rise in application numbers from Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  The invocation of Article 50 in March is likely to add further to the high levels of increase in passport applications from the UK.  Last year applications from Northern Ireland increased by almost 27% compared to 2015 and applications from Great Britain increased by over 40%.

This is the first such agreement between the EU and Cuba.  Its signature marks a further positive step forward in relations between Cuba and the EU, which have improved considerably in recent years.  The agreement is robust and comprehensive, consisting of three main pillars, namely Political Dialogue, Cooperation and Sector Policy Dialogue, and Trade and Trade Cooperation.  The core aim of the agreement is to open channels of dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Cuba in order to assist the modernisation of the Cuban economy and society, strengthen human rights and democracy, and work together to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.  The President&rsquo;s visit was the first by an EU Head of State to Cuba since the signing of the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement (PDCA) in December 2016. The visit was historic in that it was also the first by a serving President of Ireland to Cuba.  A Memorandum of Cooperation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Cuba was signed during the Presidential visit by David Stanton TD, Minister of State with special responsibility for Equality, Immigration and Integration.  I warmly welcome the signature of this agreement, the core aim of which is to open the channels of dialogue and cooperation between Ireland and Cuba, particularly in trade and cultural engagement.  <\/p>  <p>  My view is that the enhanced relationship between the EU and Cuba as supported by the EU-Cuba PDCA, along with the signature of the Memorandum of Cooperation between Ireland and Cuba last week, together provide a solid framework and welcome opportunity to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relations with Cuba.

The consultants were tasked with developing a viable, cost effective and sustainable Scheme which built upon the findings the Lee Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Plan published in January 2014.<\/p><p>The Scheme must provide the standard level of protection provided for such schemes in accordance with international best practice which is taken as dealing with the 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (commonly known as a 100 year flood event) for fluvial events and the 0.5% Annual Exceedance Probability (commonly known as a 200 year flood event) for a tidal event.  Significant detailed work was undertaken in arriving at the preferred option for the proposed Scheme.  The project involved the review of historical flooding data, hydrological analysis and hydraulic modelling to define flood mechanisms and the extent of the problem.  A multi criteria analysis, taking into account technical, environmental, social and economic factors, was carried out of the possible solutions resulting in a preferred solution which was brought to formal public exhibition in December 2016.<\/p><p>Options which were considered either in the Lower Lee CFRAM or during the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme development included upstream storage, land use management, tidal barrage, direct defences, channel widening, modifications of the upstream dams and a flood forecasting system, among others.<\/p><p>The preferred option, at an estimated cost of &euro;140m, was not the lowest cost option and is the least intrusive from a visual perspective and effects the least amount of channel.  While the proposed Scheme considerably reduces the flood flow of water through the City in a peak flood event, the volume of water still to be conveyed would result in considerable damage to residential and commercial premises if direct defences as proposed are not installed.  The scheme has been designed by a multidisciplinary team, including Cork City Council, to ensure that there would be no loss of relationship with the river.  During the development of the Scheme<i><font color=\"#004080\">,<\/font><\/i>Cork City Council drew on the services of the City Architect, the Heritage, Parks and Roads Sections in arriving at its position in relation to the finishes to be used on the Scheme.  In many areas where there are existing railings, the proposed defence is a low wall with railings and of those new walls being constructed, their heights will be consistent with other existing walls in the City thereby ensuring that there will be no dramatic change of a pedestrian&rsquo;s view of the river. <\/p><p>The OPW welcomes all submissions on the proposals as part of the Public Exhibition which is the final stage of a comprehensive consultative process all the way through the design of the Scheme that included a public awareness event at the inception of the project, a public information day at the stage where an emerging preferred option was identified, briefings for elected representatives and business groups in the city and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including a large number of personal consultations by members of the Project Team with those who might be affected directly by the project.  So far, approximately 150 submissions have been received, which will all be given careful consideration by the Design team. A meeting has also been arranged with the savecorkcity group during which the group will be given every opportunity to put forward its views on the proposals. <\/p><p>The Scheme, if implemented, will bring huge benefits to Cork City and upstream to Inniscarra with over 2,100 properties benefitting in the design flood events with a further 1,000 properties benefitting from a reduced risk from more extreme events.  In addition, approximately &euro;20m will be invested to repair circa 4kms of historic quay walls in the City as part of the Scheme.<\/p><p>The OPW is committed to working closely with all relevant stakeholders in progressing the much needed flood defence scheme for Cork city.  The overriding objective for all concerned is to construct a scheme that will protect the businesses and other property owners from the 1 in 100 year fluvial flood event and the 1 in 200 year tidal flood event.

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE operates a Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons entitled to treatment in another EU\/EEA Member State or Switzerland under EU Regulation 883\/04, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulation 987\/09, and in accordance with Department of Health Guidelines.  Patients apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the State through model form E112.  The application requires the patient's Irish-based public referring hospital consultant, following clinical assessment, to certify, among other things, that the treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs.  The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it. <\/p>  <p>  The result of the EU referendum in the UK means that the UK electorate have declared their wish to leave the EU.  It is important to be clear that until the UK formally withdraws from the Union, it remains a full member, with all of its existing rights and obligations.  I wish to assure the Deputy that there are no immediate changes in the area of health as a consequence of the UK's decision to leave the EU.  Irish patients who had planned to travel to the UK under the Treatment Abroad Scheme may continue to do so as planned. <\/p>  <p>  An extensive programme of engagement with all other EU Governments and the EU institutions, including the Commission&rsquo;s Brexit Negotiations Task Force, is under way.

This new legislation will effectively mean that all children in respect of whom a DCA payment is made will automatically qualify for a medical card and, therefore, no longer be subject to the medical card means test at any point in the future while in receipt of DCA.  The drafting of the legislation is at an advanced stage and will be brought before the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.

The recruitment of these nurses means that the new theatre will be used to provide the additional capacity for scoliosis procedures in OLCHC from April.  This will allow an additional day of procedures to be carried out in the medium term.  I am advised by OLCHC that an orthopaedic surgeon post in the hospital will also be filled by June.

With increasing travel and trade in food, drug resistance can spread rapidly and new resistance mechanisms are emerging, which make it difficult or impossible to treat certain infections.  If Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) continues to rise it will become increasingly difficult and expensive to control and treat infections in medical care and more difficult to maintain animal health and welfare.  <\/p>  <p>  The WHO Global Action Plan 2015   sets out five Strategic Objectives:<\/p>  <p>  (1) to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance;<\/p>  <p>  (2) to strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research;<\/p>  <p>  (3) to reduce the incidence of infection;<\/p>  <p>  (4) to optimise the use of antimicrobial agents and<\/p>  <p>  (5) to develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.<\/p>  <p>  The WHO expects that countries will develop their own national action plans on antimicrobial resistance in line with the Global Plan.  European Council Conclusions - &lsquo;The next steps under a &lsquo;One Health approach to combat antimicrobial resistance' adopted at the June 2016 EPSCO (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs) Council meeting call on Member States to have in place before mid-2017 a national action plan against Antimicrobial Resistance based on the &lsquo;One Health&rsquo;   approach and in line with the objectives of the WHO Global Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>        In 2011 a national Health Service Executive\/Royal College of Physicians in Ireland (HSE\/RCPI) Clinical Advisory Group on HCAI\/AMR (Healthcare Associated Infections\/antimicrobial Resistance) was established to provide expert advice to the public health system and a HCAI Clinical Programme within the HSE was put in place.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE established a National Taskforce on HCAI and AMR in 2015 to support and advise on providing effective system-wide response to the issue.  The Taskforce will oversee the continuing development and implementation of an Action Plan to address HCAI\/AMR across the Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations with support from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and Public Health Directorate of the HSE.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Healthcare Quality Reporting System (NHQRS) publishes data on antibiotic prescribing in the community as well as MRSA and Clostridium difficile(C. difficile) rates. The second annual report of the NHQRS was published in June 2016.  As the majority of human antimicrobial consumption in Ireland takes place at community level it is important to have a measure of  consumption.  Measuring rates of MRSA infection is used as a quality measure in many countries while C. difficile  rates in hospitals are recognised and used internationally as a good measure of the quality and safety of a healthcare service.  <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the serious and increasing threat of AMR and the requirement for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to health issues, the Department of Health&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) established a high level National Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee to address this issue.  The Committee has a clear role and mandate across the human and animal health sectors.  Committee membership consists of representatives of both Departments and of the relevant HSE and veterinary specialist agencies, including other relevant bodies with a remit across the two sectors; membership is representative of major stakeholders.  The Committee meets Ireland&rsquo;s requirements to have an Intersectoral co-ordination mechanism for addressing AMR at European level, as outlined in Council Conclusions.  The Committee meets bi-annually and its next scheduled meeting will take place on 6th April 2017.    <\/p>  <p>   The Committee and the Departments of Health and Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine are currently working to finalise Ireland's National Action Plan on AMR.  This work is ongoing and it is expected that the Plan will be published in 2017.  The Plan is examining strategies to optimise Ireland's response to AMR and this examination will include both timelines for implementation and resource requirements.  I am considering seeking cross-Government support for the National Action Plan.  I welcome the recognition by the Deputy of the seriousness of AMR.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300064#WRM05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":838,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300064#WRM05100"},{"type":"question","counter":839,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[9189\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300064#WRM05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide urgent funding to a facility (details supplied) in County Louth for the care of persons with intellectual disabilities and mental health issues to allow it meet modern standards for delivery of care to persons in both institutional and community settings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1332","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":840,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[9190\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300064#WRM05250","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to problems uncovered with the services provided at a facility (details supplied) in County Louth for persons with intellectual disabilities and mental health issues; if his attention has been further drawn to the imminent closure by HIQA of four of the units at this facility and the distress that this will cause to persons and families that use same; if his attention has been drawn to the urgent need for resources to keep this much needed service open; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1332","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":841,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[9193\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300064#WRM05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons that are living in the four units at St. John of Gods, Drumcar, which have been recommended for closure by HIQA; the outcome for these persons in the event that these units are closed; the measures that need to be taken to prevent closure of these units; the steps that will be taken to ensure these units are up to the required standard; the communication that has taken place with the families of these persons since the HIQA report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1330","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":842,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 299, 300 and 302 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:<\/p><p>1  the health needs of the public; <\/p><p>2  the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;<\/p><p>3  the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement; <\/p><p>4  the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;<\/p><p>5  the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;<\/p><p>6  the clinical need for the item or listed item; <\/p><p>7  the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety; <\/p><p>8  the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and <\/p><p>9  the resources available to the HSE. <\/p><p>I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi. This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.<\/p><p>The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website. It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016. The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug. The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis. In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information. Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price. The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company. <\/p><p>The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi, with a view to significantly reducing the cost of Orkambi. A meeting was held in December and again in early January. Following completion of the negotiation process, I am advised that the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee met at the end of January and considered the manufacturer's latest price offerings.  The matter is currently under consideration by the HSE Directorate, in accordance with the criteria set out in the 2013 Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300064#WRM06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":854,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300064#WRM06900"},{"type":"question","counter":855,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[9200\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300064#WRM07000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to provide for the libre testing device (details supplied) for sufferers of diabetes on the medical card; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":856,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300064#WRM07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Administration","counter":857,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300064#WRM07200"},{"type":"question","counter":858,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[9206\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300064#WRM07300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he expects to deliver on the commitment to provide a medical card to every child in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance.","asker":"1223","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":859,"content":"<p>I received permission from Government to draft the new Bill in December 2016.

It made 48 recommendations. It is available on my Department's website at  . <\/p><p>The National Rare Disease Plan recommended that an Oversight Implementation Group of relevant stakeholders, including patients' groups, be established to oversee and monitor implementation of the plan's recommendations. This group was established by my Department  in 2015 and it has met on a number of occasions. <\/p><p>One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases. This programme was to be responsible for, over time and among other functions, assisting with mapping and developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise - nationally and internationally; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.<\/p><p>In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established in 2013 under the National Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division of the HSE. The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. This clinical programme is the channel for assisting with the advancement of a number of other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases; and in this vein, the programme designed a framework for the designation of Irish Centres of Expertise in cooperation with the HSE Acute Hospitals Division in line with the recommendations stipulated in the national plan.<\/p><p>The Rare Diseases National Plan also recommended that  &lsquo;the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases through a National Office for Rare Diseases develop the clinical and organisational governance framework that would underpin care pathways and access to treatment for rare disease patients, particularly in the context of transition from paediatric to adult care'. As such the National Clinical Programme has developed a draft transition model of care which is currently in the public consultation stage.<\/p><p>The National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and my Department encouraged designated centres of expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases in line with the national plan. ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients.  Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patients' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work.  Hence, the recommendations in the national plan that related to empowering and protecting patients and carers, and research on rare diseases will be fulfilled in part through this process.  It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU.<\/p><p>With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated in June 2016 during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks.  Three of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs and two were approved.<\/p><p>In 2014, the Minister for Health announced &euro;850,000 for investment into charity-led research priorities, which particularly benefits rare disease research. Five charities were to provide matching funding bringing the total investment to &euro;1.9 million.  They were to share &euro;850,000 in State funding to take part in international research into rare medical conditions.  In 2016, the next cohort of projects was funded by the State with &euro;1.686M, matched by charity funding of &euro;1.224M. The total funding of &euro;2.91M is shared between 11 charities.  Six of the 15 projects with a total value of &euro;1.1M address rare diseases.  The next round of this joint funding initiative will open in autumn 2017.  The EU commission now intends to explore the possibility to further strengthen the collaboration between Member States and the Commission in the area of research on rare diseases.<\/p><p>The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan.  The national office has now been established by the HSE. Its work is currently led by the NCPRD Clinical Lead supported by an Information Scientist, part-time Administrative Officer, part-time Genetic Counsellor and by a 0.2FTE Consultant Geneticist.  It is, among other functions, providing up-to-date information regarding new treatment and management options, including clinical trials.  In addition, the post of Information Scientist for the office is being funded jointly by the HSE and the EU Commission.  The NRDO has already performed a preliminary situation analysis of the existing rare disease registries and is in the process of assigning these known registries on our national Orphanet site, which is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU. <\/p><p>A number of recommendations about access to appropriate drugs and technologies were contained in the plan. One chief recommendation in this regard refers to the HSE developing a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies; and that the approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme. The HSE Acute Hospitals Division is developing the terms of reference, required membership and reporting relationship for this committee. The Committee will also be supported by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases Clinical Advisory Group.<\/p><p>The national plan for rare diseases recommended that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health and Patient Safety Bill be published. The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  The Individual Health Identifier part of the project is now being implemented by the HSE.  A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the government in November 2015 and published on the Department's website.  It is currently with the Attorney-General's Office for formal drafting and with the Oireachtas Committee on Health for Pre-Legislative Scrutiny.<\/p><p>Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals.  The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.<\/p><p>Finally, rare diseases have already been tabled on the agenda for North-South meetings.  Therefore, future work to deepen cooperation between both jurisdictions on rare diseases is anticipated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300065#WRN01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":878,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300065#WRN01600"},{"type":"question","counter":879,"qnumday":314,"qnumall":"[9224\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300065#WRN01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a cataract operation in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":880,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

As well as supporting other paediatricians, the Consultant also provides clinical support and advice to maternity hospitals and neonatologists.  The Programme also included the appointment of eight Children&rsquo;s Outreach Nurses  whose role is to ensure that children being cared for at home by their families have access to co-ordinated and supportive services.  The nurses liaise closely with statutory and voluntary service providers including local GPs, Public Health Nurses, Disability Services, the Jack and Jill Foundation and LauraLynn.  A further two Children's Outreach Nurses are being recruited under the Programme, one in Letterkenny and the other to the Children's Hospital Group. <\/p>  <p>  The Letterkenny post, which will be offered to the successful candidate this week, will be entitled Clinical Nurse Co-ordinator for Children with Life-limiting Conditions.

The review makes twenty recommendations, one of which is the need to provide adequate and needs-based respite services.  The HSE is currently considering how both in-home and in-patient respite services might be made more available for children in Donegal and surrounding areas.

As it is a pilot scheme, eligibility is necessarily limited. In 2016 the operational area for the scheme was selected as Community Health Area (CHO) 7, following consultation with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE). This CHO encompasses Kildare\/West Wicklow, Dublin West, Dublin South City and Dublin South West.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband roll-out so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:  <\/p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  <\/p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out. <\/p><p>Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  <\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to roll-out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. <\/p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded. <\/p><p>In this regard, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in July 2016 together with Minister Humphreys.  The findings of this Taskforce recommends practical actions that can be taken to remove barriers to and improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland. The Taskforce report is available at the following link: . <\/p><p>Minister Humphreys has established two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.

Any customer, including those in Clonbullogue in County Offaly, who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance. If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to the independent regulator of the telecommunications sector, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by ComReg. I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to roll-out services to particular locations. However, mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage. However as mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets and the capacity of the network, as well as by and proximity to mobile telephone antennas. The rate of demand for data services has increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force. In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. The report of the Task Force was published in December and is available on both Departments' websites.<\/p>  <p>  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the Task Force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.

ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.  <\/p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high-speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment plans have not been fully demonstrated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300068#WRQ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":1124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300068#WRQ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1125,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[9280\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022300068#WRQ03300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when an area (details supplied) will be connected with fibre broadband; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1126,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to deliver high speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.

I am sure the Deputy was pleased to see, as I was, the significant increase in the numbers cycling and walking into Dublin City Centre in the Canal Cordon Report published last week. We are now seeing more than two thirds of people using sustainable transport modes (public transport, cycling and walking) to enter Dublin in the morning peak. It is important that we continue to build on that progress in the coming years.<\/p><p>The Government is embarking on a Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan, which will take stock of progress under the Plan to date and provide the Government with an opportunity to consider the scope for increased levels of investment.  In addition, with the scheduled completion of the Luas Cross-City Project later this year, which was one of the more capital intensive projects under my Department's remit in recent yeas, I hope that more funds may become available to support cycle routes. I will certainly be making the case for increased investment in public transport and cycling and walking infrastructure in discussions on the review of the Capital Plan.<\/p><p>The Deputy will also be interested to know that my Department is presently establishing a fund to support low carbon technologies in public transport vehicles including a Green Bus Fund.

It is expected that the draft plan will be available for public consultation in March.  Transport will of course have to play a significant role on the national mitigation effort.  The measures under consideration for transport will be wide-ranging and will focus on modal shift, movement to alternative fuels, and targeted behavioural change. To date, considerable progress has been achieved through measures aimed at promoting improved technologies and changing behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also recently developed a National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport, which will be published in the coming weeks, following our recent public consultation on the draft Framework.

In some Countries the basic national minimum wage is not fixed at a monthly rate but at an hourly or weekly rate and Eurostat for comparison purposes converts Countries hourly or weekly rates into monthly rates.\u00a0\u00a0 These figures are also affected by currency fluctuation that exists for Countries listed that are outside the Eurozone, such as the UK, and the fact that some Countries have lower national levels of hours worked per week. Thus these Eurostat figures provide a comparison between European Countries of the monthly national minimum wage in Euros at a point in time using the Countries standard national level of hours worked per week. It should be noted that monthly national minimum wage rates are gross amounts. Income tax and social security contribution deductions vary greatly from Country to Country. <\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that disparities in minimum wages across the EU States are considerably smaller once price level differences are eliminated: minimum wages in those Member States with relatively low price levels become relatively higher when expressed in purchasing power standard, and relatively lower in those Member States with higher price levels.

The Committee issued its report in November 2015 and included reference to the issue of refusal to disclose birth certificate information where Tusla, the Child and Family Agency considers that there are compelling reasons, such as may endanger the life of a person, for so doing.<\/p>  <p>  My Department considered the report of the Committee and a revised policy was developed to reflect concerns raised.  The Bill provides that where a birth mother has registered her details on the Register, Tusla will notify her, in writing, of the adopted person&rsquo;s application for his\/her birth certificate information.  She will be offered support and guidance by the Agency and advised that the adopted person has also been also been offered support and guidance.  The birth mother will be advised that the information will be provided to the adopted person unless she advises Tusla within 12 weeks that she considers that there are compelling reasons not to release this information.  Where the Agency having considered any information, either provided by a birth parent or otherwise available to it, considers that there are compelling reasons for not disclosing information, it will refer the matter to the Circuit Court for determination.
