As Members will know, the Catholic Primary School Management Association, CPSMA, represents the boards of management of 2,900 primary schools and provides a wide range of services to those schools.<\/p><p> The rising costs for parents whose children return to school in September is of major concern to us.  Primary schools are can-do places and have a good relationship with parents and work closely with them.  Issues of concern to parents are issues of concern to the boards of management.  As a brief backdrop to the issue, one cannot consider the problems faced by parents without putting them in context.  At present there is inadequate funding for primary schools so there is a direct correlation between funding for schools and costs borne by parents.  Many schools are chronically under funded and when they are short they must go to the parent population - their nearest port of call - to make up the shortfall.  I shall give a brief example.  The capitation grant for primary schools was reduced over the past three years by &euro;22 for pupils in a mainstream class and by &euro;100 for a special child in a mainstream class.  The way the capitation grant is paid also poses a problem for schools.  It is paid in two moieties - the first arrives in June and the next arrives the following February.  It is a bit like live horse and eat grass, one is left without a cashflow for that period each year.  <\/p><p>  A wonderful grant called the minor works grant - which we feel is under threat - used to arrive which gave a great cashflow opportunity to schools during the period when the capitation grant had well run out.  It allowed schools to survive until the second capitation grant moiety was paid the following February.  If one combines the capitation reduction and the potential loss of the minor works grant together one will find that a school of 100 pupils, which has five special needs pupils in mainstream education, will be down &euro;10,000 in total.  That is a significant drop in income in any school and where must the school turn to make that sum up, to the parents. <\/p><p>  Additionally, there are changes in schools because they are treated like businesses.  Therefore, they must pay charges for water, An Post and all of the usual utility bills for oil, heat, bin charges, fire certificates, fire alarm calls and their maintenance.  Schools are treated as a business but being able to claim what businesses can claim is not the same thing.  For example, schools cannot claim VAT expenses on purchases.  <\/p><p>  The CPSMA conducted a survey of its members to provide solutions - and that is what the committee asked for too - to issues that are of concern to parents.  The two biggest cost factors identified were uniforms and books.  It was suggested - and largely supported across the board - that parents should be allowed to buy uniforms in any main store and crests could be bought as a separate item thus enabling them to be sewed or stuck on and passed on to the next school jumper or cardigan that a pupil wears.  Bulk buying was another suggestion.  The notion of swapping uniforms and parents hosting recycling days for uniforms were also clearly indicated in responses received from parents as ways to cut costs.  Sometimes people promote the idea of having no uniform but the notion was not quite what we thought it would work out to be.  We asked about it but were told that it may seem attractive initially.  However, when the yearly cost of providing clothes instead of a uniform was examined one was faced with peer pressure.  Children wanted labels from high-end products sewn onto cheaper models and then they would wear them to school.  <\/p><p>  The next issue was books and book rental.  The vast majority of schools seem to have a book rental scheme in place.  Its set-up and maintenance costs are significant.  Schools must find the money to continue with such schemes.  It was suggested that publishers should bind their books properly thus ensuring that they last longer.  It was also suggested that publishers should be asked not to update their books on a regular basis and for schools to examine their book policy.  In other words, they should first ensure that there is a series of books available before making the decision to change.  Perhaps they should also examine alternative ways of teaching the curriculum so that schools are not so dependent on textbooks or workbooks but instead use visualisers that are available through grants from the Department of Education and Skills and so on.  Several suggestions were made along those lines.  <\/p><p>  The CPSMA has run procurement competitions.  Schools were asked to sign up for the procurement of gas, oil and other requisites with the National Procurement Service.  One school saved 40% because it joined a national procurement scheme to pay its bills.  We encourage schools to examine the measure outlined in order that they do not pass their financial pressures on to their parent population through seeking voluntary contributions or other fund-raising exercises.<\/p><p>   If schools can plan for what is required and spread it across the year then it might lighten the financial burden on parents.  Schools in certain locations may find it more difficult to fund-raise.  I hope that I have covered most of the issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101000004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Flynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1349859900,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Flynn.

I am the Secretary to the Church of Ireland's General Synod Board of Education which is the board within the church's structures that has responsibility for its education policy.  In that capacity the board represents the interests of the Church of Ireland in education and also provides an advisory service to the boards of management of Church of Ireland primary schools.  To some extent I shall echo what Ms Flynn has said.<\/p><p>  While schools under Presbyterian, Methodist or Quaker patronage have their own boards of education, the board also provides support and advice to those schools.  For the committee's information, there are ten bishops in the Church of Ireland who are patrons of their local diocesan Church of Ireland primary schools.  We also liaise and advise them closely.  <\/p><p>  The schools that I represent can be outlined as follows.  There are 200 Protestant primary schools in the State, 174 are Church of Ireland, 24 are Presbyterian and there is one that is Methodist and one is Quaker.  Fifty of the schools are located in Dublin and the remainder are dispersed across the country and many are in rural locations.<\/p><p>  In the course of this presentation I hope to describe the direct and indirect costs to parents that result from the costs of running schools.  I will echo what Ms Flynn has said.  The direct costs are items such as school books, art and stationery, materials, uniforms, costs associated with activities such as swimming and school tours, along with transport costs for those in rural areas.  The committee will be aware of the recent survey conducted by Barnardos which advised that it costs &euro;355 for a child to start junior infants and rises to &euro;390 per year thereafter.<\/p><p>  As Ms Flynn has said, school books are a significant cost for parents.  Many of our schools operate a school book rental scheme where the schools buy books and rent them out.  There is a cost incurred by the school but it is a good endeavour in the long run.  I wish to express our thanks to the Department of Education and Skills for its book rental scheme guidelines for schools that it issued recently as it has done so for the past couple of years.  Schools have told me that they find the guidelines useful.  I also thank the Minister for initiating a review of the operation of the school book scheme.  Again, schools have told me that they have also found it useful.  <\/p><p>  A major issue faced by parents living in rural areas is the provision and increase in the cost of school transport.  In 2011 a charge of &euro;50 per child for the provision of school transport was introduced and budget 2012 raised it to &euro;100 per child.  It constitutes a significant increase over a short period.  In 2011, changes to the eligibility criteria in respect of the retention of a school bus service has resulted in the loss, or projected loss, of a large number of school buses representing a significant hardship to the affected parents.  We are advised that the grant provided to parents in lieu of the provision of a school bus falls far short of the cost to provide a private bus, instead of the main bus, or to cover the cost of getting a child to school by alternative means.  There is also the cost of fuel.  The recent changes to the school transport scheme have inflicted an inequitable hardship on parents and children attending schools in rural areas.  This matter is of particular interest to the Protestant minority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101000004#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ken Fennelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349860500,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fennelly.

There is a deep appreciation among teacher and principals that parents are struggling with the rising cost of sending their children to primary school.  School communities are constantly struggling to come up with innovative ways to reduce these costs to parents and yet to ensure the school itself remains solvent and keeps up-to-date with the newest innovations.  It is generally felt, as the two previous speakers said, that primary schools are seriously underfunded and the boards of management have no option but to go back to the parents to fund-raise.  The capitation in primary schools is far lower than that in secondary schools, yet it costs the same to heat, run and maintain a building be it a primary or second level school.<\/p><p>  We accept that primary schools are overstretched due to underfunding yet we recognise there are current restraints on public spending.  Principals and patrons can and do make efforts to lighten the load for parents as much as possible.  Both previous speakers discussed the book rental scheme.  That is the single most efficient way to help to reduce costs to parents.  Any textbook that is not a workbook, that is a book in which children do written work, is purchased in advance by the school, using the book grant scheme and parents pay a quarter of the cost for that year.  After four or five years, we buy a new stock of books.  It has the advantage that we buy in bulk so that the costs are reduced.  When publishers bring out another edition, we are at an advantage because we have the stock of books and every child has the same book for four to five years.  Work parties of teachers and parents get together, cover the books and maintain them.  It is a way that parents can be involved in schools, without asking them to pay.  It does not cost money to volunteer.<\/p><p>  We would encourage schools to work as far as possible to implement this low cost book scheme for parents, through careful management of the book grant for schools.  The books grant itself is used to support the buying of books or the renting of book for parents who cannot afford to buy.  It is also used to help to buy in schemes at the beginning of the year and to support the cost of running the books scheme, replacing lost or damaged books or covering the books.  With the renewed emphasis on literacy in schools, the book grant is essential to enable schools to purchase sets of books to do lift off to literacy or read and recovery initiatives that schools have been asked to do.  Any reduction in that grant would materially affect school's ability to make improvement in their literacy as required by the literacy and numeracy strategy.  It would also be helpful to schools if the books scheme grant was paid in June of the previous year so that a stock of books could be available to the school to begin in September. <\/p><p>  Parents still have to purchase books.  They get the book list well in advance and by September they usually have bought the books.  Many schools are re-examining the educational value of many of the workbooks.  We are trying to reduce the number of workbooks that are used in schools for educational as well for economic reasons.  Some of our parent teacher associations run a book club apart from the book scheme which encourages parents to pay in on a monthly basis, similar to a Christmas club, and at the end of the year, they have paid for their books in June.  The PTA buys in bulk with the money parents have paid in advance.<\/p><p>  Other contributors have raised the issue of the materials money.  Parents have to pay to rent books, for personal accident insurance, the cost of materials, class stationery, art, photocopying and so on and schools find it is harder to collect the money for these sundries..  We find that parents buy the books from the book list, but the more we put books on to the book rental scheme we find it more difficult to get the money in from it.  It is now common practice for a number of parents to pay this charge for materials in staged payments, perhaps a monthly payment or a payment per term.  Perhaps it could be formalised at the beginning of the year that parents could chose to opt to pay for materials yearly, monthly or by the term, so that they do not have to talk to the principal or negotiate the terms of payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101000005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349861100,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Ms Kavanagh has gone over time and I must ask her to wrap up.

Not unlike many other people they have lost their jobs.  Imagine it is August and the start of term is approaching.  The school has very helpfully sent a letter to remind mammies and daddies about the children's needs for the start of term.  Johnny's parents go through the list in the letter item by item.  First is the book list, which involves traipsing from shop to shop ensuring all the workbooks and textbooks are bought.  Enterprisingly, Johnny's mammy has been able to get them for &euro;100, which is not too excessive.  Next comes the uniform, which can be bought in only one shop.  New shoes are also needed and these and the uniform amount to &euro;150.  Added to this are the schoolbag, lunchbox, pens, pencils and copies, which amount to another &euro;50.  This adds up to a considerable amount, but on top of this schools ask parents for a contribution to the pupil personal accident insurance fund and arts and for crafts money, which is another &euro;15, and to round it off to the nearest &euro;100 parents will probably be asked for &euro;85 as a voluntary contribution.  All of this adds up very quickly and amounts to &euro;400.<\/p><p>  There is nothing excessive about what has been mentioned so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101000006#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Campbell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349861700,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I am president of the Joint Managerial Body, JMB, and principal of St. Finian's College, Mullingar.

It advises, supports and negotiates on behalf of the boards of management and school management in the 380 voluntary secondary schools.  The JMB welcomes this opportunity to participate in the examination of the rising costs faced by parents every year when sending children back to school.  It is the strongly held view of the JMB that every effort must be made to ensure costs are kept to a minimum for all parents in order that children have the opportunity to fulfil their potential during their time in the education system.  This issue can only be tackled by a collaborative approach by all stakeholders, including the Government.<\/p><p>  The Government needs to recognise that the historical starvation of resources to the education system has been exacerbated by the recent and further projected budgetary reductions for schools.  The country has lingered for many years in the bottom rankings of the OECD table for funding of the first and second level education system.  If that was not bad enough, in 2010, schools received no increase in capitation, a 5% reduction in 2011, followed by a further 2% decrease in 2012 with a projected decrease in 2013 of 2% followed by a 1% reduction in both 2014 and 2015.  These reductions in funding to schools means that a secondary school with 400 pupils lost &euro;12,400 in income alone as a result of the budget cuts in 2011 and 2012.  A secondary school of 600 pupils lost &euro;18,600 in the same period with a school of 800 pupils losing &euro;24,800.  How is a school to replace this financial loss when basic costs such as electricity, oil, gas, water, refuse charges and insurance have soared in the same period and must be met from its capitation grant?<\/p><p>  The regrettable answer is that management in a secondary school can only respond in one way to this loss of income and that is to seek the assistance of parents through either fund-raising ventures or voluntary contributions.  Research conducted by the JMB indicates that, on average, more than 30% of a secondary school's annual expenditure must be raised through local sources.  In other words, central Government has decided that the school community must raise &euro;3 out of every &euro;10 locally.  Thus, in the view of the JMB, the main burden for parents in sending their children to school is created by the Government policy to grossly underfund schools.  There are no bailouts for schools, so school management has no option but to look to parents to provide the funding to balance the school accounts on an annual basis.  In addition, the loss of the summer works scheme has created more pressure for schools as now essential repairs to the school buildings must come from the already overstretched school budget.  The situation is even more severe for the voluntary secondary sector when one realises that, in the case of the average 400-pupil school, a voluntary secondary school inexplicably continues to receive &euro;90 per pupil less each year than a comparable community and comprehensive school and &euro;212 per pupil less than a vocational school.  This results from a decision by Government to underfund secondary schools at the time of the introduction of the free scheme in 1967.<\/p><p>  Turning to the issue of procurement, the JMB welcomes the motivation behind the setting up of a national procurement service, NPS.  It is in the interest of everyone associated with schools that best value for money forms the basis of all spending.  However, to date, schools have found two critical problems with the NPS, namely, the slow and cumbersome process involved in establishing the service and the high levels of bureaucracy associated with the process.  An over burdened school management will simply not be able to cope with the mechanics of a NPS without a major streamlining of the process.  Oil and electricity make perfect sense nationally but we also have to be conscious of the local economy, which must be taken into account.<\/p><p>  Apart from the requirement to shore up the school budget as a result of Government policy, the other main costs for parents are books and uniforms.  The JMB in a submission last June to the Department of Education and Skills consultation process on school book grants and rental schemes agreed with the overall aim of this initiative, that is, to reduce the cost to parents of school books.  The JMB acknowledged the progress made by the Minister in the establishment of a code of practice in respect of publishers and on the protection of funding for book grants to schools for 2012.  There, nonetheless, remain some challenges to be overcome in respect of equity and implementation which require comment and these were the focus of the JMB submission.  It is unarguable that book rental costs less to families than buying new texts.  No school wishes to add pressure to parents but the figures released to the media stating that a year's books could be provided by schools for a tiny fraction of their cost are unrealistic.  Where such is being achieved, it can safely be assumed that the scheme is well beyond its seed phase and other reliable sources of funding are being sourced.<\/p><p>  However, the JMB acknowledges the publication of draft guidelines for book rental schemes.  The staffing demands of such schemes will require engagement on the part of parents as current ancillary staffing in schools, as well as the moratorium on posts of responsibility, militates against a wholly school-staffed solution.  In this respect, we welcome the engagement of the NPC in the development of these guidelines.  However, the JMB must put on record the following serious reservations for schools regarding the feasibility of trying to establish a book rental scheme at this moment in time: the initial cost of setting up book rental schemes is very high - in the case of my school alone, I estimate that to be &euro;100,000; schools do not have the resources in terms of personnel to operate the scheme - all our middle management posts have been abolished and will not be replaced; there is no space in the school to store the books; more important, the implementation of the reforms at junior cycle will result in new syllabi being introduced across 21 subjects between 2014 and 2017 so it would be ridiculous for a school to spend, say, &euro;100,000 putting together a book grants scheme only to discover in three or four years the books were obsolete; and schools are exploring the introduction of technology such as e-books.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101000007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Fr.

I also thank them for their suggestions on how it can be addressed and improved.  It has become more and more difficult in the past three years to manage schools, with costs, subsidies and grants from the Government having taken a hit in successive budgets.  It has become correspondingly difficult for parents because of the increased burden placed on the communities surrounding the schools to make up the shortfall to maintain the level of service that has been provided.<\/p><p>  Surveys show the key costs in pupils returning to school are uniforms and book costs.  An issue that is not being addressed this morning is the cost of students in the third level sector.  Many families may have children at primary, secondary and third levels and the cost to such families becomes oppressive at third level.<\/p><p>  The comments on the school books scheme were particularly interesting.  Where one can be set up, it can have an impact on reducing the cost of books to families.  Ms Kavanagh referred to the Educate Together school in Adamstown and the fact that the scheme costs one quarter of the cover costs of books.  Fr. Connell referred to an example of a school where the set-up costs were &euro;100,000.  Perhaps Ms Kavanagh can comment on how to get to the stage where the scheme is up and running without such oppressive costs at the outset.<\/p><p>  Fr. Connell referred to reform of the junior certificate.  From first to third year, there will be a complete change starting in 2014 and running to 2020 across a range of subjects.  It will pose real challenges for parents and schools in terms of the cost involved.  That must be given significant attention.<\/p><p>  Regarding school uniforms, experiences are different among the witnesses.  Some have none and Ms Flynn referred to the existence of peer pressure in schools with no uniforms.  I am interested in further comments on that point.<\/p><p>  Some pupils in lower infant classes have to leave school at 2 p.m., which has become more of an issue in the past two years.  In the past, schools managed the pupils between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., when family members were not able to pick them up or avail of public transport.  Anecdotally, it is becoming a flashpoint in some schools.<\/p><p>  The code of practice agreed with book publishers seems to be working well.

Parents face major challenges as the cost of sending children to school is increasing.  With a reduction in the education budget, there will be an increased cost for parents, who can expect a figure in the region of &euro;77 million.  This is separate to the multi-annual reductions announced last year, such as the capitation grant.  We must look at solutions in a different light because it is important to reduce the cost to parents as much as possible.  Many of the solutions were the same across all presentations.  However, there are different challenges to parents in terms of costs.  For instance, Dr. Fennelly referred to school transport being a significant issue for parents in rural areas, whereas it is not a factor in urban areas.  In Educate Together schools, the cost of school uniforms is not an issue.  While there are different pressures in terms of the cost to parents, some of the solutions could be implemented across the board.<\/p><p>  Regarding VAT rates for schools, is there any research on how much schools will save if it was abolished?  What is the amount of money paid by schools?  It will vary across the board but it may be significant in helping schools to manage budgets.<\/p><p>  In respect of start-up costs, I am interested in the figure of &euro;100,000, referred to by Fr. Connell.  It is not feasible for schools to raise that amount of money.  If it was possible, it would alleviate the costs for parents.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions on how to overcome the obstacle?  Junior certificate reform will make it more difficult to get to that position.  Educate Together is in a position where 25% of costs are passed on to parents.  Is there anything the Department can do to help schools to get from the start-up process to being able to implement the scheme very well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101000008#G00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1349862300,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending to discuss this issue.

Each year we have used our book grant to purchase all the books for a specific subject, for example one year we purchased all the history books, the following year we purchased all the science books and so on.  Gradually parents had a lower book bill, as they had to pay for fewer books as the years went on.  We get parents to pay a rental charge of a quarter of the value of the books.  In second level schools, it would be very different as teachers may want to use different schemes in their classrooms.  I can understand how it would be much different.<\/p><p>  The question of after school care was also raised.  The cost of after-school care is a major issue.  I know that Educate Together is looking at forging a relationship between its school and a not-for-profit organisation, where the schools could be used as a venue for after-school child care at a reduced cost.  We think that is a very good initiative if we can help parents with after-school child care without being involved.  Obviously we cannot do it ourselves, it has to come from somebody else.<\/p><p>  There is an initiative in Lucan, which has five Educate Together schools called \"time banking\", where parents, teachers and children all can donate time to the school - Mr. David Campbell referred to schools as communities - where people work for the school and help to run after-school clubs.  If one gives an hour of one's time then one gets an hour's worth of service.  Let us take the example of a mother who works in the after-school club on a Monday, she can get an hour's \"time banking\" for her child on another day.  Parents are working toward giving to the school but also getting something that has a value for them as a result. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101000009#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Colette Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1349862900,"counter":34,"content":"<p>That is done in conjunction with South Dublin County Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101000009#H00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349862900,"counter":35,"content":"<p>It is.

If one orders fuels costing &euro;2,000 and the VAT rate of 23% applies it amounts to &euro;460 in VAT, which is very significant.  Then the school must pay for water rates, public utilities and other charges.  The cost of running a school has become prohibitive.  The school must function and must pay its bills.  The load then transfers to the local community.

There is a great deal of community involvement.  The parents come in and see it as a day out and do not see it as going out on the streets and looking for money.  They are doing something and they are getting paid for a service.  It is a good fund-raiser. <\/p><p>  We can certainly take up the issue of the VAT rate .  It is a very good suggestion to consider ways that we can exempt the schools from VAT.<\/p><p>  On the question of uniforms, when we moved to the country there was no uniform in the school but my children continued to wear the uniform from their previous school.  Today that school has a uniform and I think it saves money.  The pupils made their confirmation in the school uniform.  That saved a great deal of money.  I believe that uniforms are the way to go.<\/p><p>  The awarding of a green flag is a great initiative for schools.  I hoisted the green flag recently where the school was awarded it for water conservation.  The children gathered lemonade bottles and put them into the cisterns, they also changed the taps to ones that go off automatically.  Everybody knows that young children will leave taps running.<\/p><p>  An issue that was raised recently with the board of management of which I am a member is the transportation of children to football matches, swimming and so on.  The parents were grouping together and taking turns in driving them.  This is now a major issue and parents are being advised not to do this, which is putting an extra cost on everybody.  Now the school has to organise a bus to transport the children.  We need to consider ways of having the parents help out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101000010#J00900","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1349863500,"counter":54,"content":"<p>T&aacute; ceisteanna s'agamsa d&iacute;rithe ar Chaoimh&iacute;n &Oacute; hEaghra agus baineann siad le gaelscoileanna.

If a number of schools come together and decide to purchase their oil and insurance from certain suppliers, they run the risk of breaching EU law.  I accept that this seems extraordinary but we are continually faced with the problem of ensuring that we comply with health and safety regulations, EU law, etc.  Schools are obviously concerned about matters of this nature.  We work very closely with the National Procurement Service, NPS, because it offers schools a way in which to bulk buy without being in breach of competition law. The CPSMA has been pushing the concept of working with the NPS in order that schools will not fall foul of the rules and regulations.  Unfortunately, it is sometimes the case that difficulties can arise in respect of what might seem to be an obvious solution.<\/p><p>  Schools are becoming VAT collectors.  The CPSMA, in conjunction with the JMB, is currently running seminars throughout the country because schools are now returning VAT to the Revenue Commissioners.

Of course, e-books and e-learning are fantastic.  However, school authorities continually point out that we should not forget about the ongoing costs involved in respect of ICT.

I refer to implementation support at school level for the points made by Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy.  Currently, schools are engulfed with issues ranging from child protection to new curriculum implementation.  Trying to reduce costs is another issue.  Many issues arise in both rural and urban schools.  Sometimes it is necessary to have someone to come into the school and say, for example, that if one takes out every second bulb it will save &euro;1,000 or that one should go to the national procurement website.<\/p><p> School principals receive a multiplicity of correspondence daily by e-mail, letter and also from speaking to parents.  It is not easy to absorb all of the information and to co-ordinate it.  That must also be taken into consideration in what we are trying to do.  If we are to reduce costs we must provide assistance to school boards on how to do it.  Reference was made to centralised bulk buying and the cost savings that would ensue.  We should bear in mind that those on school boards are volunteers.  Board members, teachers and principals bring all the goodwill in the world to their approach but consideration must be given to providing assistance to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101000013#M01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Caoimh&iacute;n &Oacute; hEaghra","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349865900,"counter":84,"content":"<p>It is a valid point about the need for assistance to maintain old buildings.

This year one quarter of my capitation grant to the school will go on heating and lighting.  That is a significant proportion of the funding.

They are representative of local communities and they are dealing with a complexity of issues.  It is important that we recognise that.  Boards of management are aware of local issues that affect parents.  Great work is done by them.  There is a danger at meetings such as this one that we can sometimes hone in on the negatives.  Much positive work is being done in terms of the mass of 30,000 volunteers who support the education system at first and second levels.  We must congratulate them and also encourage them to continue to look at how to reduce costs.<\/p><p>  At the core of our submission is the fact that central government has a role to play.  Schools have no source of funding other than central government or the local community, in particular, parents.  It is a huge dilemma and a struggle for local management to reconcile.<\/p><p>  I will deal with a couple of issues that were raised by various members of the committee.  On the enrolment fee and voluntary contributions, we are clear and we send regular guidelines to schools reminding them that if they are in the free education scheme they cannot charge a compulsory fee of any type.  I have a copy of the most recent correspondence we sent to schools four weeks ago.  That point has been reiterated time and again.  At the same time we remind parents that we need the support at local level to keep the school open.  It is literally down to that nowadays.<\/p><p>  Fee-paying schools have about 7% of the second level school population.  The State contributes the salaries of teachers.  No matter where those 26,000 children are, the State will be paying the teachers&rsquo; salaries.  If parents can no longer afford to continue to send their children to such schools and they have to move into the free education scheme, the State will be paying much more.  They will still be paying the teachers&rsquo; salaries but they will be paying capitation and other grants to keep the schools running. That must be remembered and kept in focus.<\/p><p>  Everyone recognises that the national procurement service is a good idea but there are difficulties.  I went to a meeting in March 2011 at which we spoke about the provision of electricity.  I gather a competition was to be run.  The primary schools are still involved in the same situation.  I do not know whether electricity is measured in watts or ohms but not one competition has run yet.  I am told it will be next March &ndash; two years on - before the aspiration can be fulfilled.  Big questions arise in that regard.<\/p><p>  We were asked about local suppliers.  We are conscious about office supplies and stationery in particular.  If three or four schools in a town switch to the national procurement framework then a local business will be gone overnight.  We must get the balance right.  We need to save money.  We will save money, but we must recognise the balance between saving money and maintaining local businesses.<\/p><p>  Reference was made by a few members to school transport.  There is a danger, in particular with the new school transport arrangements that have been introduced since 1 January 2012, that parental choice will be restricted.  We are getting more and more representations by the week from schools representing parents who have to contribute substantially higher sums of money to pay for school transport to a school of their choice.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Moriarty said, we welcome the opportunity presented by shared services but it would be remiss of me not to mention that when setting up the education and training boards, the other education sectors should have a statutory right to representation on them.  This would help to ensure the integration of all of the educational services within an area and allow shared services to operate in an integrated way because representation would exist at board level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012101000014#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ferdia Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1349865900,"counter":86,"content":"<p>We will conclude as we have had a long meeting.

A further order on 15 April 2010 for the formal administration of the company was made, and this was not contested by the company.<\/p><p>  Separate to the appointment of provisional administrators, on 30 March the regulator also directed the company to cease writing all lines of business in the United Kingdom.  As officers of the court we have reported, and continue to report, to the President of the High Court on matters arising in this assignment.  To date, we have lodged over ten reports with the court which have kept the president informed as developments occurred.  We also appeared in person earlier this year and answered questions the president wished to put to us.  The court also oversees and approves the fees and costs associated with the administration.<\/p><p>  The administrators share the dismay of all Irish citizens that the current estimate of deficit in the insurance compensation fund has risen to &euro;1.65 billion.  It is important to point out that while it took approximately 18 months from the date of our appointment to uncover the &euro;1.65 billion deficit level, this deficit always existed and neither the actions or lack of actions by administrators have contributed to this number.  Furthermore, the nature of insurance claims means that while we are comfortable with the adequacy of the provisioning now in QIL, the final deficit number will only be known with certainty when the last claim is settled, a process which will take a number of years to complete.<\/p><p>  I will now set out some of the background information which I hope will assist this committee but in particular I will deal with the financial position of QIL upon our appointment, subsidiary companies, the under-provisioning of reserves, and the sale to Liberty Insurance.<\/p><p>  On the financial and operating position upon appointment, when we were appointed the task as set out in the relevant legislation was to put in place a plan to return the business of the company to a sound commercial and financial footing.  Prior to our appointment, discussions had been ongoing between the board of QIL and the company's auditors, PwC, with regard to finalising the audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009.  The draft unaudited financial statements for that year indicated a loss of approximately &euro;47 million.

The joint administrators indicated to the High Court that the main reasons for the increased call on the fund are: an increase in the best estimate of the ultimate claims by Grant Thornton actuaries - &euro;208 million; a new adverse-deviation reserve for potential claims in Ireland and the United Kingdom - &euro;300 million; a contingency reserve to protect against currency fluctuations - &euro;215 million; and a further reduction in asset values in the investment portfolio and revisions to trading estimates - &euro;152 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101000004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Carrigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349875200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me and my colleagues from the general insurance supervision division of the Central Bank to discuss the insurance compensation fund and Quinn Insurance.  The insurance compensation fund was established under the Insurance Act 1964.  It is maintained and administered under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the accountant of the High Court.  Only the High Court may make payments from the fund.  The fund is financed through contributions received from non-life insurance companies up to a maximum of 2% of their gross written premium.  The contribution is collected by the Revenue Commissioners and forwarded to the fund through the accountant of the High Court.<\/p><p>  The role of the Central Bank in respect of the fund includes carrying out an annual assessment of the financial position of the fund and determining an appropriate contribution to be paid to the fund by non-life insurance companies.  The Insurance Act 1964 states that the High Court may pay out of the fund to the administrator of an insurer such amounts as are required to enable the administrator to carry on the business of the insurer.  Quinn Insurance Limited, QIL, is required to comply on an ongoing basis with its obligations under the Insurance Acts and regulations.  Of particular note in this regard is the obligation that each insurer shall establish and maintain technical reserves in respect of all underwriting liabilities assumed by it.  The amount of technical provisions must be sufficient at all times to cover any liabilities arising out of insurance contracts as far as can reasonably be foreseen.  The amount of any item in the accounts must be determined on a prudent basis.  It is the obligation of insurance companies to ensure compliance with these requirements on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>  Throughout 2008 and 2009, the Central Bank continually engaged with QIL in respect of its business and financial performance.  The Central Bank was concerned there were gaps between the technical reserve calculations of Milliman, QIL's signing actuary, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, QIL's external auditors, because Milliman's calculations were lower than those of PricewaterhouseCoopers.  The Central Bank advised QIL during 2009 that these gaps were unacceptable.  We required QIL, Milliman and PricewaterhouseCoopers to attend several meetings in the Central Bank to discuss the issue.  The last of these meetings took place on 24 March 2010.  At this meeting the Central Bank informed QIL that the &euro;68 million gap between Milliman's estimate and PricewaterhouseCoopers's estimate for 2009 was unacceptable.  In addition, since May 2008, monthly returns submitted by QIL showed that the company had only complied from time to time with the required solvency margin.<\/p><p>  Submissions made to the Central Bank by QIL during the early part of 2010 showed its financial position had deteriorated to such an extent that the company's solvency margin was only 107%, considerably below the 150% level required.  There was no satisfactory plan in place for QIL's recovery and on 19 February and 23 March 2010, the Central Bank informed QIL that consideration was being given to applying to the High Court for the appointment of administrators.  Then, on 24 March 2010, the Central Bank was advised that previously unknown guarantees against properties of QIL valued at &euro;448 million were in place against Quinn Group debt.  In addition, the Central Bank was advised that an amount of &euro;35 million, in respect of which the Quinn Group had given an absolute commitment that it would be injected into QIL by the end of that week, would not be made because the consent of Quinn Group's lenders was required for such a payment and this had not been forthcoming.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank's decision, therefore, to apply to the High Court on 30 March 2010 for the appointment of the joint administrators was based on the emergence of the guarantees, a significant concern that QIL's technical reserves were insufficient and that the manner in which the business of QIL was being, and had been, conducted had failed to make adequate provision for its debts.  The appointment of the administrators was confirmed on 15 April 2010, after the board of QIL consented to the permanent appointment.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank understands and shares the concern about the level of the potential call on the insurance compensation fund by QIL and in particular that the projected call has increased from &euro;775 million to &euro;1.65 billion.  Reserve calculation by its nature is a difficult and complex process heavily dependent on several factors, including a firm's claim handling processes and its approach to the setting of reserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101000005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Domhnall Cullinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349875800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Cullinan.

In April 2011, when the sale to Liberty Mutual was approved, it was estimated that the call on the fund would be about &euro;600 million.  In September 2012, the Minister for Finance came before the Oireachtas and said the estimated call was &euro;738 million.  The Minister gave that figure in good faith.  In December 2012, the administrators informed the High Court that the estimate was &euro;755 million and at the end of July 2012, the estimate given to the High Court was, &quot;anything up to &euro;1.65 billion&quot;.  The original estimate was given one year into the administrators' work.  It was not a back-of-the-envelope exercise.  It was a considered estimate given when the administrators had been<i> in situ<\/i> for one year.  That estimate has increased almost threefold since that time.  <\/p><p>  For whatever reason, there was a catastrophic miscalculation of the potential losses.  Given that ordinary policy holders will be paying this levy for quite some time, they are entitled to know how the administrators could have got it so wrong.  In the first year, the administrators estimated a call on the fund of &euro;600 million, and that has increased almost threefold since then.  How could they have got it so wrong?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101000006#E00600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349875800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>The estimate of &euro;600 million was based on the information available to us.

Part of that review process resulted in what the actuaries felt was continued volatility in the case movements.  For every euro of case reserve level the actuaries, based on their experience, tend to add on another &euro;1.5, on average.  For example, current reserves in the UK model are &euro;1.3 billion.  That is made up of &euro;485 million of case reserves at company level, plus &euro;588 million, which is the actuaries' estimate of where that &euro;465 million will end up.  The final component of &euro;300 million is an adverse deviation provision which the actuaries and auditors have recommended to us as a prudent way to take into account unknown unknowns that may occur over the next ten to 15 years in settling those claims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101000006#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael McAteer"},{"type":"speech","time":1349875800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Is Mr. McAteer saying that, given the information the administrators had in their first year in the company, it was not possible to come up with a better estimate than the figure of &euro;600 million?

Did the Central Bank engage in any communication with the UK financial regulator or the Bank of England about Quinn Insurance and its selling practices such as its undercutting in the English market?

What procedures are in place since then to ensure there will not be a recurrence?  It seems the regulatory section in the Central Bank was asleep on the job in this case.  Did the Central Bank have similar concerns about any other companies during this period?<\/p><p>  I refer to the potential claims in Ireland and the UK.  This issue was also referred to by Grant Thornton.  Is there a division as between claims in Ireland and in the UK?  Mr. McAteer mentioned that an additional &euro;300 million was added during his review.  Is a breakdown available between claims in Ireland and in the UK?  I note there was a reduction in asset value of &euro;152 million in the investment portfolio of Quinn Insurance.  What is the composition of this investment portfolio?

As referred to in my opening statement, that statement was provided to us by Milliman, a well-respected global actuarial consulting firm.  If a signing actuary is unable to provide an unqualified opinion to us, the actuary must act as a whistleblower and inform the Central Bank.  At no point did we receive a whistleblower report.  PricewaterhouseCoopers was the auditor.  It is part of the work of any auditor to audit the work done by the signing actuary.  PwC raised some concerns regarding the difference in the estimates - to which I referred in my statement - but equally, PwC was willing to sign off on the reserves on the basis that these were, in its view, within a range of best estimates.  While I am very conscious there were rumours about the performance of the company and that people were concerned, very few came forward to the Central Bank to provide any concrete evidence.  Our safeguards include the statement of actuarial opinion and this was being returned to us as an unqualified opinion.  The United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority raised some concerns with us about the firm, but when we requested the provision of specific data, it was unable to provide any.  We had a good level of engagement with the FSA because Quinn Insurance had a branch in Manchester and also a presence in the North of Ireland.<\/p><p>  I have referred to the arrangements for the future such as the new engagement model with the firms.  Our powers have been greatly extended by means of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 which provided the bank with new powers with regard to fitness and probity.  It also amended the Insurance Act 1989 to allow authorised officers other than employees of the Central Bank to be called upon to carry out investigations on behalf of the bank.  Further powers for the bank are planned in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill which is currently before the House.  This will provide even further powers with regard to what we call skilled persons reports whereby the bank can commission another party to carry out an investigation on its behalf, the cost of which is charged to the firm under investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101000007#F01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Domhnall Cullinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349877000,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Cullinan confirm the form of the contact which took place with the United Kingdom financial regulator?

Grant Thornton stated in 2010 that there would be no call on the fund.  At the time of the sale of Quinn Insurance, it indicated that there could be a potential call of &euro;600 million on the fund.  When the D&aacute;il was passing legislation last October, it stated that the call could be as much as &euro;738 million.  When the matter came before the courts again in December, the amount had risen to &euro;775 million.  Now it stands at &euro;1.65 million.  I accept that Grant Thornton might not be in possession of all the correct information but there is a time when one indicates that one got it wrong.  Mr. McAteer should state that his original assertion to the effect that the taxpayer would not be obliged to cover the costs relating to this matter was completely wrong.  Mr. McAteer and his company have been paid millions of euro to carry out work in respect of this matter.  He indicated that his priority was to sell Quinn Insurance.  However, there must be due diligence in respect of the call on taxpayers.<\/p><p>  Almost everyone in the State has an insurance policy.  It is ordinary citizens who, if we are to believe the officials from the Department of Finance, are going to be obliged to pay the price in respect of this matter for the next 15 years.  There is a time and place to accept responsibility and state that one got it wrong.  In my opinion, there has been far too much of this kind of behaviour in the past.  I am reminded of comments to the effect that ours would be the \"cheapest bailout in history\".  As we are aware, the cost of the bailout continues to increase.  The figures produced by Grant Thornton in respect of this matter have gone through the roof.  It must be held responsible for the fact that it got it wrong over a very short period.<\/p><p>  In the context of the Central Bank, Mr. McAteer indicated that his company called in the auditors in respect of a dispute regarding a discrepancy of &euro;68 million between audits.  If we were only talking about &euro;68 million, then the country might be in a much better position.  I am aghast by what has taken place.  Reports indicate that Mr. McAteer has been directly responsible for supervising this company since 2006.  When a financial regulator from another member state indicates its view that a problem exists, then something must be done.  I presume that financial regulators do not engage in loose talk in respect of different companies.  It is shocking that a financial regulator from another state had to bring to the attention of the company the fact that it had failed to go through the accounts and identify some of the losses.<\/p><p>  It was stated that some of the additional losses relate to the fact that QIL's &euro;450 million of assets are deteriorating in value.  Why was this fact not factored into Grant Thornton's original assumption in respect of this matter?  Why were currency fluctuations not taken into account?  We are aware that the purpose of the 2% levy relates to products that are available in the North and Britain.  Why were currency fluctuations not taken into account in the context of the original estimates and why are they only being thrown into the mix now?<\/p><p>  The officials from the Department of Finance indicated that the amount of money required in respect of Quinn Insurance will be in the fund by 2015.  It is difficult to accept the figures the Department - and indeed the Minister for Finance - have provided in this regard.  The Minister for Finance informed the D&aacute;il that this fund would be in place for between 11 and 12 years.  That was his estimate and I presume the Department supplied him with the relevant figures.  We now know that he was basing his assertion in this regard on losses amounting to &euro;738 million.  As we are aware, those losses may eventually amount to &euro;1.65 billion or more than double the amount originally communicated to the Minister.  Our guests from the Department have indicated that the fund will only be in place for three years.  It was stated that assets and asset sales are being taken into account but why were these not part of the equation when the Minister stated that the fund could be in place for 11 or 12 years?  Did the Minister just ignore the position in this regard?  Our guests are playing around with figures, while we are concerned about people's lives and their money.  It is very disappointing that we have not received very honest and forthcoming presentations from them at this meeting.<\/p><p>  Will the officials from the Department indicate when the State will get its money back?  The administrators referred to action being taken against certain professionals.  Will they indicate the individuals against whom they propose to take legal action?  What are the chances of recouping any, if not all, of this money from the professionals who provided the administrators with dodgy advice in the past?  This matter has arisen in the past in respect of the banks, when auditors presented books indicated that certain institutions were solvent when, in fact, they were insolvent.  The State lost billions of euro as a result.

If we had not sold the company, the claims would still have had to be met.  If it had not been sold and had gone out of business, we would have no company in place to process those claims and over 1,500 would have lost their jobs.  In such circumstances, the amount of the claims would have been substantially greater than &euro;1.65 billion because we would not have had the infrastructure in place to collect them.  As stated previously, the figure of &euro;1.65 billion comprises several numbers which may or may not be required to be used.  What is important for the Department of Finance from a budgetary perspective is that those components are built in.<\/p><p>  The company is not a normal trading company.  That is one of the reasons why the actuaries and the auditors have requested that &euro;300 million be set aside as an adverse deviation provision.  This does not relate to a specific case within the Quinn Insurance caseload, it is a buffer to move the actuaries from a 50-50 review - which they would normally carry out on a trading basis - to 80-20 cover.  That is a provision the actuaries have put in place in the sense that the company is in run-off.<\/p><p>  We identified that hedging was required, we sought it and we expected to obtain it.

The figures were, therefore, calculated on the basis of a spot rate.  We disclosed to the court that the number was based on a &euro;1 to &pound;0.83 exchange rate and was exposed to currency fluctuations.  The &euro;215 million is based on an exchange rate of &euro;1 to &pound;0.70.  Luckily, sterling has weakened since our appearance before the courts in August.

It would not be unusual for us to have a relationship with a supervisor in another country where they have a physical presence, which is the case both in Northern Ireland and in Manchester.  The concerns were expressed in that context.  I hope I did not leave the committee with the impression that we did not act on the concerns, as we did, and explanations were sought from the company and answers were provided.

When that was available, we did act.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty asked a question of my colleagues about the certainty around the &euro;1.65 billion.  It seems to me that what has caused an awful lot of the anguish is the jump from the &euro;775 million to &euro;1.65 billion.  As I said in court last month, the work the administrators have done is based on a robust process.  One will not see anything like that size of an increase again but reserve estimation is not static.  I would not like anyone to leave the meeting with the impression that the amount could not go up incrementally again.  Everyone is working towards reducing the call in so far as it is possible.  The administrators are judging their performance on keeping the amount to within the range of &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.3 billion.  From my perspective and that of the protection of the policyholders of Quinn, it is very important that they make adequate provision, whatever that will be.  As Deputy Doherty said, the claims were there on the day the company went into administration.  The frustration has been in trying to get to that and to get to how bad it was.  We are where we are now but there is no absolute certainty.  One cannot have absolute certainty on the final figure but I sincerely hope it does not reach &euro;1.65 billion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101000010#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Domhnall Cullinan"},{"type":"speech","time":1349878200,"counter":212,"content":"<p>One of the frustrations is that the losses relating to Quinn Insurance Limited exist and there is not much we can do about that at this point.  I am sure many other people share my frustration that the agencies of the State failed to recognise what was happening and failed to act appropriately in advance to limit the losses or the liability of the State.  We have had problems with the banks and now we have the insurance company.  There is nothing to indicate that this scenario will not repeat itself.  If one looks back on history we have had banks in the same situation 20 years ago as they are now and levies being imposed on people.  We have a regulator to regulate them but it failed to see a potential &euro;1.65 billion loss.  What went wrong and what will be done to ensure that difficulties will not arise in the case of another insurance company, bank or financial institution that the Central Bank regulates, and that the witnesses will not be put in front of a committee to say that PricewaterhouseCoopers gave them a report and that an auditor gave them another report?  What is in place to satisfy people at home who are being screwed as a result of the financial institutions that what has happened will not happen again and that the agencies of the State are robust enough and have sufficient manpower and tools to make sure this does not happen?  Does the Central Bank need anything or could assurances be provided that it is sufficiently strong and robust to ensure this will not happen in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101000010#J01000","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349878200,"counter":213,"content":"<p>The situation with supervision in the country is well documented.

The capacity of the office has been increased massively.  The capability and the specialists we now have within the organisation have been increased substantially.  In terms of our supervisory powers, some have already been amended and others are currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Again, it is a little like the reserves, I cannot give an absolute guarantee.  Nobody can ever guarantee that nothing will happen.  We have seen insurance failures in the past in other jurisdictions and it is well documented that things were hidden from supervisors.  If people are so minded, that can be done and there is very little a supervisor can do in that regard.  We have close, continuous and ongoing engagement with the firms based on their impact category and the potential impact they could have on the Exchequer.  A lot of work has been done.

I hope the delegation will agree that this is a pretty sickening episode in the pretty awful recent history of this country.  On top of all the other crises concerning the banks and financial system, we have the mess in Quinn Insurance.  Hundreds of thousands of ordinary families and householders are on the hook again, this time for &euro;1.6 billion.  If I understand Mr. Cullinan correctly, we cannot say for certain that the figure will not be higher.  We could be forgiven for being alarmed by that thought given that the estimates have been revised upwards fairly dramatically in recent times.<\/p><p>  The main cause of this is obviously the cowboy capitalism in which the Quinn family was engaged, driven by nothing but greed.  Will the delegates from the Central Bank state how this could have happened?  That a company could be engaged in this sort of reckless mismanagement, and falsely declaring profits when making losses, represents a catastrophic failure of regulation.  There was massive under-provisioning against potential losses or claims, and none of this was spotted.  Could the delegates from the Central Bank explain the nature of the supervision, or the lack thereof, during the period in question?  What was the nature of the relationship and how was the supervision carried out?  If the delegates were under-resourced, did they tell this to the then Government or state it publicly?  Did they state they were worried that they did not have sufficient resources to carry out the necessary supervision of people such as Mr. Quinn?  If the Central Bank was not complaining about this, it was also culpable.  It is not good enough just to pass the buck, although I do not doubt the Government has to take some responsibility.  The public would like some accountability.  Who was to blame for the fact the Central Bank was under-resourced?  Was it because of the ideological commitment to light touch regulation of the previous Government?  Is that why we are paying the &euro;1.6 billion?  Was it because of the failure of the Central Bank itself to ring the alarm bells about its lack of resources or power to regulate the industry properly?<\/p><p>  On the issue of profits which were actually losses, profits were taken out of the firm by the Quinn family, which was the sole shareholder.  Gifts were mentioned.  Some &euro;135 million was given to Quinn Group Family Properties, or just to the Quinn family, and some &euro;75 million was given to Barlo Financial Services.  What precisely is that company?  Is it just another front for the Quinn family?  Do these sums comprise the same &euro;200 million that Mr. Quinn described as adding to the personal wealth portfolio of his children?  Did he not give &euro;200 million to his children a few years ago?<\/p><p>  How much profit did the Quinn family make when it was declaring profits falsely and were there more gifts than those I have mentioned?

As one who opposed the sale of Quinn Insurance and who still fails to see the logic of selling it, I do not see the logic behind the people covering the losses, bailing out the company and then handing to Liberty Insurance what could, I presume, be a profitable enterprise.  Why was there a rush to sell the company rather than nationalising it such that potential profits could be used to cover the losses we have incurred?  Who made the decision to sell?  Was pressure exerted by the Government or was it the Central Bank's decision?  I would like to know the circumstances surrounding the matter.<\/p><p>  Let me consider the question of fees.  Some &euro;14 million was paid over three years to the administrators.  This is a pretty sizeable sum.  How many people were working on this case to account for remuneration at that level?

I do not expect that again but I would not like anyone to leave with the impression that the &euro;1.65 billion is absolutely static.  We all hope the figure will be much lower.  Claims concerning people with brain injuries, for example, develop over time so one cannot know the absolute cost until the end of the process.

No insurance company remaining in administration is a long-term viable enterprise because people seek certainty when picking an insurance company.  Consequently, it was critical that we had a sale and that a sale occurred because, otherwise, I note the company's sales were declining during the period of administration because a company being in administration does not provide customer confidence.  In addition, administrators cannot make strategic decisions on items such as capital expenditure and so on because the company was loss-making at the same time.  Consequently, it was necessary to sell the company and to do so as quickly as possible.  We were also faced with a clear possibility that there would be no sale.  This was not a case in which a queue of people was lining up to purchase the company.  We did the best deal possible to secure the 1,500 jobs and had we not achieved the sale, they would have been lost.  The Deputy also raised the question of benefit to the State and what is important in the future is that, both directly and indirectly, the State has a 50% interest in Liberty Insurance.  That company is now run by professionals, in the sense that they are from the fifth largest insurance company in the world.  They run the business and have the expertise and the access to capital.  They have all the know-how to run an insurance company properly and the State has an indirect 50% stake in that business in the future.

Consequently, &euro;6 million of the figure of &euro;14 million relates to the UK payment for actuarial fees.  As for the total of &euro;8 million, we also had a property portfolio, if one wishes to call it that, of more than &euro;448 million.  We had asset management and were obliged to get buildings ready for disposal.  We sold the hotel in Cambridgeshire for &pound;35 million last August.  We have fundamental issues to walk through to get each of those assets ready for sale and to maximise the value for the taxpayer.  It takes substantial time and effort to get the assets to its maximum value for sale.

For the benefit of members, he might elaborate further on the reception that awaited the administrators when they arrived at Quinn Insurance Limited.

Mr. McAteer might elaborate on this and whether this was the position.  In that context and in respect of the administrators' preliminary reports to the courts, with hindsight, does Mr. McAteer think there was an excessive reliance on senior management with regard to the guesstimate he was in a position to make at an early stage?

In terms of the accuracy of the reserves and the level of certainty one can build around reserving, as Mr. Cullinan stated it is not a precise science.  The core foundation is the file estimates.  When a file comes, say, for an injury, one has a snapshot of what is involved.  If one has the right balance of experience and knowledge in the organisation, one can give a reasonable estimate of what the claim is likely to cost.<\/p><p>  One of the issues in Quinn Insurance is what is described as a culture of optimistic or aggressive reserving.  If a more conventional view was a figure of X, Quinn Insurance would tend to target a much lower number on the estimate.  If the estimate were low, then the actuarial reserving on top of that would miss it.  This would lead to a compounding of the error and the error in the file estimate.  There was a culture of aggressive reserving while processes and controls were not strong.  This was backed up by the State Claims Agency when it went into the company.  There were some examples of deliberately under-reserving which led to sanctions against some individuals in the claims department.  There was a foundation around the file estimation of the company which was not up to the standards one would expect.<\/p><p>  In fairness to the administration, much of that was done in the first 18 months.  How long did it take to find this?  It took three exercises at different stages with different degrees of pressure to get the file estimates up to the level that was regarded as satisfactory.<\/p><p>  When one is trying to project into the future the cost of any claim, one is dealing with the potential deterioration in the injury that the individual has suffered, external environmental issues, changes in legislation and the decisions of the courts.  It is a complex area and is not amenable to a precise figure.  Hence, when we give the committee a figure that we consider is robust and prudent, we are 80% certain about it but there is 20% risk depending on what happens in the external environment.<\/p><p>  There was a culture in the company of aggressive reserving and there was probably not the right skills set within the company for managing, particularly the more complex claims.  These two issues together created a scenario in which there was much under-provisioning of the files which the actuarial provisioning then accentuated the problem as it did not adequately pick up on that.  I do not want to go into it too much further because there are issues there where we feel some of these matters should have been picked up.  We will be examining that in the context of legal action.  Another difficulty is that some of the claims go back to 2000 and it takes a long time for the more complex claims to settle.<\/p><p>  Broadly speaking, there was a culture of aggressive provisioning and lack of adequate experience, knowledge and controls.  These have now been addressed and we have adequate reassurance from our investigations that the situation today is satisfactory from our perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012101000014#N01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Cassells"},{"type":"speech","time":1349880600,"counter":312,"content":"<p>As I stated earlier, I need to leave the meeting for a while.

There were allegations, for example, of retired garda&iacute; being used to visit claimants in their homes, etc.  Did the Central Bank look into that?  It was widely reported at the time.

The real problem with Quinn Insurance was the large claims.  We refer to the smaller claims as attritional claims such as the fender benders and the slip and trips.  The model they had for that is probably more the model to which the Deputy is referring.  With any model like that where the cost is &euro;10,000 and one settles for &euro;7,000 and somebody views that as a &euro;3,000 profit, there is a danger in that one of the basic principles of insurance is to indemnify people in order that if they lose, they are compensated for their financial loss.  It is equally wrong to overcompensate them but they should be in the same position after the claim has been settled as before it.  That is the fear in that type of model.  What I can certainly say to the Deputy is in terms of complaints about Quinn Insurance claims settlement and the company's compliance with our consumer protection code and the rules, there were no significant issues and there was not a significant level of complaints, certainly as compared to their peers.

The purpose of regulation is to ensure there is a level playing field.  How did it happen that QIL was clearly operating with smaller reserves than other companies?  I ask Mr. Cullinan and to explain the regulation that allowed that to continue.  Shortly after Mr. Elderfield had been appointed as Financial Regulator he moved to put the group into administration.

I hope I got the pronunciation right as I rarely call him by his surname.  He is accompanied by Mr. Mahdi Babakazemi, third counsellor at the embassy in Dublin.  I sincerely thank the ambassador for accepting our invitation so promptly.  The committee has asked him here to discuss a number of issues that have been raised by visitors to the committee or by way of correspondence and we look forward to hearing his views on these.  The matters the committee has signalled it wishes to discuss are: Iran's nuclear programme and the associated sanctions, which is an important topic at present and dominates the news headlines; reports that anti-Semitic comments have been made by the Vice President of Iran; the organisation known as the People's Mujahideen Organisation of Iran and related issues of Camp Ashraf; and the protection of human rights in Iran, including the rights of adherents to the Baha'i faith.  We would also like to discuss broader issues, including bilateral relations between Ireland and Iran - we consider that extremely important as well - and the prospect of developing a trade relationship.  The ambassador has been working extremely hard over the last year or so to encourage trade between Ireland and Iran, and a number of delegations from the educational and agricultural sectors have come from Iran in recent times with a view to improving trade with our country.  That is very important.<\/p><p>  Before inviting you to make your presentation, I wish to advise you that you are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at the committee.

It is a pleasure and an honour to be here to discuss the issues of interest for both countries.  I will speak in my introduction about my country and perhaps in the members' questions we will discuss all the issues that are important for both sides.<\/p><p>  Members will have a general idea about Iran but I will only mention some points.  In the name of God, Iran, which is known also as Persia, with several thousands years of history and civilisation, is located in a strategic area of the Middle East.  It has 15 neighbours, some of them with a variety of regional problematic issues.  Iran has a population of 75 million and is located in a region with a population of 300 million.  We have very close relations in that area.<\/p><p>  The Islamic revolution of 1979 was rooted in the constitutional movement in Iran in 1905, whereupon, for the first time in that region, Iranian people could realise their right to have a national parliament.  Five decades later, in a popular uprising, Iranians were able to overcome the dictatorship of the Shah and introduce a popular government.  Unfortunately, it was subsequently suppressed by a foreign-supported <i>coup d'&eacute;tat<\/i> in 1953, and the Shah came back to power.  The struggle was not over, and two decades later new ways of uprising led to the collapse of the Shah's regime in 1979.  The Islamic revolution came up with the slogans of independence and freedom, and a new age of political, economic and cultural life began for the Iranian people based on those slogans.  Following the revolution the state's main policies basically changed, especially foreign policy.  At the top, there was a withdrawal from military alliances.  Iran was part of the western military alliance in that region.  We hosted more than 30,000 military experts in that time and they all had to leave.  We joined the Non-Aligned Movement, ceased our relations with the apartheid regime in South Africa and supported Mr. Mandela and the African National Congress, ANC.  We shifted our foreign policy towards supporting the Palestinians' legal rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012101000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

As the ambassador is aware, the standards of animal husbandry and food production in this country are exceptionally high, right through from the farms to the processing facilities.  As a country we have welcomed, over the years, senior veterinary delegations from countries all over the world to see at first hand how our food production system works.  We are very proud of that system and the high standards we maintain.  I ask the ambassador to try to ensure that whatever technical details are outstanding are finalised as soon as possible.

I visited Iran twice some years ago and we are all keen students of history of the Egyptians, Persians, Greeks and Romans so we have an ongoing interest in the area.  Some of those regimes were very peaceful and educational and cultural while some were very war-like.  It is part of what we are.<\/p><p>  The question of weapons grade uranium and the development of a nuclear weapons programme is a difficulty that I understand.  Iran says it does not have any such programme and we must be convinced, which is a matter for the Iranians; they must convince the global community.  We know there was an unfortunate experience previously with Iraq and the weapons of mass destruction that did not exist.  We do not wish to engage in any way in a propaganda war suggesting that something exists when it does not.  We need, however, because of the seriousness of the situation in the region, to know what is going on.  If something like that is happening, it is of massive importance to Iran's neighbours and the rest of the global community.<\/p><p>  Anti-semitism has been discussed at this and other meetings.  Because of the sensitive nature of relations in the area anything said by either side to inflame passions is not of any benefit to anyone, not to Iran, its neighbours or the rest of us.  I would like clarification of this issue.  I am sorry the ambassador must leave so quickly.<\/p><p>  Human rights is a huge issue that this committee is particularly interested in.  Going back decades, the Irish Government has taken an interest in the issue.  While propaganda may give false impressions, from the information we have, and I would like to hear if it is true or not, it appears there is a problem with the observance of human rights in certain quarters with particular reference to the right of the individual to practice his own religion or customs.  Deputy Crowe mentioned prisons and people are judged by the manner in which they treat the people who are in custody.  It is vital for the benefit of those in power in any administration that human rights are strictly observed.  Deputy Crowe's point is valid.  Is it possible for international human rights observers to attend and engage with the Iranian authorities to reassure the rest of the global community that basic human rights are being observed?  That would be very important and beneficial in the entire Middle East.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012101000004#C00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1349876400,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I want to give everyone a chance so if the ambassador deals with Deputy Smith's question about Irish beef exports and the technical details that remain to be worked out, and the nuclear question.

We are going to supply the committee with a detailed paper in respect of this matter.  I should mention the fact that the nuclear programme in Iran was launched in the 1950s.  It is not new and it was started with the help of the United States as part of the atoms for peace programme.  In 1967 the Tehran nuclear research centre, in respect of which the US supplied a 5 MW nuclear research reactor, was established.  The centre was fuelled by enriched uranium.  Following the Iranian revolution, the United States cut off the supply of the enriched uranium required for the research centre.  The Tehran research reactor uses 20% enriched fuel to produce radioactive isotopes used to treat more than 1 million people who suffer from various diseases, mainly cancers.  This is the outcome of the research centre, which requires 20% enriched uranium.<\/p><p>  We have tried to import 20% enriched uranium, both through the International Atomic Energy Agency and from other countries.  Unfortunately, we have not received a positive response in this regard.  A proposal was put forward, by the US and others, that Iran should send out part of the enriched uranium - approximately 1,200 kg - and have it enriched to 20% and then returned for use in the research reactor.  This proposal was not successful.  The President and Prime Minister of Brazil and Turkey, respectively, came to Tehran and signed the deal.  Everything was finalised and I can supply to the committee the relevant letter that was published by the foreign Ministers of Brazil and Turkey.  It was our view that problem had been solved and that we would not be obliged to enrich uranium to 20% purity, particularly as this is very costly and we do not need that cost.  Unfortunately, the deal to which I refer did not work.  We were left, therefore, with a research centre and a reactor on which patients in Iran are dependent.  There was no possibility of obtaining the uranium required.  As a result, we had no choice other than to produce 20% enriched uranium ourselves.<\/p><p>  On 2 October, our President clearly stated that Iran had no alternative other than to enrich uranium to a purity level of 20% after the Western countries had refused to sell Iran the nuclear fuel it needed to operate its research centre reactor for producing the medical products required for patients.  The Western countries have refused Iran's requests on several occasions.  The President stated that we were even ready to give 3.5% enriched fuel to the West and to get back fuel enriched to 20%.  Again, the West was not ready to do this so we were forced to start enriching uranium to a purity level of 20%.  The President also emphasised, in New York and again during an interview in Tehran, that Iran is still willing to stop enriching uranium to 20% if the International Atomic Energy Agency members sell the required fuel to it.  Last week, in an interview with <i>Der Spiegel<\/i> in Germany, our Foreign Minister clearly stated:<blockquote>If our right to enrichment is recognised, we are prepared to offer an exchange.  We would voluntarily limit the extent of our enrichment programme, but in return we would need a guaranteed supply of the relevant fuels from abroad.<\/blockquote>Our proposal is very clear.  We are ready to stop enriching uranium to a purity level of 20% if a guarantee is given that the research centre will be supplied with the fuel it needs.  The research centre is the only place in Iran which supplies the material required to treat the patients to whom I refer.  Some 1 million Iranian patients rely on the materials produced at the centre.  As soon as the western countries reply positively to our proposal, we will cease producing the 20% enriched uranium about which they are concerned.<\/p><p>  As one of the members stated, none of the reports from either the IAEA or various intelligence services have provided evidence to the effect that Iran is working on nuclear weapons.  We have made it clear that we are not engaged in such work.  Iran is a member of the IAEA.  Inspectors are present at the centres in Iran on a 24-hour basis.  They are verifying what is happening and there are cameras on site.  We have no plan to produce nuclear weapons.  Independent experts from different countries, including from the United States, have produced reports in respect of this matter.  Members may have seen those reports but we can certainly make them available to the committee.  Our position in this regard is very clear.  The only demand we have is that the countries who are opposed to Iran enriching uranium should provide us with what we need and should recognise our rights under the NPT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012101000005#D00700","nonspeaker":"H.E.

We, on behalf of the trade, applaud his efforts.<\/p><p>  I have very little in common with his country, in so far as an Irish politician gets a mandate from the people to represent liberal democratic standards.  The difference between the democratic society we are used to and an Islamic republic such as Iran is like chalk and cheese.<\/p><p>  I am surprised at the sentiments expressed by members of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party when they questioned the nuclear enrichment programme.  There has been eight fruitless years of negotiations on the nuclear enrichment programme between China, France, Germany, Russia, United Kingdom and the United States.  These six are known alternatively as the E3+3.  Six major powerful nations have been involved in negotiations with Iran on the nuclear issues with fruitless results.<\/p><p>  We as a small island country are equally concerned about the welfare of the 75 million Iranians, particularly the beautiful and highly-educated young population.  We would hate to see any pre-emptive strike by Israel against the nuclear deposits in Iran.  We are entering a very sensitive period, with the forthcoming elections in America.  One can clearly see that Mitt Romney would support the Israelis in pre-emptive strikes whereas President Obama has to be more understanding and has supported the extension of the talks.  The talks must reach a conclusion.  I disagree with my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues.  Sanctions are a crude method of punishing a nation.  I understand Iran is suffering tremendously from sanctions.  The people who suffer as a result of sanctions are usually the poor and less capable who cannot sustain themselves in a sanctioned society.  I am pleading with the ambassador to convey to his Government that Ireland applauds Iran's right to nuclear energy.  It is, however, the potential military use of the enriched uranium that worries us.  We would like to see a conclusion to the negotiations on that issue.  <\/p><p>  We cannot support the Iranian Government on a vast range of actions.  Human rights has been mentioned.  We know of examples of the outrageous treatment of women, the horrendous treatment of gay, lesbian and transgender people and the public executions.  The hanging of gays from cranes in public places is inhuman.  I cannot see the religious context for that type of behaviour.  It is horrendous to hear President <font color=\"#222222\">Ahmadinejad's bellicose outcries about Israel and how he intends to wipe Israel off the face of the earth.  That type of language does nothing to secure the security of the 75 million population in Iran.  I would be very interested in visiting Iran.  Iran has a rather complex border of 1,000 km.  I applaud the way it deals with<\/font><i><font color=\"#222222\"> <\/font><\/i><font color=\"#222222\">drug trafficking which is a major problem.  We in Ireland know the negative effects of drug trafficking on a community or a society.  Just because there is a border of 1,000 km with neighbouring Afghanistan, to call the influx of drugs a Zionist plot is confrontational.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#222222\">  There are many human rights issues.  The delegates will appreciate that we as a committee and a country apply a very high level of support for those who are activists in the human rights field, front-line defenders, NGO movements and so on.  <\/font><br \/><font color=\"#222222\">  Until such time as the nuclear issue is brought to a satisfactory conclusion, the sanctions will apply.  Until Iran returns to being a society that is more acceptable in the wider game of international politics, there will be pain involved for the people of Iran unless negotiations are successful in dealing with these tricky issues.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012101000006#E00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1349877600,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I believe that civilised discourse and courtesy are very important values and for that reason I welcome the presence of our guests who will of course be treated with courtesy.

Israel did not warn Iraq and Syria that it was going to attack them.  Therefore, it does not need to warn other countries if it intends attacking.  Israel knew the case of Iran was different and a strike was not possible then.  However, if we are put in a position where we must defend ourselves, we know how to defend ourselves.  A war has been imposed on us for eight years, but we have resisted against war.  If one looks at the history of Iran over the past 200 years, there has been no case of Iran starting or initiating a war against a neighbour.  We do not have any border conflict with our neighbours and we have not initiated any war.  Even our revolution, if compared with other movements in the region, was the most peaceful.  The revolution was conducted peacefully, with as few casualties as possible.<\/p><p>  Iranians, as Senator Norris and others know, are more concerned about culture, civilisation and human beings as a whole rather than other matters.  For example, if one looks at terrorist attacks that have taken place, such as the 11 September attack and others, one will not find even one Iranian national involved.  None.  In the past 1,000 years of civilization we have looked for peaceful solutions for all problems.  With regard to the nuclear issue, we are optimistic the situation will improve without violence.  Also, we will work with Europe and other countries to help improve the situation in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Bahrain and all countries with problems. <\/p><p>  As members know, Iran has been chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, NAM, for three years.  The most recent summit of this group was held in Tehran just a month ago and Iran will remain the chair of the movement, which has more than 120 members, for the coming three years.  Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union for the first six months of next year offering an area of potential co-operation to help bring about improvements in our region.<\/p><p>  Senator Norris mentioned his knowledge of Islam and our beliefs.  I recall a letter from one of the Islamic leaders to his representative when he was sending him as governor to Egypt one time.  He told him when he was going there that the people could be seen as being in two groups.  Some of them would have the same religion, but the others were sharing human beings.  Therefore, he could either govern the Muslims there or govern them as human beings, because people are all the same and share the same common areas.  We believe that all people around the world share a common essence of being human and that this is the most important common ground on which we should base other relations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012101000009#H00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

As usual, the Seanad is a step ahead because we have had an opportunity to consider the Bill.

I was forthright in the Seanad in arguing that people in direct provision and those who come under the auspices of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, the Reception and Integration Agency and the Prison Service should be included under the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit.<\/p><p>  The Minister has indicated that he will establish a redress agency under the Department of Justice and Equality but the Ombudsman&rsquo;s role is one of final adjudication and issues could also arise with the proposed new body.  The Ombudsman should be given jurisdiction over these agencies even at this stage because even if the new body is established the need for redress could arise if voices are not heard.<\/p><p>  For the past several weeks I have been campaigning on behalf of Lisbrook direct provision centre.  Today we received a letter from the Minister stating that the centre is to be closed with immediate effect and that a review is ongoing.

Much of the delay was caused by bodies which fought to be excluded - I do not refer solely to bodies under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality - with the result that long conversations and arguments took place, people lost the political will to keep up the campaign and then something else popped up.  It has been very difficult even to get the Bill to this stage but I am confident that we might have it by the end of the month.  It is entirely open to this committee and to individual members to do what they want but my view is that on balance it is best to proceed with it than to delay it further in the hope that whatever the Department of Justice and Equality proposes will fit the requirement for an independent and transparent appeals process.

My explanation is it is just institutional racism and the State does not want to highlight the appalling treatment of people in the direct provision system.  I do not know whether the Ombudsman would feel free to agree publicly.  Is it not telling that asylum seekers who are fleeing persecution are exempted from the treatment every other citizen expects when they should have a right of resources or appeal against the way they are being treated by the State by being lumped in with prosecuted criminals?  While people in prison should also have rights, is it not telling that asylum seekers and so on are lumped in with them, which indicates the attitude the State has towards them, and that the normal process of justice, where people are innocent until proven guilty, is turned on its head and the State assumes asylum seekers are guilty until proven innocent and all rights are suspended until they work their way through the long and onerous asylum process?  What explanations have the Department of Justice and Equality and the Government given to the Ombudsman for their refusal to extend the office's remit to cover these areas?

The administration of my office comes within the remit of freedom of information but not its investigations per se.  They are protected, as are other ombudsman office investigations.<\/p><p>  In regard to complaints against my office, I once attended a meeting of ombudsmen where the question was raised as to whether there should be an ombudsman for ombudsmen.  In other words, <i>quis custodiet ipsos custodes<\/i>?  We constantly review our own internal complaints procedures in order to ensure they are as transparent and robust as possible.  I accept that people sometimes will not be satisfied with the outcome of their engagement with the office.  There is the possibility of judicial review in such cases but that can be an expensive process.  I cannot give an easy answer to the Deputy's question and will not give a glib one, other than to say that we take every complaint seriously.  When a complaint is submitted, an investigator other than the person who received it is assigned to deal with it.  It then goes up the line, usually ending up with me, unless I am the subject of the complaint in which case the director general would deal with it.<\/p><p>  We have a great deal of personal interaction with complainants and will go back to them again and again.  There are people we continue to have dialogue with for years.  I am not saying we always act perfectly - that is absolutely not the case.  Sometimes people who feel they have been wronged either do not understand that I cannot do anything about it or it is something that so troubles them that they cannot let it go.  We take complaints very seriously, mainly because of the nature of our own office.  Nobody likes being criticised and we are no exception.  As I said, there is always the option of judicial review.  I may be creating a stick to beat my own back in pointing out that in the United Kingdom office, it is not uncommon for decisions to be &#8220;JRed&#8221;, as it is called.

I have exhausted all of my particular powers in this regard.  I put it before the committee at the time that the Government did not wish to answer to it in terms of its decision, but it did eventually relent.

In overall terms, 2011 was the busiest year for my office since its establishment in 1984 with 3,602 valid complaints received, which was a marginal decrease from the 2010 record high of 3,727.  The total number of cases dealt with in 2011 was 4,420, which was an increase of 38% on 2010 and my office dealt with 11,541 inquiries, which was an increase of 23% on 2010.<\/p><p>  In 2010, 61% of cases were received and dealt with in fewer than three months, which was up from the equivalent of 47% in 2010.  Our increased productivity was achieved as a result of a major organisational review which was completed in early 2011 leading to a more efficient and effective operational model.  I explained the detail of that change management process in my annual report.  In terms of the breakdown of the valid complaints received in 2011, 46.6% related to the Civil Service, 27.7% related to local authorities, just about one-quarter related to the HSE, 1.5% related to An Post and 0.1% related to my separate statutory role under the Disability Act 2005.  The Civil Service total of 1,670 included 1,135 complaints against the Department of Social Protection, which comprised just over 30% of the overall number of complaints received by the office in 2011.<\/p><p>  In my introduction to the annual report, I reflected on my office's role in dealing with complaints against public bodies prompted by the consequences of the economic downturn.  Needless to say, it is a matter for the Government to make difficult high-end fiscal policy decisions, which can mean that at a local level, services or benefits are either abolished or reduced, and it is not the role of the Ombudsman to interfere in such decisions.  I do, however, have a legitimate role in examining how such decisions are implemented when a complainant comes to me after having been adversely affected.  I am of the view that it is unacceptable if cutbacks are not communicated at all, communicated in a confused manner or implemented in an apparently unfair or arbitrary way.<\/p><p>  To give a practical example if, for example, a long-running scheme is closed down at short notice, I do not think a public body could treat people who had already applied for such a scheme and had submitted valid applications in the same way as people who had not submitted applications before the decision was announced.  In such cases, applicants have acted in good faith and have a legitimate expectation that their applications will be considered in the normal way having regard to the published eligibility criteria.  Furthermore, I do not think it acceptable for public bodies to seek to achieve savings by stealth by, for example, arbitrarily raising the bar in terms of eligibility criteria where discretion is available to grant or deny a particular allowance.  Decisions must be made based on clear-cut published criteria and individual decisions to deny a particular allowance must be fully explained and made in a manner consistent with the relevant criteria.<\/p><p>  In addition, where a public body has discretion available to it, the blanket fettering of the exercise of that discretion so as to deny an allowance or an opportunity to mitigate a penalty is not only unacceptable but would amount to maladministration.  Cutbacks can also lead to the introduction of a prioritisation system, formal or informal, to cope with limited resources.  When this happens, people should be told that this is the case and have it explained to them, including the reasons for the system and the guiding principles determining any prioritisation of one applicant or beneficiary over another.  I do not propose to go through in detail the individual cases outlined in the annual report as I hope they are self-explanatory but if members have any questions on its contents, I will be happy to deal with them later.<\/p><p>  I would like to make some comments on my relationship with this committee.  I take this opportunity to underline how pivotal I see my office's relationship with this committee.  The Office of the Ombudsman is a creature of Parliament and has a statutory duty to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas annually and in respect of investigations and special reports.  In order to fulfil the inter-relationship, it is of the utmost importance that there is a follow-through at parliamentary level when the Ombudsman submits a report.  This committee now provides a formal avenue whereby such reports can be given due consideration and debate while at the same time respecting the statutory independence of the Office of the Ombudsman in carrying out its complaint examination function.<\/p><p>  I would characterise the relationship of the committee with the Ombudsman as that of a \"critical friend\".  We offer each other mutual respect but we are not afraid to say what needs to be said if the situation demands it.  I also acknowledge the committee's stated determination to carry out its work in a non-partisan fashion by setting political allegiances aside, which is also crucial.  The committee's role in accepting petitions is now getting off the ground and I have arranged for officials from my office to engage with the committee's secretariat in order to agree operational procedures with the committee in that context.  This will cover such matters as the referral of complaints from the committee to my office, if appropriate, and the feedback process when my office completes its examination of such complaints.  We also need to avoid duplication and overlap in carrying out our respective complaint examination functions.  I can assure the committee that my office will bring its long experience to bear in assisting the committee in its vetting and handling of petitions in every way possible either formally or informally.<\/p><p>  Finally, I would like to inform the committee that I hope to bring a special report to it in the coming weeks under section 6(5) of the Ombudsman Act.  I hope the committee will understand that I am not in a position to discuss it today as the report is not yet finalised but when laid before the Oireachtas, I would welcome the opportunity to reappear before the committee to discuss it in detail and to answer any questions it may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2012101000007#F01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1349883600,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Reilly for the excellent and fascinating report and the work that has been done on it.

To some degree, tough political decision making is clashing with bureaucracy.  Money is being saved.  As the Ombudsman, I do not have an opinion on policy.  If a Department decides to abolish a scheme or benefit for whatever reason, that is its decision.  I deal with how the Department goes about it.<\/p><p>  Let us take an example of someone who used to be in receipt of domiciliary care allowance in respect of a child with autism but who no longer receives it.  The child has not necessarily improved or worsened, but the scheme has been tightened.  We were finding that, in schemes where there was an element of subjectivity or discretion, one doctor might say \"Yes\" while another might say \"Maybe not\".  In the Celtic tiger years, the discretion went one way.  Now that there is a recession, it is going the other way.  Any Minister can truthfully claim that nothing has changed, the scheme is the scheme and the rules are the rules, but it does not feel that way to people because the discretion has changed.<\/p><p>  I have been trying to get the message across at meetings such as this and through our annual report.  We are in the process of drafting a new set of principles of good administration and complaint handling.  Sometimes people believe this is like motherhood and apple pie, but we have found these sets of principles useful when it comes to letting public bodies know how they should treat people and deal with the schemes under their remit.  When we publish the principles, I hope that the committee and the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform will buy into them so that the message can go out that this is the way matters should be handled.<\/p><p>  No one likes to impart bad news.  What tends to happen is that people are not being straight about cuts.  People can cope with cuts to a degree, but it is difficult to cope with not knowing whether they are entitled or why they are no longer receiving payments despite having had an entitlement six months previously and nothing having changed in the meantime.

The Geological Survey of Ireland, as part of the larger Department, provides technical and independent geological advice, including in the groundwater area, where we also work with the EPA.  The circulated document demonstrates the importance of groundwater as a drinking water resource, and it can constitute up to 80% of the water supply in some counties.  Some 68% of group water schemes serving 20 or more people are supplied by groundwater boreholes or springs and we are aware that there are up to 200,000 private wells in rural areas not served by public or group water schemes, and where groundwater is usually the only source of supply.  We have a detailed map showing the level of information we have across all the country, and we can take the north west as an example.  Groundwater resources or aquifers where there is a water supply can be categorised based on its importance and strategic value.  Most of the rural houses and farms would have their own bore and spring, and not all boreholes are necessarily known or mapped.  From the data we have, the deepest water supplies known in the area are approximately 140 metres.<\/p><p>  As part of risk assessment we produce a groundwater protection or vulnerability map, showing the areas where groundwater is most at risk from surface contamination.  By combining the importance of the aquifer with the thickness of cover and nature of geology, we can produce planning maps used by the local authorities and in development plans.  With regard to contamination pathways, the highest threat is considered to be contamination from boreholes, and engineering solutions are considered to ensure that does not happen.  Gas leakage from below the aquifer along fractures is also an issue, and it should be pointed out that from what we know of the geology, existing faults are relatively tight in the area.  Seismics or acoustics are used to monitor and model the process.  Gas exploration within or adjacent to the aquifer which could cause lateral migration would seem to be unlikely due to lack of permeability or large lateral distances.  It is nonetheless considered a potential source of contamination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101000004#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Koen Verbruggen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349858400,"counter":617,"content":"<p>As outlined, the authorisations granted are licensing options and provide a first right to apply.

It is vital that the information provided for this committee is conveyed to the wider public because of the concerns expressed, particularly in the areas in which it is proposed to carry out hydraulic fracturing.  <\/p><p>  One of my questions relates to a comment made earlier about the licence application option, which is that at the end of February the existing licence holders must take a decision on whether to apply for an exploration licence.  Tamboran Resources, representatives of which have chosen not to appear before the committee, indicated in a letter to it that the company was aware that a special study of shale gas had been initiated by the EPA which will report in about 12 months and until that time the company considered discussions would not be meaningful.  It stated it did not believe it was productive to make detailed comment on project impacts until the requirements of the EPA and other regulatory agencies were defined.  It stated its schedule was predicated on the EPA report and the strict regulatory and planning mechanisms that would be in place.  It stated it expected the project would be allowed to advance at least to the test well stage once these regulatory and planning requirements were known, although it believed this was unlikely to be before 2015.  In the light of that letter, does it mean its licence application will fall?  It appears from the letter that Tamboran Resources will not be in a position by February to apply for an exploration licence because it is awaiting the outcome of further research.  What are the implications of this for licence holders?<\/p><p>  Also, Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in has pointed out that there are a number of EU regulatory regimes in place that will have an impact and be relevant to the final decision on this issue.  A question was put by two Green Party Members of the European Parliament to the Directorate-General for the Environment last July and the reply stated that as part of its ongoing effort to determine whether the level of human health and environmental protection provided by the existing EU legislation was appropriate, the Commission had initiated work in order to assess by the end of 2013 whether there was a need for a risk management framework for shale gas developments in Europe, both at the exploration and commercial production phases and, if necessary, the form that it would take.  What input does the Department have into these discussions with the Directorate-General for the Environment?  Is it actively engaging with it in terms of what appears to be ongoing research and analysis as to whether the existing legislative framework in Europe will be sufficient?  As the officials will be aware, several European countries have suspended or introduced a moratorium on shale gas exploration; therefore, this is a Europe-wide issue, not exclusively an Irish one.  What input will the Department have into it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101000005#G00100","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1349859000,"counter":619,"content":"<p>We will take all the questions together and the officials can note them for reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101000005#G00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1349859000,"counter":620,"content":"<p>My family and I live five or six miles from what would be the centre of operations in this case.

At some stage members of the committee will need to meet in north Leitrim to see the countryside and the community we are discussing.  I formally propose that a meeting be held on a site in what would be the centre of fracking operations.  Can such a meeting be arranged?  I will facilitate by providing a nice conference room that would be capable of accommodating the meeting.<\/p><p>  To put it mildly, it is disappointing that representatives of Tamboran Resources did not see fit to attend this meeting.  The reason they have given is that it is difficult to engage in meaningful discussions at this stage, yet, according to them, they continue to work closely with the relevant Departments in establishing dialogue with all stakeholders.  Therefore, they are saying they do not have enough information to talk to legislators, but they do have enough information to talk to the community.  Is it any wonder that the community has concerns about the validity of the information being passed at those meetings?  Had Tamboran Resources representatives been here, I would have asked them to explain something.  There are recent credible reports which cast serious doubt on the company's projected figures for the estimates of gas available, average well performance and projected well life.  They also call into serious question the projected development costs, income projections, job number projections and, critically, the State income projections.<\/p><p>  I have a vested interest and my position is very clear.

People talk about experiments and work taking place in Poland and the United States, but north Leitrim is different.  The ground and scenery are different and what is underground is totally different from what is in Poland or the United States.

That provided some reassurance until I received a newsletter, <i>EU News Bulletin<\/i>, published by the Irish Regions Brussels office of September 2012, issue No. 94.  Lo and behold, I note a budget of &euro;200,000 has been set aside to cover five or six hearings and campaigns with a view to organising early stage dialogue with citizens and launch information campaigns on shale gas as a basis for informing decision-making on its potential industrial exploitation.  Many members of the community in north Leitrim will have heard the European Commissioner saying there was insufficient information available and telling people to wait and see what happened.  At the same time, representatives of a company will not appear before the committee because it is too early to meet legislators, but it will talk to communities to split them.

Questions were asked as to the next step in the application process and the associated timeline.  Questions were asked about a number of studies that have been completed or are ongoing and how they relate to the process.  I will start with those two themes and I will answer the questions as best I can.<\/p><p>  I refer to the application process.  The companies have a licensing option which gives them a first right over others to apply for an exploration licence.  If they wish to exercise that right, they must do so before the end of next February.  In reply to Deputy O'Mahony, three companies in different parts of the country have those licensing options.  They will make their decisions independently before the end of February as to whether they wish to apply for a licence.  If they wish to stay involved in the process and they wish to exercise that right, they would need to apply.  The key point is that any such application and process must be supported by an environmental impact statement.  The Minister has said that this process and the evaluation of that application will be underpinned by a full environmental impact assessment.  The Minister has also said that the assessment cannot conclude until the findings of the further EPA research are considered.  That is the first stage on the timeline, for the information of the committee.<\/p><p>  To be clear, there is nothing in the statutory process that indicates the timeline by which that environmental impact assessment must be concluded.  This is important from the perspective that no company has a right to make an application and demand a response.  The application process will take the length of time it takes and a key element in that process and in the evaluation will be the findings of the further EPA research.  The committee may have to wait for the next presentation to understand the timeline element.  I will not pre-empt the EPA findings because in the first instance it will be scientific research and it will make conclusions.  If those conclusions leave it open to a project advancing to an exploration stage, then the full evaluation of the application and the environmental impact statement and assessment process will begin.  One can anticipate that the process, if it runs well and if there were no need for additional information, would last for eight or nine months but it could be more than one year.  Time would need to be allowed at the conclusion of the EPA research for the company and the regulatory bodies to consider that research and then a nine to 12-month period would need to be allowed for an assessment of an application.  That is the timeline involved.  As for the range of studies that have been completed and those which are ongoing, they will feed into the EPA project.  The aim is to conclude with a scientific-based understanding of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing in Ireland and for that to inform future decision making.  <\/p><p>  I will deal with some of the other questions from members.  The potential environmental and social impact will be addressed through those consent processes.  Deputy Colreavy referred to the exploration stage in this regard.  There will be an environmental impact assessment of any application for an exploration licence and that environmental impact assessment has to take account of community issues and the environmental and social impacts.  A number of consent bodies determine whether the exploration phase can go ahead.  The exploration licence is a matter for the Minister, but as outlined in the presentation, a planning consent is required and also a safety permit from the Commission for Energy Regulation.  As regards the role of the Oireachtas, the members will understand that role as well as anyone.  In my view, the manner in which such applications must be considered is set down in the legislation by the Legislature.  A point that is raised at times with regard to the discussion about unconventional gas is relevant to a point raised by Deputy Colreavy about the trade-off between the use of gas versus the use of renewable energy.  It would relate to unconventional gas if unconventional gas was an acceptable way to proceed and it is also relevant to conventional offshore gas.  The key point for Ireland is that there will be a continued high dependence on gas in our energy mix.  There is a benefit for Ireland if that gas is indigenous gas and we can gain a financial return from it.  <\/p><p>  On the question about company figures, the Department does not comment on projections made by exploration companies involved at the early stages or in the exploration stage.  The only time the company figures matter is at the point when it is making the case that it has a commercial discovery.  There are often news reports, in advance of exploration drilling, of predictions by the company which are based on what might be the potential of an area.  Exploration drilling is required for any confirmation and a significant level of appraisal drilling will be required before there can be a determination of the reserves with anything close to great certainty.  As to the enforcement of commitments, the Department has a strong control in that any change in ownership of the authorisation-holder at an exploration phase or in a later development production phase requires the consent of the Minister.  The obligations entered into by the initial party must be transferred in that process.  On the question about the knowledge gap, the core aim of the EPA research is to identify the extent of that gap and to address it.  I will leave that matter to be dealt with in the next presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101000007#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1349860200,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in to elaborate on the issue of consent for any transfer.

I hope my statement will assist the committee.  As members are aware, the Environmental Protection Agency is an independent statutory body, established in 1993 under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  We have a wide range of responsibilities in the environmental field.  Today, we are discussing hydraulic fracturing.<\/p><p>  The main role of the EPA with regard to projects involving hydraulic fracturing, or fracking as it is commonly termed, is its regulatory role through the IPPC licensing process as set out in the EPA Act, whereby an IPPC licence is required for onshore extraction of shale gas on a commercial scale.  The EPA does not have a regulatory role at the exploration stage of these projects, but will be a statutory consultee with respect to any environmental impact assessment conducted by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, as indicated earlier.  The Environmental Protection Agency is also involved in research into the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing.<\/p><p>  The EPA has a number of roles.  First I will discuss our research role.  The EPA is responsible for the development, co-ordination and management of environmental research in Ireland and has provided funding for environmental research since 1994.  The current research programme STRIVE has been running since 2007 and is focused on major environmental challenges and the provision of policy relevant analysis and research.  The study Hydraulic Fracturing or 'Fracking': A Short Summary of Current Knowledge and Potential Environmental Impacts was published by the EPA in May 2012.  This short desk study was conducted for the agency by the University of Aberdeen.  It provides an introduction to the environmental aspects of fracking including a review of regulatory approaches used in other countries and areas for further investigation and research.  In brief, some of the key findings of the study included the importance of well integrity for preventing groundwater contamination; the importance of knowledge of local geology regarding potential impacts on groundwater quality and the possibility of tremors; and the uncertainty regarding the carbon footprint of shale gas in comparison to conventional natural gas.  This is an important climate change issue.  There are a small number of published, peer reviewed, scientific studies in the area.  This study also examined regulatory approaches in Europe, North America and elsewhere and identified areas where further research is required to determine best practice.<\/p><p>  The information provided by this preliminary research project will now be used to inform a more comprehensive study to be commissioned by the EPA, in co-operation with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This project will be administered by the STRIVE programme, and steered by a committee with representatives from  the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resoaurces, Environment, Community and Local Government, the Commission for Energy Regulation, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.  The EPA expects to commission this study in 2012.  The scope of the research, while not finalised, is expected to address, among others, the areas of environmental best practice; identification of potential environmental impacts, local and global, and associated mitigation measures; baseline studies to characterise the existing local environment; and an examination of regulatory frameworks in the Republic, Northern Ireland, and the EU.  The study will take account of existing international research in the field, and a public consultation process is also planned.  While elements of the research will relate to specific regions where options have been granted from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, it is the intention that the study will generally be applicable to the island of Ireland.<\/p><p>  With regard to international research on hydraulic fracturing, there is currently much research underway, particularly in the EU and US, on the environmental and human health aspects and impacts of fossil fuel activities involving fracking.  As recently as September 2012 the EU Commission has published two studies in this area, on climate impact and the environment and human health.  The EU Commission has also recently invited tenders for research aimed at supporting possible Commission initiatives on managing impacts and risks arising from unconventional gas developments, and assisting the Commission in developing best regulatory practices.  In the US, the US EPA is currently conducting research on the potential impact of these projects on drinking water resources.  This research is expected to be completed in 2014, and an interim report is expected in late 2012.  The Environmental Protection Agency will be keeping abreast of all such research with a view to being in the best possible position to perform its statutory duties.<\/p><p>  The primary role of the EPA with regard to fracking is our licensing role.  Any proposed project involving the commercial scale extraction of shale gas would therefore need to apply to the EPA for, and be granted, an IPPC licence in order to operate.  Any licence issued for such an activity would also regulate the environmental aspects of any hydraulic fracturing operations taking place as part of the extraction activity.  The IPPC licences aim to prevent or reduce emissions to air, water and land, reduce waste generation and use energy and resources efficiently.  Applicants are required to demonstrate that they meet the criteria set out in the legislation to be considered as \"fit and proper\" persons to hold such a licence.  They must also make adequate provision for closure and environmental liabilities.<\/p><p>  The IPPC licence is a single integrated licence which covers all emissions from the facility and its environmental management.  All related operations that the licence holder carries out in connection with the activity are controlled by this licence.  In order to grant a licence, the EPA must be satisfied that emissions from the activity do not cause a significant environmental impact.  Any application to the EPA must demonstrate the use of best environmental practice in order to minimise environmental impact.  Applicants are also required to demonstrate that the proposed activity would not cause any breaches of national legislation or European directives.  For example, with regard to protection of groundwater, an applicant would be required to show that no breaches of the EU Water Framework Directive or national water quality standards would occur.<\/p><p>  No applications for IPPC licences for commercial extraction of shale gas have been received by the agency to date. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101000009#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Burke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349862000,"counter":664,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Burke sincerely.

Is there enough geological evidence to indicate that this country's geological composition could be different from that of other countries?  Has the EPA received any indication of that?  What sort of criteria will the EPA use when it compiles its report?  Ms Burke mentioned various issues.  It seems to me, from the little I know about this matter, that different procedures are used in different countries.  Most of the information is coming out of America.  For example, chemicals are currently being used.  Tamboran, which is the leading company in this area, has repeatedly said it will not use chemicals but will use water only.  The area where it is proposed to extract shale gas has a high water content in terms of lakes and rivers.  That is unlike the American experience of locations like deserts that have a totally different topography.  Will the EPA take that into account when it is setting the criteria?  What will it be looking for?  What can we expect to get at the end of this report?  Ms Burke indicated that the EPA is tracking what is happening in other countries.  She referred to the American report.  It seems that the actual procedures continue to be the subject of a great deal of controversy.

I am still unclear.  Does an exploratory licence permit hydraulic fracturing in north Leitrim?  I received an answer to that question, but I did not understand it.  It is not clear to me.  This document points out that people have the right to make a submission.  We are talking about the potential for environmental impacts such as the poisoning of groundwater.  Nothing in the document relates to the impact that this development would have on the people who live in north Leitrim.<\/p> <p>From reading about experiences in other jurisdictions where hydraulic fracturing is practised, I have learned that nobody listened to the concerns raised elsewhere.  In Ireland the concerns about fracking are not confined to the possible poisoning of groundwater or potential damage to the agrifood and tourism industries.  People are concerned that a beautiful agricultural area with drumlin hills, lakes, rivers, mountains and valleys - I again suggest members visit north County Leitrim - will be turned into an industrial wasteland.  Fracking will impact on local people.  Prior to my election to the D&aacute;il last year, I was a county councillor in County Leitrim where applications to build houses with a septic tank were rejected on the basis that a family home would be intrusive on the landscape.  This is the same area where consideration is being given to allowing the construction of seven acre concrete pads.  I cannot understand why we are even considering allowing exploratory hydraulic fracturing in this area.  Will someone explain the reason, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101000010#M01000","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349862600,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I will make some comments rather than pose questions.  The main concern about fracking relates to the possibility of groundwater being contaminated.  Given our heavy dependence on groundwater, like Deputy Michael Colreavy, I wonder why the possibility of permitting hydraulic fracturing is even being considered.  The evidence from other countries suggests different jurisdictions take different approaches.  The United Kingdom appears to have an open mind on the process; France has closed down the process, while Germany and Poland are exploring the possibility of allowing fracking.  The intelligence, as it were, from North America and Australia suggests the approach taken in these countries is different.  Unlike Australia and the United States, however, Ireland's centres of population are close together and our dependency on groundwater is great.  Fracking is much easier to carry out in the middle of Australia where the nearest centre of population may be five hours away by air than it would be in Ireland.  Given that the process is in its infancy, we should consider permitting it and await information on the practice in other countries before allowing fracking to commence here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101000011#N00200","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speech","time":1349862600,"counter":675,"content":"<p>My questions are similar to those I asked the previous delegation.

This is a prime driver of the research.  The role of the Environmental Protection Agency is to protect the environment and science is at the core of all our activities.  I hope I was clear in my statement in noting that we did not have information available to us to make a decision on whether this technology could be operated without harming human health or the environment.  This is the key purpose of the research, which is taking place at international and European level.  A key part of the research we will carry out in conjunction with the other relevant bodies is to examine baseline studies to characterise the existing local environment in Ireland, in other words, to address the issue of local geology and other local issues.  We do not want to duplicate research being carried out at European level or in other countries and will instead localise our research in order that we have data on which to make a decision.<\/p><p>  The Deputies are correct that compliance with the water framework directive is a key criterion in respect of any of these activities.  We cannot permit any activity to undermine Ireland's compliance with European Union obligations to have good water quality.  Water is also a significant resource for the country and we cannot undermine it.  The research is to obtain a large amount of baseline information on Irish circumstances. <\/p><p>  With regard to the impact of the development in north County Leitrim, as I stated, the Environmental Protection Agency is not the only body progressing the relevant research.  We have arranged that the steering committee has representatives of the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Commission for Energy Regulation, which will also have responsibility for regulation in this area, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Geological Survey of Ireland and the environment agency in Northern Ireland.  All the regulators that would at some stage in the future have a role in regulating the activity in question are included in the steering committee in order that any issue raised, including by the relevant bodies in question, may be addressed.  The purpose of the steering committee is to try to pull together all of the bodies which have a role in the context of the research required.<\/p><p>  The report of the European Parliament will feed into the research we are conducting.  We are very conscious of the findings of this and other reports.  It is important to note in the context of the report that it found that thresholds of environmental impact assessment needed to be examined.  In the Irish case, environmental impact assessment would be carried out for the exploratory phase.  This has been stated by officials from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  With regard to the regulatory framework, Ireland is slightly different from elsewhere in that under the Environmental Protection Agency Act and the integrated pollution prevention and control, IPCC, licensing regime, shale gas exploration is specifically included as an operation that would require a licence.  That is not the case in other EU member states.<\/p><p>  With regard to links with other environmental agencies, as I indicated, the Environmental Protection Agency is represented on the EU technical working group on shale gas.  In addition, members of EPA senior management and I are part of a network of environmental protection agencies throughout Europe in which fracking is being discussed as a key upcoming issue.

I will also address the risk of groundwater contamination, which I know has been discussed previously but some of the slides might give a better view of the problem.  I will also discuss the impacts on health, the promise of jobs and the social impacts of this boom and bust industry.<\/p><p>  Onshore shale gas extraction is not the same as a North Sea oil or gas rig.  In conventional shale gas extraction there is a reservoir of gases underneath and a few wells can extract vast volumes of gas.  In the Corrib gas field five wells can extract 1 trillion cu. ft.  In unconventional gas extraction the target area is deeper, the gas must be released by high-volume hydraulic fracturing and thousands of wells may be needed to extract the same volume of gas.  In the north west, the proposal is to take over 156 sq. m., industrialise it, build 120 pads and drill 3,000 wells.  The scale of this project cannot be compared with a conventional proposal.<\/p><p>  This slide shows a picture of what would come to Ireland.  I am not speaking only about north Leitrim; I am also speaking about Fermanagh, Clare and other places where proposals may be made for shale gas extraction.  The pads shown are seven acres each and it is proposed to place one in every square mile throughout the target area.  A total of 24 wells are to be drilled from each pad, which is 3,000 in total.  This is the Tamboran proposal for north Leitrim and Fermanagh.  We do not know what proposal will be made for Clare.<\/p><p>  The picture shows a pad in British Columbia.  Soon after the picture was published a report showed that more than 40 seismic events were recorded where none had been recorded prior to 2009.  We know earthquakes were caused by the first two wells drilled in the UK.  The target area in Ireland has many geological faults so there is a high risk of the same thing happening.<\/p><p>  I am not speaking about the exploratory stage; I am speaking about what would happen if the proposal reached the production stage.  I see this as being like a juggernaut.  If it reaches the exploratory stage and the results are good this slide shows what we can look forward to in rural areas of Ireland and, if the area is good, it will creep towards centres of population.  This slide shows Dish in Texas.  If one logs on to Google Earth and keys in Dimock in Pennsylvania or Alberta in Canada one will see the same thing.  These places are not populated, but there are people the length and breadth of Ireland and the countryside is dotted with little villages and communities which have existed for generations.<\/p><p>  This slide shows a map of north-west Ireland indicating where the proposal would be situated.  The red circle is the first phase proposed by Tamboran where 3,000 wells are to be drilled.  The blue circle shows where the company could go afterwards because the shale there is more than 700 metres thick.  The company could go down around Lough Allen into the Shannon River area.  Where the company is now is in the Shannon catchment area, which is also linked to the Erne catchment.  Whatever is done in Fermanagh will affect the South.  Similar areas are found in clear extending through Limerick into north Kerry and Cork.  Many other counties need to be aware of this proposal.<\/p><p>  This slide shows a bird's eye view of what the area proposed for fracking would look like with the pads.  I will now show committee members some animations which will make a twinkly effect.  The slide gives an idea of the density of the pads.  It does not show the access roads, gas pipelines or huge machinery involved.  It would have huge consequences for the land.  These are areas of high visual amenity, vast underground water and cave systems and blanket bogs.  There is no room in the proposal for the farms which exist.  They may survive for a while but they will have contamination problems.  If there is a rumour of contamination entering the food chain it could have a disastrous consequence for agriculture throughout Ireland and not only in this part of the country.<\/p><p>  This is a diagram of under the ground.  The lower line shows the depth of the Barnett Shale in the US.  It is very deep and goes from 1,500 metres to 3,000 metres, which is one to two miles below the ground.  Whatever happens at this distance is very far away from the surface of the water.  The vertical lines show the depth of the fractures caused by hydraulic fracturing.  They can be 580 metres long and at this depth one might suggest they do not do any harm.  This slide shows the groundwater depth, which we know can go down to 150 metres below the ground and this shows where it is proposed to frack in Ireland.  The shale is much shallower and goes from 500 metres to 1,250 metres.  The same type and length of fracture will cause a high risk of contamination of the aquifers.<\/p><p>  Any geologist will cringe at this slide, which shows a very simplified view of the various layers in the area we are discussing.  We have shallow aquifers towards the top, layers of rock, and the shale target area, which is between 500 metres and 1,250 metres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101000013#P00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aed&iacute;n McLoughlin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349865000,"counter":704,"content":"<p>That is a comprehensive overview.

How would the witnesses respond to what they have heard?<\/p><p>  Are the witnesses indicating they will not accept hydraulic fracturing under any circumstances with regard to current technology?  Is it seen as being absolutely damaging to the environment, as it was made quite clear in the presentation's conclusion that high-volume fracking should be prohibited?  Has the research provided any indication from across the world that there will be improvements in technology or we could arrive at a position where shale gas could be extracted without the use of horrendous infrastructure?  It appears to be like a lunar landscape.<\/p><p>  In the Irish context, are the witnesses encouraged by the fact it is perfectly clear that the geology of Ireland is totally different to that of the other relevant countries?  That may be encouraging, as there is a high volume of water, including lakes and rivers, in the area where drilling is proposed; the chances are that the Government may decide it is not worth the candle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101000015#R00500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1349865000,"counter":708,"content":"<p>Listening to the events of this morning's meeting, I am not as comforted by the proceedings as Senator Mooney.

I may play the devil's advocate but the views of communities should be uppermost in any decision taken.  On the one hand the witnesses have given very definitive facts; if people had not heard of fracking until the presentation this morning, the immediate influence would be that we should not touch it.  Nevertheless, it was indicated that it is too early to decide on this because the technology is only several years old and we are unsure of the effects.  Is there a slight contradiction in the definitive facts given with regard to health issues and on the other hand the contention that it is too early to know long-term effects?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101000015#R00900","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1349865000,"counter":712,"content":"<p>I thank the delegation for the excellent presentation.

The witnesses have answered many of the questions I had.  I suggest that people take up the invite to consider the case of Dimock, Pennsylvania, and view it with Google Earth, which I am doing now.  Some people may say water could be poisoned and the issue can be debated.  Nevertheless, it cannot be debated that I am looking at an horrific and ugly landscape, and if a similar process goes ahead in Ireland, there will be no tourism in that part of Leitrim.  It is a fact.  I would not bring my kids on holidays to look at lumps of concrete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101000015#R01000","speaker":"1084","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349865600,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I will first deal with Senator Mooney's question about whether I was encouraged by the Department and the EPA.  I would not say I was encouraged.  What I heard was what I expected, because we know that this is what is happening.  There is a grey area emerging where the company is talking about one kind of timeline and the officials are talking about another.  That is made even more complicated by the fact that it is over the Border as well, which is contiguous with ourselves.<\/p><p>  With regard to not allowing anything to go forward, I am not sure that the licences will be rendered void by this.  I can only assume that an extension will be required.  We need more attention to be paid to policy in the entire area and to look at not only the technical aspects of it but also the human aspects.<\/p><p>  When talking about hydraulic fracturing I specifically said that high volume hydraulic fracturing should be prohibited.  The reason is that all the evidence coming from where this is taking place shows that it is not a safe technology.  Personally, and not speaking on behalf of the campaign, I think that if there is a new technology that might examine the production of gas in a completely different way, perhaps for the good of the community and not to have it produced suddenly with huge industry and probably just going into the international store of gas rather than have it used by the people, we could be talking about a completely different scenario.  That is why high volume hydraulic fracturing should be prohibited, but not the research into what could be the future development of gas production.  There is no doubt we all need and use gas and know its benefits.<\/p><p>  Being optimistic, I believe that the geology is different in Ireland and, as a result, it might well be found it is not worth it.  I agree with the Senator in that regard.<\/p><p>  Deputy Colreavy spoke about the community.  There is an extraordinary situation in the local area wherever this fracking is proposed, that is, Clare, Leitrim and Fermanagh.  The people on the ground are really united behind a call to stop this process and many of them are talking about banning fracking.  The reason is that people are very afraid of what might happen to their land, communities and health.  To refer back to the slide on health, somebody said that if we do not know what the long-term effects are, perhaps that was a contradiction of what I said.  In fact, the short-term effects of what was in that slide are effects on people.  This is happening now.  People are going to the doctors and the hospitals with all of these illnesses.  We know the long-term effects of the chemicals but if one looks at the communities, it takes more than seven years for certain diseases to appear.  We are now beginning to see the cancers emerging and the other longer-term effects on human health.  We do not know the extent of those but we know how the beginning looks.<\/p><p>  Another question was about if there were guarantees that the technology was okay.  Unfortunately, at present there are more disasters than technology advances in this field.  There is a great deal going on but given the technology as it is now, the proposal that is made is unacceptable in our view.  I will ask Eddie Mitchell to add his comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101000016#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aed&iacute;n McLoughlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349865600,"counter":715,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Mahony spoke about future technology and asked whether we would accept this under any conditions.  We would accept an industry if we could see a life cycle analysis of the industry.  We will not see that with fracking.  I am referring to future developments.  The people in Leitrim and Fermanagh are pro-development.  This is not an anti-development or anti-Government campaign.  We are interested in farming, tourism and clean manufacturing, and we want our areas to develop in that way.  If a policy was developed for an industry, we would like to get a strategic environmental assessment, health impact assessments and debates on the policy.  We would like people to educate themselves about that and then to make decisions based on knowledge.  That is the type of scenario in which we would like to see development progress.  We do not wish to have it pushed in.<\/p><p>  We are very concerned about the situation in Corrib and the way the community was dealt with there.  That community does not feel it was dealt with properly and it is still in the same position as it was 12 years ago.  We are facing a much bigger project on land in north Leitrim, Cavan and Fermanagh and eventually developing across to Monaghan if we follow the shale.  In order to cater for our demand for energy we would have to exploit the shale.  If we start to depend on unconventional gas as part of our energy mix, we will exploit the shale that is there.  This will mean that over the next 30 years production will be moving across the Border counties towards Fermanagh.  Therefore, we want to ensure that anything of that nature is debated in public and that people understand.<\/p><p>  This will destroy agriculture in those areas.  It will also do damage to our agriculture at international level.  Given that we have a small population of 6.5 million people on the island of Ireland, we must consider whether the solutions people are looking to in countries such as Britain, Germany and America are suitable for Ireland.  I do not believe they are.  We depend on our green, clean image, so we should be very cautious.  That is the reason we have been calling for a ban and for shale gas to be prohibited in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012101000016#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Mitchell"},{"type":"speech","time":1349865600,"counter":716,"content":"<p>In light of the responses, do the witnesses think that is feasible, bearing in mind their own recommendations?
