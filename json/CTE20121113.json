I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister but I did not get much joy.  I believe this issue should be discussed.<\/p><p>  At this time of the year everybody comes in with the shopping list.  At this stage it is normally way too late but I suggest the committee should look at the issue of the tax ramifications of land consolidation.  This is a very important issue for dairy farmers.  We need to develop a policy, and argue it out well in advance of a budget.  I can guarantee that little will be added to what is already in the budget.  As a committee we should set out early next year to consider our policies on these proposals and examine all the implications in order to ensure that barriers to the development of farming, such as land consolidation and the tax regime and so on are looked at.  We should not wait until the last minute when it is too late to influence Government.<\/p><p>  The delegation from the ICMSA obviously did not read the expenditure report issued by the Government last year, in which it was stated there would be a 6% cut in agriculture next year.  I see from the ICMSA shopping list that more money and not less is required.  It is a very handy ploy because no matter what happens, it is on a winner.  We too can play the same game when talking to the Minister, but one does not influence the game that way.  I think the 6% cut is probably disproportionate, I recognise there will be a cut, as there is less money.  The first thing to do is to try to make as many savings as we can from administration.  We can try to handle the money a bit better and ensure there is no carry forward of unspent cash, which disappears into the ether leaving just a liability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111300005#E00300","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352817300,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives of the ICMSA.  We have held a number of briefings with them and what is most important is to get the budget in place, which I hope will be done by the end of the year.  Listening to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v it sounds like we will have a hell of a battle distributing it when it comes to it.  How many farmers receive more than &euro;150,000 for &euro;250,000?  I do not have the figures with me but the average payment is much lower.  I agree with the Minister on keeping farming in Ireland and using a percentage taken off the top to increase payments to farmers on the bottom of the scale in the west of Ireland as it would mean a great deal to them.  Perhaps if it was increased a little it would suit smaller farmers better, but I support the Minister on his view and he has support throughout Europe on the issue.  We will examine the figures to see how many farmers are in the large payment bracket but I do not believe too many farmers receive payments of more than &euro;150,000 or &euro;250,000.<\/p><p>  It is very important to support active farmers.  We should get a definition of the \"armchair farmer\".  Young farmers will be looked after in the proposals and we welcome this as it is very important.  Perhaps those farmers who are not so young and have been farming and working hard on the land trying to earn an income since 2002 but have not received a single farm payment should be looked after as well as young farmers.  They should receive a single farm payment.<\/p><p>  We must sort out the problem in the commonages.  We spoke about this earlier and we will have a meeting on it.  If the commonages are not sorted out many farmers will be penalised for the sins of their neighbours.  It will create a hell of a battle in hill areas.  One group of farmers will want to work the commonages while another group will just put sheep on them and not care about anybody.  This will create war on the commonages and something must be done.  It must be sorted out.  Farmers cannot be penalised for another farmer taking the law into his or her own hands and over-grazing on commonages.<\/p><p>  An environmental scheme is very important and we should have something better than AEOS to replace REPS.  Perhaps it will not be as good as REPS, but a good scheme should be put in place to help farmers who look after the environment.  Suckler cow and sheep schemes are funded under pillar 2, as is the disadvantaged areas scheme.  We will all work to try to achieve these.<\/p><p>  The points made about solicitors working for families was quite right.  Introducing a bus load of solicitors does nothing for transferring farm assets.  One solicitor is quite adequate, once what needs to be done is laid down quite clearly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111300007#G00200","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1352817300,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives from the ICMSA whom we met last week to discuss the same matter.

Approximately 500 farmers in the country receive a single farm payment of more than &euro;100,000.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated we would create a group of armchair farmers.

I have covered much of this area in my introduction, in which I recognised that there would be anomalies.  However, 85% to 87% of those who were active in the historical years are still active.  Some 1,640 people are in receipt of more than &euro;50,000 per annum and only a few hundred receive more than &euro;100,000.  That number is insignificant compared with the overall package.  It looks wrong and the aesthetics are not great, but there are 110,000 farmers.<\/p><p>  I was asked about payments.  Across the 27 member states, the average single farm payment is &euro;4,000.  In Ireland, it is &euro;9,000.  Proportionate approximation was applied at member state level because the Germans, French, Austrians and others did not want to shift the budgets too dramatically.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's suggestion of giving people a lift of &euro;30 on the first ten or 15 hectares sounds lovely, but the reality is that most of those involved might not be full-time farmers and might have sizeable off-farm incomes.  For example, they could be garda&iacute;, teachers, solicitors, doctors, etc.  The money will go to them.<\/p><p>  Our organisation is trying to protect the one constant, that is, the family farm unit, a labour unit that produces enough to make a living with the incorporation of the single farm payment.  It is as simple as that.  The amount involved usually hovers between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000, depending on one's borrowings.  I hate characterising farmers, but someone who has 1,000 acres of hill and 50 sheep could theoretically be called active.  However, he or she has plenty of time to generate other income.  Such farmers are not solely dependent on farming and have developed other ways to live.  I do not want to segregate farmers, but giving &euro;30 on the first ten hectares would be disastrous.  It would create more anomalies than it would solve.<\/p><p>  Senior departmental officials have crunched the numbers.  We support the position taken by the Department to lessen the impact of the change in funding.  A gradual convergence is fine.  By 2020, the vista across food production in Europe will be different than it is now and there will be many plans to shift the emphasis back onto coupled payments.<\/p><p>  Senator Comiskey mentioned young farmers.  We support his comments.  The issue of commonages must be sorted.  The notion of collective responsibility is lunacy.  I do not know how anyone could have come up with it outside of a communist society.  If four farmers who have sheep on a hill are dependent on one another, it is a recipe for disaster and must be rectified.  A commonsensical approach must be taken.<\/p><p>  The rural environment protection scheme, REPS, was also mentioned.  A whole-farm approach is the best in that regard.  Under the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, each item of expenditure is receipted and only parts of a farm are involved.  To be successful, a scheme must take a whole-farm basis.<\/p><p>  The suckler cow scheme has been prioritised and is funded from the Exchequer, but we are not in favour of coupling payments in the next CAP budget.  There is no justification for recoupling those moneys.  With one hand a linear cut of 5%, 10% or so on would be applied to everyone and, with the other, it would be given back again, only with terms and condition attached, including the requirement to keep the cow.  Beef prices are high because of the law of supply and demand.  Numbers have decreased and prices have increased.  If payments are coupled, farmers will need to keep their animals, which will lead to a decrease in prices.  Recoupling in respect of a small percentage now would be detrimental for farmers.  The situation might be different if everything was recoupled, but our organisation is against recoupling just 5% or 10%.<\/p><p>  Senator Comiskey referred to land conveyancing.  We have serious issues in this regard, but they are not specific to farmers.  Every citizen is affected, as all property transfers are involved.  The only element that is excluded is the physical transaction of cash.  One will even be required to have two solicitors to conduct the transfer of a share in a council house.  Heretofore, it was always advisable to have a second solicitor, but that is different from being required to set up a new account with a second solicitor and duplicating the searches.  What sticks in my craw is the fact that the Law Society implemented this statutory instrument and its members are getting the business.  I want to make the Houses aware that this expensive and impractical approach will not solve the problem.<\/p><p>  I believe I have covered everything, but members might remind me if I have left anything out.

It is anticipated there will be a significant increase in 2015, probably never to be matched, of in the region of 15% or 20%.  I know having attended branch AGMs last year and this year that the train of thought in this regard differs.  The climatic conditions that prevailed during 2012 have brought a sense of realism to farmers.  We are encouraging individual farmers to get to grips in terms of expansion costs because, contrary to what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said earlier, a farmer on wet soil who meets difficult times as regards price volatility and a challenging climatic year and who has increased stocking density and milk output could find himself or herself doing more and creating a bigger hole.  We are advising our members of the need to consider costs and capabilities because in 2011 the cost of production varied between 14 and 25 cents a litre, depending on efficiencies and soil types of the individual farmer.  It is paramount that they know where they stand before they step forward because they need to be in a position of profitability in order to expand at a sustainable rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111300009#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McCormack"},{"type":"speech","time":1352818500,"counter":23,"content":"<p>We all know that the test farm is in Kilkenny.  Prices in 2009, at the time the test in terms of trying to prove milk could be produced at a certain level was applied, were really depressed.  Thankfully, market prices have increased since then.  While it was hoped the result would set an example and that the land used was good, I do not believe the test, in terms of what was hoped would be achieved in relation to the cost of production, was realistic.  I note Mr. McCormack's statement that the organisation is urging caution on the part of its members post-2015.  However, that scenario must be set against what Mr. Comer had to say in regard to the suckler cow welfare scheme, the cost of which is currently met by the Exchequer.  <\/p><p>  As I stated earlier, I believe part of Pillar 2 should be a couple of payments to support the suckler cow payments.  I am not suggesting that every situation will be black and white post-2012 because it is not possible to milk cows on all lands because of some of them are not suitable or large enough to support milk production.  My concern is that land close to that of an intensive or active dairy farmer, which becomes available for lease, sale or rent for 11 months will be designated as suitable only for milk production, resulting in tillage, suckler cow, beef, sheep or pig farmers not being able to rent that land.  I have previously stated in public and to the Minister that I believe that some of the money obtained during the next CAP negotiations should be used to support other parts of agriculture besides dairy farming.  It should be used to support the suckler cow or sheep scheme and so on.  I am not suggesting that the dairy sector should not get support.  Currently, our herds are 50% dairy and 50% beef.  During the past six to eight years we have built up, through quality assurance, traceability and so on a reputation worldwide in relation to our beef.   We are second to none in terms of quality of production and traceability in respect of products exported from Ireland.  I would hate if post-2015 the 50:50 ratio would be changed to 60:40, 65:35 or 70:30, which would make it unviable for even meat factories to continue here.  I know that, unless everything is set before inception, beef will be produced from the dairy herd.  However, that will not do anything for us in terms of sale to the market.  Previously, beef from our dairy herds was exported to Third World countries such as Lybia, Egypt and Russia.  The consumers with the most money are those in Europe, including France, Italy, Spain and Germany.  They want quality.  Since the introduction over three years ago of traceability and so on there has been a significant increase in the price of product, which may be down to scarcity.  We do not want countries such as Argentina or Brazil, which do not provide assurance in terms of quality, meeting beef needs in Europe.  We must be in a position to support the needs of Europe.   <\/p><p>  It was stated earlier that support for the suckler cow scheme should be discontinued.

Are the witnesses opposed, in principle, to any cap in the amount of payment that any individual can get?  If they are, that is fine, but if they are not, perhaps they could indicate a suitable cap?  There have been suggestions from Commissioner Ciolo\u015f and the European Parliament, which basically stipulates that there can be a payment of between &euro;200 and &euro;300 per hectare.  That is a dramatic cap.  The Minister also has a proposal.  An interesting mind game concerns where we are likely to end up and how likely it is that the Minister's proposal will get through the European Parliament.  I am not sure it will.<\/p><p>  An issue could arise if we do not get the answer we want but rather an indication that no payment will be less than &euro;200 per hectare.  There are not many hill farmers with 1,000 acres but they would make a huge gain because there would be no cap.  By having a cap, one would avoid an unintended consequence arising because the advocacy groups do not control the negotiations; there are 27 countries involved in the process.  I notice there is much concentration among member governments but the European Parliament is in the game.  It is interesting to note what its rapporteur put forward, which is, if I may term it, Ciolo\u015f mark 2, plus or minus 20%.  When all these people get together and start compromising, things happen that may not be expected.  I am interested to hear the views on such a cap.<\/p><p>  People often raise the question of whether farmers work full time.  We know the vast majority of farmers do not work full time, although dairy farmers are the exceptions.  They are not necessarily the people with the biggest single payment, as it is not the way the payment is made.  For example, people in the beef industry did relatively well in single payments; if they were well organised they would get the first and second tranches, as well as the slaughter premium in reference years.  The idea that the highly paid farmers - either taken on a per hectare basis or in total - are dairy farmers is a nonsense.  I do not know how many dairy farmers are in the country, although the witnesses probably know this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111300010#K00300","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352819100,"counter":34,"content":"<p>There are 18,000 farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111300010#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Comer"},{"type":"speech","time":1352819100,"counter":35,"content":"<p>There are 120,000 registered herd owners.  It is interesting that 90% of these get a payment of less than &euro;25,000, and there must be many dairy farmers in the group.  Considering the amount paid per hectare, the majority seem to be under the famous &euro;274.  If we cap the really big operators, who do not need the single payment if they are making any money from farming, we would hit what is termed the \"armchair farmers\".  Capping the amount per hectare means that every farmer - including every dairy farmer except any near the 2,000 top payees - would gain.  If we assumed there are 400 or 500 dairy farmers in the top group, the other 17,500 dairy farmers would gain &euro;600 if they had 20 hectares, which most dairy farmers would have at least.  It may happen, by chance, that money may end up with a farmer on poor land, such as that in Senator Comiskey's area.  That would not come from the middle ranked farmer or the very prosperous farmer, instead it would come from the farmers who either stack entitlements or have a very large payment.<\/p><p>  It is interesting to consider farm size.  The more one digs into figures, the more we can see that some people are earning disproportionate amounts.  It is amazing that everybody accepted the capping principle with REPS and the disadvantaged area scheme.  If capping is good for one scheme, it should be good for the other.  If it is not, capping should not operate anywhere.  It is fair to say that the people who oppose capping the single payment would be the first to complain if there was no cap on the other two payments.  An entire farm must be farmed in an environmentally friendly way if the farmer is part of that scheme.<\/p><p>  Those with the smallest payments have the smallest farms.  On average, it is not true to say that those with poor land have much poor land; those with poor land have small payments and those with small payments have the smallest farms, with an average of 32.7 hectares.  If there are some enormous operators in this group, there must be many farmers under the average.  At payments between &euro;150 to &euro;250 per hectare, the average size farm is slightly bigger at 33 hectares.  At payments between &euro;250 and &euro;500 per hectare, the average farm size is 39 hectares.  For the farmer receiving between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000 per hectare, the average size is 44.9 hectares.  That gives the lie to the idea of the few farmers who own all the mountain.  Senator Comiskey could bear out that idea.  With most mountains, there could be 50 or 200 farmers who have to walk on 1,000 acres to get to their sheep.<\/p><p>  At the point where payments are greater than &euro;1,000 per hectare, there is a collapse in average farm size to 34 hectares.  Anybody in this case with &euro;1,000 or more per hectare would have stacked payments.  That is the only rational explanation, and these are the real armchair farmers.  They are getting money for half the farming.  I am interested to know if the witnesses are in favour of a cap on payments.  Are they in favour of a cap on the disadvantaged area scheme?  Are they in favour of cap on acreage and total payment for REPS?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111300010#K00500","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1352819700,"counter":36,"content":"<p>With regard to the points raised by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, the figures have been texted to me.

The only farmers I know forced to chase 1,000 acres for 50 sheep have been forcefully destocked by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They are not allowed to have 200 or 400 sheep and there is as much chasing in 50 ewes across the mountain in a commonage of 1,000 acres as there is in 400 ewes.  One must still gather them up and separate them from the neighbours' sheep.  The idea is that many hill farmers willingly and knowingly have low numbers of stock.<\/p><p>  The Minister should watch for the following point in his payment regime.  Europe is very ecologically minded at the moment and, because the sheep have been taken from farmers forcibly, many young farmers will not chase through the mountains for the sheep.  There will be an ecological disaster of land abandonment.  When that happens, Europe will fine Ireland severely in agriculture payments and ecological fines for not maintaining the mountains in good farming order.  In that circumstance, the lowland farmer could be paying the penalty for not making it viable for the hill farmer to get out on the hill and maintain the sheep.  If members think land abandonment is not a reality, they should go to Scotland.  It is a significant problem there because they are not allowed to keep the number of stock they believe make it viable to go up the hill.  The idea does not stand up.<\/p><p>  I never said the biggest farmers were the armchair farmers, I said the evidence appears to be that where the leasing of a farm with a big single payments is happening, it is not in the hill areas.  Mr. John Enright accepted the analysis.  The analysis after the derogation in the hill areas this year bears out my point.  It is happening in the lowlands.  There are a certain number of armchair farmers in the country and nothing will stop them.  It is not something connected to low payments; it is connected more to the intensive leasing that takes place in the land and letting of land in the 11 months system on more fertile parts of the country.  That is where the armchair farming exists but I do not know how to stop it.  We could examine the rules.  The idea that increasing the single farm payment to farmers on bad land would make them all armchair farmers is nonsense.<\/p><p>  To go back to the statistics, there are more than 2,000 farmers in receipt of more than &euro;50,000.  This represents approximately 2% of all farmers and they receive a payment that amounts to 12% of payments even though they have the best farms.  Like other schemes, I suggest these farmers are doing very well and we are talking about a seven year slide-off.  At the beginning of the debate, as agriculture spokesperson, I said this must be done on a slide-off basis because it cannot be handled like the farmers with REPS, where they were told overnight the payment would go.  I did not agree with what happened with REPS.  There should be a cap, which will help the other 90% of farmers.  I am amazed at the fight being put up for the 2% at the expense of the 90%.  Good on Senator O'Neill, he can explain it to the farmers and I will explain my side to farmers.  In all the counties in Ireland, the highest average single payment is in Kilkenny, at &euro;16,000.  If there is a standard deviation around the mean even in Kilkenny there must be few, if any, farmers receiving over &euro;50,000, it will show that some 90% of farmers will be under the ceiling to which I referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012111300011#L00800","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1352819700,"counter":44,"content":"<p>We will revert to the delegation.

I have asked further questions to elicit more information but basically if one wanted one could opt for a Ciolo\u015f mark 11 or a Minister's mark 11.  I do not believe the Minister's proposal is correct because it does not do enough to level it up towards those in the middle, the farmers the ICMSA should be concerned about, the ordinary dairy producer with between 40 to 100 cows, who are the backbone of the ICMSA and not the farmers with 800 to 900 cows.

I will talk briefly about the SME sector to provide some context.  Some 99.8% of businesses in Ireland are small and medium-sized enterprises.  Therefore, the sector is a cornerstone of the economy.  It is worth noting that more than half of SMEs - which employ 900,000 people - were established in the past ten years and are very new in terms of operating experience.  Employment is concentrated in the domestically focused sector, which we are aware has taken serious hit.  Some of the areas hit are distribution and retail, accommodation, food, tourism and construction, which is on the floor.  This is quite different from the typical SME profile across the European Union.<\/p><p>  The next slide deals with SME use of bank credit.  It is useful to highlight the difference between ourselves and our European peers.  Looking at how SMEs use bank credit in the form of term finance, we can see that Irish SMEs are about mid-table compared with other European countries.  When it comes to the use of overdraft facilities, however, we are top of the table.  It can be seen that there is a big reliance on overdraft facilities among Irish SMEs.  Six out of ten businesses say they have used overdraft facilities in the past six months, far more than in any other country.  Generally, Irish SMEs' use of bank credit is significantly higher than in other countries.<\/p><p>  Mr. Trethowan was fair in mentioning the issues that face banks in terms of improving their performance, and those that face SMEs.  The main challenge for SMEs is weak demand in the domestic sector.  People starting a business in 2007 would probably have based their business model on 25% growth in the economy between then and 2012.  Instead, the economy has shrunk by 25%.  That is a cataclysmic drop in domestic demand, which is bound to have a severe impact on SMEs that are primarily focused on activity in the domestic economy.  Few of them are exposed to export or external demand.<\/p><p>  Another problem is that many SMEs are under-capitalised and, as their primary problem is capital, they have had to drain either owner capital or other sources.  Banks are not primary suppliers of capital.  A further problem is that microenterprises face particular challenges.  Help is on the way in that respect and we will talk later about the establishment of the micro-finance fund.  These companies tend to be younger and smaller in profile and they find it harder to make a pitch in terms of meeting the requirements when presenting business plans to access credit.<\/p><p>  The big challenge for banks, on which they continue to work, is to ensure they have productive engagement with customers.  This means that customers with sustainable businesses need to approach the banks.  It is a myth that banks are not lending and it is a myth that if a business approaches a bank and is turned down, that is a blot on its copybook.  It is not, as will be verified by Mr. Trethowan.  Another challenge for the banks is to increase our understanding of growth sectors.  Many new sectors are emerging in the Irish economy in the software, life sciences and green technology areas and significant work is being done by banks to improve their skills and understanding in those sectors so they can lend to these businesses.<\/p><p>  A problem I referred to at the outset is that of rebalancing the debt-equity ratio and finding ways to get more capital into banks.  John Moran, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, spoke about this recently at a conference, referring to the need to find models to bring more equity into SMEs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300003#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352814000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>We have been trying to supplement what the banks are doing at the coalface in terms of lending.  We have tried to ascertain whether there are information or resource gaps, identified by ourselves, the Credit Review Office or other stakeholders, which can be addressed.  In that regard we worked with Chambers Ireland and developed a new website, <i><i>www.smallbusinessfinance.ie<\/i><\/i>, which has already had 26,000 page reviews.  It is increasingly seen as a one-stop shop for information for all small developing businesses, not just about getting finance but also about all the other supports that are available.  It has been fully endorsed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Finance.  Most recently, the new Microfinance Ireland initiative has adopted and promoted it throughout the network of county enterprise boards.  Small businesses are being directed to our website for further information.<\/p><p>  We have worked with accountants to develop a business plan guide.  One issue we encountered and which was flagged by the Credit Review Office and others was that businesses had difficulties with the variations in documentary requirements of different banks.  When they went to one bank seeking credit, they were asked for certain things to be included in their business plan, while another lender would tweak this.  We worked with all of the banks and with accountants to come up with a blueprint for a standard business plan for SMEs applying for credit to any lending institution.  We have developed that guidance which is now being used throughout the country by accountants, in conjunction with small business clients.<\/p><p>  We also worked with the Credit Review Office to develop a standard credit application form.  Again, in the past there were slight differences between one institution and another.  This was very much an initiative of the Credit Review Office but we sought to fine tune that and to drive it out, not just to the pillar banks but also to other lenders in the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Felix O'Regan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352814600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>To summarise, we are working with small and medium-sized enterprise customers to get them the credit they need.  We are approving more than 2,000 applications for credit each week.  The member banks and ourselves are working with customers to give them the best chance of accessing finance.  Where we see deficiencies and where issues are pointed out to us, we work with all best intent to try to close out those issues or to improve the situation.  It is not all about new lending.  Renewing or renegotiating credit and working capital finance are what many businesses need.  Banks are working to meet that need.  Getting finance to businesses depends on addressing a range of issues.  It is not only about bank debt.  Access to capital and equity, the experience of the business owners and their ability to manage the business in question are also relevant.<\/p><p>  It is critical to have a positive environment for credit availability because that will help to drive demand and support growth and job creation.  If we continue to maintain that banks are not open for business or not extending credit, it will become a self-fulfilling prophesy.  It will become the reality.  Our job and that of the Credit Review Office is to ensure we get the message out loud and clear to business operators that if they have a sustainable business and they approach their bank, they will get access to credit.  If business operators are aggrieved about a decision, they have the backstop of the Credit Review Office which will independently assess an application and determine whether the decision should be upheld or refused.  I thank the committee for its time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1352814600,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank both organisations for coming in today and for their ongoing help in our day-to-day existence.  Having said that, the presentations are altogether at variance with what we are dealing with.  In page 2 of his presentation outlining his observations of the banking market, Mr. Trethowan stated that the centralisation of credit decision making taking place, coupled with the reduction of many rural branches and the continuing churning of front-end staff, has led to many SMEs feeling isolated and remote from the banks.  That is a rather diplomatic way of putting it.  I have questions for both organisations and I will turn over and back.<\/p><p>  Mr. Trethowan also stated in the two previous reports that he has encouraged banks to do more to support enterprise-type lending.  His view is that a low-risk appetite and overly tight lending policies have gone too far to ensure that new lending and future loans do not cause a repeat of the recent past.  He also stated that excessive prudence may risk banks not fully supporting an economic upturn when SMEs require access to more working capital to invest.  Will Mr. Trethowan expand on that, please?  Will Mr. Farrell respond to those two comments from the Credit Review Office?<\/p><p>  The survey referred to the level of credit for SMEs as 37%.  However, the Central Bank published Irish SME credit supply and demand: a comparison across surveys and countries.  This was a presentation of research by Sarah Holton and Fergal McCann.  It stated that Ireland has the second highest rate of discouraged borrowers in the eurozone.  These are defined as firms that do not apply for a loan despite requiring credit.  We all know that.  We know people are not submitting applications and that they are advised by the relationship manager in their bank not to bother because it will not happen.  What measurement does the Credit Review Office have of that?  Is there any system in the Credit Review Office to review what the Central Bank says about discouraged borrowers?  Will Mr. Farrell and Mr. O'Regan comment on that finding?  Where in the system are we tracking these customers and their need for credit?  It appears they are not coming into the system.<\/p><p>  Mr. Trethowan remarked that some sanctioned term loans take some time to be drawn down.  Will he outline some more of his knowledge in this regard?  Part of the reason they take some time to be drawn down is the fact that more hurdles than in the Grand National are put in front of businesses before they can complete a loan or complete a revision of a loan.  I know of cases lasting seven, eight or nine months from the time a loan was initiated and they are still on desks.  We hear of this every day from the business organisations and businesses.  Is there any sense among the deputations of introducing some time limit such that if information is not supplied then the loan is deemed dead, everyone moves on and it is not treated as an outgoing application?<\/p><p>  Mr. Farrell referred to Ireland's credit trends in the context of the eurozone.  Will he provide the United Kingdom figures as well?  Many organisations like to provide a comparison of Ireland in the eurozone.  We share a currency with those countries but not much else.  Our way of doing business bears greater similarity to Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom rather that the rest of the eurozone.  Is there any chance of the Irish Banking Federation providing those figures as well?<\/p><p>  Mr. Trethowan's first point related to the alienation of businesses from the banking system.  I refer to Bank of Ireland's so-called bank of the future policy.  \"Bank of the future\" is Bank of Ireland's phrase.  Initially, the idea is to target small businesses, including retail and hospitality businesses, with a turnover of &euro;20,000 or more.  The bank is assigning days that these enterprises are allowed to lodge.  On other days they are not welcome to lodge money, including coins and cash.  They bring cash or coins to the bank via four suggested security organisations, those we see around the town, a service for which the businesses must pay.  On other days they are informed that they cannot lodge money.  They incur the cost of bringing money to the bank.  For example, if a business operator normally lodges on a Monday and he is instructed to lodge on Tuesdays, he misses the day that money normally hits the bank account and the day when he has the ability to deal with the takings from the weekend straight away.  If there was one example of Mr. Trethowan's initial comment about the alienation from the banking system, that is it.  These banks are closing branches and cutting the number of desks available for cash and coin transactions.  One cannot lodge coins through a machine.<\/p><p>  All the business organisations have been before the committee.  Chambers Ireland will be before the committee presently.  Its view is of a system completely disconnected from the reality of businesses.  The Irish Banking Federation can produce all the figures it wishes but it is rather like a college lecturer.  The theory is great and I have no doubt it is happening.  Mr. Farrell referred to 80,000 credit applications, but what was the total number that applied?  What was the overall amount?  There are people here from every part of the country.  There is no sense of reaching out to local branches, in particular on the part of the two pillar banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300005#D00300","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352814600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>There are many points to cover but I will do my best to cover them.

We have referred those reports to the banks.  The staff in the two branches concerned are to be retrained to avoid that.

I remind small businesses that they have a right to apply for a loan.  I urge them to do so but to make sure before they go in that they are well prepared and can argue their case.  A request must be made formally and in writing.  If it does not go into the bank system it will not be measured.

If I miss something I hope members will come back to me.<\/p><p>  I am seeking, in a respectful way, to present facts.  These are facts that are corroborated by third parties.  They are not hypothetical but are based on real experience and data collected on what is happening in the SME sector. <\/p><p>  The Credit Review Office consistently reports that somewhere between 80% and 85% of credit applications are approved.  Thus, if 80,000 loans are approved, there must have been approximately 100,000 applications. <\/p><p>  Reference was made to the turnaround time.  I recently saw the figure of 60% cited as the percentage of loan applications approved within 15 working days.  That figure should be 100%, although I know banks are working to bring down the approval time so there is a much faster turnaround time.  I suspect some of this delay is caused by the issue Mr. Trethowan referred to: a business making an application does not always arrive with the correct information.<\/p><p>  The issue of discouraged loans is a perennial one.  If we want to get a handle on the level of refusals, businesses must make formal applications.  Meeting a bank manager in the golf club, outside the church or in the corner shop and having a \"how are you fixed?\" type of conversation does not constitute an application.  A bank cannot make an evaluation based on that kind of casual encounter.  Members know that if a constituent comes to them with a case they need to gather all the salient facts before they can make a judgment.  A formal application must be made, tedious as it may be.  Businesses are run by entrepreneurs, who are extraordinarily resilient individuals.  They would not survive in business otherwise.  They have to be equally resilient in making sure they put in a formal application.  If that formal application is put together in a robust way with all the salient facts, demonstrates the sustainability of the business and provides all the required information, it stands an excellent chance of success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300006#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352815800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I refer to the European Commission statement which is quite startling that Ireland has the second worst credit environment in Europe after Greece.  Credit was being lashed into the economy prior to 2008 and the mirror image is happening now.  This is the result of European and Government policy.  There is a pressure on banks to deleverage from markets.  Banks need to reduce their costs and exposure.<\/p><p>  ISME represents small business and its figures are startling.  A total of 45% of SMEs looking for loans have been refused credit; 25% of SMEs did not make a loan application because they were discouraged from doing so by the bank; 72% of firms stated that bailed out banks are making it more difficult to access finance.  Those statistics are for the period up to last September 2012; they are live figures.  What is the current level of credit in the market?  A total of &euro;2.6 billion credit is outstanding to SMEs.  How does that compare to the situation ten years ago?  <\/p><p>  There is confusion about the Government's objectives with regard to facilitation of new credit.  Would it be better for banks to separate refinancing credit from new credit and to have separate targets for the banks?  Politicians are under pressure from small business to ensure credit is available for them.  We are told the banks are facilitating this lending but much of the finance is directed to refinancing rather than being issued as new credit.  <\/p><p>  The cost of borrowing is a barrier to accessing finance.  It is more expensive to access finance in Ireland than in other European countries.  The micro-enterprise facility charges more for finance than the banks.  I ask Mr. Farrell for his view on this point.  Small indigenous businesses with non-performing legacy loans were advised to put money into property and not to put all their eggs in one basket.  Spicers in Navan and Olhausen in Dublin, are examples of businesses that were functioning.  Is it possible for the banking industry to separate those loans from the functioning business in order to safeguard jobs?  Can these loans be written down?  How do banks accommodate small viable businesses ?  How are customers of the former Anglo Irish Bank or Bank of Scotland (Ireland) faring when applying for credit rating with banks?  How can they ensure access to credit from the banks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300007#F00200","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352815800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I believe the situation is improving.

I must make the point that most people who were in business around 2007, when preparing their three- or five-year plans, projected that the economy would have grown by about 25% up to now, but instead it has shrunk by 25%.  That is a catastrophic reduction in the economic output of the domestic economy.  Something has to give.  If one builds one's business on servicing that level of capacity, one must seriously reduce one's business or it may transpire that one no longer has a viable business.  That is a hard but indisputable fact, and it needs to be borne in mind.<\/p><p>  On the issue of non-performing loans, the Deputy is correct.  In many cases, one of the big problems - two chief executives of the banks who appeared before another committee recently referred to this, and Mr. Trethowan is also aware of it - is that the underlying business is still profitable and sound but people got involved in property speculation and investment during the Celtic tiger era and they are now trying to service those investments from the business, which is putting a huge strain on the business.  One of the challenges for banks is to work with customers to examine the core business and the activity within it to ascertain the needs in this regard while, separately, examining the property issue and how it can be dealt with or structured.  Mr. Trethowan may have more to say on that.  I  am not sure whether I covered all of the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352816400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I will add one point which may be helpful.  The Deputy referred to ISME.  We have had surveys from the Small Firms Association in the past, Chambers Ireland has done some work, and we have done our own work.  In their wisdom, the two key Departments - the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Finance - brought all of the stakeholders, including the bodies represented, around the table about 18 months ago and said that we had to get to the bottom of this to obtain a real picture of what was happening in lending and that the Government would commission a piece of work in this regard, and that is how we got the Mazars study.  All of the stakeholders agreed that this would be the definitive piece of research that informed policy and practice as we moved forward.  ISME was at that table, as were the SFA and ourselves.  That is the reason we consistently point to the Mazars study, warts and all - in which the warts, from our point of view, are deficiencies.  We must all subscribe to one definitive piece of work.  The figures produced by Mazars are nowhere near the sort of figures ISME continues to produce.  I believe I am correct in saying that Mr. Trethowan and his colleagues in the Credit Review Office have also had issues with the ISME research.  We are all trying to subscribe to and support the same definitive piece of work.<\/p><p>  To return to a point Deputy Calleary raised regarding discouraged borrowers, one result from the research that was particularly worrying was that 45% of businesses said their opinions about whether banks were lending were formed on the basis of media reports or statements from what they heard outside, rather than their own experience.  Obviously there are businesses that base their opinions on their experiences, but nearly half of the respondents said their views were driven by media reports.  The challenge for us is to cut through that and try to get a more positive message across that what is involved is, as Mr. O'Farrell said, the formulation of a formal credit application and then going through the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Felix O'Regan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352816400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I will deal with the questions from the top of the list, and the first question I have listed is the one on the size of the loan book.  I have been monitoring the loan books for the past two and half years, since April 2010, and I can comment on the general direction of lending.  It has been downwards.  Each half-year we ask the banks to do what is called a funds flow statement, which shows the starting balance of their loan books and the end balance at the end of the period, and it shows how much lending has been done, how many repayments have been received, what interest has been charged and what has been written off.  It tracks all the movements in the book.  Irish businesses are currently paying down debt much more quickly than the demand for lending is putting new money into the market.  There is a clear reason for the decline in the loan books during the past two and half years.  I cannot speak for the past ten years but I am sure someone will find those numbers for the Deputy.<\/p><p>  On the ISME survey, all of the trade bodies and trade groups - ISME, Chambers Ireland, the SFA, the IFA and the hoteliers - have a vital role to play in the market.  They keep the pressure on from the demand side and keep everyone honest.  I have a different view on the ISME survey.  My problem with it is that ISME surveys all of its members.  It sent out 8,000-odd surveys and reported on the number it received back, which was about 800.  The people who tend to reply to such surveys are people who have issues - people who have been on the wrong side of staff satisfaction surveys and so on - so the survey is skewed towards the negative.  That is my issue with the survey.  It does not reflect the number of people who were asked to respond; it only reflects those who responded, which skews it towards the negative side.<\/p><p>  On the separation of new and restructured loans, that is one of the fundamental things we do in the Credit Review Office.  We do it in some of the 55% of cases in which we can help to get credit for businesses.  We do it for farms and also for small businesses.  Farmers were encouraged in poorer times to engage in secondary enterprises and many of them went into building as a secondary enterprise, including farm buildings, for which there were grants available.  In such cases, we often find that the farm is viable but the farmer has not collected the trade debt on the building.  By separating the farm from the secondary enterprise, we are able to show that the business is viable as a farm and that we need to park the other debt and see, first, if the farm business can survive through this period and, second, if it can make some contribution towards paying off the debt.  It is the same for small businesses.<\/p><p>  There was a question about legacy loans.  I would say that applies in half of the cases we see.  We always ask for a statement of assets from the main promoter of the business, whether it be the sole owner or the principal director.  Invariably, when we ask for a statement of assets, we are given a list of buy-to-let properties.  We have a table which shows the value they were bought at, their current value, how much was borrowed against the properties, how much is due to be repaid and what rentals there are.  Those were the reserves of the business during the Celtic tiger years, and instead of being released as a liquid source of cash, they are now fixed assets.  They either break even or go underwater, and instead of providing cash for the business the servicing costs of the loans are pulling the business back.  Therefore, they need to be parked and the core business needs to be examined.<\/p><p>  Anglo Irish Bank is precluded from making new loans and Bank of Scotland (Ireland) has declared it is leaving Ireland.  We get some applications in which the business is currently insolvent because of large property debts with, let us say, Bank of Scotland (Ireland).  Certus is doing forgiveness of debts and the application we get would be to finance a deal to refinance the Bank of Scotland (Ireland) debt.  It might be a tenth of what was borrowed.  For a business with a balance sheet that shows it is insolvent with a level of debt on one side, if the debt is written down to a tenth of the amount, it is transformational for the business.  It gives it a future.

Currently, people have been turning over the forbearance waiting for better times to come but the troika has said it wants to see a business in that position, which is struggling, restructured over five to seven years with a proper programme.  That will mean that those legacy debts will have to be addressed one way or another.<\/p><p>  It is not the job of the Credit Review Office to talk about debt forgiveness.  We try to make a deal without recommending that the bank write down debt but the reality is that some level of forgiveness by all of the banks will have to be required on the way forward to deal with just the legacy debts.<\/p><p>  On the reduction, the global economy is awash with cash with businesses paying down debt, and not just in Ireland.  It is not an Irish phenomenon; it is a situation across the world.  There is approximately &euro;15 trillion in cash on businesses' balance sheets across the world.  Businesses are not borrowing; they are repaying.<\/p><p>  On directors' loans, again, one of the features we see in many appeals is that when we get to the capital account there is a big chunk in it with the directors' loans.  It may be that there is some capacity remaining out there but we are probably in year 5 of these challenging times for domestic demand, turnover and profitability.  The capability of directors to continue to fund businesses from their own resources may be getting strained.<\/p><p>  The other aspect that would worry me is the trade debts in some business balance sheets.  As bank lending has been tight for some businesses they have borrowed from their suppliers and suppliers have been willing to lend because they want to increase their turnover, but once a trade debt is taken onto someone's books they become the banker for that other business.  If they go down, they have a bad debt on their books.  It is not unknown for us to see a good business brought down just by bad trade debts and therefore it is something about which to be cautious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300009#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Trethowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1352817000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Farrell want to address those questions or wait until the next ones-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300009#H00400","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352817000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>To come back to the point on the slight reduction in the size of the debt outstanding, I refer to the point Mr. Trethowan made earlier.

I have been judging the Business &amp;amp; Finance Entrepreneur of the Year for the past three years, the most recent of which we finished yesterday.  I was also involved in a television programme called \"Retail Therapy\" which involved meeting small businesses.  I found that those businesses that were bright and with it, and I am thinking of the Entrepreneur of the Year, had no problem getting loans because they were professional in the manner in which they went about doing that.  I have met other companies which had two views on that.  One was that having read what is in the newspapers they knew they had no chance of getting a loan and therefore they did not look for one.  The other was that they had put in an application that was poorly worded, badly advised and lacking in professionalism.  I would not give them a loan on that basis.  However, I found that if I gave them some advice or got somebody to give them advice the entire situation changes.  Is that what has happened?  I believe the bank has a strong case to make when it says people are coming in to them ill-prepared or that people are not coming in to them because they have read in the newspapers that they have no chance of getting money.  Is that the experience of the Credit Review Office as well?  It appears that if there has been a 55% change of attitude something has changed from the time the bank said \"No\" to the time it said \"Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300009#H00600","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352817000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>We do not have bank policies on solvency, gearing and security.

Why was there such a difference?<\/p><p>  Many members have said the views they hear on the ground are different from those we hear from the Irish Banking Federation.  At the start of this year I met two local bank managers from one of the pillar banks.  They told me they are open for business and encouraged me to send clients to them.  I stated I had heard anecdotally that the bank was reluctant to lend and the managers accepted there was reluctance in 2011 and that the bank was anxious about or scared of being too generous in giving out loans.  Since then, one would have expected to have seen an increase in lending.   Is the bankers&rsquo; statement that they are more open for business backed up in the figures?<\/p><p>  Mr. Trethowan referred to the parking of other debt.  We have been told many businesses that are doing well invested in property, both foreign and Irish, during what were supposedly the good times.  Obviously, the property prices have collapsed.

I will revert to one point the Deputy made about microfinance.  The increased rate of refusals suggested by the Deputy will not happen for the following reason, if no other.  Banks are supplying most of the finance for the Microfinance Ireland fund.  While there is a certain amount of risk-sharing with regard to the equity that is being invested in respect of the guarantee for the loans, effectively the lion's share of the financing will come through the banking sector.  Effectively, the banks will be the primary source of finance for the Microfinance Ireland fund, as they have been for the Social Finance Foundation over the past number of years.  However, I believe what Microfinance Ireland is doing constitutes an extremely important initiative on the Government's part because many of these businesses comprise one, two or three people and are fairly low in respect of formal business management or planning skills.  That is not anyone's fault; it is simply a function of the type of business they operate.  Therefore, their proposition to a bank to obtain money is more challenging than would be the case with regard to meeting the traditional criteria.  Moreover, this was where the highest rate of decline was detected, because these are riskier enterprises.  Effectively, a model has been developed to try to change that dynamic and hopefully - there is no reason to believe otherwise - the establishment of that structure, for which banks will supply quite a lot of finance, will help to address that issue.  It is a particular challenge that has been identified in both the Mazars report and Mr. Trethowan's reports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352818200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>The genesis of the enterprise loan scheme was the First Step scheme that went before it, which has transformed itself into the enterprise loan scheme.

However, banks never supplied seed capital for start-ups, especially for small-scale lending, and consequently this scheme is tailored for them.

As I have approximately eight questions, I will go through them as quickly as possible.  First, I wish to make a suggestion in respect of the report from the Irish Banking Federation.  On page 4, in respect of the percentage of small and medium enterprises, SMEs, using banking credit, it might be a good idea to consider debtor days when considering bank overdraft facilities across the rest of Europe as opposed to here, because I suspect we are very poor in managing our debtors.  As Mr. Trethowan has already indicated, I believe that would be a worthwhile exercise.  How do the witnesses envisage the loan guarantee scheme helping?  As it has been established that demand is weak, the witnesses should indicate their views on what the banks are doing to stimulate demand.  Is the pricing of interest rates a disincentive?  What are the banks doing differently today in comparison with what they were doing 18 months ago when the Mazars report was drawn up?  How are banks approaching the task of gaining a real understanding of their customers' requirements and how they can be supported where security clearly is an issue, where credit rating is an issue or where there are core and non-core issues extant?  To paraphrase Fiona Muldoon of the Central Bank, there is a lot of activity but no real outcomes.  Banks may be putting loans on different interest rates or on shorter terms but they are not really dealing with the core issues.  I do not believe that waiting for property prices to increase will solve the problem any time soon.  This is a real issue.<\/p><p>  In my experience of helping clients to get loans, there is a huge mix, with people putting together very good business plans and getting loans, as well as people who are putting together very poor ones.  It is clear there is a major issue in respect of soft supports nationwide.  Everyone present is familiar with my views on this issue and on the concept of establishing a stronger mentoring force whereby businesses can receive help.  I have spoken to the banks about it and they agree.  However, it is important to have such a force because at present there is much activity in that space but there really is no place for some of it.  While the banks were talking about entering that space, I do not think it is a space into which they should go.  There should be a single establishment that does this and does so really well.  I seek the witnesses' views in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300011#K00900","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speech","time":1352818200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>While I did not count eight questions, I am sure there were eight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300011#K01000","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1352818200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>History has a habit of coming back to haunt one.

He has done a very good PR job for the banks and was faultless in his presentation showing everything is perfect with them.  I am delighted to meet Mr. John Trethowan in person.  He was the fair-haired boy for a while when he agreed with the banks.  When he disagreed with them, he became a <i>b&ecirc;te noire<\/i>.  I heard one of the bank bosses claim various new companies were successful when Mr. Trethowan pointed out they had already gone out of business.<\/p><p>  Bank lending overall has contracted due to the weak demand in the economy.  However, yesterday, Lars Frisell, chief economist of the Central Bank, at a European conference, gave a more fundamental reason.  He claimed Ireland's banks face great economic uncertainty and pressure to deleverage which stifles their ability or willingness to supply the economy with credit at reasonable costs.  Mr. Trethowan has upheld 55% of the appeals made to his office.  Have the banks subsequently agreed to provide the funding?<\/p><p>  Mr. Trethowan referred to relationship banking and the centralisation of decision-making on credit applications, the reduction in rural branches and the continuing change of front-of-house staff leading to many small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, feeling isolated and remote from their banks.  Any of us involved in a SME know that it is all about the character, calibre and capability of the promoter whether the business survives or not.  I do not agree with Senator Quinn that the banks are being upfront about their loans.  I do not believe anyone seriously in business today would make a presentation to a bank that would not stand up to scrutiny, particularly with the wide availability of computer programmes and so forth for such exercises.<\/p><p>  Regarding the &euro;3.5 billion lending targets for the two pillar banks, Mr. Trethowan stated new lending is a vital component of economic growth and is an area in which the Credit Review Office is encouraging banks to be more accommodating.  What are the components of this &euro;3.5 billion lending?  Why are the banks not more transparent about it?  There is a case for including restructured loans in the targets.  The same cannot be said for annual overdraft limits which are part of the annual process of cash flow management.  Are annual renewals of overdraft limits and invoice discounting included in this &euro;3.5 billion target?<\/p><p>  As an opposition spokesperson in the Seanad on jobs, enterprise and innovation, I have harangued the Minister, Deputy Bruton, about the lack of money available for SMEs.  I believe he is listening to the banks rather than to the SMEs.  While a bank may approve a loan, it may effectively stifle it being drawn down by imposing tough conditions such as personal guarantees.

Some of the banks - I stand open to correction - may have funds or resources dedicated to nurturing young entrepreneurs.  Businesses age and their owners age with them.  One needs to be able to bring a new cohort of young entrepreneurs on track who will start up new enterprises, give new energy and refresh existing enterprises, and bring new ideas and new thoughts.  There is a significant cohort of young people who have brilliant business ideas but, as Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins stated, they need mentoring and support.  The banks are actively putting resources into that area at present.  It may be there is merit in looking at co-ordinating mentoring activities better.  There is probably more than enough mentoring activity around.  It is to direct it in the appropriate manner.  Young entrepreneurs must be nurtured by banks because the customers of the banks will eventually age and retire, and they must replace them with new customers.

Our submission represents the views of the entire chamber network.  It is the result of extensive consultation with representatives of the business community throughout Ireland.  Our members include established indigenous and multinational companies as well as small and medium-sized enterprises taking their first steps in business.  All of them recognise the role governments can play in producing the right conditions for job creation and retention.<\/p><p>  When this Government came to power, we noted the importance it attached to job creation.  Policies that support existing positions and help to create new employment will be a cornerstone of any future economic recovery.  Throughout 2012 we observed the progress made in this area and commented on the action plan for jobs and the three progress reports made to date.  Our general view is that while the action plan is strong on aspiration, we urgently need to deliver more rapidly.  While high profile jobs announcements are very welcome and we congratulate the Government on successes in this area, the numbers on the live register remain alarming.<\/p><p>  The policies pursued must create sustainable employment at a cost that is capable of being borne by businesses.  We believe this can be achieved through a number of policy areas.  There must be no increase in the cost of employment, wage setting mechanisms must not be excessively rigid, local government reform must help local economies, there must be a range of practical supports for SMEs and entrepreneurs, Ireland's infrastructure must be strengthened, and any changes in taxation must be sympathetic to the needs of the business community.<\/p><p>  Our members believe that the most important factor affecting job creation is the cost of employment.  If the Government is serious about helping businesses to create jobs, they must not increase these costs.  An example members may not think about is that the profitability of companies which cover health insurance costs for their staff is affected by ongoing levy increases, which have increased from &euro;160 for each adult covered in 2009 to &euro;285 in 2012.  With further increases scheduled, this has a real impact on the ability of these companies to retain existing staff and create new employment.  We believe there must not be any increase in the employer's share of PRSI and additional costs of sick leave must not be transferred to employers.  The Minister for Social Protection has suggested that such moves would be justified as they merely bring Ireland into line with international norms.  We reject that claim, however.  A number of major OECD countries have similar sick leave regimes as in Ireland.  Furthermore, employers bear the brunt of the cost of sick leave through their contributions to the Social Insurance Fund.  The extraordinary rise in health insurance costs also adds to companies' cost burdens and is a matter of concern.  These costs would not only harm existing indigenous companies but also have a harmful impact on foreign direct investment.  Companies considering investments in Ireland will not like to see the cost of employment rising.  The Minister's logic is flawed because the outcome of these policies would run counter to the Government's stated aims on job creation.<\/p><p>  This August saw the enactment of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act.  A number of changes were welcomed by Chambers Ireland and the wider business community.  In particular, the reduction of Sunday premium rates of pay could prove vital in guaranteeing the survival of many small businesses in the retail and service sector.  For job creation to be sustainable, conditions of employment must be flexible.  Artificially inflated wage levels actually threaten jobs.  Many EU countries are seeing the benefit of flexicurity in employment because flexible terms and conditions actually produce more secure and stable outcomes for employers and workers.  Future legislation must be clear, simple and easily understood and implemented to ease the regulatory burden and make it easier for employers to comply with the current cornucopia of legislation in this area, which itself is a disincentive to employment creation.  Approximately 35 Acts apply to employment.  We reiterate our call for a fully consolidated single Act in this area.<\/p><p>  Considerable attention has been given this year to the reform of local government.  While the local government reform action plan mainly focused on the restructuring of local authorities, if the Government is intent on putting people first it needs to ensure local authorities work with local companies to assist in the task of job creation.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, which replace the county enterprise boards, should have clearly defined roles and functions and must not duplicate the services already offered by private companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300014#N01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352820600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>We appreciate that.

A cost saving measure in that area would do a lot less damage to the economy than would other types of initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012111300017#Q01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1352821800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>That is all part of the reform agenda.

Our main business today is the student grant application system.  The meeting has been convened at short notice to address problems and delays that have arisen in the new system.  I understand many frustrating delays are being experienced by students applying to the new body, Student Universal Support Ireland, known as SUSI.  It appears the SUSI system has problems in coping with the volume of applications received.  As a result, some students and their families are suffering without any indication being given of how long it will be before the students receive their grants.  I thank the City of Dublin VEC officials for attending.  We all remember the crisis in dealing with the backlog of medical card applications.  The Joint Committee on Health and Children adopted a very proactive approach to solving that problem.  This committee is attempting to do something similar.  We have invited representatives of City of Dublin VEC to seek answers and outline what actions can be taken immediately to address the backlog of applications.  To that end, I welcome Ms Jacinta Stewart, chief executive officer of City of Dublin VEC; Mr. Tom Prizeman, unit manager of SUSI; and Ms Kay Cullinane, principal officer in the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to this committee.

SUSI wants to award grants to students.  I will make a short presentation on current issues and the efforts we are making to deal with them.<\/p><p>  SUSI opened the new grant application scheme on Monday, 11 June 2012, with a closing date of 31 August.  Students applying for a new grant filled in an on line application form.  At the closing date of 31 August, 56,935 applications had been received.  We have, however, continued to receive applications beyond the closing date.  Over 9,000 applications have been received since.  Currently, the rate is approximately 200 a week.  <\/p><p>  SUSI includes a stringent means test to discover if a student is eligible for a grant.  Following the on-line application, each applicant was sent a pack by post, with a personalised check list, requesting a set of documents.  The SUSI figures as of 12 November are as follows: 20,350 applications are now complete at award stage; 25,310 are being processed; while documentation is awaited from 20,500 students.  <\/p><p>  I will describe how the system works.  Students complete an on-line application form and then each applicant is sent a pack by post containing a personalised check list and requesting a set of documents.  There are two parts to the process.  The first is to review the pack and ensure is it complete and the documentation is returned to SUSI.  The second is to assess the completed application.  In order to ensure the pack is complete, SUSI has provided a support service which has, to date, dealt with 175,000 telephone calls and 35,000 e-mails.  <\/p><p>  In the early stages of the process students who had applied early submitted complete packs.  As we moved towards the closing date of 31 August, it was noticeable that a number of the packs from later applicants were incomplete.  By incomplete I mean, for example, a failure to sign the declaration form or the final course acceptance form; submitting income details for the wrong year; only submitting supporting documents for part of the year; students under the age of 23 years failing to supply parent information.  <\/p><p>  We had been assessing packs at the rate of 800 a day, which figure then increased to 1,300.  By the end of next week it will be 1,900 a day.  These are the numbers of submitted documents being assessed.  At the assessment stage of the process, we are assessing 750 packs a day but want to move to 1,150 a day.  The system is working, but we need it to work faster.  We have taken a number of measures to make the process work faster.  We have scaled up the staffing of the support desk, in line with the volume of calls received.  At support and review stage, staff numbers have been increased from 39 to 79.  We have assigned more staff to the assessment unit.  At assessment and payment stage, the number of staff has been increased from 55 to 96, with ten further staff due to start next Monday.  We have increased text and e-mail communications to encourage those whose responses are awaited to contact us and provide the correct documentation.  We are making reminder telephone calls to students to request that they submit their final course acceptance form.  We have posted the ten top reasons for incomplete documentation packs.  These include reminders to supply the long form birth certificate and a copy of a passport must be certified by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a Commissioner for Oaths.  We have a representative on <i>boards.ie<\/i> to address issues raised by applicants through this forum.<\/p><p>  SUSI has taken the following measures to speed up the process for the next academic year: we have agreed with the CAO that students may opt in to allow it to pass course details to SUSI.  We are working with the Revenue Commissioners to explore methods of data sharing, particularly P21 details.  These discussions are at an advanced stage.  We are in early stage discussions with the Department of Social Protection to explore the issue of access to social welfare payment data.  We will continue to expand the SUSI information campaign which, to date, has included working with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors, the Union of Students of Ireland and the citizens information service centres to enable them to assist students in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacinta Stewart","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352806200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I remind members we agreed previously the order of speakers which is the spokespersons of Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Government, other Deputies in the order in which they raise their hands, Senators and then non-committee members.

It is at crisis stage in that 46,000 students have not been told yet whether they will be awarded a grant and only a small percentage of those would have been paid.  How many students have been paid their grant at this stage?  I do not have to tell Ms Stewart or her team the trouble and hardship this is causing for students across the country.  Ms Stewart outlined that SUSI has dealt with 175,000 telephone calls in the recent period.  She and her team more than anyone else will be aware of the stresses students and their families are under from not being able to get their grants yet.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, a new system has been set up replacing the job of work that was previously done by 66 authorities, 33 VECs and 33 county councils, and this work has now been given to one national organisation to do centrally.  My party and I do not have a problem with the centralisation of this system, however, we have a very serious problem with how the Minister has gone about doing it in conjunction with SUSI and about delivering it.  Unfortunately, many students now face Christmas still not knowing whether they will be awarded a grant and based on the evidence before us many of those students will not be paid their grant until into the new year.  <\/p><p>  Ms Stewart outlined that 20,000 applications are complete at award stage and she might break that down.  She also outlined that 25,000 are being processed.  Previous answers given by the Minister indicated that those being processed are just starting to be checked to see if information is missing.  Also, in replies to questions tabled by myself and other Deputies, we have been told that the expectation is that 40% of those packs will be returned to students as incomplete.  Those students who have not yet been told their documentation is incomplete have to wait to hear from that from SUSI and then send the information back to SUSI and we are only five weeks from Christmas.  SUSI is awaiting documentation packs back from 20,000 students.  I know from dealing with students that in many cases they have sent in the information but it has been lost and they have been told by SUSI that it has been lost.  Despite sending in the full information the first time they were asked for it, they have been asked to send the complete packs back in again because their information has not been found or SUSI did not keep a proper record of it.  That is a very serious issue and I am sure other Deputies will have similar accounts.    <\/p><p>  Ms Stewart mentioned that SUSI had been processing packs at the rate of 800 a day and that this has increased to 1,300 a day.  I would question that because the figure we were given for the number of applications processed two weeks ago was 18,000 and the figure Ms Stewart has given us today is 20,350.  That means that only an additional 2,350 were processed in a period of two weeks.  I do not see how the rate she gave us can be the case.<\/p><p>  She might outline the way the number of staff was increased from when SUSI was set up in June to now.  She told us that at the support and review stage the number of staff has increased 39 to 79.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111300003#B00300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1352806200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I am going to cut off the Deputy there.

Ms Stewart said twice during her presentation that the system is working.  That is simply not true and that is not only my opinion.  I have received tens of e-mails from students over the weekend who would also be of the view that the system is not working.  Some of the issues students have raised with us include a student who is attending college 155 km from their residence yet only receives an adjacent grant rather than a non-adjacent grant.  That is not the only instance of that issue that has been raised with us.  Some students who have had their grants processed are now appealing those decisions because they believe the grant that was awarded was not the correct grant.  Can Ms Stewart indicate the number of appeals that have been submitted to date?<\/p><p>  When SUSI first raised the issue of the backlog with the Department what was its response?  Did Ms Stewart ask for additional resources to be put in place to deal with the backlog and, if so, what was the response?  Did SUSI get all the additional resources sought and, if not, was there a reason it did not get them?  Is Ms Stewart satisfied with the numbers working in SUSI?  As Deputy McConalogue said, there is a difference between the numbers Ms Stewart has given us and the numbers the Minister has stated in the past number of days.  Ms Stewart is talking about 96 and 79 staff which is nearly 180 staff and we are being told that the number has increased to 85.  I would like to know which figure is correct.  Are the figures Ms Stewart gave us correct or is the Minister mistaken about the number who are working in SUSI?  <\/p><p>  Can Ms Stewart give us some background to what happens to the packs when they are sent off?  Is it true they are sent to an outside company which compiles them, uploads them on to a computer file from which they are then sent back to SUSI?  The information we have is that the SUSI office is a paperless one, that no documentation goes to SUSI and that it goes to an outside agency, and that is where the documentation is being lost.  I have received an e-mail from an individual indicating that when their original documents were sent back they included documentation belonging to a different student, a birth certificate of another student, which that student then returned to SUSI.  I would certainly disagree with Ms Stewart's statement that the system is working.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111300003#B00700","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352806800,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Like Deputy O'Brien I was surprised by the statement that the system is working when it demonstrably is not.  I do not wish to be smart about it but I expected an acknowledgement or apology to the students and families who are enduring monumental hardship as a result of the flaws in the system.  It is not a matter of dispute.  The impression being given was that somehow this was the fault of the students who were not capable of filling out forms.  I know from my dealings with local authority grants over a long period that it can be the case that forms are incorrectly filled out but we all received much correspondence from people who seem perfectly competent and who stated that they did send in all their documentation.  I refer to people who were able to get their leaving certificate and get into college and parents who have done it before and can read and fill out a form.  They said they did send documents and that the delay in the process was at the SUSI end.<\/p><p>  What investigations have been made?  There seems to be a litany of missing documentation.  Is there a flaw in the system in that regard?  How is the issue of missing documents being addressed?  One issue that emerged from the correspondence is that four or five months after an application was made an applicant would be asked for a final course acceptance form.  I presume that is an additional document but people did not know about it.  Prior to submitting applications people specifically inquired as to whether all the documentation was present and they were told that everything was in order, but later in the day further documentation was sought.  What is the correct system?<\/p><p>  We acknowledge that it is a new system but it has not come out of the blue.  It was years in the making.  We know approximately how many people will seek grants.  It is not the case that some strange phenomenon emerged in the course of the year.  Those issues should have been anticipated.  It seems to me that a complicated process was adopted.  Why is the City of Dublin VEC only going to Revenue now?  The grant is means-tested.  It is public money and the public has a right to know it is going to deserving cases, but much of the information that is being sought is with Revenue anyway.  We heard a story about a person from Waterford dropping out of college because of what he was put through in terms of looking for a profit and loss statement for his parents who have a small farm income even though the tax authorities and the tax assessment would have provided the information.  He had to employ an accountant to do ridiculous profit and loss statements.  That just seems completely unnecessary.<\/p><p>  A number of people who endured the hardship got the grant only to find that it was wrong.  I received five or six e-mails from people on the matter and I presume far more than that were affected.  Those applications are now back in the pile of applications that still has not been processed.  How many people have submitted appeals and what is the appeals process?  There appears to be some confusion.  If someone is clearly getting the non-adjacent level but the mileage is obviously on the wrong rate, I presume that is an error that could be corrected that does not require a major appeal.  What is the attitude of the witnesses to that?<\/p><p>  I have a problem with what has been said about the plans for dealing with the backlog.  A total of 29 working days remain between now and Christmas, including today.  Even if we were to accept the figure of dealing with 750 applications per day that would give a total of 21,000 perfect applications.  If we go on the upgraded estimate of a target of 1,100 applications per day, one would reach a total of 30,000.  It is an impossible aim.  Based on the plans that are currently in place the majority of cases will not be processed prior to Christmas.  I would like a response in that regard, in addition to the number of staff involved because I am unclear about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111300004#C00200","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1352806800,"counter":244,"content":"<p>In the absence of a nominated Government spokesperson I will call on the first Government party member who indicated, Deputy Keating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111300004#C00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1352806800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I too join with you, Chairman, and the committee in welcoming staff from the VEC.

Of course, I believe we could do this better.  We have learned a considerable amount from this.  We produced a video on YouTube to bring people through the process.  We underestimated the complexity of the kinds of details required.<\/p><p>  Consider the question on the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection.  All sorts of legal issues arise with regard to data protection.  With regard to the CAO, it would take 18 months for us to be able to gain access to the documentation, and for the student to give permission for his or her information to be released.  We must be really careful to honour the arrangement in place and to ensure we are not releasing information that we should not release and that we do not receive information that should not be released to us.  However, we do want to award grants and are doing the best we can at this stage to ensure that.<\/p><p>  We have already talked about how we increased the number of staff working on the backlog.  In the initial stages, there was a return rate of 56%.  There are still a number of people in the system in respect of whom documentation was sent back on a number of occasions because it was incomplete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111300006#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacinta Stewart","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352808600,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Were the additional personnel who were taken on experienced or must they be trained?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012111300007#F00200","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speech","time":1352808600,"counter":314,"content":"<p>That is a supplementary question with which the Deputy can come in at the end.

While I acknowledge they are coming under fire, that is the job to which they signed up, like the rest of us present, and the questions must be asked.  I must take issue with the witnesses with regard to the loss of documents and the statement that SUSI has received one complaint.  A number of people approached me stating they had submitted all their documents but that two full months after so doing, they received a letter requesting precisely the same items they had sent in previously.  The person concerned had actually registered her pack, as had a number of her friends, and they approached me together with their registered letter slips.  I spent an entire morning tracking those registered letters, only to find they went to Dublin and were redirected to Abtran in Cork.  The last place I could find a record of them was in the sorting office in Cork.  I was then obliged to approach the postmaster to track them to this company Abtran, where they were signed for by an individual.  Obviously, one cannot give names at this meeting.  I rang SUSI, which, I am sorry to be obliged to say, was most unhelpful.  First, its representatives would not speak to me.  I deal with housing grants, medical cards, agricultural grants and social welfare payments, and every office I contact will speak to me as a public representative, with the exception of SUSI.  Its representative stated he could not speak to me, whereupon I asked to speak to his supervisor.  Eventually, after arguing on the telephone - as Ms Stewart has stated, the conversation is recorded and she should go back and listen to it - I got to speak to a supervisor, whom I also will not name, as members are not allowed to use names.  The supervisor also was most unhelpful and kept telling me to tell the student to send in the application again.<\/p><p>  This is not good enough in the case of people who have sent in all their documentation, have registered them to ensure they got there and who have them signed for by an individual.  Those documents got to SUSI, which lost them and there are no two ways about it.  This simply is not good enough.  I acknowledge the application form suggests the applicants should photocopy everything, but human nature being the way it is, many people put original documents into an envelope without having photocopied them.  They are now running around trying to find P21 forms again  Incidentally, P60 forms cannot be reissued as they can only be issued once.  Consequently, people are in an awful state.<\/p><p>  I have a few other points to make.  As for the self-employed people who sent in their self-assessments and their notice of assessment from the tax office, this is not good enough for SUSI.  It now seeks a letter from their accountants stating they are self-employed.  I cannot understand this as it is quite evident that they are self-employed, yet this is not good enough.

It is disappointing, however, we do not have any Department officials or the Minister here which is a matter the committee should consider.  The questions about students&rsquo; access to services, sitting examinations at Christmas and submitting projects can only be answered by the Minister.  It is not the job of SUSI to answer these questions.  I have had telephone calls and e-mails about students dropping out because they cannot submit projects due this week.  The committee needs to call in the Department, the Higher Education Authority and the institutes of technology to sort out how this is causing distress to students as it appears it will continue for several weeks.<\/p><p>  In theory the centralised system is good and City of Dublin VEC is the right organisation to run it as it has a good track record in this area.  My concern is that from the very start it was not given the resources it needed to properly process these claims.  This is evident from the fact staffing levels have changed several times since this started.  Ms Stewart informed the committee how many extra staff she has been given.  How many did she ask for?  How many staff does SUSI need to ensure every application is decided on by Christmas?  As Deputy Clare Daly pointed out, on SUSI&rsquo;s best estimate there will still be thousands of students who will not have a grant by Christmas.  It is important the committee is given the information it needs to put pressure on a cross-party basis on the Department to ensure SUSI is given the staff it needs to sort out this mess.<\/p><p>  The delegation pointed out that there is only one formal complaint of lost documents.

For example, take the case of a student being asked for 15-piece documentation.  When it is scanned in, it is then merged and an assessor checks to see the 15-piece documentation is all there.  If some of the requested supporting documents are not there, a letter is generated to the student requesting them.  A student may think it was submitted but it may not have been.  I guarantee every piece of documentation received is scanned into the system.  We have sent out 20,000 requests for full and complete packs.  Back in September, when the packs were beginning to be returned, up to 56% of them were not complete.

It is a three to five-year project and we hope to get rid of much of the documentation by year five but it will take time to do that.  We looked at the idea of students scanning in the documentation and it is something that will potentially happen in year two or three but a great deal depends on the quality of the photocopies coming in.  Part of the job that has to be done is to darken or lighten the photocopies to make them legible.

I thank the joint committee for the invitation to discuss the Estimates for my Department for 2013.  The Government&rsquo;s expenditure reform programme has provided for enhanced engagement by committees on expenditure issues and, as part of this process, I am keen to hear members' views and proposals on the difficult choices which must be made in the context of budget 2013.<\/p><p>  I have arranged for briefing material to be made available to the joint committee, which I hope will assist members in their deliberations.  It sets out the structure of the Department&rsquo;s Vote, both current and capital, reductions in expenditure that have had to be implemented in recent years, and the financial parameters in which we must operate in the period ahead.  I look forward to members' engagement and hearing their ideas as to how my Department should achieve its expenditure ceilings in 2013 as well as 2014 when further savings have to be made.<\/p><p>  In recent years, the Department has developed and maintained a strategic focus on contributing to economic recovery and employment and assisting those in need of support through the various programmes for which it has responsibility.  This has been done in the context of a sharp reduction in resources following the financial crisis that began in 2008.  Total funding for the Department&rsquo;s programmes has been reduced by slightly less than 50%, from nearly &euro;2.7 billion in 2009 to &euro;1.36 billion this year.  In tandem with reduced programme expenditure, staff numbers have declined substantially, as have the day-to-day costs of running the Department.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding these reductions, the funding available to my Department remains significant and a key priority is to maximise efficiency and secure the best value from the resources available to us.  The Department continues to be the second largest capital spending Department, having spent &euro;861 million in 2012, a figure which does not take account of &euro;34 million carried forward from 2011.  Within our capital programme, expenditure on housing and water services predominates.  The Leader and EU-related programmes are also vital to achieving rural development and enhancing cross-Border co-operation, respectively.<\/p><p>  The current spending provision for 2012 amounts to &euro;467 million.  Achieving reductions in current expenditure is highly challenging given the non-discretionary nature of much of it.  As a result, there are major areas where unavoidable commitments arise.  These comprise the rental accommodation scheme, for which &euro;135 million has been committed, local authority housing leasing costs on existing units, for which &euro;20 million has been committed, the capital loans and subsidy scheme loan charges of &euro;71 million, departmental pay of &euro;50 million and agency pay and pensions of &euro;31 million.  These current items amount in total to &euro;307 million, with the remaining &euro;160 million of the &euro;467 million used primarily for the local and community development programme, which accounts for &euro;55 million, and accommodation for homeless people, which accounts for &euro;50 million. These two programmes are of particular importance in countering and dealing with social disadvantage.<\/p><p>  Capital expenditure has declined from &euro;1 billion in 2011 to an estimated &euro;861 million this year, with the bulk of the savings falling on the housing and water services programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300003#B00300","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352816400,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300004#C00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1352816400,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I join the Minister in congratulating the Chairman and thank the committee for the opportunity to engage with it.  I will concentrate particularly on the housing programme.<\/p><p>  The significant challenges faced in the housing area within the current budgetary climate are clear to all.  Therefore, in allocating the resources likely to be available to me in 2013, I intend to continue to focus the necessary adjustments on areas where there is scope to maintain output through more flexible approaches and to continue to direct the available capital resources substantially towards the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors.<\/p><p>  In terms of the delivery of social housing,<b><\/b>the Government's housing policy statement clearly identifies that the main focus in terms of supports provided by the Government will be on meeting the most acute needs - the housing support needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources.  Meeting social housing need in the coming years will, therefore, have to involve a continuation of the transition from traditional construction and acquisition towards more flexible options such as the rental accommodation scheme and the leasing initiative.  We must tailor these supports according to the market conditions and the financial parameters in which we are working.<\/p><p>  The local authority capital allocation programme has been reduced to &euro;112 million in 2012.  This funding provides for the continuation of existing housing construction and acquisitions programmes, a small number of payments under the land aggregation scheme, and funding of the public safety initiative for unfinished housing developments.<\/p><p>  It must be recognised that, while there are existing public financial constraints, there also remains a need for local authority housing. To this end, I announced a programme of local authority house purchases and new construction starts last July.  Construction will start this year on a number of well-advanced projects, with the balance being advanced next year for completion by 2014.  I need to caution that the programme had to take account of the current financial circumstances of the country and was, therefore, a limited one.  However, we will work to ensure that the best value possible will be obtained from the funding which will be available in terms of unit cost and the number of units to be delivered.<\/p><p>  I am acutely aware that the issue of mortgage arrears<b><\/b>is one of the most pressing economic and social challenges facing the Government and the nation.  A mortgage-to-rent scheme was launched on a pilot basis and extended nationally earlier this year, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  It is just one element of the range of solutions on which the Government has been working.<\/p><p>  The capital assistance scheme is the main source of new housing provision for the most vulnerable, disadvantaged households and those with specific needs.  The 2012 allocation for the capital assistance scheme should support the provision, by approved housing bodies, of accommodation for households with special categories of need.<\/p><p>  The social housing improvement works programme spans a range of crucial Exchequer and local authority funded programmes and initiatives designed to maintain and improve the local authority housing stock of approximately 125,000 units.  My Department supports an ambitious programme of regeneration projects which seek to address the causes of disadvantage in some of the country's most disadvantaged communities through a programme of physical, social and economic regeneration.  In addition, funding is also provided to estate-wide remedial-type works<b><\/b>and necessary adaptations and extensions to properties to meet the needs of tenants with a disability.  The ongoing importance of these programmes cannot be underestimated, not just from a social policy perspective but also in terms of the job creation and economic renewal that are delivered as part of any regeneration programme.<\/p><p>  The energy efficiency programme of retrofitting and improvement works across the local authority housing stock is a further example of how social interventions can also help meet economic and employment objectives. This is a highly labour intensive programme and the funding provided will facilitate the upgrading of units as well as supporting and maintaining jobs.  The improvement works programme is specifically targeting vacant dwellings and, in particular, stock that has remained vacant for a significant length of time.  Returning vacant stock to productive use is essential in order that high quality, energy efficient homes can be provided, especially in light of the current pressures on local authority housing waiting lists.  Similarly, the suite of housing adaptation grants very effectively delivers across a number of priority areas, with households benefiting from investment from the Exchequer and from local authorities' own resources.<\/p><p>  A commitment was given in the programme for Government to review and update the current homeless<b><\/b>strategy and to introduce a so-called housing-led approach to accommodating homeless people so as to offer them suitable, long-term housing in the first instance and radically reduce the use of hostel accommodation and the associated costs for the Exchequer.  Work on the review is almost complete and I intend to launch a homelessness policy statement in the coming weeks.  The statement will indicate the steps the Government intends to take and also what housing authorities and other stakeholders need to do to accelerate progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.  The statement will advocate a housing-led approach.  This is about the rapid provision of secure housing, with support as needed, to ensure sustainable tenancies.<\/p><p>  I have set out the broad parameters within which the 2013 Estimate in respect of housing will be framed.  I welcome the members' views on the key issues and challenges outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300004#C00300","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1352816400,"counter":549,"content":"<p>We will move to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300004#C00400","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1352816400,"counter":550,"content":"<p>In regard to the rent supplement scheme and the changeover next year to the rent assistance scheme to be administered by local authorities, is it intended that it will still be a rent assistance scheme or to accelerate the rental accommodation scheme?

We have brought two memos to Government.  The full roll-out of it will not happen next year.  We intend to begin with a pilot phase sometime next year.  It is obviously a major change to which the Government is committed.  It involves the transfer of a large number of recipients of rent supplement to the local authorities and Deputy Catherine Murphy correctly points out that it is a big change which involves a good deal of work.<\/p><p>  On the financial side of it, the intention is that it will be Exchequer neutral.  In effect, it is transferring a group of recipients from one Department to another.  In terms of how it will work, there are a number of purposes.  One is that the entire cohort of those who are in need of housing support will be under the one system and there will not be one lot in one Department and the rest under the local government system.  It will be coherent and it will be easier for those involved in the system.  We also want to ensure that we can do it in a coherent way.  We want to get rid of the poverty traps that are there at present of which public representatives around this table will be well aware where recipients are afraid of losing their rent supplement if they get even part-time work.  The intention is that when it is fully implemented there will be a sliding rent scale - something similar to the differential rent system under local authorities - so that recipients will not suddenly lose their rent supplement but that they will pay in accordance with their ability to pay.<\/p><p>  We will introduce a pilot phase next year.  We are in ongoing discussions and there will be a further memo to Cabinet in the fairly near future.  The intention is to eliminate poverty traps and to make the system more coherent.  It will involve a payment system for those currently on rent supplement who will move to the new system that will be more appropriate in terms of a gradual increase in the amount they pay if they are able to secure employment.  No doubt it will be a better system for those involved.  However, it is a big move.  That is why, initially, we need to conduct a pilot to start off the scheme.  Bringing in the entire group in one go would be difficult for the local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300005#D00200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1352817000,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Has the local authority for the pilot scheme been selected yet?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300005#D00300","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1352817000,"counter":554,"content":"<p>We have not yet determined exactly how we will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300005#D00400","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1352817000,"counter":555,"content":"<p>It will not be Kildare.

It is difficult enough to make suggestions in the absence of a full budget being available at this early stage, but I have a few questions.<\/p><p>  The capital expenditure on housing will fall from &euro;189 million this year to &euro;92 million in the years 2014, 2015 and 2016.  Is this amount sufficient to tackle social housing waiting lists?  Is it almost whittling away at local authorities' functions in this area by virtue of housing associations, private finance or deals with NAMA becoming sufficient to meet the challenge of social housing needs across the country?<\/p><p>  The Exchequer initiated a contribution at least at the start of this year of &euro;175 million to the Local Government Fund and it was replaced by a &euro;160 million contribution from the household charge.  Some &euro;110 million was collected, leaving a &euro;65 million shortfall.  Local authorities were bearing the brunt of that cut, during the course of the year and in the third quarter and fourth quarter, despite the Estimates that they had agreed earlier in the year.  The Minister has been reducing the contribution to local authorities with low household charge payments.  Will that trend continue in the context of the proposal on property tax next year?<\/p><p>  It has been quoted that &euro;500 million per annum will be derived from the property tax.  How much of that will go to the Local Government Fund, how much of it will be retained by the Department and how much, by a process of elimination, will go back to the Central Fund?<\/p><p>  How much must the Minister commit towards Irish Water next year?  There has not yet been confirmation as to the cost, for example, of metering.  When the committee met Bord G&aacute;is last week on this issue, the cost from its perspective was estimated to be &euro;450 million whereas Deputy Stanley mentioned that a report of which he had sight stated it could cost &euro;1.2 billion.  The existing cost of local authorities for maintenance of water services, based on the research that I have done, appears to be approximately &euro;600 million per annum.  There is that figure, the figure for metering which I ask the Minister to clarify and the charge to be imposed, and then one must measure that against the Minister's statement that he will have to supplement Irish Water in the coming years before it becomes self-sufficient.  At what level will the Minister supplement Irish Water?<\/p><p>  I have two questions on EU related programmes.  I presume a large element of such programmes are co-funded by the European Union and it would be in all our interests that they would be retained and enhanced where possible.  Can the Minister give a commitment that such will be the case in the forthcoming years?<\/p><p>  What co-operation has there been with the Minister's counterpart in agriculture on the CAP proposals?  Specifically, I refer to environmental issues and to the funding that may be available within that envelope of CAP.  Will such funding be retained and controlled by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or its agencies for disbursement to the relevant sectors of society?  For example, I am conscious of SACs throughout the country where REP schemes, which were to be put in place, have not been put in place.  It is my information that there is a fair-sized sum that will be available under CAP within the envelope of environment that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, could garner for the public who need this and have not had comfort in this area <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300005#D00700","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1352817000,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I will deal with the matters raised by Deputy Cowen.

We are getting more bang for our buck.  That is working well.  It is one of the few areas where we have money and we encourage Leader groups and communities to advance their projects.  Axis has more applications than money at the moment.<\/p><p>  My Department has a very good relationship with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I refer to recent announcements about the environment which take into account the bad weather conditions which affect the farming community.  We have approval to extend the slurry spreading season because animals have been housed for a large part of the summer and we did not want to cause an animal welfare issue.  We are very conscious that when putting robust systems in place it is essential to avoid causing a nitrates problem.  The negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy will include the rural development element.  As part of what is called the greening of the CAP, I hope there will be additional funding for the environmental provisions which will be administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through the AEOS, agri-environmental options scheme.<\/p><p>  The special areas of conservation, SAC, are a matter for the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan.

We can only assume that the tax will continue to be &euro;100 per house for eligible households.  A collection rate of 100% will garner &euro;80 million as opposed to &euro;160 million for the full year.  We have been informed that the new house tax will begin on 1 July - it has been referred to as a property tax.  We are discussing this tax but we have no indication of what the rate of the tax will be.  The troika and Ministers have said it is expected to bring in &euro;1 billion a year.  I ask the Minister to give some indication of what his Department hopes to realise from the new house tax - property tax - from 1 July to the end of December 2013.

The money in this regard is being taken from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and while it will facilitate the putting in place of meters, it will not stop the leaks in the system.  Many people are curious with regard to the overall cost in this regard.  Figures ranging from &euro;300 million to &euro;1.2 billion have been referred to at meetings of this committee and in the D&aacute;il in the context of the cost relating to the introduction of metering.  The representatives from Bord G&aacute;is were extremely complimentary regarding the expertise that has been built up by local authorities.  I am of the same opinion and the Minister is aware of that because he has heard me comment on this matter on many occasions.  The representatives of the professional staff of local authorities have claimed that it could cost in excess of &euro;1.2 billion to install meters and to carry out the substantial ancillary works that will be required.

These staff already carry out certain functions at a very low cost.  The concern in this regard is that private contractors are going to have to be brought in at a higher cost.  Have the Minister and his officials examined the position in this regard, particularly in the context of the large number of retirements that are occurring?

We have seen what has happened in Northern Ireland, where huge mistakes were made.  The representatives, when pressed, said that in the short term perhaps staff at local authority level throughout the country could do what was required.  I believe, as I am sure do other members, that they are the appropriate people to identify the issues, as they have been working with this system for many years.  What arrangements or firm commitments have been given to the Department and Irish Water that these people's jobs will be secure in the future?  I have been told that many of these people are concerned about the security of their jobs after 2018.  The commitment given to us in this respect was only for the short term.  Some of these people are young and have large commitments to meet.  It is vital that we get clarification from the Department and Irish Water on a firm commitment regarding the security of these people's jobs.<\/p><p>  I have a few questions for the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan.  Under the capital allocation programme, the Minister of State referred to funding for unfinished housing estates throughout the country, referring to those under NAMA and various others.  What amount of funding is available for this work for 2013?  Unfinished housing estates are a major issue throughout the country.  It is vital that adequate funding be available to ensure that most of these estates can be completed.  This would assist in reducing the number on the housing waiting lists.  I do not know the Minister of State's objective regarding the use of these houses.  I note there has been a reduction in the capital allocation programme to &euro;112 million in 2012 and that funding under the programme provides for acquisition programmes and a number of schemes which are to be started during 2013.  I believe there are adequate numbers of houses in many areas of the country to accommodate many people's housing needs.  Another major issue is retrofitting and improvement works on local authority houses.  Does the Minister of State have information on the carrying out of this work next year?  A complaint I have received on numerous occasions is that local authority houses are left for far too long from the time they are vacated until the next tenant takes up residence.  That happens because funding is not available for such work.  It is vital that this be addressed.  It would provide a saving in terms of generating work on the retrofitting of houses and it would ensure people get into their homes as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  What is the budget for regeneration programmes for 2013?  The Minster of State might indicate what areas will benefit from regeneration projects for next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300008#G01700","speaker":"1082"},{"type":"speech","time":1352818800,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I consider Irish Water to be a great opportunity for staff at local level because the idea is to bring more investment into the capital programmes for water and waste water services.

It is important to note the increased investment we are seeking from private sources to enhance the public capital programme, which people do not take into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300008#G01800","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1352818800,"counter":616,"content":"<p>Deputy McLoughlin asked me questions on three areas.  On the unfinished housing estates, &euro;5 million was allocated nationally this year in regard to public safety issues, and this has not all been drawn down yet.  I chair an ongoing committee on unfinished estates and we have required the local authorities to have site resolution plans for the estates in their various areas.  NAMA attends those meetings as well.  Some of the estates are under NAMA while others are not, and NAMA is carrying out the same kind of programmes as the local authorities.<\/p><p>  In terms of acquiring housing, we are also dealing with NAMA with regard to the acquisition of properties for social housing.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, and myself have met NAMA on a few occasions and we intend to meet it again before the end of the year in order to speed up the process.  The Deputy may remember that it originally identified approximately 2,000 properties that would be suitable.  The latest figure I have is that 133 of those are over the line and about 400 more are under negotiation.  There was a time lag in terms of bringing those NAMA properties over the line because this process involved the original owners, the receivers and the lending institutions - there was a series of hoops to jump through.  NAMA has set up a special purpose vehicle which we hope will speed up this process and we hope to transfer them more quickly in the future.  The meetings we have had with NAMA have been productive in that regard.<\/p><p>  Programmes are available to local authorities to address the issue of housing voids in terms of energy efficiency and improvement works; these are targeted particularly at vacant dwellings.  The Deputy may be aware that local authorities have a sum of money available per house from our Department to improve the status of empty houses.  We want to work with the local authorities to bring any housing voids back into use because there is no point in having empty houses if we can use them for families who need to be housed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300008#G01900","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352819400,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  I thank the Minister and Minister of State for their overview which sets the scale of the challenge that faces them.  I have a couple of questions about the housing area.  The first point to which the Minister referred is that of the transfer of the rent allowance to local authorities.  Does the Minister agree that we have major problems in store unless local authorities have additional staff, albeit from their own resources, to work in the housing departments who are trained to deal with this activity?  We must accept that not all local authorities have given housing the priority it deserves in the past.  If they had, we would not have the scale of housing problems we have today.<\/p><p>  Reference was also made to RAS and long-term leasing as being the emergency initiative to deal with the growing waiting lists.  That is fair enough under the circumstances but what is the long-term vision on RAS and long-term leasing?  I am minded of what is happening now with shared ownership loans.  There was a time when we encouraged people to move away from the old annuity loans into shared ownership.  We now find that people at an advanced stage in local authority shared ownership loans are carrying a very substantial burden.  A small shift in the housing market will cause significant difficulties as far as RAS and long-term leasing is concerned.<\/p><p>  In regard to vacant dwellings, in recent years if one met people involved in local government they would tell one about the number of vacant units in their respective areas.  Only recently did I discover why that is happening.  I suggest that it is because of the improvement works programme because the houses have to be vacant for a period of six months before they can attract funding.  What is happening is that local authorities are leaving houses vacant for six months and they are falling into greater disrepair and they are then drawing money from the Department, which should be drawn the minute the vacancy arises.  Will the Minister revisit the issue?<\/p><p>  In terms of the scheme of works for the elderly and housing adaptation grants, there seems to be a fear in the Department that someone who is not entitled to them will get those grants.  They are of invaluable use to the elderly, disabled people and those who are vulnerable across the country.  If the Minister is worried about the grants, rather than cutting back on them would he consider doing something similar to what is being done in respect of the fair deal scheme, namely, registering a charge against the property for a period should the property be disposed of and should one be afraid of people profiteering?<\/p><p>  Approximately 25,000 units are managed or owned by the voluntary housing sector.  It is doing a good job but I do not believe it should be allowed to build empires.  People who live in the mainstream family, non-specialised housing units who have come off local authority waiting lists and have had houses provided for them that are 100% capital funded by the Department in the same way that local authorities have been funded should be able to buy their houses.  Will the Minister introduce a tenant purchase scheme for the voluntary sector and ring-fence the funding for the provision of other social housing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300009#H00200","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1352819400,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and Minister of State for their presentations.

Many homeowners affected by pyrite have been waiting for a considerable period and without success to date for a resolution.  The purchase of a home is likely to be the largest investment most people make in their lives.  One has a justifiable expectation that one's home will be a place of enjoyment for oneself and one's family for many years.  If serious problems arise, they should be dealt with promptly and efficiently by those considered responsible, be they materials suppliers, builders, developers, guarantee companies or insurance companies.  For homeowners affected by pyrite, living in their homes has not turned out to be the enjoyable experience they had hoped for.  In many cases, they rightly feel let down by those parties whom they believed would provide effective solutions in the event of problems.  Cognisant of the long period that many homeowners have been waiting for a solution and the lack of engagement by responsible parties in providing such solutions, I established the pyrite panel in September 2011, with the remit of exploring options for a solution to the problem of pyrite in private housing.  The comprehensive report that the panel submitted to me in late June 2012 contains 24 interrelated recommendations and provides me and the stakeholders with the framework for a resolution to the pyrite problem.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the excellent work undertaken by the pyrite panel on producing a carefully researched and balanced report, which I understand has been generally well received.  The recommendations fall into two broad categories, the first of which deals with current pyrite problems and the suggested immediate and comprehensive solutions.  The second aims to ensure that the risk of similar problems will be minimised.  A number of the recommendations in the report pointed to the need for constructive engagement by stakeholders in providing solutions for homeowners and to the important role of the State in driving this engagement.  The panel expressed its disappointment that stakeholders had not, up to that point, engaged with homeowners in seeking a resolution to the pyrite problem.  I agree with the view expressed by the panel that while the State is not responsible for the pyrite problem, it has a pivotal role in assisting and co-ordinating the provision of the necessary infrastructure that will provide the remediation of pyrite-damaged dwellings where no other option is available to homeowners.<\/p><p>  When I published the report in July, I indicated that my preferred approach to dealing with the problem was for the stakeholders to work with me in finding solutions for affected homeowners.  This included, in particular, sourcing the necessary funds to meet the cost of remediation works.  However, I also made it clear at the time, and have reiterated on a number of occasions, that in the absence of buy-in from the stakeholders, I would impose a solution along the lines recommended in the report in regard to the establishment of a resolution board funded by a mandatory levy on the construction-quarrying sector and the related insurance sector.<\/p><p>  Following the receipt of the pyrite report I met the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation, HomeBond, the Irish Banking Federation and the Irish insurance Federation in early July.  I outlined to them the key role I believe they should play in providing a resolution for homeowners.  I encouraged them to engage with one another with a view to developing a collective response and I set a deadline, the end of September, for the submission of their proposals.  All the stakeholders came back to me by the deadline with individual responses.  While all of them outlined, in varying levels of detail, how they envisaged the pirate problem being resolved and, in some cases, how they might participate in a resolution process, they did not submit any definitive proposals at the time that individually or collectively would see stakeholders providing a voluntary solution for homeowners.  While I was disappointed that the responses were not more positive, there were nevertheless some positive elements in the detailed responses.  The offer to participation actively and engage in any structure that might be established to make progress on the pyrite issue was welcome.  Conscious of the time for which homeowners have been awaiting a solution to the pirate problem, I asked my Department to finalise arrangements and terms of reference to permit the establishment of the proposed resolution board, as recommended by the pyrite panel.  My preference is that all of the main stakeholders should engage with the proposed resolution board.<\/p><p>  Building on the positive elements of the stakeholders' earlier responses and other positive soundings received, I again wrote to the organisations, on 31 October, enclosing the terms of reference for the proposed resolution board.  I asked them to give further urgent consideration to their positions and to respond not later than 9 November.  I have received responses from all the stakeholders.  In addition, the Department met a number of the organisations over the past two weeks and further meetings are scheduled for this week.  This continuing engagement is worthwhile and I would not continue with it if I believed otherwise.  Everyone is now engaged for the first time with my officials with a view to achieving an agreed solution.  However, if the discussions fail or prove unsuccessful in the coming days, I will proceed immediately to seek the permission of the Government to impose the levy.  I intend that final decisions in regard to the proposed resolution board and its funding be made in the coming days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300011#K02800","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352821200,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I welcome, from the Department, Mr. Aidan O'Connor and Ms Marion Kiernan.

We received a highly positive response and indication from the financial institutions as late as today, which leads me to believe there is now a window of opportunity - if the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation, HomeBond and the insurance sector will avail of it - to deal with this problem which, through no fault of the homeowners, has been caused by the building sector.  It is up to the latter to make sure they are in a position to meet the requirements for remediation of these houses.  I would prefer a voluntary solution because I can set it up much more quickly through the pyrite resolution board, but if we must go down the road of forcing people to pay the necessary levy, we will do so.

What will the Minister do with that information to protect the consumer in the future?

Will there be some sort of cross-sectoral linkage between the third level sector and, for example, the National Consumer Agency to ascertain where they could fill the gaps to ensure something like this never happens again?<\/p><p>  My other question relates to the Buildings Regulation Advisory Board.  When the board was before the committee recently, we were most concerned to discover that HomeBond held a position on it.

It is not acceptable that those who took money from consumers on the basis of a structural guarantee did not discharge their responsibilities, which is what HomeBond and Premier did.  They were set up by the Construction Industry Federation to provide certainty to consumers about structural matters and they let everybody down in that regard.  Professionals let people down.  Unfortunately, those who were affected were the consumers.  I am very much in the space of helping consumers to overcome the difficulties which were created through no fault of their own.

I thank the Chairman for giving me an opportunity to discuss the pre-budget position for my Department in 2013 with the joint committee.  He is aware that engagement with the committee and the opening up of the Estimates and budgetary process to wider public and parliamentary scrutiny are important elements of the reform agenda and the programme for Government.  Members of the committee will be aware that the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht oversees and has policy responsibility for the conservation, preservation, protection, development and presentation of Ireland's heritage and culture.  The Department seeks to promote the Irish language, support the Gaeltacht and assist the sustainable development of island communities.  A gross provision of almost &euro;269 million was provided to the Department for this purpose in 2012, with a further &euro;8.6 million allocated to the Vote of the National Gallery.<\/p><p>  As Members will appreciate, a consequence of the significant fiscal deficit facing the country is that sufficient resources have not been available in recent years to fund all the services we would like to provide.  The 2013 allocations will reflect this position once more.  In the present economic circumstances, unfortunately we have no choice other than to accept the reality that any failure to meet public expenditure targets at this time would have much more serious implications in the years ahead.  It would affect our continued ability to maintain, promote and protect Ireland's heritage and culture, develop cultural tourism, advance the use of the Irish language and support the sustainable development of the islands.  I hope the material my officials have provided to the committee will assist today's discussions.  I propose to provide some further detail in respect of the comprehensive review of expenditure indicative allocations and the key areas of expenditure under my direct responsibility.  I will give the committee a broad update on the issue of public sector reform and on the amalgamations and mergers process as they relate to the Department.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, will speak about the relevant aspects of the Gaeltacht, Irish language and islands programmes.<\/p><p>  As part of the comprehensive review of expenditure and the parallel capital review process, which involved a thorough and detailed evaluation of each area of spending under my remit, a number of options for expenditure reductions were identified in line with the guidance of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  These reviews set an indicative expenditure ceiling of &euro;276 million - current expenditure of &euro;232 million and capital expenditure of &euro;44 million - for my Vote group in 2012 and an indicative expenditure ceiling of &euro;256 million - current expenditure of &euro;218 million and capital expenditure of &euro;38 million - for the same group in 2013.  Members will be aware that my Vote group allocation of &euro;277 million in 2012 was in line with that indicative ceiling.  The additional &euro;1 million that was provided relates to delivery of the EU culture programme, which my Department leads.  With regard to current expenditure in 2013, an adjustment of some &euro;15 million on this year's allocation will be required to meet the indicative ceiling of &euro;218 million.  A further reduction of &euro;6 million on the capital expenditure side would be needed to meet the 2013 indicative ceiling of &euro;38 million.  If we are to achieve this level of reduction, an overall decrease of approximately 8% will need to be applied to each of my programme areas, including the National Gallery.  In light of the level of reductions across various programme areas in recent times, members will appreciate that this represents a very challenging scenario for my Department and for the National Gallery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300016#P00300","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352823900,"counter":757,"content":"<p>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an deis teacht i l&aacute;thair an chomhchoiste inniu chun pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar sheasamh r&eacute;amh-ch&aacute;inaisn&eacute;ise mo Roinne don bhliain 2013 sna r&eacute;ims&iacute; Gaeilge, Gaeltachta agus oile&aacute;n.

To paraphrase Martin Luther King, that help enables us not only to dream but also to realise a major part of the dream.<\/p><p>  It is widely acknowledged that culture is an important ingredient of national morale, but sometimes its economic aspect in national development is understated.  The fact that 73,000 jobs are dependent on cultural tourism is significant.  In its 2009 survey F&aacute;ilte Ireland identified that &euro;1.9 billion was generated by the cultural and heritage aspects of tourism.  It is estimated that there will be growth of 15% per annum worldwide in cultural tourism.  If this figure was related to any other industry in the current recessionary times, it would be a huge cause for celebration.  In that context, we must be careful to know which goose is laying the golden egg.  Can we take it that this aspect of the generation of funding will be kept in mind when funds are being dispensed and policy is being formulated?<\/p><p>  Connected with this issue is the EU Presidency.  Is it envisaged that events will not be confined to Dublin city?  Will entourages and related activities be widely dispersed?  I could issue straightaway an invitation to visit the Rock of Cashel and Br&uacute; Bor&uacute; if the Minister was going in that direction.  Because of the importance worldwide of cultural tourism, we will benefit, but we must share the publicity.  In the case of the Eurovision Song Contest, for example, other aspects of Irish life were shown.  I hope this will be a priority in planning and that we will ensure those who come to Ireland will get to see the whole island.<\/p><p>  The Minister has invited us to bring forward our ideas on how to generate finance.  I have one suggestion at which he might look.  If a person deposits surplus cash in the bank, at most he or she will receive interest at a rate of 1%, on which DIRT is payable.  There is a message to be learned from how charities can claim back tax on donations.  The Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht could devise a scheme under which those who deposit money with an arts organisation would receive interest on the sum deposited tax free.  This should apply to both capital and current funding.  If a person borrows money from a bank, he or she will pay at a rate of 4% or 5%.  This might sound like an unusual idea and while it is not radical because the concession for charities is already provided for, it would be novel because the opportunities to raise money are fewer and there are huge sums on deposit - up to &euro;70 billion.  There must be a way to release some of these funds from the banks into the business sector by offering some carrot to do so.  It should not be beyond the bounds of possibility.  I ask the Minister, even if it is outside his remit, to consider it with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012111300025#Y00200","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1352828700,"counter":832,"content":"<p>The biggest test of the potential of cultural tourism will be provided by The Gathering next year.  Across the country communities in villages and towns are gearing up by organising different festivals that will all be based on culture.  The test of our cultural product is whether we can attract more visitors.  Many people will come for family or school reunions or for other reasons, but the cultural product available is different from what was available 30 years ago.  The Senator will agree that the standard has improved because of work done by his organisation and the different schools of music, from primary to third level.  There is a major movement.  I was in the Senator's parish some time ago when I was very impressed by a young harper.  It is now cool to play Irish music and there has been a great revival in the playing of the harp.  We will put this to the test next year in seeing how many will come during The Gathering and if we can gain an extra 350,000 tourists.  That will be a challenge, but we do have a great cultural offering.<\/p><p>  As regards funding, I encourage people to look to the Leader programme under which there is more of a fund for heritage projects than in my Department.  It provides vital funds, as does the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport through F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  It offers product development funds for important cultural projects across the country.

We are doing preliminary work on that at the moment.  Local aspects of the matter are being considered.  Obviously, we would love to engage with the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association.  As members of the committee will be aware, the association left the Peatlands Council last year.  It is important for the association to come back into the council.  When Deputy Luke Flanagan and others tabled a motion in the D&aacute;il calling for a national plan on raised bogs, I accepted the motion and took the substance of what was called for in the motion to the Commissioner in Europe.  The Commissioner accepted that.  The motion called for a plan to be drawn up for the 53 raised bogs in special areas of conservation and for an accommodation to be found in the cases of a small number of bogs where there are no relocation possibilities.  That is exactly what this plan will be pursuing.  It will be in the spirit of what was accepted by the Commissioner last year.  That is exactly what was proposed in the D&aacute;il at that time.  It is there.  The motion is there.  I accepted that motion.  I took the spirit of that motion to Europe and it was accepted by the Commissioner.

The Peatlands Council is examining the matter at present.  The difference between special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas is that special areas of conservation are designated by Europe whereas natural heritage areas are designated under national law.  Obviously, we have some flexibility with regard to natural heritage areas.  In the programme for Government, we promised to review natural heritage areas and examine different approaches.

I have already raised the issue of macro-economic conditionality of Structural Funds with the T&aacute;naiste or the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Creighton.  I am disappointed that the matter is still being discussed.  It is a dangerous concept.  It is unfair that good social projects in, for example, disadvantaged areas along the Border or in a Border county, could see funding or workers' pay suspended due to the wider economic problems here.  I know that the EU Parliament and the Government oppose conditionality.  How does the Government propose to work with others to remove conditionality?<\/p><p>  There seems to have been little progress made on our own resources and there has not been agreement so far.  The Commission, with the support of enough countries, seems intent to push ahead with the financial transaction tax.  Does the T&aacute;naiste foresee a situation where the contribution of one state is calculated using one method, such as the financial transaction tax, while another country, like Ireland, outside of the financial transaction tax, will have its contribution based on the current VAT model?  What is the preferred method of own resources or contribution calculation for Ireland?<\/p><p>  I probably sound like a broken record because I have talked so much about youth unemployment and the Irish Presidency at meetings of the committee.  What about funding, part funding or a youth guarantee?  The Minister for Social Protection has said that she will advance the matter during the Irish Presidency.  Where does the T&aacute;naiste think funding will be found?  Figures sourced from the International Labour Organization show that the amount of Ireland's entire ESF money would need to be used to deal with youth employment.  Other member states have linked the issue to a financial transaction tax that Ireland would not be part of.  Does the T&aacute;naiste see a youth guarantee working on an EU scale?  Where will the funding be found?  Has thought been given to creating a specific funding instrument?  In broader terms, beyond following the Commission's plan in December, will the Government prioritise the fight against youth unemployment during its Presidency? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012111300004#C00900","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1352821200,"counter":861,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Leyden and Reilly for their congratulations on Ireland's election to the UN Human Rights Council.

There are large gaps in views between member states.  Some states have expressed a clear determination to drive down the size of the budget while other states, like ourselves, have argued that we need to have a European budget that is fit for purpose.  In particular, we need a European budget that delivers on the objectives that the European Union has, particularly the implementation of the compact on jobs and growth.  Clearly included in that matter is youth employment which is high in this country and in other European Union countries.  The current level of youth unemployment is simply unsustainable for the European Union.  We need a European Union budget that is capable of addressing the problem.  A youth guarantee is one measure that we intend to pursue during the course of our Presidency.

Picking up on some of the themes raised in his address, the T&aacute;naiste touched on discussions taking place on the future shape of the European monetary and banking union.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to comment on the current situation of Greece, and reaffirm that it is in Ireland's and Europe's interests to ensure Greece continues to be a member of the eurozone and that it is facilitated in dealing with its major difficulties.  Some of the discussion that took place a year ago, regarding the idea of Greece leaving the eurozone, was misguided and dangerous.  It is essential we find a way of facilitating Greece and allowing it to work through its difficulties while continuing to be a member of the eurozone.  That should be made clear.<\/p><p>  My second question concerns the situation in the United Kingdom, which the T&aacute;naiste touched upon in terms of the discussions taking place on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF.  There is an increasingly strong stance coming from some members of the British political system with regard to a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union and its participation or non-participation in a banking union.  We have been successful at riding two horses at the same time, maintaining a close relationship with Britain and deepening political integration with the European Union.  The strong statements coming out of the British system are challenging continued deep participation in the European Union.  I would appreciate the T&aacute;naiste's views on where that stands and the choices it may present to Ireland in the future.  In support of a point made by the T&aacute;naiste with regard to the MFF and the sub-heading of global hunger, having seen the way the money is spent when I visited Malawi, it is of great importance that Ireland supports the value of the sub-heading and ensures the European Union's role in maintaining an increase in nutrition and in fighting global hunger is not affected as a result of these negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012111300005#D00200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1352821800,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I join the previous speakers in thanking the T&aacute;naiste for attending the meeting.

Is the T&aacute;naiste optimistic that we will get the kind of funding and direct initiatives, on a Europe-wide basis and specifically here, to enhance our ability to deal with youth unemployment?  It is dealt with on two levels, at the level of reskilling and retraining and at the level of job creation.  The latter is slightly difficult, as it must come from a number of fronts, including the private sector.  There must be a direct involvement in creating jobs.  Does the T&aacute;naiste think we will get product?  Over the course of the Presidency, will there be an initiative of some substance in that area?  We are all with the T&aacute;naiste in identifying it as the greatest priority for our country and our Presidency going into the General Affairs Council meeting.<\/p><p>  I am happy to know that work has been agreed and is continuing on effective governance in the financial sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012111300005#D00300","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352822400,"counter":866,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and reiterate the congratulations expressed by others.  I had three questions but two of them have been touched on.  I reiterate Deputy Paschal Donohoe's concerns regarding the budget being used by certain member states to whip up an anti-EU feeling.  Deputy Joe O'Reilly commented on the CAP budget, but the T&aacute;naiste has stated some member states have called for significant cuts to agricultural and cohesion funding.  I wonder whether they recognise the role the Common Agricultural Policy plays in guaranteeing food security, protecting rural communities and preventing Europe moving towards a system of factory farming, which would be more likely to happen in the absence of a strong Common Agricultural Policy.<\/p><p>  On the Social and Cohesion Funds, the trend in recent years has been to support initiatives in regions as opposed to individual member states.  Obviously, there is a cross-Border role, but is the T&aacute;naiste concerned about what that trend would mean for us in the future, including the west and Galway, in particular?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012111300006#E00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1352822400,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I will comment on the point made by Deputy Paschal Donohoe on Greece.  Difficult discussions are under way aimed at helping Greece to return to the path of sustainability.  It is fair to say one year ago there was much public and political discussion about whether Greece would leave the eurozone.  That is not on the agenda and is not being raised as a serious prospect.  It is important to recognise that progress has been made and that it is clear that Greece intends to stay in the eurozone and that the European Union as a whole and the eurozone wants Greece to stay in it.  It will work with Greece to ensure that happens.  It is also interesting to note the discussion which has taken place in the past couple of days on whether it will take eight or ten years for Greece to work through its difficulties.  Not so very long ago there were voices in this House stating we should do what Greece was doing.  We now see the wisdom of not having doing so.  We are looking at a situation where it could be eight to ten years for Greece to work through its difficulties.  We are talking about exiting our programme next year.  The most recent discussions with the troika were in that space.  It is very important that there is solidarity with Greece.  The European Union is about solidarity and members states showing their support for others.  That will be part of the discussion.  I am glad, therefore, that the speculation about Greece exiting the currency has come to an end, as that will probably help to ensure stability.<\/p><p>  Ireland and Britain, our nearest neighbour, joined what was then the EEC at the same time.  Britain has always been a very important partner for Ireland in the European Union.  We have very often found ourselves on the same side of discussions and arguments.  As a consequence, we have a very special relationship.  There is a certain degree of debate in Britain about its future in the European Union.  It is very much in our interests that it remain a fully engaged member of the Union.  In bilateral discussions we have with it, we express the hope it will continue as a member.  The European Union is very important for the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom is a very important member of the European Union.<\/p><p>  We are anxious to ensure the provisions in respect of hunger will be maintained.  We have our own development body.  Development aid policy is very much focused on hunger and nutrition.  We were a leader in what has become known as the SUN - Scaling Up of Nutrition - movement.  We want to see these funds maintained in the budget.<\/p><p>  On the issue raised by Deputy Joe Reilly on youth unemployment, the sequence is that we expect there will be a package of measures which we hope will include proposals in respect of the youth guarantee and youth training to come from the European Commission in December.  The discussion on the funding of these proposals will follow and we will continue to press for an adequate weighting in the Cohesion Fund allocations for unemployment, particulary youth unemployment, measures.<\/p><p>  On the Common Agricultural Policy, we are very conscious that 85% of the funding allocated to Ireland through the European Union comes through the Common Agricultural Policy.  Clearly, it is a major financial priority for us to ensure we secure the right outcome.  We are working closely with other member states with an interest in the Common Agricultural Policy to ensure we secure the best outcome in the negotiations, including maximising the flexibility under Pillar 1 in respect of direct payments.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, who mentioned the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy in respect of food security and rural communities, would strongly agree with this.  Since we have placed a very strong emphasis on the European Union budget, its objective to address job creation and growth, the food sector is of significant importance in that context.  As we have seen in the past couple of years, growth in food and agricultural production in terms of its potential for economic development and job creation is of major importance.  It is not a case of either-or.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012111300006#E00300","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352823000,"counter":869,"content":"<p>I apologise.

More developed regions need to continue to be able to access cohesion funding, particularly to tackle issues like unemployment and disadvantage.

It is great that he is here in advance of next week's meeting of the General Affairs Council.  I will begin by speaking about youth unemployment.  We learned today that this country has a youth unemployment rate of 34%.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that the equivalent figures for Greece and Spain are approaching 50%.  The Seanad was honoured last week to be addressed by Professor Pissarides, who is a Nobel economics laureate, on the subject of youth unemployment in a recession.  I was struck by some of his wise words in the context of the decisions we have to make, the opportunity we will have when we assume the Presidency of the EU and the funding commitments we have to make.  He was cautious about the youth guarantee because he felt it was expensive.  As far as I know - I might be wrong in this regard - countries like Finland and Sweden which are taking this approach are investing approximately 5% of GDP in this area.  Professor Pissarides said that he feels that a four-month timeframe for employment or training is too short, given the scale of the problem.  Ireland has a long-term unemployment problem at this stage.  I would like to hear the T&aacute;naiste's comments on that.  Is he open to taking this approach on board?  Can he see a way of influencing Europe in this regard?<\/p><p>  It is interesting that Professor Pissarides believes we have a massive opportunity to persuade the powers that be in the troika to split the budget between investment spending and recurrent spending on things like public service and Civil Service salaries.  He feels that a component of the budget should be dedicated to investment spending in certain areas.  For example, this week we welcomed the European Investment Bank's decision to provide &euro;50 million in funding towards public private partnerships on school projects.  He pointed to all the evidence in the IMF research of the multiplier benefit of public investment programmes, job creation projects and education and training.  The Government has committed to some job creation projects, particularly in the green economy.  I would like to hear the T&aacute;naiste's thoughts on the decisions we need to make.  As Deputy O'Reilly just said, youth unemployment is the greatest crisis of our time.  It is a scourge that leaves a mark and a scar on people for a very long time.  I would like to hear the T&aacute;naiste's views on how he expects to influence what is done in this area.  We have to be careful not to take the youth guarantee on board without being sure it is the best thing for Ireland and for Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012111300007#F00500","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1352823000,"counter":872,"content":"<p>I compliment the T&aacute;naiste on his success in securing a position for Ireland on the UN Human Rights Council.  I congratulate him and his Government colleagues on the tremendous effort they are putting into the whole European project at present.  I refer particularly to the position they are pursuing in the context of Ireland's need for a healthy budget.  The disparate views that emerge within the EU lead me to despair from time to time.  Some of the member states in question are in the eurozone and others are not.  If those disparate views are ultimately to be accommodated, we will end up with a mishmash of views, opinions and policies that will achieve neither one thing nor the other.<\/p><p>  The Chairman and I recently attended a meeting in Brussels that was addressed by Mr. Barroso.  He must have repeated the word \"solidarity\" at least ten times in the course of his speech.  If there is one element that is lacking in every issue that affects Europe at present, it is solidarity.  I think the T&aacute;naiste will agree with that.  Everything he and his colleagues try to do seems to be frustrated after a few days when somebody makes an offhand remark that creates ripples in the pond and is not of a cohesive nature.  I would like to draw particular attention to the budget in this regard.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the Greek example.  It should have been obvious to our betters in the European scene two or three years ago that it was not possible for Greece to emerge from the extent of the burden it was facing in the time allotted at that stage, especially in light of the nature of the Greek economy.  It was obvious to many people that it was not possible.  Would it not have been better to recognise at that stage that the system needed to be changed and made a little easier for those who were having difficulty?<\/p><p>  The last point I want to make is that we do not seem to be progressing in the same direction.  Everyone in Europe does not seem to be facing in the same direction.  There are those who want less of Europe and those who want more of Europe.  There are those who want integration and those who want out.  We cannot make progress in such circumstances.  If one state of the United States sought to secede from the union - I do not foresee that happening - I do not think the union could continue to be cohesive.  It does not work that way.  It is a question of unity of purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012111300007#F00600","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1352823000,"counter":873,"content":"<p>I warmly welcome the T&aacute;naiste and the departmental officials.

Like many Members of the Oireachtas, I find the news coming from Uganda particularly odious.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that the Speaker of the Ugandan Parliament has said that the Parliament intends before Christmas to pass anti-homosexual laws that would impose the death penalty on homosexual people.  As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, homosexuals in many African countries - particularly Uganda - suffer from severe discrimination and persecution.  The proposed legislation in Uganda would represent a serious escalation and persecution of vulnerable people in those societies.  I suggest that pressure is required from the international community, particularly from Ireland and the rest of the EU, to prevent this Bill from passing in Uganda.  I would like to ask the T&aacute;naiste if he intends to raise this matter at the EU or with our European partners.  He is aware that the Governments of the United Kingdom and Sweden have said they intend to cut off aid from Uganda if this legislation is passed.  This seems to be a reasonable proposal that would apply maximum pressure on the Ugandan Government.  It is simply perverse for Ireland and other EU countries to supply aid to a country that is guilty of gross human rights breaches.  Is the T&aacute;naiste in a position to describe how he plans to approach the matter at EU level?  Does the Government have any plans to suspend Irish aid to Uganda if this legislation is not withdrawn?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2012111300007#F00700","speaker":"1043"},{"type":"speech","time":1352823000,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I wish the T&aacute;naiste well in these negotiations.

I reiterate that there is no issue which is more urgent for Europe and ourselves than the issue of youth unemployment.  The level of unemployment here at 14.8% is too high and we must get it down.  That is the reason the singular focus of Government is towards growing the economy and the creation of jobs.  There is a particular problem of youth unemployment which we share right across the European Union, about which there must be an urgency to address.  This is not an issue on which we can afford to spend an inordinate amount of time holding seminars and hearings, undoubtedly worthy of comment, on what is the best way to deal with it.  There is an urgency about dealing with it.  I do not think there is a single silver bullet approach that will deal with it.  We have to deal with it at a number of levels.  The compact for jobs and growth agreed by the European Council in June is part of addressing the issue.  The &euro;120 billion committed to the compact, completion of the Single Market, the completion of trade agreements with countries outside the European Union, such as the US, Japan and Canada, all have enormous potential for growth in the EU economy as well as the measures we are taking to promote employment by attracting inward investment.<\/p><p>  The Commission will present the youth transition proposals in December.  I expect the youth guarantee scheme will form part of the proposal and it is an issue we want to pursue during the course of the Irish Presidency.  These measures are specifically geared to addressing youth unemployment.  I am not sure I would agree with Professor Pissarides in his view that one can make a distinction between recurrent spending and investment spending in this context, particularly in the area of youth unemployment, much of which is around issues of apprenticeship, training and further education.

Many members have witnessed this during their visits to a number of programme countries, particularly our recent visit to Sierra Leone.  That we are able to continue to fund the delivery of high-quality aid programmes in the midst of the most difficult economic crisis ever experienced by Ireland is a testament to the Irish Aid success story.  Most Irish people appreciate the significant work being done by Irish Aid and the non-governmental organisations, NGOs.<\/p><p>  However, it has always been of the utmost importance that money provided by the Irish taxpayer for development assistance reaches the people for whom it is intended.

My organisation has appreciated their support for many years of the programme.  Without that support we would not have the programme.<\/p><p>  I shall start by expressing my deepest concern about the misappropriation of Irish Aid funds in Uganda.  I have watched the development of Uganda, from the mid-1980s when it was regarded as a failed state after a generation of brutal dictatorial rule and civil strife, into a stable, relatively peaceful, modern but far from perfect democracy of recent years.  Most of us will remember the depredations of Idi Amin and Milton Obote.<\/p><p>  I am committed to the aid programme in Uganda having served there as head of mission for two years from 1998 to 2000.  The recovery and transformation of Uganda has been made possible through the efforts of the Ugandan people, together with international donors, including a significant contribution made by Ireland.  As Members will be aware, a special investigation was carried out by the Auditor General of Uganda which discovered the misappropriation of &euro;4 million of Irish Aid funds that had been provided by Ireland specifically for northern Uganda.  As the Chairman said, our response was immediate and decisive. The T&aacute;naiste suspended all Irish assistance, totalling &euro;16 million, that was due to be channelled through the Government of Uganda in 2012.  He demanded the return of the &euro;4 million misappropriated and announced an immediate investigation into the findings of the Auditor General.  A team from the evaluation and audit unit of the Department travelled to Uganda within days and they will report to the T&aacute;naiste shortly.  He has indicated that he will release the report and he is committed to implementing any recommendations contained in the report.<\/p><p>  The report of the auditor general into the handling of aid funds by the Office of the Prime Minister found that there was significant financial mismanagement of the Peace Recovery and Development Plan for northern Uganda.  The PRDP had been established to rebuild infrastructure in the region after decades of conflict and the ravages of Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army.  The Auditor General found that an elaborate and sophisticated fraud had been perpetrated involving a high level of collusion that would have been difficult for any normal audit systems to uncover.  The Auditor General's special investigation found that over &euro;12 million received from Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark, of which the Irish Aid component is &euro;4 million, had been diverted into unauthorised accounts controlled by the Office of the Prime Minister of Uganda and a significant proportion of these funds were unaccounted for.<\/p><p>  I travelled to Kampala and, together with our ambassador in Kampala, met the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance and Economic Development of Uganda.  I made it clear to the Ugandan authorities that the T&aacute;naiste and the Irish Government regarded it as absolutely intolerable that development assistance, given by the people of Ireland, should be misappropriated or diverted.  I reiterated the T&aacute;naiste's clear statement that Irish funding had to be repaid as a matter of urgency.  I emphasised that all necessary actions should be taken to pursue those guilty of the crime and that the control weaknesses identified in the report of the Auditor General be corrected.<\/p><p>  The Ugandan Government has since confirmed in writing that: all Irish Aid funds that have been misappropriated will be reimbursed; that the officials against whom financial impropriety has been established will be prosecuted; and that strong measures will be undertaken to tighten their internal controls.  The T&aacute;naiste has welcomed the commitment and our ambassador in Kampala will work closely with the Ugandan authorities to ensure that these actions are followed through. However, the suspension of &euro;16 million of funding due to be channelled through the Government of Uganda remains in place as we closely examine our options for engagement with Uganda in the future.<\/p><p>  Ireland's aid programme is strongly focused on the poorest people and communities in sub-Saharan Africa.  The Government will not provide financial support under our development co-operation programme unless it is clear that Irish money is being spent for the purpose for which it was allocated.  Funding programmes through Government systems is an important tool in achieving strong development outcomes and empowering national Governments to deliver and take ownership of the provision of services.  This is essential if the improvements that we put in place are to be sustainable in the long term but it can only take place when such systems are accountable, transparent and effective.<\/p><p>  In the case of Uganda, the independence and strength of the Auditor General are a clear sign of Ugandan Government accountability systems working well and the importance of assisting in this work.  Ireland has provided technical and financial support to his office for a number of years in order to build the skills and capacity required for the conduct of complex investigations.  The Auditor General also visited Ireland in 2001 to learn about our systems of accountability.  Ireland's support of the Auditor General was strengthened after the previous Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs met the Auditor General during its visit to Uganda in 2008 and it endorsed his work.  <\/p><p>  The findings of the Auditor General in this case are deeply disturbing and affect the excellent reputation of the aid programme.  However, the fact that the Auditor General is now in a position to make them is a demonstration of the increased capacity and the determination of progressive and forceful elements within the Ugandan Administration to enforce accountability in the use of Government and donor money.  It is only by building national accountable systems that corruption can be fought and eliminated.  If we are in a position to resume development assistance to Uganda further assistance to strengthen the Auditor General's office must be an essential component.<\/p><p>  Our aid programme in Ugandan is regularly examined and evaluated in order to ensure that we achieve effectiveness and value for money.  It is done in a number of complementary ways: through auditors based in our embassy in Kampala; through the evaluation and audit team at headquarters; through international accountancy firms which we commission to carry out audits; through the national audit offices of our partner governments; and through the Department's audit committee that provides an independent appraisal of Irish Aid's audit and evaluation, meets the Comptroller and Auditor General and publishes an annual report on its work.  We have invested heavily in our financial tracking systems and there is real time access to all of our financial transactions that allows us to have rigorous control and oversight of what moneys are spent in the field.  It is clear that, notwithstanding all of the checks and balances, funding programmes through government systems in more volatile regions of the world can be challenging, as we can see in this case.  We are committed to ensuring that we learn from what has occurred in Uganda and strengthen our systems of risk identification and management, as well as monitoring and audit, in order to minimise the potential for the misuse of funds in the future.  In this regard we will look closely at the conclusions and recommendations contained in the evaluation and audit team's report that will be presented to the T&aacute;naiste shortly.<\/p><p>  Ireland has had a bilateral aid programme with Uganda since 1994.  The programme is focused on reducing poverty among some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged communities in the country.  Our aid programme in Uganda is designed to reduce the incidence of HIV and AIDS; to build schools and provide education for poor children; to reduce the incidence of gender based violence; to improve government accountability; to promote protect human rights; to help develop the capacity of the private sector to provide jobs and economic opportunities for Ugandans; and, in particular, to provide support for Karamoja which is one of the poorest and most marginalised regions of the country.  <\/p><p>  Since commencing our work in Uganda, we have witnessed significant improvements in the quality of life for the Ugandan people. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111300003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Rogers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352806800,"counter":900,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Rogers for his contribution.

The sum of &euro;4 million represented phase 2; the first phase involved &euro;3.2 million, which went where it was supposed to go.  We are one of the only donors to have placed an office in Karamoja to examine the infrastructure that has been built on the ground.  Our team in Kampala travels regularly to Karamoja, which is an inhospitable spot.  Two or three years ago, one could travel in northern Uganda only with flak jackets and armoured personnel carriers.  Now, one can walk around the area and life is coming back to the 55 districts.  Northern Uganda is approximately the size of Ireland and was essentially a wasteland.  Slowly but surely, we are seeing life, infrastructure and hope return to the area.  Our funding and the funding of the Government has been making a difference.  There is a lag between putting money in at the top and seeing what is happening on the ground.  I assure members there has been an enormous change.  When the members of the committee come to visit, they will see what is happening on the ground.<\/p><p>  Should we have found out about this matter ourselves?  We would have found it out eventually.  When we looked back at where money was spent on the ground - when we looked at the government budget and our budget - we would have seen that the funds did not reach the area.  There was a gap.  However, at the top, the key organisation and institution of the Ugandan Government with responsibility for examining government systems is the auditor general, who has a team of 400 people working with him.  They are highly trained and highly competent.  Their capacity has been built up from the money provided by Ireland and other donors.  The office of the auditor general has enormous capacity and special investigative powers.  Its staff were able to go in at the top - into the office of the Prime Minister - to examine what was happening, and saw very quickly what was happening.  They identified a sophisticated collusion among a number of people in different Ugandan Government departments.  One could not have anticipated it.<\/p><p>  We will have to examine our risk profiles.  In the past, we looked at risk in districts, further down the line, with procurement and capacity issues.  Risk was determined in respect of whether the money would reach the ground.  Many of the donors working together had looked at the systems and said that, in general, they were fit for purpose.  A joint assistance framework is a very sophisticated system, with donors and the government looking at the overall public financial management system.  In general, they said the systems were reasonably fit for purpose.  The risk for us was at the bottom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111300004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Rogers"},{"type":"speech","time":1352806800,"counter":902,"content":"<p>Had all of the consultants and audit teams been in northern Uganda?

We must put our hands up.  Money has disappeared so there is room for improvement.  We must embrace the recommendations.  We will do that.<\/p><p>  On the question of expenditure profiles, we carry out very detailed expenditure profiles on the money that leaves the system to go to the NGOs, government or other international organisations.  Northern Uganda is remote, and Karamoja is one of the 55 districts which are inhospitable remote places.  They are only coming back to life.  There are very detailed district plans which have been budgeted for and the additional funds from the PRDP programme are measured.  The money was coming down and was being measured.  Clearly, Ugandan Government money was coming down into the system.  The gap in the donor funds had not been reached yet.  I examined some of these profiles in the past couple of months and what was quite clear was that the amounts of money going into the districts had dipped.  It was way below what it should have been, which now would be a red flag matter.  We would then work back into the system again.<\/p><p>  The Ugandan financial system has been evaluated as being reasonably robust by the World Bank, the IMF and FID.  The British carried out a fiduciary risk assessment and we use these assessments all the time because they are highly technical and have been done by experts.  Our view is that on balance the risk is reasonable.  What happened with these funds is that they did not go into the system.  They went into a holding account, because we wanted to mingle them with the other donor funds and collusion at a very high level was required to go into the system and extract those funds before they went into the Treasury.

We work with and support the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, and other groups working in this area.<\/p><p>  The role of the Ugandan Parliament is crucial.  As Mr. Rogers noted, this can be seen in the reaction in Uganda where this issue has caused uproar among parliamentarians, especially those who represent northern Uganda, the intended destination of the relevant funding.<\/p><p>  As part of the aid programme, for some years a group of donor countries has been providing support for what is known as the financial management and accountability programme, otherwise known by the acronym FINMAP.  Under the programme, the donors work with institutions of government to build up accountability.  Donors are providing $60 million in the current three year phase of the programme.  The &euro;1.3 million per annum Irish Aid has budgeted approximately for FINMAP is part of the money that has been suspended as it is aid that goes through government systems.  Within the overall programme there is strong support for the Ugandan Auditor General's office, for which funding of some $15 million over the three-year period has been provided by the donors.  In addition, well in excess of &euro;1 million has been provided for building oversight and scrutiny in Parliament.  This integral part of our programme, which works through the various systems, has been suspended.  As a result, our assistance to the Office of the Auditor General, the Ugandan Parliament and some other aspects of the programme have also been suspended because we must await the outcome of the report.<\/p><p>  Looking ahead to how Ireland engages with Uganda, the joint committee may wish to consider the nature of Irish Aid support to the country, what we support and how we support it and whether we should drop support to the Ugandan Parliament and Auditor General or find a way to support them while scrutinising the other ways in which we work.<br \/><b><\/b>A question was asked about funding to non-governmental organisations.  Outside our programme budget of &euro;32 million, we will provide approximately &euro;5.5 million directly through NGOs, most of which is through our programme funding for the major Irish non-governmental organisations.  For instance, we will provide &euro;1.8 million to GOAL and &euro;730,000 to Tr&oacute;caire in Uganda.  The scrutiny of this funding has been significantly strengthened as a result of the new results-based management system in place for funding NGOs.  Under this system, the non-governmental organisations must set out in advance their programmes and the results they wish to achieve using Irish Aid funding and against which they can be measured annually.  We have significantly strengthened management of NGO funding.<\/p><p>  In recent weeks, representatives of the non-governmental organisations have made clear to Irish Aid and Ministers that they do not seek to become the main channel for funding for Irish aid through Uganda.

That is laudable and may be important down the line.  Having returned from Sierra Leone, we know the government structures are weak and need strengthening.

It is a vast office which has grown far too quickly, and that is one of the reasons the auditor general wanted to have a look at it.  There is no evidence to the effect that it goes beyond the chief accountant.  That is the information we have.<\/p><p>  In fairness to the Government of Uganda, it has given the auditor general incredible investigative powers and has set him up independently.  When the committee visited Uganda in 2008, one of the issues he raised was that, as he had been placed in the ministry of finance, he was too near the government.  He has since moved out of government and into new buildings; his staffing has been increased and he has received money to pay for good staff.  The President, apparently, has given him these special powers.

Normally, a comptroller and auditor general takes a year to do this, and looks back on that year in his work.  The Ugandan year ends in July, and the auditor general's report was produced on 19 October, which was very fast.  That is an indication of his powers.  He has personal bodyguards with him but he is very secure.  He has a large programme, and he has the support of the public in Uganda.  What is happening is amazing; I have never seen that type of debate in Uganda before.  This is not a positive story, and I am not trying to put a positive gloss on it, but the positive part is that for the first time a country which was a failed state under Idi Amin and Milton Obote has a strong auditor general holding the government to account.

I have already sent a message out to all of our ambassadors and all of our heads of development informing them that in view of this I want them to interrogate their systems, check they are fit for purpose and examine what auditing and valuation are being done.  This message has gone out in the past few days.  Also, over the past 18 months, we have been working with all of our programme countries on carrying out a public financial management assessment.  As I mentioned earlier, we looked at what the World Bank, the IMF and DFID have done.  Now we want to look at ourselves and had been looking at our programme countries over the past 18 months.  About four weeks ago we had just got to Uganda to have a look at its systems.  We will now have to interrogate all of our systems.  We must put our hands up and look at them all again.  We are going to do that.<\/p><p>  I am hopeful and reasonably confident that we will not see anything like this elsewhere.  Nothing like this has happened to donors previously.  However, we must check.  We must be clear and transparent on this rather than be defensive on it.  We will do that.  With regard to the timescale for repayment.  I went out to Uganda as soon as we suspended our aid and spoke to the Ministers.  We have a written commitment - I do not think other donors have this yet - from the Government of Uganda that it will restore the money.  That is a sovereign agreement between two nations.  Of course Uganda has budgetary systems and parliamentary oversight.  It has yearly budgeting.  We will work with them to get that money back as soon as possible.  In the meantime, nothing moves.  Therefore, the timescale is as soon as possible.  However, we are reasonable on that.  We want to get the money back and want to use it for the purpose for which it was intended.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State will have to take the decisions on that.  We have the &euro;16 million.  We kept to our word and took that back and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State will decide what to do with it.<\/p><p>  The negative publicity is very dispiriting.  The people of Ireland have been incredibly generous.  They are incredibly generous during emergencies and were incredibly generous during the tsunami, when we had one of the highest rates of personal contributions in the world.  They were incredibly generous towards Haiti.  When we have polled people, they have been very supportive of the programme.  However, in the current environment, when they see &euro;4 million going missing and are aware of what the situation here at home, the reaction is of course negative.  We need to assure them of what is happening to their money.  Over the past few years there has been much more openness and transparency about the good work being done.  When Irish people are asked whether we should support that work, they say \"Yes\".  Of course they say misappropriation such as this is appalling, wrong and criminal and this affects their attitude negatively.  Therefore, we must all work together on this over the coming years.  That is why we are so angry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111300008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Rogers"},{"type":"speech","time":1352809200,"counter":930,"content":"<p>The biggest negative would be if Irish people lost confidence in Irish Aid and the work it is doing.

Some 8.3 million children are now in schools there and poverty has been halved.  These are the positive stories that emerge, on the back of this negative criminal act.  It will be good if the positive message goes out from here today.<\/p><p>  I believe people want us to do things differently in the future.  Mr. Rodgers spoke about investing heavily in financial tracking systems and real time access to all financial transactions, allowing vigorous control and oversight of where moneys are spent in the field.  Will he expand on that?  If he cannot do so today, will he get back to us with regard to the systems in place for this?  The fact the misappropriation was discovered by the Office of the Auditor General in Uganda and the fact this committee and the Department had a role in training and upskilling that Department is positive.  However, it also highlights the fact that many people working with Irish Aid and familiar with that area were not aware of what was happening.  It is important to broadcast the fact that these systems that work and support countries are being put in place.<\/p><p>  I do not understand what happened with regard to Denmark, Norway and Sweden.  What did they do differently?  What we did seems to have worked, but they have not received a written commitment with regard to their moneys.  I presume their reaction was similar to ours and that they are annoyed with what happened.  However, they seem to have taken a different approach.  Did Ireland discuss the issue with them before the misappropriation was made public?  What was the timescale with regard to this being discovered and it being made public?  Was there agreement between the countries involved with regard to taking a similar approach or did Ireland go and do its own thing?<\/p><p>  Yesterday, it was announced that Ugandan Government officials are planning to create stronger anti-homosexual laws and that they hope to pass a Bill before the end of 2012.  I presume the Department is aware of this.  Have concerns been raised with the Ugandan Government on this?  Will this impact negatively on Irish Aid's good governance work?

Mr. Gaffey mentioned earlier the support we provide to the Office of the Auditor General and the parliamentary oversight structures through the FINMAP programme.  That is critical to overseeing the support that we provide through government systems in Uganda.<\/p><p>  In terms of our own controls, when we initially look at a programme for a country like Uganda, we go through a complex and elaborate process to determine what type of programme is appropriate to that country and what types of oversight measures should be introduced.  That process takes almost a year.  We must work out the types of audit and evaluation system to put in place.  If we are working through government systems, we must determine what supports we should provide to make sure they have the capacity to oversee these programmes.  We have audit and evaluation systems in place.  We have our own independent audit committee in the Department, to which we report.  We have improved the capacity of our embassies with internal auditors and accountants who are charged with evaluating, auditing and overseeing the programmes on the ground.  We work with other donors too.  We have joint arrangements with donors through basket funds and we work with them to make sure the programmes are being managed properly on the ground.

It has asked to be given time, as has the auditor general, in order that it can assemble all the evidence.  For example, people have asked what the term \"interdicted\" means.  Interdicted means one loses ones job and one is on suspension with no pay.  The investigation team sought to do that when people were in their offices.  They believed that if the word got out, people would go off into the bush and they could not be contacted on their mobile telephones.  They are doing this in a clear and focused way, incrementally in order that they get all the evidence.  This is what we have been told.  Two people have been put in jail.<\/p><p>  While we wish to see prosecutions brought and people brought to justice, we are keen for it to be done in line with good judicial practice and with free and fair trials.  We have no wish to see a rush to judgment.  They have put it to us that they wish to do it carefully, clearly and ensure they have the evidence.  A total of 17 people have been named in the Auditor General's report.  The point about this fraud is that it occurred at a high level.  There were passwords and forged signatures involving three Government Departments.  It was difficult to detect but once it was detected, it was clear that all the tracks were apparent and all the signatures were there.  They have the 17 names and they know who did this.  I cannot understand how they thought they could get away with it.  They also stole Government of Uganda money as well.  Approximately &euro;5 million is gone from the Government of Uganda.  They were stealing their Government's money from the Office of the Prime Minister as well, as far as I know.  Several audits are under way.  As Mr. Gaffey said, the auditor general is carrying out comprehensive work across every Government Ministry, the Peace Recovery and Development Plan and the treasury.  This will take six months.  There will be a forensic investigation and perhaps things will come out in the wash about other donors as well.  There is no evidence at the moment with regard to the politicians.

We have moved somewhat away but other donors are heavily invested and this is dangerous for them because they are really a good deal more heavily invested that us.  We will be discussing this.  We will be discussing the matter with other donors in each of our programme countries and we will make our views clear.  We will be carrying out a risk analysis and re-examining the risk levels and making a judgment.  We will be doing that in every country.

The area is complex and requires legislation but we would be open to doing that if our relations get back on track.  They will not be back on track, however, until all of this is resolved and the money is back.  That is going to take a little time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111300011#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Rogers"},{"type":"speech","time":1352811000,"counter":954,"content":"<p>On a related matter, the audit committee of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade made some recommendations which the committee should follow up.  In June 2012, with regard to a recommendation to appoint a risk assessment officer, the chairman of the audit committee said:<blockquote><br \/>It is disappointing that the Department has not yet found itself in a position to implement two appointments recommended in the previous audit committee reports: designation of a chief risk officer with direct access to you and; the appointment of a professionally qualified head of finance.  The committee believes that both appointments would enhance the managerial capability of the Department.  I understand from my contacts with you that while this view is shared by the Department it has thus far been unable to progress them because of staffing limitations.     <br \/>I know what that is all about.  In light of recent developments, we should look at that recommendation and have a discussion with the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111300011#K00600","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1352811000,"counter":955,"content":"<p>Have you a final response, Mr. Rogers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111300011#K00700","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1352811000,"counter":956,"content":"<p>I know the matter mentioned by Deputy Durkan is being progressed positively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111300011#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Rogers"},{"type":"speech","time":1352811000,"counter":957,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Rodgers, for being open, frank and honest with the committee and I commend you for coming here as quickly as possible.  I also commend you on your quick response on this serious incident.  All politicians have heard concerns from our constituents about how Irish Aid money is being spent.  Whether we like it or not, some damage has been done to our aid programme, but I believe we can recover.  Irish Aid moved quickly with regard to the incident and a visit by a senior Ugandan politician to Ireland to apologise for what happened would be important.<\/p><p>  The committee will keep in touch with the Department with regard to what is happening.  We look forward to the publication of your initial investigation in the coming days.  We may see you again after Christmas.   This has been a constructive engagement and the committee will continue to monitor and progress the investigation.  It is important for us, in our oversight, that we keep in touch with the situation to ensure that this never happens again.  One can never say it will never happen again, but improved checks and balances must be put in place so that our aid programme can continue.  We have seen its positive effect in programme countries and we know the hard work being done on the ground.  This incident was unfortunate and has caused some damage.  I hope that damage will be repaired in the near future.<\/p><p>  I join with committee members in welcoming the appointment of our former colleague, Mr. Barry Andrews, as chief executive officer of Goal.  I propose that we write to him, congratulate him on his appointment and suggest that the committee meet him at some stage in the near future.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. <\/p><p>  I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the successful campaign to secure a seat for Ireland on the UN Human Rights Council.  A significant political and diplomatic effort went into getting this result.  I know the T&aacute;naiste and his officials will use this opportunity to promote a progressive vision for human rights.  I congratulate our ambassador in Geneva, His Excellency, Mr. Gerard Corr, and our ambassador at the United Nations, Her Excellency Ms Anne Anderson, who had an important role to play in ensuring that Ireland has a seat on the Human Rights Council.  The committee will write to the T&aacute;naiste and the Secretary General in this regard also.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  As there is no other business, the meeting will adjourn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012111300011#K00900","speaker":"974"}]
