I thank the committee for the opportunity to present to it the 2014 Estimate for the Department of Education and Skills.  I propose to make a short opening statement and I am happy to provide further detail, as required, as we work through the Estimate.  I also make the observation that we are having this debate in regard to expenditure for 2014 while still in the month of January 2014.  Last year, because of a different timetable we met in June to consider expenditure for 2013.<\/p><p>  The net sum proposed for my Department for 2014 is &euro;7,848.5 million, made up of current expenditure of &euro;7,304.7 million and capital expenditure of &euro;543.8 million.  The allocation for current expenditure incorporates net pay related savings of &euro;177 million under the Haddington Road Agreement.  In addition to voted expenditure, there is a non-voted allocation for this year of &euro;362 million under the national training fund.  <\/p><p>  My Department has supplied some briefing material regarding the Estimate, which members will have received.  This material supplements the content of the Revised Estimates volume published on 18 December last, much earlier than usual.  Deputies will be aware of the changes made to the overall budgetary timetable, including the introduction of an October budget.  Notwithstanding the teething problems that accompany such changes, the bringing forward of the budgetary process provides for much earlier Oireachtas involvement in relation to the budget.  The year 2014 will be the second year for which my Department's Estimate follows the new performance budgeting format, with expenditure shown across the Department's four high level goals.  The expenditure information is supplemented with broader detail on programme outputs and outcomes, widening the scope of the Estimates process.<\/p><p>  On current expenditure, Deputies will note that almost &euro;6.2 billion of my Department's gross current expenditure allocation of &euro;7.9 billion for 2014 will go on pay and<i><\/i>pensions.  This equates approximately to &euro;4 in every &euro;5.  This is not surprising given that about one third of all public sector employees are in the education sector, with some 92,000 whole-time posts spread across that sector.  In addition, there are some 2,700 civil and public service posts in other education bodies and agencies.  The pension bill pays lump sums and the pensions of some 42,500 retired people.  <\/p><p>  In addition to providing expenditure details in respect of each subhead area, the Estimates and briefing material gives information regarding the main outputs to be achieved under each of the Department's high level goals.  Information is also provided on savings measures introduced to maintain education expenditures within their overall ceiling.  These measures were required in order to ensure that the overall Government deficit position remained inside the GDP limit of 5.1% for 2014.  The current estimate for 2014 takes account of savings and expenditure reductions of some &euro;44 million.  I am happy to discuss these in the examination of the relevant expenditure programmes.  <\/p><p>  Implementation of certain measures announced as part of previous budgets will also continue during 2014.  While the preference would be to avoid taking any such measures, the reality is that we are still in the process of restoring our economy equilibrium.  However, we are getting there.  I have also sought with my Department to prudently balance and manage education expenditures across the 2012 to 2014 period, which is the period covered by the last comprehensive expenditure review.  Work will shortly commence on a new expenditure review to cover the years ahead.  <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the requirement to secure savings on expenditure, budget 2014 has again sought to protect front-line education services as far as possible.  The pupil-teacher ratio in non fee-charging schools at primary and post-primary levels has been protected for the third year in a row.  The 2014-15 year will see up to a net additional 1,400 teachers recruited to schools, providing positions for newly-qualified and unemployed teachers.  Two thirds of these will be mainstream teachers, while one third will be resource teachers supporting children with special educational needs.  In addition, I secured agreement for the recruitment of up to an additional 390 special needs assistant posts by 2014-2015, on top of the earlier ceiling of 10,575 posts.<\/p><p>  The 2014 allocation includes seed capital funding, using proceeds from the national lottery licence transaction to allow primary schools without book rental schemes to set up such schemes.  This will assist in reducing back-to-school costs for parents.  I remain determined to push ahead with important educational reforms and in this regard have provided a further &euro;9 million in 2014 to sustain the literacy and numeracy strategy.  I am also providing approximately &euro;5 million towards the reform of the junior cycle.  Deputies will be aware that the junior certificate will be replaced with the new junior cycle student award.  I also expect that high speed broadband will have been rolled out to all second level schools by September of this year, in time for the start of the academic year.  My Department's expenditure programme for 2014 will continue to provide funding for training and reskilling, both for those in employment and for those seeking work.  In order to help tackle youth unemployment, a minimum of 2,000 training places will be ring-fenced on the Momentum programme for under 25s who are out of work in 2014, at a cost of &euro;6 million.<\/p><p>  On capital Expenditure, my Department's &euro;544 million capital expenditure allocation for 2014 will be in the main used in the ongoing delivery of the five-year 2012-2016 school building programme.  This involves 275 major school building projects and an additional 80,000 school places to meet continuing demographic increases.  The allocation includes some &euro;65 million under the Government's stimulus initiatives of 2012 and June 2013.  These initiatives include enabling works for the development of the new DIT campus at Grangegorman and 28 additional school building projects.  There are 70 school projects scheduled to commence construction this year as part of the five-year plan, delivering over 27,500 permanent school places, of which some 21,000 are additional places.  The projects will support 3,200 direct jobs and 640 indirect jobs in 2014.  Projects include, 22 new schools and 12 extensions at primary level, 12 new schools and 20 extensions at second-level, and three new special schools and one major special school extension.  Together with the school projects already announced under the jobs and investment package last June, and other ongoing projects from 2013, this means that a total of 168 major school projects will be on site in 2014.  This represents significant investment by any measure.  As 2014 progresses, projects scheduled to begin construction in 2015-16 will be assessed by my Department to see if any are ready to go to construction earlier than planned, and if there is financial scope to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200004#C00200","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390396800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We will now consider the Revised Estimate and proposed expenditure and performance for 2014 by programme.

I also thank the officials for the preparatory work put into the briefing documents that have been put before us today.  I thank the clerk to the committee for the briefing and assessments done by the secretariat for the Revised Estimate.<\/p><p>  There are a few questions in general relating to heading A.  The Minister indicated in his opening statement that &euro;5 million is allocated this year for training for the junior certificate reform.  What exactly does that encompass?  Until last week the plan was for a day's training this year in advance of September for English teachers, and there was nothing planned for whole-school training or buy-in with regard to seminars.  I know from last week's working group that it was suggested that one day of training for English teachers is to be expanded to one and a half days of training before September, and there was also a suggestion that schools may take one day for the whole school, with all teachers doing a day of in-service.  I presume it will be in a school.  What are the cost implications of that and does the &euro;5 million cover it?  Will the Minister elaborate on that?<\/p><p>  There is a summer works scheme and minor works grant, and the Minister indicated that the minor works grant was paid in November to schools.  Was it paid to all schools in November?  I presume, if it was, it came from last year's Vote.  I am not sure of the exact figure but it was approximately &euro;28 million.  Where did the Minister find the &euro;28 million?  It is a significant sum, although it may be a small percentage of the overall education budget.  It is still not easy to find.  Where was the funding sourced, as it was not indicated earlier in the year?  It certainly was not in last year's Estimate.  I presume it has come from the 2013 budget line.  I assume the summer works scheme will come from the current year's Estimate.  Where is the Minister finding the additional space in order to be able to pay for the summer works scheme this year?  Is there anything in the 2014 Estimate to pay a minor works grant in 2014?  With the 2013 Estimate and provisional outturn, the initial estimate for pensions was &euro;1.128 billion but it came in at &euro;26 million less, coming in at &euro;1.102 billion.  How did that change come about that led to an underspend in pensions?<\/p><p>  Last year, we had a disagreement on resource teaching hours - the Department was going to cut resource teaching allocations.  The allocation is currently at 0.85 and the Department was proposing to bring it down to 0.8 of an hour for every hour allocated.  Will the Minister assure us the figure will remain at 0.85, and that there is sufficient provision in the Estimate to be able to cater for that?  The new residential institutions statutory fund has seen the establishment of a board but it has not yet started to pay out any funds.  What is specifically allocated in the Revised Estimate this year for that and how much, if any, is expected to be paid from that fund this year?<\/p><p>  Over the course of the past year there has been a couple of schools from the private and fee-paying sector, particularly Kilkenny College and Gormanstown College, which have moved to the free scheme sector.  The Minister has made very significant cuts to the pupil-teacher ratio for the schools.  Will the Minister elaborate on the cost to the Exchequer of those colleges and what the net difference will be to the Exchequer if those colleges join the free scheme sector rather than remain as fee-paying schools?<\/p><p>  The Minister has indicated that he plans to bring high-speed broadband to all secondary schools by the end of September.  We all agree that we have not yet achieved that goal of all secondary schools having high-speed broadband.  Will he give an outline of the current position for broadband in primary schools and what is planned to expand provision for them?  The Minister mentioned funding that he is allocating this year for transferring accommodation from prefabs, with &euro;15 million outlined for 2014 for doing away with prefab accommodation and transferring pupils to permanent accommodation.  What will be left after that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200005#D00300","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390397400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Deputy McConalogue covered almost everything, but I have some brief questions on policy issues.  How is the action plan on bullying progressing and how is the success of its roll-out being measured?  Perhaps the Minister would give an update on it.  Also, will he outline how the guidelines on mental health are proceeding?  How is the Department measuring their success or lack of it?<\/p><p>  With regard to the reform of the junior cycle, a reply I received recently to a parliamentary question stated that it would cost approximately &euro;10 million in total to implement it.  It is expected to cost &euro;5 million this year.  Deputy McConalogue asked some of the relevant questions about that, but perhaps there could be more discussion of it.  Obviously, that is important in view of the current impasse between teachers and the Department regarding its roll-out.<\/p><p>  With regard to the value for money report on SNAs, one of the key outputs for 2014 is to provide other supports for pupils with special educational needs and to further implement the recommendations of the value for money report on SNAs.  Can we get more detail on that?  What elements of the report is the Minister hoping to implement in 2014 and at what cost?<\/p><p>  As regards DEIS, I read recently that the Minister is in discussions with the Minister of Education in Northern Ireland, whose Department is looking at the DEIS model.  As far as I am aware, there were some discussions between both Departments on how to evaluate the success of DEIS.  I recall that when I was speaking to the Minister, Mr. John O'Dowd MLA, he said the Department was examining some cross-Border initiatives particularly in respect of schools in disadvantaged areas and it was looking at the DEIS model in this State and, perhaps, taking on board the lessons that have been learned and implementing it in the North.<\/p><p>  I had noted a question on early school years education but I cannot locate it now.  I will return to it later.  With regard to the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, the target for last year was that the NEPS would be available to approximately 95% of the target population and this year we intend to roll it out to all schools.  Will that target be reached this year?  The target for 2013 was 95% of the target population and one of the key outputs for this year is that it will reach all ordinary and second level schools.<\/p><p>  On Question Time yesterday we discussed the funding for the book rental scheme.  It is &euro;5 million over three years which is coming from national lottery funds.  Again, could we discuss that a little further?  The Minister said yesterday that he would consider the possibility of getting more information during the course of 2014 and reviewing the scheme at the end of this year, to see if we could help schools that have school book rental schemes but are in the very early stages of getting them off the ground.<\/p><p>  I might have further questions based on the Minister's replies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200006#E00200","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1390397400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Any other questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200006#E00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1390397400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I had a few but they have been asked, so I will not duplicate them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200006#E00400","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1390397400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Chairman, I have a final question on the capitation grants.

The first meeting of the national working group on junior cycle reform, as I said yesterday, took place last Friday.

It had an effect on getting clarity.  One of the two unions, the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, had voted for the acceptance of the Haddington Road agreement, but the advice I received, which I accepted, was that to try to attempt to do something in the context of the ASTI standing back and not balloting its members until September was likely to jeopardise constructive talks, so we were unable to commence them.  It was not that the union refused to talk or that we deliberately stopped talking to its representatives.  We believed that given the context it would have been prejudicial, perhaps, to an overall outcome in that regard.  It was a judgment call rather than a hard decision.  Nevertheless, I accepted that judgment and I am responsible for the final decision.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding that, it is expected that there will be meetings of the group, starting from last Friday, every three to four weeks over the next few months and thereafter while the new junior cycle is being phased in.  In that context, three sub-groups have been established to address: continual professional development; assessment or moderation, as both words are used - that is, how one measures and assesses students as distinct from examinations; and resources for schools.  This new working group will be a forum where the concerns of the parents, including the teachers, can be heard.  The concerns raised can be addressed through dialogue, to enable the successful implementation of junior cycle reform to proceed over the next number of years.  The sub-group on resources is due to meet next Friday, 24 January.  The next meeting of the group is scheduled for 7 February.<\/p><p>  This builds on the regular engagement and meetings with education partners since the launch of the framework in October 2012.  The talks have not started now.  They are a continuation of talks that commenced after the launch in 2012.  The working group is made up of representatives from the parent bodies, management bodies, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, officials from the Department of Education and Skills, and the two teachers' unions ASTI and TUI.  Since this is the junior cycle, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, is not involved.<\/p><p>  Originally, English teachers were to receive three days of continual professional development, and Deputy McConalogue referred to this.  This has now been extended to four and a half days.  Other subjects will be provided with an additional day, which is an increase from three days to four days.  In addition, a whole-school day will be provided each year, so the whole-school team can have continual professional development together and develop a whole-school approach to the implementation of the new framework.  This means that the school will close for pupils, but will remain open for the teaching and support staff to devote the entire day to discussing the items I have just described.<\/p><p>  The NCCA will provide schools will resource materials.  The teachers' education centres around the country, numbering approximately 12, will provide additional elective opportunities for continual professional development, CPD.  Teachers can go to these centres and participate in CPD courses.  The Department will continue to fund subject associations, such as the History Teachers' Association of Ireland and Association of Teachers of English, so they, too, can augment the opportunities available to teachers.  It is not just three days increasing by one and a half days.  Additional facilities are being made available as well.<\/p><p>  I will turn now to the phasing-in of the junior cycle.  Change for the junior cycle will happen in a planned and measured way.  We will assess progress as we go along and if we can report good progress, we might consider speeding it up or if we are running into difficulties, we can slow it down.  That is built into the system.  Phasing-in as proposed in the framework for the junior cycle has been changed from what was originally planned.  Only English will be introduced in September this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200006#E01000","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390398600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>By the beginning of September, every single post-primary school in the country will have 100 Mbps broadband, an industrial or high-quality level of broadband service, supplied to it.  It came about because of collaboration between our Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources predominantly supported the capital costs and the Department of Education and Skills will support the ongoing revenue costs associated with providing the service.  Subhead A.14 shows an increase of &euro;2.3 million for this year to cover the revenue costs associated with sustaining the service into the schools.<\/p><p>  We need to explore whether we can do something similar in our primary school network across the country.  Our experience in the post-primary sector is that providing that level of broadband support leads to innovative methodologies being used to enhance and augment the learning experience for children across the post-primary sector and in the primary sector.  Some areas do not have a successful broadband service.  It has not arisen because of an issue within the Department.  It is a national issue that must be resolved on a national basis.  Primary schools with a poor or non-existent broadband service reflect the area or the community in which they are located.  In such cases, the community does not have a very strong broadband service.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has ambitions to ensure that by the end of 2016 there will be a minimum of 30 Mbps into every community in the country.  That is something I applaud and am very supportive of.  After providing such broadband infrastructure across all of Ireland, including rural Ireland, we can look at connecting our schools to the network.<\/p><p>  Before Christmas, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, launched the digital schools of distinction programme, developed in collaboration with HP and Microsoft.  It is not unlike the green flag programme and it involves encouraging best practice in the use of technology across our primary school system.  In the short 11 weeks the programme has been up and running, 650 primary schools have registered and want to be recognised and affirmed as digital schools of distinction, using technology in an innovative way in the learning process.  The 650 schools will be validated and accredited over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200008#G00200","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speech","time":1390398600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Are there other questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200008#G00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1390398600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Subject to the direction of the Chairman, there are some outstanding questions.  Deputy McConalogue referred to the replacement of prefabs.  In 2012, under the prefab replacement initiative, approval was given to 170 schools nationally to replace 458 prefab units with permanent accommodation.  In excess of &euro;42 million was allocated for the initiative, of which &euro;35 million has been paid to date.  Of these, a total of 157 projects have gone to construction and 108 have been completed.  The total rental saving achieved by the 108 completed projects is in the region of &euro;2.1 million per annum.  The figures will be subject to change as further projects are completed.  Last year, I announced a further prefab replacement initiative, replacing in the region of 115 prefabs in 46 schools with permanent accommodation.  A total of &euro;15 million is allocated for the academic year, 2013-14, and the further initiative should result in an additional rent saving of &euro;2.5 million.  Both Deputies have received details on the matter concerning the replacement of prefabs and a list of all schools currently renting such accommodation at present.  If Deputies want to ask me a question on any of those, I will happily answer it.<\/p><p>  With regard to the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, referred to by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, from start of the 2013-14 academic year and based on a staffing complement of 173 whole time equivalents, NEPS assigned a psychologist to all mainstream schools in order to provide the full advisory and support service.  This means that NEPS psychologists have taken on additional school numbers and pupils supported by the use of the scheme for the commissioning of psychological assessments, SCPA, where the psychologist deems it appropriate.  Particular attention is being placed on the development of clustering of small schools, which constitute a large proportion of schools not currently assigned a psychologist in respect of the effective provision for direct NEPS services.  Some special national schools, which currently receive psychological services from HSE agencies, will continue as before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200008#G00400","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1390398600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that every school will have access to a psychologist.  One of the issues that come came to my attention is that when NEPS personnel come to a school, they can only carry out so many assessments.  A maximum of three students can be assessed at any one time.  Some schools have more than three students awaiting an assessment by NEPS personnel and I wonder if the Department has plans to address it.

It was a reduction of 2% in 2012 and 2013 and a further reduction of 1% in 2014 and in 2015.  We have factored that into our savings over the next number of years, as has the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  If we were to alter or change it if say allocations increase, that saving is already set into the figures, so we would have to unlock that.  It would cost more than just the amount of money about which we are talking because it has already taken that saving and banked it.  If we were to say we did not want to proceed with the reduction of 1% next year, the baseline we have for next year would be increased by the amount we would not be saving.  Notwithstanding, the departure of the troika, we are still in difficulties in terms of reducing capitation grants, albeit at a very small number in that 1% is still 1%.<\/p><p>  In many cases, schools are growing, so the pressures are there.

Prior to that, there was an understandable culture that individual schools saw themselves as individuals dealing directly with the Department of Education and Skills and with other suppliers, whether for reams of paper, for electricity or for other commodities.  In the case of electricity, where one is dealing with one or two suppliers and because of the nature of the network, one is able to say 3,200 primary schools is a bulk buyer of the product and to leverage that price per unit of electricity downwards.  That is a new concept and we are trying to introduce not only in education but right across the entire public sector spectrum.  We found that the same unit of typing paper or whatever was being supplied by the same supplier to different public authorities, which were not in communication with each other, at different prices.  The National Procurement Service has been deliberately put in place to avoid that kind of mismatch and to get the maximum value for the same quality of product one is currently getting.

The subject is now out for consultation.<\/p><p>  The main recommendation effectively for members who are not immediately familiar with it - and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon can elaborate on it - is that an apprenticeship should effectively be a minimum of 104 weeks or two years consisting of 50% spent on education off the job and the remaining 50% training on the job.  The apprenticeship would be a paid post, subject to employment law and contractual protections in a number of areas and not a student rate position.  The minimum period should be two years.  Our biggest barrier to getting an effective 21st century apprenticeship programme up and running is the willingness of employers to engage with and to provide not just the places but the training associated with the places.  There is a personnel manpower management imposition obligation for them.  I welcome the fact that the committee will have hearings.  I suggest that the committee focus on the training side.  There is no difficulty relatively speaking - I think the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, will agree with me on the training side.

This great opportunity for people is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>  I recently came across a situation involving the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in which it did not give due recognition for FETAC level 5 or 6 qualifications in its preselection cull on those who should go forward for interview.  People with a level 5 FETAC qualification have the equivalent of a leaving certificate, however people have come to my clinic stating there is no recognition for the other courses and qualification they have received since their second level education.  They are only getting recognition for the junior certificate or the intermediate certificate they did all those years ago.  I am pursuing that matter with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to see what is going on but it would be extremely unfortunate if there was no due recognition for what they achieved under FETAC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200011#K00700","speaker":"1013"},{"type":"speech","time":1390400400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200011#K00800","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1390400400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>If Deputy Ryan would copy the Department of Education and Skills with the specific information, and I do not wish to intrude on the privacy of the individual who came to his clinic.

As a result of the new legislation underpinning Quality and Qualifications Ireland, the new body has a role to play in regularly addressing and examining the access, transfer and progression model in place across the system.  This system is very well developed in further education.  When one begins the process of engagement with further education one can see a very clear line of progression if one wishes to continue to level 10 or 11.  However, this line is not as visible or easily accessed in third level.  QQI will have a role to play in ensuring third level education becomes as easily accessible as further education.<\/p><p>  The third level sector is considering the possibility of modularising complex course provision into small, easily consumed modules and credit systems.  This move will make progression easier in future.  The Minister is correct, however, that there is a certain degree of academic snobbery towards people entering third level education through what could be described as unconventional routes.

The reduced allocation also reflects the decision in this budget to retain the 2013 reduction of &euro;25 million to the higher education institutions in general by requiring them to use the existing large cash deposits and reserves available to them.

There is no agreement between the two parties in coalition on broadening the base of the assessment from household income to reserves, savings or capital assets.  It is not part of the programme for Government and, as I have said previously in public, that is the position at the moment.  There may be some movement on broadening the base to approximate the evaluation of means, similar to the assessment used for social welfare purposes.  That might be a possibility.  However, there is no agreement <i>per se<\/i> on capital assets.  Therefore, there is no proposed change, despite my party's position, which is that we would like to see that happen.<\/p><p>  The Bill on technological universities will be coming to the committee in due course in the normal way after the committee has sent back the enrolment policy Bill.  We have no wish to overload the committee with two Bills at the same time.  The 84 sections will provide for three things, in essence.  First, to enable the existing 14 institutes of technology, if they so wish, to merge or come together.  They have already indicated their position in response to an invitation from the Higher Education Authority.  They were asked, <i>inter alia<\/i>, where they see their future in terms of collaboration and so forth.  All third level institutions find themselves in educational regional clusters anyway and they are required to co-operate.  Let us consider Limerick, for example, where the University of Limerick, the Limerick Institute of Technology and the Limerick School of Art and Design would be required to form an educational cluster.  The same applies in other parts of the country.  That is the first component of the Bill.<\/p><p>  The second component of the Bill is to provide for a merged institution.  The Dublin Institute of Technology and the institutes of technology in Blanchardstown and Tallaght have signalled their intention to proceed down the path to merge and become a technological university.  The Bill provides for what they must do to get there, including the criteria they must meet.  These are criteria established by an international recommendation panel of experts, conveyed to the Higher Education Authority and accepted by the Department and myself.  The criteria would be enshrined in law in order that institutes will not be able to qualify to become a technological university unless they manifestly meet the criteria.  The last thing this is about is changing the badge over the door of the building.  It is about transforming the internal quality.<\/p><p>  The third component of the legislation provides for a change in the governance structure of all the institutions.  Historically, the regional technical colleges were attached to the vocational educational committees.  The model of governance was not dissimilar to that of the old vocational educational committee schools or institutions, with a large number of county councillors on the boards.  Modern recommendation and practice is that the composition of the board of governors should be representative of the internal academic staff, including senior and middle academic staff, students, including graduate and undergraduate, and personnel from the wider world.<\/p><p>  In the technological university legislation there is a definition of the composition or description of a technological university such that it is not a broad-based university like UCC, for example, which has a medical school, a law school, a philosophy school and other sections.  UCC covers the full spectrum.  However, the technological university will be focused narrowly on converting research into commodities that can be manufactured and distributed and which can create wealth, profit and employment for the region in which the technological university is located.  This is all in the documentation but there are requirements within the composition and the activities whereby they must have a structured relationship with large-scale industry and enterprise in the region in which they are located.  We do not need more universities of the type we currently have but we need to advance the institutes of technology to a higher level of wealth creation, in order that they can commercialise research and apply research to activities and commodities that can be sold abroad or at home and that will create employment.<\/p><p>  The timetable will go out for consultation and we should have it back by Easter.  I believe we can get it enacted between Easter and the end of the June session, because we now go into the middle of July.  That is my optimistic expectation.<\/p><p>  When will it happen?  They must merge first and they cannot merge until the legislation is enacted.  They can do a good deal of preliminary work but mergers of any kind are always slow because we are dealing with human beings and it takes time to integrate.  I envisage there will be a stage that will take them into this time next year, if not beyond, to get to the point where a merged entity will seek to start the journey to get up the ladder for qualification.<\/p><p>  I will anticipate the Deputy's final question.  Three groups have indicated that they want to travel that road.  I have already described the position in Dublin involving the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The institutes of technology in Cork and Tralee have indicated their position and they have embarked on exploring the possibility of a merger with the intention of going the full journey.  Likewise, with the institutes in Carlow and Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200013#M00200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1390401600,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Despite the increased numbers of people going to third level and doing postgraduate and Ph.D. studies etc. there is still some evidence of difficulties.

This relates to indigenous industry and the multinationals which have chosen to locate here.  The hope is to address the dearth of skills that is occurring.  We should be aware that this is not an issue unique to Ireland.  It is predicted that by late next year there will be almost 1 million job vacancies in the information and communications technology sector throughout the European Union.  Not long after the formation of the Government the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, came together to establish our national ICT skills strategy.  Every time we have looked at empowering people to develop their skills, whether the unemployed, those already in education or those in employment, it has been predominately in that area.  A unit has been established in SOLAS to determine exactly what skills shortages are occurring now and what will occur in the medium term and long term.<\/p><p>  We are trying at all times to address the areas which have been notified to us as those where shortages are occurring.  The predominant challenge is in the area of information and communications technology.  We are now considering the development of a digital education strategy in our Department.  In fact, before Christmas we launched the public consultation phase.  We hope to begin allowing children the opportunity to do two things.  First, to have greater enhanced use of technology in their learning in all subject matter.  Second, to begin to develop their own technological skills.  Let us consider the wonderful work taking place in the CoderDojo movement throughout Ireland.  There are certainly some questions to be asked about whether this can be mainstreamed into the public school system.  I believe elements of it can be.<\/p><p>  Let us consider the MOMENTUM programme from last year.  Some 6,500 training places were provided to people who were unemployed.  There was major collaboration between industry and the entities, both public and private, delivering the MOMENTUM programme.  The needs of industry were considered in the design and development of the curricula and industry offered job placement opportunities to people who were studying on the MOMENTUM programme.<\/p><p>  A report released by Accenture Ireland last year on the skills challenge highlighted a specific point in this regard.  I believe it is a salient point and one industry should reflect on.  It certainly ties in with what the Minister, Deputy Quinn, said earlier about getting IBEC before the committee to consider the apprenticeship model.  The point was those in industry, as well as being consumers of talent, must play a more proactive role in creating talent.  That is something industry should reflect on.<\/p><p>  I referred earlier to the ICT strategy.  We are ahead of target in identifying and producing the type of ICT graduates we need for the future.  The numbers will have doubled by 2015.  The date originally set for the doubling of numbers was 2018 but we will have reached the target by the end of 2015.  The number of people who are now taking up computer science and ICT subjects in general at third level has increased by 50% in the past three years.<\/p> <p>With the increase of 25 points there has been a significant increase in students, boys and girls, taking honours mathematics.

The model for industry both among multinationals and indigenous industry is collaborative.  A team of people is set a challenge to innovate a particular product or service.  Our third level colleges have not got their heads around how to reproduce that.  The National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, has developed an interesting model for a master&rsquo;s programme to respond to the medical devices sector which employs 8,000 people in Galway city.  It brings together medical, engineering and marketing graduates to work together as a team to develop new devices for the medical devices industry.

Specifically, I have concerns regarding the agendas that might be at play on the part of particular movements within the patronage sector.  I am not referring only to the Irish language movement here.  In fact, I am on record as having criticised the ways in which Educate Together, to give another example, has sometimes pushed its agenda.  When we are told about huge waiting lists for certain types of schools in certain areas, it is important to consider how reliable that information might be.  Sometimes it is based on data which do not give a complete picture because, for instance, they incorporate an element of duplication or are not clear as to the reasons people might be putting their children's names down on a particular waiting list.  There are issues to consider when it comes to the motivation of particular groups of parents.<\/p><p>  The issue of greatest concern in Lucan is that there are two schools, in particular, in which significant numbers of the students are being taught in prefabricated buildings that are in a simply awful condition.  They are conditions in which an adult would not be willing to work.  Sometimes what we ask small children to put up with is at odds with what we ourselves would tolerate in terms of accommodation and so on.  There is a question mark over whether there is a requirement for new schools in Lucan.  Several principals of schools in the area have indicated to me privately that, in their view, there was no need for the school that was recently established.  As I said, it is important to consider the agendas that might be at play.  It is probably to be expected that people will tend to talk up the demand that is there for their own particular model of education.<\/p><p>  When a delegation from the joint committee travelled to Finland we saw an education system that is based on a single model of education provision.  There is a sense in which the choice within our system is in itself a driver of inequality which would not arise if we had one model of education delivery at primary level.  Under such a system, schools would, according to my preference, be State-run and multidenominational, established in consultation with all stakeholders and catering for everybody, with the compromises that would inevitably involve.  The notion that we must have a range of choices is often motivated by a need to confer advantage on a particular set of people to the disadvantage of another set.  We must be careful in that regard.  It will be interesting to see what comes out of the report to which the Minister referred.  The issue I am pointing up is part of the broader enrolment issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200016#P00400","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1390403400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I will not address the more philosophical issues the Chairman raised.  Our post-primary school system is at least 150 years old and has resulted in a typical provincial town having three or four schools, all under the patronage of the Catholic Church, with nobody in the town being under any allusion as to the social status of the Ursuline school versus the Presentation school versus the Mercy school.  They might not be able to measure it but, by Jesus, they could describe it.  Until we find a solution to address that reality, it is not going to change.<\/p><p>  On the question of capacity and demand, I have heard the point raised by the Chairman raised by others on more than one occasion.  An example that comes to mind is when party colleagues in the Tallaght area suggested there was no need for an additional post-primary school at Kingswood Heights, where we have a site.  This was coming from councillors who were formerly members of the vocational education committee and now the education and training board, who put forward an assessment of what was needed in the area.  To put it simply, they were ill-informed.  They were all of a certain age, their grandchildren had already gone through the education system and that was the end of it as far as they were concerned.  There was a failure to take account of the numbers of new people who had come into the area.<\/p><p>  The Chairman might find it helpful to visit the departmental staff in Tullamore who are using the geographic information system, GIS, or to invite them to appear before the committee.  This system keeps track of every one year old whose parents registers him or her for child benefit.  Measurements are taken on an annualised basis, so we can see how many children there are aged one, two, three and four and thus anticipate the likely demand in the catchment area.<\/p><p>  In the case of a relatively isolated area in rural Cork such as Clonakilty, for example, it is easier to assess demand and pressure and conclude that the existing two or three primary schools will deal with the extra demand that arises.  When it comes to the travel distance and time factor, all things being equal, parents will generally send their children to a local school.  In my own constituency of Dublin South-East, to give an example from a very different perspective, on Haddington Road, which is just over the Baggot Street Bridge, there is a demand for 169 places in junior infants this year in a three-stream primary school.  These pupils are coming from all over and include the children of immigrant workers who are employed in financial services and the health sector.  There are also the children of people who were originally from Ringsend, for example, and are now living, say, in Lucan.  These people are sending their children to schools near where they grew up so that a grandparent can look after them while the parents are at work.  The children travel into the city with their parents in the morning and are collected in the evening from the grandparent's house.  It is very hard to match demand with capacity in those circumstances.  When it comes to particular principals claiming that a new school is not necessary in a particular area, that might well be their honest view.  It does not, however, fit with my understanding, having explored the issues elsewhere.<\/p><p>  The other issues the Chairman raised could provide fuel for a lengthy debate.  The bottom line, however, is that we must live with the existing infrastructure and patronage structure we have inherited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200016#P00500","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1390403400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I accept there is another side to the argument on the particular local issue to which I referred.  I am also aware, however, of schools that have been set up recently and have hardly any pupils.  One has to wonder what happened to all the demand that was predicted in those cases.  I accept there is a need for additional school places.  In Lucan some years ago we experienced a crisis in this regard, with emergency schools having to be set up.  It was very much a case of demand being catered for only after it became evident rather than being planned for in advance.  The situation is very much changing in that regard, which is welcome.<\/p><p>  The specific issue of concern I have raised is where there is demand for a particular type of school.  I am not saying it is always the case, but I have been written to by parents who reveal their motivation as being a reluctance to have their child mix with disadvantaged pupils in a particular school.  They want a specific type of school to be set up simply to cater for their child.  As a public representative, one hears that type of sentiment.  I am making the point that we should bear in mind what might be going on behind the scenes in terms of some parents' motivation.  I am concerned that this factor might be influencing some of the choices that are being made within the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200016#P00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1390403400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>It would be useful for the committee to have an opportunity to explore what is being done by the staff in Tullamore in terms of the GIS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200016#P00700","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1390403400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I am very willing to accommodate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200016#P00800","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1390403400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Under which heading is the summer work scheme included?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200016#P00900","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1390403400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>My officials tell me it is under subhead D3, which is on page 58 of the documentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200016#P01000","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1390404000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>What is the allocation for this year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200017#Q00100","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1390404000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Approximately &euro;40 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200017#Q00200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1390404000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12014012200017#Q00300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1390404000,"counter":132,"content":"<p>Are members happy to move on?

I was on both sides of the fence growing up.  If one is seeking one's qualification or \"pilot's licence\" in terms of teaching, one must complete so many \"flying hours\".  A similar issue arose with regard to construction apprentices who were made redundant when their employer's went bankrupt.  Those individuals were left high and dry.  They just wanted to complete their training and obtain their qualifications in order that they could go to Australia in search of work.  They could not obtain - I use the phrase figuratively - sufficient flying hours.  I am in favour of young teachers obtaining sufficient real experience in classrooms - that is, the necessary flying hours - in order that they can be probated and thereby progress in their careers.  Many young people are pursuing teaching courses in order that they might emigrate and teach abroad.  There is a worldwide shortage of qualified teachers and people can make fortunes in places such Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.  A person who goes to Dubai can return home after three years with approximately &euro;50,000 in cash and use it to pay off their loans, etc.  They can then decide what they want to do thereafter.  I am referring here to people in the mid-20s who are in a position to travel where they want.  People who are willing to teach in schools in particular areas of England, including inner city London, are receiving bonus payments at present.  There are providers of education in England who are employing Irish contractors for this purpose.<\/p><p>  I am of the view that we can no longer consider education from a domestic, inward-looking perspective.  People have the right to train as teachers.  When they obtain their qualifications and complete their training - and once they have paid their taxes and so on - they should be free to do so.  Probating trainee teachers and making them available to obtain experience in classrooms is good for them and for the schools in which they teach.  It is also good for existing teachers.  Is it good that they are being used a cheap, yellow-pack source of labour?  The answer is \"No\".  However, the position is not black and white and there are arguments which can be put forward.  I believe I am correct in stating that the teacher unions stated that they would not facilitate a limited number in this regard.  When the social employment scheme was established many years ago, trade unions and local authorities objected on the grounds that it would displace existing workers.  An agreement was reached whereby if local communities wanted to build community halls and if they were prepared to raise the necessary funding and use apprentice construction workers in a way which would ensure that full-time employees would not be prevented from doing their work, then they could do so.<\/p><p>  There are models which can be used and, as already stated, we circumvented the difficulties relating to local authorities, etc.  I am of the view that a similar exercise should be undertaken in the area of teaching.  In some instances, the presence of an additional pair of hands would make it much easier for certain teachers to do their jobs.  In addition, the relevant young person would obtain sufficient flying hours and be in a position to enter the labour market as a qualified teacher.  That is my view.  Is they system being exploited and abused?

There is also the issue of the Central Remedial Clinic.  It, rightly, filters into the political system, whereby Members of Parliament wish to bring people before committees, hold them to account and have exchanges on expenditure.  This is no different.  What we want to establish is that the money spent to date has been well spent, that there has been good value for money and whether there are other issues in this regard.  That will form the basis of our deliberations and I thank the delegates most sincerely for attending and engaging with us.

Since taking up my position as city manager, I have been concerned about the project and anxious to bring it to a resolution.<\/p><p>  The background to the Dublin waste to energy project, together with a project chronology, is set out in detail in section 2 of our submission document.  Dublin City Council, acting on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities, has been pursuing the provision of the waste to energy facility following the adoption of the Dublin region waste strategy in 1998.  The Dublin waste to energy project was developed as a public private partnership, PPP, using the appropriate EU procurement procedure and carried out in accordance with the capital appraisal and PPP guidelines issued by the Department of Finance.  The public tender competition was conducted by the client's representative on behalf of Dublin City Council to award a contract for the design, build, financing, operation and maintenance of a thermal treatment facility.<\/p><p>  A project board was established in January 2004 to oversee the project.  The project board comprised representatives from Dublin City Council, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the client&rsquo;s representative.  In response to a public procurement process, three bids were received on 16 April 2004.  In June 2005 the procurement report was finalised and issued to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the NDFA and the Dublin local authorities.  The project was subject to financial assessment by the NDFA which confirmed in 2005 and again in 2007 following a financial restructuring by the preferred bidder that the project represented value for money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012200003#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Owen Keegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390400100,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Keegan and the other officials for coming before the committee.

I know that elected members on Dublin City Council of various shades of political opinion are extremely concerned; members from my party are extremely concerned about the issue.

The problem is that the elected members have been hung out to dry and have been left completely exposed to a roasting from the public on this waste of money.  The public cannot grasp the reason this amount of public money could be paid from the coffers of the local authority.  Mr. Keegan spoke of the prospect of the project being done but I would beg to differ based on what has been happening in waste management.  Mr. Keegan's officials will be aware of the success of the recycling initiative, with increases in the rates of recycling.  Further work has to be done in terms of waste reduction but it is hoped the volumes of waste will decrease, which means there will be less raw material to feed an incinerator.<\/p><p>  I will now question Mr. Keegan on the payments to consultants.  As of 2011, &euro;28.4 million was paid to consultants.  The estimated cost had been &euro;8 million, but three and half times more than the figure in the Estimates was spent.  How much has been paid to consultants to date?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012200005#M00300","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390400700,"counter":163,"content":"<p>First, I will address the question of the need for the incinerator.  There is a view going around that with higher recycling rates there is no need for an incinerator.  In the course of my report, I have a graph showing how waste is treated in the countries with the highest rates of recycling, that is Austria, the Netherlands and Germany.  For example in Germany they have 62% recycling but some 37% of waste goes to thermal treatment and less than 1% goes to landfill.  That is what national policy aspires to and is something that the waste energy facility will be fundamental in achieving.  It is not displacing recycling, it is replacing disposal to landfill, which at present is 53% of waste.  There is significant scope in my view.<\/p><p>  There is legitimate concern about the expenditure on the project.  The primary element of expenditure on consultants was on the client representative contract.  We have detailed in our report the total expenditure including VAT to the end of December 2013 which was &euro;29.77 million.  Let me explain how this came about when the anticipated figure initially was &euro;8.3 million.<\/p><p>  The Dublin waste energy project was one of the first proposed thermal treatment plants in the State.  It was a pilot project in the PPP programme under the National Development Plan.  It was the only design, build, operate and finance project in the waste sector.  It was also one of the first projects to fall within the terms of reference of the National Development Finance Agency.  At the time the concept of the public private partnership was a new approach to projects.  The city council would have had no experience of dealing with them.  When the original client representative contract was drawn up - I have no doubt that it was drawn up in good faith - there were serious weaknesses in it.  Certain services that turned out to be necessary were not included and the scope of works that were included in the contract proved to be totally inadequate in the light of what happened subsequently, particularly the long delays.  It was necessary to extend the contract very considerably.  I have the details of the breakdown of the expenditure on that contract.  The fundamental problem was that the original scope of that contract proved totally inadequate in face of the actual complexity of the work required to be undertaken and the eventual duration of the assignment.  That was unfortunate.  The council can also be criticised for its failure in respect of issues that the auditor drew to its attention, and was determined by the Commission subsequently.  <\/p><p>  When the contract originally exceeded the 50% threshold in terms of the increase on the original figure, public procurement guidelines require that it should have gone out to procurement.  For understandable reasons a view was taken by the city council that because of the complexity of the project it would be a bad idea to change the client representative team as a very significant degree of expertise had been built up in that team, at the public's expense, and it made sense to negotiate extensions of that contract.  I think a view was taken that it was such an exceptional procedure it was justifiable to depart from the norm.  This issue was first raised by the local government auditor in his report in 2013, the matter was subsequently clarified by the Commission and the Commission's view was that we should have abided by the EU procurement rules.  I have accepted that.  We were advised of that late in 2013 and I put in train arrangements to serve the notice on the client representative team and to terminate their contract.  I do not think anybody is saying, given the complexity and change of the scope of the work, with the additional work that had been done, that expenditure of that order did not have to be incurred, the difficulty is that in the absence of public procurement I cannot say we achieved value for money.  We have to accept the reality.  With the benefit of hindsight, it would have been better to break that contract in 2005 and gone out to tender.  I have no doubt that had we known that the project would have stretched on as long as it did, I am sure that decision would have been made.  I think there was always a view that we were very close to getting this project over the line.

Certainly this issue has blighted Dublin south east for the past 17 years.  If it was not this particular incinerator it was the illegal one that was on Sir John Rogerson's Quay.  One of the first protests was Ban the Burn.  It is a long time running.  It was initially conceived by John FitzGerald, followed on by John Tierney and now Owen Keegan, whom I congratulate on being promoted to be the new Dublin city manager.  I had hoped there would be a certain amount of fresh thinking rather than being tied to the past.  Certainly the record on this project is not good.  We had the problem with the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Dick Roche, rushing to approve the signature on the contract before John Gormley became Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.

Does Mr. Keegan still believe it was unforeseen that Dublin City Council would lose control over waste collection?  I do not think the Panda case is relevant because it came quite some time afterwards.  It was an amendment to the Waste Management Act 2001 which clarified the issue.

I appreciate Mr. Keegan is a new city manager and did not preside over the incinerator plans in that position in the past.  I find it shocking that so much was spent and that the figure for consultancy rose from &euro;8 million to more than &euro;30 million.  I acknowledge Mr. Keegan has stated that in hindsight, he believes it would have been better to break the contract in 2005 when issues then arose.  Is this because there was a legal problem that meant it should have been re-tendered?  Alternatively, is it because he thinks that expenditure of money on that scale does not constitute value for money over which one could stand?  I query whether much of that work could have been carried out by Dublin City Council.  It is a phenomenal amount of money and I do not understand how the council got it so badly wrong whereby nearly four times as much as predicted was spent on client services, public relations and things like that.  It is an incredible amount of public money.  The city manager stated at the outset that this entire debacle has been too complicated and has gone on for too long, which I consider to be an understatement, given the current position ten years later.  My biggest concern is whether at this point, good money simply is being thrown after bad.  I accept the amount that already has been spent although I would query the wisdom of it but note Mr. Keegan has told the committee that were he considering the project today in the present day context of the current waste management environment, he would not sign off on it.  While &euro;100 million already has been spent on it, a further &euro;500 million is coming down the track.  I am not confident that a case has been made to the effect that now is not the time to shout \"stop\".  If Mr. Keegan is stating that the entire context has changed, is this a situation similar to that in respect of electronic voting, whereby a Department and agency decide that as so much has been spent thus far, they cannot admit to having been wrong and stop?  Alternatively, is there a rational argument at this point for proceeding with a project of this scale at that location?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012200010#R00900","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1390403700,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Likewise, I realise this was not on Mr. Keegan's watch.  However, does he have an opinion on the reason no serious internal investigation took place after the McKechnie judgment had been so damning of individuals in the council or the reason no one has been held accountable?  In the interests of transparency and accountability, does Mr. Keegan have an appetite for carrying out such an investigation?  He stated that although not all meetings were minuted, there is an account of most of the serious decisions that were made.  My second question is somewhat similar to that of the previous speaker.  Given that so much money has been spent on consultancy fees, did this actually hamper the decision-making process of the local authority?  Would the city council have been in a more independent position otherwise?  For example, some people thought the city council had an option in 2010 to walk away from Covanta but the commitments made to consultants made so doing more difficult.  Now that Mr. Keegan is the city manager, does he plan to strengthen his own teams within the local authority to make the city council less dependent on consultants in the years ahead?  Does Mr. Keegan agree the over-dependence on consultants in many areas is proving to be disappointing?  I would have much greater faith in the city council building its own teams to deal with matters and it would represent a better value for money for the taxpayer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012200010#R01000","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1390403700,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I have a few questions in respect of the project.  In his opening statement, Mr. Keegan stated the contract has been renegotiated with revised funding liabilities for the combined councils.  Does the revised contract also include revised capacity for the incinerator with regard to the amount of waste it requires?  Does this contract contain a commitment on the part of the four councils to provide a set amount of waste?  If so, how much is it, given the amount of waste being produced in the four council areas reduced in 2013 to approximately 165,000 tonnes, while the original contract was to provide 300,000 tonnes?  In the revised contract, what are the quantities in respect of the waste to be provided?  As for the current status of the project, Mr. Keegan outlined in his statement that a number of steps must be taken after these procedures have finished.  I take it from this that the four councils still are committed fully to delivering an incinerator on this site at some point in the future.  Mr. Keegan might confirm whether this is the case.  On the European Commission complaints, what has been the cost of consultants and correspondence in respect of dealing with that complaint?  Are projections available on what will be the cost to continue to deal with this complaint until its completion?  Does Mr. Keegan consider it is justifiable to continue on that road?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012200010#R01100","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1390403700,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Deputy Kevin Humphreys also wishes to ask two brief final questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012200010#R01200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1390403700,"counter":304,"content":"<p>First, my question on air quality was not answered.

This appears to me to be a misuse of public money.  My final point pertains to sludge-to-energy treatment.  I believe it will be necessary to input energy to the burning of sludge and no gain will be derived from sludge, as if one includes the treatment of sludge, it is a minus, rather than a plus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012200010#R01300","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390403700,"counter":305,"content":"<p>On the points that have been raised, I wish to make absolutely clear that I am very concerned and with regard to the escalation of the cost from the predicted &euro;8 million to &euro;30 million, I have sought to explain the factors that gave rise to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014012200010#R01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Owen Keegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390404300,"counter":307,"content":"<p>As part of the negotiation a design was made for the relocation of the plant.

I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, and the senior officials, including Secretary General, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to this meeting of the select committee.  The purpose of this meeting is for the select committee to consider the Revised Estimates for the Department.  The select committee, when considering the Estimates, will do so under the following headings: context and impact indicators, key outputs, financial and human resource inputs;and a preliminary exchange on the allocations and targets.

I hope the committee will welcome and endorse the priorities and output targets we have set ourselves for 2014.  In my remarks I will focus on Vote 28 and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, will address Vote 27.<\/p><p>  I appreciate that a formal introductory statement is not required but with the Chairman's permission, I will confine myself to some initial comments outlining the situation facing the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at this juncture, before I introduce the various programmes managed by my Department.   I also propose to address briefly yesterday's important announcement by Government of its decision to provide for a significant expansion of the State&rsquo;s diplomatic and consular network.<\/p><p>  For 2014, the committee will be aware that the overall Estimate for the Foreign Affairs and Trade group of Votes is &euro;691 million.  This compares with an Estimate of &euro;714 million the previous year, and represents a reduction of the order of 3.2%.   The allocation for spending on administration has decreased from &euro;187 million to &euro;175 million, a 6.2% reduction.  Much of the decrease reflects the discontinuance of additional funding for EU Presidency costs, and I am satisfied that, despite the continuing tight budgetary situation, we can deliver our targets for 2014. <\/p><p>  In the course of 2014, we will be building on Ireland&rsquo;s success in exiting the EU-IMF programme.  We have been working towards this objective for the past three years and its achievement is an important milestone on the road towards Ireland&rsquo;s recovery.  My Department has been centrally involved, in particular through the agency of our diplomatic and consular network abroad, in this achievement.  The task of restoring our economic fortunes and of recovering lost ground internationally is not yet completed, however, and there is no room for complacency.  At the same time, important opportunities and challenges are unfolding as we drive forward the process of economic renewal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2014012200002#A00500","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390401000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his introduction.  Yesterday's announcement was good news for this country.  It is welcome that in spite of the difficult circumstances that we have extended our embassies, in particular in Asia, and a new one in Zagreb in Croatia, as well as extending to the US and other areas.  It is very good news despite the tight budgetary constraints that exist because there is no doubt that our embassies play a very important role in our economic recovery.  We will move on to Vote 28.

The amount allocated for the programme in 2014 is &euro;48.1 million, a reduction of &euro;6 million or 17% on the 2013 provision.  As previously noted, this reduction reflects the discontinuance of additional funds that were allocated in 2013 for Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency.  I have addressed already the importance of the State&rsquo;s diplomatic and consular network in advancing our economic and trade interests.  I will now turn briefly to trade promotion which is a central element of this programme.  Trade missions are an important element of the national promotional effort and, in 2013, a total of 18 ministerial-led Enterprise Ireland trade missions visited countries which have been identified as priority markets for Irish exporting companies.  It is envisaged that this level of activity will be sustained in 2014.  These trade missions are supported actively by our trade and promotion division at headquarters and by our diplomatic missions on the ground.<\/p><p>  In 2013, ministerial-led trade missions secured more than &euro;200 million in new or additional contracts for Irish business.  This included an Enterprise Ireland trade mission to Turkey, which I led in April, during which contracts worth more than &euro;30 million were agreed.  Similarly, the recent Enterprise Ireland trade mission to the Middle East, led by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and supported by our embassies in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, saw the announcement of 95 new jobs in Ireland and new contracts and business developments worth &euro;65 million.  The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period presents very important opportunities for promotional activity by the embassy network.  Over the 2013 St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, the Taoiseach and I, and 18 Ministers, travelled to 21 countries across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia for a series of trade, investment and tourism-focused programmes.  It is intended to maintain a similar level of promotional activity during the 2014 St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s trade strategy sets out targets in trade, tourism and investment to be met by 2015, as well as a programme of actions conducive to achieving these targets.  My Department is leading a short, focused review of the Government trade, tourism and investment strategy in close collaboration with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, other relevant Departments and State agencies.  The review is now nearing completion and it is envisaged that it will be presented in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2014012200003#B00300","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1390401000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

He will be conscious that the members of this committee are dealing in-depth with the suggestion that we review the foreign policy and external relations of the Department.  I put that on the agenda but I woke up one morning only to read in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, which is delivered to my home, that this policy review was taking place.  What way is that to communicate to the committee?  The committee is due to report in early February.  I would hope that when we submit our report to the T&aacute;naiste it will substantially support a verbal and written contribution that was made by Graham Butler, who is based in the University of Copenhagen.  He told us that in many ways the T&aacute;naiste and the Government are subservient to this committee.  I was surprised to read that a substantial number of new embassies are to open and join with consulates general when we were bringing in expert witnesses to debate foreign policy and external relations.<\/p><p>  I support what the T&aacute;naiste is doing in opening the new embassies but I am sceptical that all of that work can be done within the existing budget.  We talk about oversight but in terms of what we are supposed to be debating now, one would want a team of workers to try to read what is in this huge document.  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware that the administrative budget for 2014 is down 23% compared to 2008?  We have this magnificent programme of expanding the services of the diplomatic corps, which is welcome, but the administrative budget is way down.  How many of these embassies will be opened two, three, four or five years from now?  Is this an overall plan that envisages opening the consulates general and the embassies?  We told people in Tehran that the reason we closed their embassy was because of financial constraints but their ambassador woke up this morning to the news that not only is the position changed drastically but that all these additional embassies are to open.  They would rightly argue that before the ink was dry on the report we will send to the Department, they persevered in Ireland, notwithstanding that we closed the embassy in Tehran, and provided excellent supports for the opening of the beef and sheepmeat industries.  They are waking up this morning and wondering, having received an Irish delegation and given its members fulsome support in entering the arena of international diplomacy, why we are opening embassies in countries that do not even have an embassy in Ireland.  I am sure they are of the view, rightly, that if we believe Iran is evolving and that it is the centre of a region with a population of 800 million people, it is worthwhile considering what they have to say.<\/p><p>  Our report will be ready in early February.  I hope it will be an important report but I would like to register my request for an explanation as to the timing of, first, the press statement from the T&aacute;naiste's Department in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> that he was about to carry out the foreign policy and external relations review and, second, the announcement that all these embassies will open at no extra cost.  All of them will be within budget, notwithstanding the huge cuts that have affected the Department's administrative budget.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste gave a good report on the visit to Turkey.

To what extent has the Department quantified the value of the Irish Presidency in the worldwide community in promoting Ireland Inc., its trade and trade potential?  The point made by the T&aacute;naiste on engaging with the world is of huge importance.  Ireland should never remain stagnant in the way in which it engages with the world.  In that regard, I welcome the extension of embassies and consular appointments worldwide on the basis of emerging world economies.  Nothing remains as it is, nor should it.  Arising from that point and having regard to performance in recent years, to what degree does the T&aacute;naiste expect these new appointments to be of benefit to Ireland Inc. with regard to promotion of the economy?  I welcome the reinstatement of the Vatican embassy, which is a positive decision.  Everything changes; nothing is forever, which is the way it should be.  Moreover, from henceforth, nothing will remain forever.  There may be changes in the future to extend further diplomatic services worldwide, which would be of huge benefit to the country as a whole.  In particular, it is important in diplomatic circles that Ireland respond to events around it in a positive way.  This is what has happened and I compliment the T&aacute;naiste in that regard.<\/p><p>  The T&aacute;naiste has referred to the need to compete and in the aftermath of the exit from the bailout programme, to what extent do he and his colleagues expect to be in a better position to compete worldwide?

The T&aacute;naiste has mentioned this and it is of huge importance.  <\/p><p>  The final point I wish to make concerns focus.  The T&aacute;naiste made a very important point on focus which I do not believe members fully understand or appreciate.

That decision and my recommendations to the Government were greatly informed by the exchanges I had had with this committee in recent years.  We have discussed a number of times the extent to which Ireland, when compared with other countries of similar size, maintains a small presence abroad.  Ireland has a total of 73 missions, with 56 embassies, while the Netherlands has 58 missions, with 1,500 diplomats in the field, compared with Ireland's figure of slightly more than 300.  We are in a competitive environment and one can make similar comparisons elsewhere.  The Government has been putting a particular focus on what is called economic diplomacy, that is, promoting trade and, in particular, Ireland's economic interests abroad.  That is the reason, when the Government was formed, the then Department of Foreign Affairs was given the added mandate to co-ordinate the trade effort across government.  A number of Departments and Government agencies are involved in the trade efforts of the State.  Obviously, these include the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Education and Skills and Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The State agencies include IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland.  That is quite a range of bodies and the Government co-ordinates all of this through the Export Trade Council, which I chair.  It is responsible for the review of trade strategy and, as Deputy Brendan Smith noted, that strategy was published at the end of 2010.  It is now being reviewed and I expect the outcome of that review will be considered at the next meeting of the Export Trade Council which will take place in February, following which I expect to bring a report to the Government.<\/p><p>  It may interest committee members, to get a flavour of the extent of the work done over the course of 2013, that under the trade strategy, 27 co-ordinated plans have been developed with the State agencies for Ireland's priority markets.  We undertook 136 high level visits, with a significant economic and promotional dimension, across 52 countries last year.  There were 656 events and engagements promoting Irish tourism and The Gathering directly to almost 300,000 people from the time of its worldwide launch in March 2012.  There were 661 engagements to promote Ireland's economic positions to officeholders internationally.  There were 734 specific engagements to facilitate trade and investment supporting Irish jobs.  In the St. Patrick's Day period alone, there were 70 focused company engagements and business events involving more than 8,500 Irish and international company representatives.  There were engagements with 1,152 representatives of the international media.  Ireland was promoted directly to 778,000 people assembled in various audiences over the course of 2013.  The promotion of economic messages through op-ed articles, interviews and media work was done to an audience estimated to have been in excess of 53 million.  Moreover, access was renewed for Irish products to nine international markets, with a combined population of 1.5 billion people.<\/p><p>  As for the specific questions raised, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked about the control of expenditure.  Apart from the presentation of the Estimates which is done by both the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, and me, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade comes under the ambit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is subject to examination by the Committee of Public Accounts which the Secretary General attends as Accounting Officer.  Moreover, in respect of the aid programme, we have an auditing system with which the committee is reasonably familiar.  The Department is in the process of appointing a financial controller, which, again, will enhance its financial governance.<\/p><p>  On the issue of Iran which has been raised by Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, Se&aacute;n Crowe and Eric Byrne, I gave consideration to the reopening of the embassy in Tehran.  The Department's consideration of the review of missions and where they are located has been under way for some time.  It has been under way over the course of the last year, in particular, especially since the completion of the Presidency.  Tehran, obviously, was one of the capitals to which consideration was given.  Were Ireland opening more embassies, we would be positive about it.  The situation in Iran is changing and I greatly welcome what is happening on the nuclear issue.  As members are aware, last Monday the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union relaxed the sanctions on Iran as a consequence of the progress that had been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2014012200005#D00800","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390402800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2014012200006#E00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1390402800,"counter":385,"content":"<p>Will the Chairman allow brief supplementary questions?

The passport service issued more than 631,000 passports in 2013, generating revenue of &euro;38.1 million.  It strives to provide a quick, secure and affordable passport service.  With up to 90% of applicants in the State now using the Passport Express application process, we have been able to meet a high level of demand with quicker turnaround times.  An ongoing programme of investment in passport machinery and technology is under way, with new contracts for passport booklets, passport production machinery and passport application forms awarded in 2013.  I was pleased to launch the newly designed and security enhanced passport booklet in September.  The committee will note a &euro;3.3 million capital allocation for further investment in 2014 in new technology.  This is intended to streamline the application process and enhance further the security and integrity of the passport application process.<\/p><p>  The number of citizens travelling has increased in the past decade, with over 6.3 million visits abroad in 2013.  The increased volume of overseas travel has seen a growing need for consular assistance and support for citizens when they meet difficulties overseas.  During 2014 we expect a similar level of consular assistance to be required to last year, when over 1,500 citizens were assisted.  That assistance was provided following serious consular emergencies, including deaths, arrests, kidnappings, accidents, child abductions and hospitalisations.<\/p><p>  The Emigrant Support Programme provides funding for non-profit organisations and projects to support Irish communities overseas and facilitate the development of more strategic links between Ireland and the global Irish.  I am pleased to say the same level of funding is provided for in 2014 as last year, that is, &euro;11.6 million.  The organisations funded provide a range of services, from informal community networking groups for seniors to outreach services and advice in accessing entitlements.  The programme also supports projects aimed at creating practical results-orientated links between Ireland and the global Irish.  Projects that emerged as a consequence of the Global Irish Economic Forum, for example, include the development of Irish business networks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2014012200006#E01500","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1390402800,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Of the 631,000 passports issued last year, what proportion were issued abroad, for example, in Britain or the United States?

Approximately 40,000 were issued in London and a further 40,000 were issued in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>  Some 90% of applications are now coming through the passport express service.  The objective is to have passports issued within ten working days through the passport express process.  Currently, the timeframe is six to seven days.  That is probably a seasonal figure because demand is not as high this time of the year.  In the past, including last year, there were periods when it took 11 to 12 days during the peak season.  The objective is to have passports issued within ten days and this is largely being met.<\/p><p>  One area we are examining at present, and to which I ask the committee to give some thought, concerns the circumstances of somebody who needs a passport in a hurry.  There are a number of arrangements in place in this regard.  Where there is a death or family tragedy and a family member&rsquo;s passport is out of date, there is an arrangement whereby a passport can be issued in a hurry.  Consider, however, the circumstances that often arise in which a family going on holiday discovers on a Saturday morning or Friday evening that the passport of one family member is out of date.  I have much sympathy for those in such circumstances.  It presents a difficulty in that there is not an immediate emergency.  We have been giving some consideration to how we might deal with this.  Two difficulties arise for the passport service.  First, if one prioritises such cases, it means those queuing by normal means are pushed back a bit.  The second consequence concerns staffing and the associated costs.  One measure we are considering is having a system whereby, if somebody is in the circumstances described, there would be an emergency service with an additional charge.  It would be helpful if the committee were to give some thought to this.  Let us have the benefit of the committee's views.<\/p><p>  It is probably fair to say the demand for consular services changes.  Our experience is that the biggest demand is in holiday destinations.  Spain comes to mind very quickly as a country in which there is quite a demand for consular assistance.  It is mainly tourists who are involved, and to some extent new emigrants, particularly in very tragic cases.<\/p><p>  Our consular service has a very good reputation.  Cases vary.  There was a recent very high-profile case involving a young Irish citizen arrested on drug charges in South America.  We had to arrange for an officer from our embassy in Mexico to travel to the location in question because we do not have a resident mission there.  Some cases arise where there are deaths and the remains need to be repatriated.  We provide assistance in that area.  In many cases, people get into trouble, for one reason or another, with the law in a particular country.  Our embassies work with the families concerned to ensure they have legal representation and know their rights in the country in question.  Some cases involve the visiting of Irish people who are incarcerated abroad.  A broad range of circumstances is covered.  We are very grateful for the work of our honorary consuls, as has been mentioned.<\/p><p>  We are currently conducting a review of the honorary consul network.  Work on that review began towards the end of 2012.  There has already been wide-ranging consultation involving the Department, State agencies, our missions and the honorary consuls.  A draft report was submitted to my Department's management advisory committee for consideration.  Consequent to this, a list of draft recommendations has been compiled.  The review covers a number of key areas, including the extent of the network, possible expansion, the range of work covered by honorary consuls and the possible expansion of that role, training and resources, and financial considerations.  One likely outcome of the review is guidelines on the expansion of the role of honorary consul to ensure far greater involvement in trade promotion.  Once the review has been completed and recommendations are agreed, the consular division will work on implementing those recommendations in conjunction with the relevant divisions and agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2014012200007#F00500","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390404000,"counter":407,"content":"<p>On the issue of the emergency passport response, consideration should be given to emergency response for a fee.

This can result in the person staying at home or the entire family staying at home.  The critical issue is the extent of the fee charged.

We got it sorted through the Minister's office and he did not have to pay.  Ability to pay depends on the individual's financial circumstances.  If somebody is ill or there is a death in the family people are vulnerable at the time and they do not need additional costs if they can be avoided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2014012200008#G00600","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1390404000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>We are considering the matter and the committee might give some thought to it.

To break down sectarianism, suspicion, hatred and tradition is a mammoth task.  It takes a significant amount in financial and physical commitment.

We asked the people, both North and South, to support the Agreement through a referendum which they did.

In future, consideration should be given to responding to an even greater extent than we have done so far and adopting a more hands-on approach.

Ireland's payments to the United Nations comprise mandatory contributions to the regular budget, the capital master plan, the International Criminal Court, the peacekeeping budget and tribunals.  Countries' payments to the UN are based on a formula for the scale of assessment for member states which is reviewed at three yearly intervals.  For the period 2013-15, Ireland's scale of assessment decreased from 0.498% to 0.418%.  This reduction in our assessment by 16.1% reflects our economic contraction of recent years.

Has anybody gone to prison as a result of the attempted fraud?<\/p><p>  I record my sadness at the closure of the embassy in Lesotho, a most magnificent and beautiful country with which I am very familiar.  I am very familiar with some of the programmes that had been initiated in Lesotho by Irish Aid, not least the cross-breeding of the Lesotho pony with the Connemara pony.  The women I met in Lesotho many years ago were making the most magnificent hand-made Aran sweaters for themselves and for tourists, because it gets cold at night.  The aid programme to Lesotho is very important.  It was more important during the Apartheid era when it was an isolated nation.  Now that the Minister is moving the embassy to South Africa, how will the relationship of the Irish Aid programme with Lesotho be carried out?  Will it be carried out through the Embassy in South Africa and will that create communication difficulties for the Lesotho NGOs or government people who are handling our aid?  Can the Minister confirm that the aid programme will continue, notwithstanding the closure of the embassy in Lesotho?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2014012200012#L00300","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1390406400,"counter":446,"content":"<p>This is the seventh consecutive cut to the ODA budget.  I understand the background to it, the economic crisis and so on.  However, we have internationally committed to the target of 7% of GNI for ODA by 2015, and last year the Government acknowledged that it is unlikely to reach this.  Are we working to a particular plan or is there a vacuum there?  How does the Minister see us eventually reaching that target?  The Irish Aid programme funding scheme has been cut by 2%.  Regarding what Deputy Smith talked about, what criteria are being used for that?  The NGO part of the Irish Aid programmes is the most poverty-focused and result-oriented part and there should be extra protection in times of budget reductions.  Are the recommendations on where the cuts should be and in what areas the knife should fall?<\/p><p>  On the multilateral funding, the ODA is spent through different sources.  It is an important part of the aid package but one of the difficulties is that some of the work is being undermined by donors in other areas.  The fight against inequality and poverty is about much more than aid.  It is also about a whole-government approach.  We raised this before regarding whether we will follow a human-rights approach in all our dealings with multilateral agencies and organisations.  Will there be a whole-government approach to aid, trade, development and human rights in all the Government's affairs?<\/p><p>  On the one hand we are pumping money into this area, for example Ireland gives &euro;23.7 million to the European Development Fund, but at the same time the EU is pushing policies that are possible undermining human rights in some areas.  It is pushing ahead with a free trade agreement with Colombia, one of the most dangerous places in the world.  The EU's fisheries agreement with Morocco allows EU ships to plunder the fisheries wealth of the occupied territories of Western Sahara.  We put aid in one area but our other policies undermine that.  There needs to be a joined-up approach on that.  How does the Minister see the Irish Government's role in that, particularly among those organisations to which we are committed?  One could argue the same about the Palestinians.  We are putting money in there, but at the same time a huge amount of their infrastructure is being destroyed by the so-called Israeli Defence Forces.  We are doing positive work, but one hand is doing one thing and the other hand is doing the other.  I do not know if the Minister shares that view, which is my view as an outsider looking in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2014012200012#L00400","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1390407000,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the ODA allocation has been maintained, despite the recession, but it is disappointing that we are moving further away from the aid target of 0.7% of GDP.  As a member of the committee and as chairman of the Irish section of AWEPA, I have had the opportunity to visit a number of aid countries and I must compliment the work of our ambassadors and their staff and the way in which they have added to Ireland's reputation, which was started by our missionaries.  I am particularly pleased with the Sierra Leone office, which is all female.  This has been upgraded in status and that is welcome.  I pay tribute to the work the staff has done.  We had a wonderful ambassador in Lesotho.  I hope he will not be put out to pasture and will be given another important role because of his hands-on approach.<\/p><p>  Our reputation is excellent and the more I travel abroad and meet people, the more I realise that.  As Deputy Crowe said, there are contradictions.  We are proactive on the hunger issue but we have fallen behind on the biofuels issue.  We cannot give with one hand and take with the other.  There is no doubt our relationship with African countries is changing.  It is no longer a donor relationship and we are in a strong position to secure trade agreements.  I hope they will be reputable and that the tax issue will be included.  We will support tax justice and oppose illicit capital flight.<\/p><p>  I support the aid programme but human rights are abused in some of the recipient countries.  Our embassies and ambassadors can make these issues known in diplomatic circles.  There was a problem with the provision of aid in Uganda but there are serious issues for homosexuals in Uganda and the way in which they are treated.  These issues should be taken on board through diplomatic contacts.<\/p><p>  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister about South Sudan recently.  The embassy in Ethiopia could have a role to play in reconciliation.  I visited Mozambique recently as part of a joint monitoring team and tensions are reappearing between Renamo and Frelimo.  Some of those we met said Ireland has a role and it could be a strong voice and give a strong lead in reconciliation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2014012200013#M00100","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1390407000,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response to the international requirements that arose during the year.  Many unforeseen emergencies occurred to which Ireland responded.  The Minister and the Minister of State responded admirably even in the current difficult economic circumstances.  It is important to recognise that we hope to return as quickly as possible to working towards the target of 0.7% of GDP in our contribution to international aid but we must work within the budget we have.  It is most important to ensure the aid goes to those for whom it was intended and there are no circumstances in which other parties can benefit from funds intended for a particular objective.<\/p><p>  I agree with my colleagues regarding Lesotho, which was a great example of how successful Irish Aid can be in a bilateral aid programme.  Ireland undertook the sponsorship of the programme in a one to one fashion which was easy to monitor and it was easy to ensure the funding was properly focused.  This is being replicated elsewhere.<\/p><p>  The integrity of international aid is hugely important and the degree to which we can be certain that we have adequate checks and balances in place to ensure the moneys collected at this time go to where they are intended and that nobody cynically decides to intervene negatively, which would lead to an undermining of public confidence in the aid programme.<\/p><p>  I agree with the upgrading of facilities in Sierra Leone and the new status of the mission and so on.  The staff should be acknowledged and complimented for the work they did in the past in difficult circumstances.  Their commitment to the cause has been impressive.  When we visited the embassy last year, we were greeted by an all female staff.  This was not the average downtown office with all the facilities and services laid on such as the Internet, street lighting, footpaths and community services.  There is serious social deprivation in the area.  There are no footpaths, sewerage schemes or public lighting.  Nothing has changed since the British left in the early 1960s.  It was a challenging scenario in which to deploy our diplomatic service.  The staff improvised and they had a significant positive impact in challenging circumstances, which should be recognised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2014012200013#M00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1390407000,"counter":449,"content":"<p>It is incumbent on me to add to the praise of the three ladies based in Sierra Leone.

I also thank the committee members for their constant unanimous support for what Irish Aid is doing.  Without that, it would be difficult for us to maintain the level of aid we provide.  This year's allocation is approximately &euro;600 million, which is a 4% reduction but, nevertheless, in the most difficult circumstances, it is being maintained at a high level.<\/p> <p>The commitment based on the programme for Government has been to move towards the 0.7%.  That clearly has been very difficult in present circumstances, but as the situation recovers the commitment is that the curve will move in the right direction.  We will be looking forward to improvement in the years to come.<\/p><p> Deputy Smith and others asked about Syria.  We had a humanitarian pledging conference in Kuwait the week before last.  It realised &euro;2.4 billion and the overall target was &euro;6.5 billion so clearly we were short of the amount that was being sought.  Ireland made a contribution of &euro;12 million.  This is the second pledging conference and last year we made a contribution of, I believe, &euro;4.7 million, but then in the course of the year that increased to &euro;14 million.  When one considers the circumstances in Syria, it is the direst conflict that is taking place at present with 130,000 people killed in less than three years and more than 3 million people are refugees or displaced internally.  Some 9 million to 10 million, which is nearly half the population, are in serious difficulty on a humanitarian basis.  Many of us saw last night's programme which highlighted the executions and deaths of detainees who had been tortured and-or starved in many cases.  That may only be the tip of the iceberg and many other atrocities may have yet to come to light.  It is an incredibly dire conflict and extremely complicated.  Today talks are commencing in Geneva and we are hopeful that some progress can be made.<\/p><p> As an afterthought, regarding the Chairman's trip to Tehran, I met the Iranian Foreign Minister at the pledging conference in Kuwait.  He specifically asked to meet me to discuss matters.  I asked him to use the good offices that Tehran had with the regime in Syria to allow humanitarian aid freedom of access, which is one of the major problems at present.  All of the contributions referred to that.  Hopefully some progress can be made in that respect.  However, it remains a very difficult situation.  There is a difficulty with the quantity of funding required because of the enormity of the problem and the difficulty of the international donor community being able to provide it.  That could create a crisis in its own right and the United Nations is very concerned in that respect.  Of course the impact on surrounding countries is colossal.  These are small countries such as Jordan and Lebanon, which I have visited in recent weeks, as well as Turkey which the T&aacute;naiste visited late last year.  These countries and to some extent Iraq and Egypt have all had an enormous burden imposed on the infrastructures of what are already fragile countries, particularly Lebanon and Jordan.  All of that creates a very volatile mix on top of the ongoing humanitarian crisis.<\/p><p> I was asked about reductions in the Irish Aid budget.  The reduction is 4% but we have endeavoured to keep it as fair and even as possible.  Members will notice that the reductions are pretty much between 2% and 4% across the board in each area.  We have sought to lengthen out and refocus on areas some of the priority issues with which we deal so that no area is excessively damaged.  The largest quantitative cut will be in the area of the funding that is used bilaterally through our embassies in the various partner countries and also regarding the various NGOs with which we deal.  We are very anxious to retain emergency aid and we have been one of the very strong contributors to emergency aid throughout the world both in areas of immediate need and also in areas with long-term and forgotten conflicts.<\/p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne asked about the &euro;1.7 million going to our universities.  The relationship between our third level institutions and colleges abroad, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, is substantial and it is important that we maintain that.  We also have the young scientist of the year in Tanzania, which is an extraordinarily successful initiative.  I am contemplating extending that to other sectors in Africa.  I believe it is extremely important to retain our emphasis on the links between the educational systems in the various countries.<\/p><p> In Uganda the money has all been restored - there is no question about that.  In October 2012 the T&aacute;naiste suspended more than &euro;16 million of assistance that was due to be channelled through the Government of Uganda, as a result of the discovery of fraud in the office of the Prime Minister.  The full funding that had been misappropriated was restored to Irish funds by Christmas.  I compliment our director, Mr. Brendan Rogers, on the urgency with which he pursued the matter.  Subsequently we pressed the Government of Uganda for concerted action following the fraud.  To date the Ugandan director of public prosecutions has opened 99 case files and Irish Aid will be following these very closely.  The cases are with the director of public prosecutions and the will obviously be following due process.<\/p><p> In 2014 the aid programme will be delivered through non-governmental partners as well as ongoing support to the office of the auditor general to strengthen its forensic investigation and special audit functions.  We have taken very strong action in that respect.  When I was in Uganda in November I met the auditor general and his officers.  We, of course, have been contributing to the strengthening of the capacity of the auditor and his officers.  That office has the country divided into six sections and has recruited approximately 400 people allowing it to move into all the different areas on the ground.  They gave the impression of having a detailed and intensive operational capacity at this point.<\/p><p> I further indicated to the auditor general that I would invite him to come to Ireland at an appropriate time in the first half of the year to address this committee and to address other functions so that we could bring to the attention of the people the steps that have been taken by Irish Aid and the capacity that was now being created in Uganda and other countries in which we are engaged to ensure that matters of this nature do not recur.  We also want to highlight that when this occurred the office of the auditor general had the capacity to go right up to the office of the Prime Minister and investigate what had happened.<\/p><p> A number of Deputies expressed sadness at the closure of our embassy in Lesotho with which we would all agree.  It was opened in 1974 and is our oldest programme - now partner - country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2014012200013#M00700","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390408800,"counter":457,"content":"<p>The Chairman is usually there before us.

However, it does not cover the situation where a person remains in employment but is on lower earnings or is off pay.  For example, a person may become ill and though remaining in employment may be temporarily off pay or not in receipt of payment.  The same could arise with regard to maternity or carer's leave.  In this scenario the person would still be in employment but his or her earnings may not be sufficient to meet the obligations under the attachment order.  The amendments in this group are designed to address this gap in the Bill by providing for the variation of an attachment order where the change in a person's earnings is temporary and for the revocation of the order where the change is of a more permanent nature.  This is an important issue which needs to be addressed in the substance of the Bill.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 12 is the important amendment.  It provides for the insertion of a new subsection (4) in section 15.  The new subsection provides for the employer to advise the court when it determines that a person's earnings are, for whatever reason, insufficient to satisfy the attachment order previously made.  Amendment No. 11 amends section 14 to allow for the making of a variation order which varies the original order to take account of changed circumstances where advised by the employer under the new section 15(4).  If the changed circumstances are such that it is unlikely that the person's earnings will become sufficient in the future to satisfy the order the court can move to the other option in the Bill which is the alternative option of community service, where appropriate, or imprisonment.  In circumstances where an individual's finances had changed so that he or she was unable to make payments, the natural order would be a residual community service order if the court deemed it appropriate.  If the sum outstanding on a fine was very small, such as &euro;20 or &euro;30, I would expect in the circumstances that the court would accept the position.  This amendment gives the court discretion to deal in a sensible and humane way with individuals who find themselves in such a situation.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 2, 9,10, 13 and 14, are mainly technical amendments to take account in other sections of the amendments to sections 14 and 15.  Amendment No. 13 amends subsection 16(2) in like regard. It inserts the words, &quot;in the interests of justice&quot; at the end of the subsection.  In the normal course where an attachment order has not been satisfied, the person is summoned to court under subsection 16(3).  Either a community service order is made or the person is imprisoned.  However, subsection 16(2) allows the court not to proceed to these options if the person pays the fine or if the court decides otherwise.  The intention is that the court would exercise its discretion in the interests of justice and the addition of these words at the end of the subsection makes it clear that the judge has a discretion as to how to approach the matter in the context of the individual circumstances of the individual affected.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014012200003#B01300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1390384800,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I refer to an issue which the Minister and I might discuss later.

I ask the Minister to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014012200003#B01400","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1390384800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>The Deputy raises an interesting issue.  The Unfair Dismissals Act and anti-discrimination legislation are in place.  My initial reaction is that these legislative provisions would adequately cover that possibility.  I do not believe an employer who would conduct itself in that way would be acting lawfully.  I do not think the fact that an attachment order could be made could properly result in anyone's dismissal.<\/p><p>  This is an issue which has been settled.  As long ago as 1976 attachment orders were introduced under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976.  These were not introduced in a criminal context but rather in the context of family law.  At that time when maintenance orders were made for the support of a spouse and children, if a person who was clearly in a position to afford to make payments reneged on making payment, the courts since then have been able to make attachment or earnings orders.  That regime of attachment of earnings orders has been extended over the years to support payment orders in judicial separation cases and divorce cases and made under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 for the maintenance of children.  This Bill deals with an attachment order instead of a fine but it is a similar order in that it orders that a portion of salary be paid directly.  I do not think this is a problem issue but I am very happy to examine it in order to ensure that it is not a difficulty.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014012200003#B01500","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390385400,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 3 and 16 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014012200004#C00300","speaker":"1105"},{"type":"speech","time":1390385400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<blockquote><br \/>In page 5, line 11, to delete &quot;compensation, costs&quot; and substitute &quot;costs, compensation&quot;.<\/blockquote>Heretofore, a person on whom a fine was imposed either paid that fine in full by the due date or failed to do so, in which case a warrant was activated and the individual could be arrested and brought to prison.  Under the new arrangements, part-payment of fines is possible.  This is an important provision in terms of ensuring that persons of limited means have a period of time in which to pay a fine and can do so on an incremental basis.  In addition, we must ensure that where people are made redundant, they do not find themselves at the receiving end of a warrant.<\/p><p>  &quot;Fines&quot; is defined in section 2 to include costs, compensation, expenses and the penalty itself.  Where a fine is part-paid, it is necessary to set out how the part-paid fine is to be allocated where it is made up of a number of different elements.  The new section 24 provides that where less than the total due is collected, the order of satisfaction is costs, compensation, expenses and the penalty.  The amendment to section 2 is a minor drafting amendment to reflect the order of satisfaction in section 24.  The latter section provides the necessary changes to address that position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014012200004#C00400","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1390385400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014012200004#C00900","speaker":"1105"},{"type":"speech","time":1390385400,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<blockquote><br \/>In page 8, line 4, to delete &quot;12 months&quot; and substitute &quot;24 months&quot;.<\/blockquote>I welcome the Minister to the committee.  This Bill is very much welcome, particularly in the context of the report on overcrowding in Cork Prison that was published some weeks ago.  Unfortunately, many judges continue to imprison people for non-payment of fines, a practice which causes great difficulty for governors who are struggling to manage numbers.  I have been impressed with every governor with whom I have engaged.  They are people who take considerable pride in the public service they provide and are keen to secure a good balance in their prisons.  We all want to get to a stage where people who are handed a fine by the court are able to repay it.  As it stands, people know that if they fail to pay a fine they will face no more than a night in prison or, more likely, no time in prison at all because of the overcrowding problem.  That is unfair to those who repay their fines.  In short, the system is not working properly.<\/p><p>  My amendments Nos. 4, 6 and 7 are straightforward, their purpose being to facilitate people in making fine repayments.  Amendment No. 4 seeks to restore the position under the original Fines Act whereby people would be given 24 months to make repayment, rather than the 12 months provided for in this Bill.  Our objective is to ensure the maximum possible number of people pay their fines and thus avoid either community service or prison.  Allowing them 24 months to do so is entirely reasonable and affords them every opportunity to meet their obligations.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are in the same vein of seeking to make the system more sustainable.  The Free Legal Advice Centres and other organisations have expressed concern in this regard.  These amendments seek to make the system more affordable and doable in order to achieve maximum compliance with fine payment obligations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014012200004#C01000","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1390385400,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I will begin by dealing with my amendment No. 5 in this group of amendments.  Subsection 6(3) requires a person who is in employment and who avails of the instalment process for paying a fine to provide certain information to the court.  It was intended that this information would be available to the courts for use should it be necessary to make an attachment order at a later date.  On reflection, having consulted further on the matter with the Courts Service, I am proposing that this requirement be deleted.  The collection of the data concerned would impose an onerous burden on either the Courts Service or any agency responsible for administering the instalments system.  By the time the information is used, it could very well be out of date and unreliable.  Moreover, the information in question is the same information a person would be required to provide when an attachment order is being made.  There is little or no advantage to be gained from collecting it earlier.  In many cases, a situation will never arise where there is a need to utilise the information.<\/p><p>  While the amendments proposed by Deputy Mac Lochlainn all stand in their own right, it is useful to consider the regime that would result from their application, namely, one under which all fines, no matter how small, would be eligible to be paid by instalment over 24 months.

I will make a relatively short statement as I will not cover what is in the appendices to my presentation.  I understand that there are three areas in which the committee are interested - the competitive tendering of subsidised bus services, rural transport and the new local area hackney licence.  I will deal briefly with each of those in turn.<\/p><p>  First, on our plan to tender bus services, the current contracts with Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann expire in December this year.  Following a national consultation exercise last year, we recently notified the European Commission of our intention to do the following: to enter into further contracts with Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2014 for a period of five years; to amend those contracts in 2016 to reduce the services by 10% within those contracts; and to provide those removed services through separate contracts following tender competitions.  We plan to start the prequalification stages of those tender competitions in December of this year.<\/p><p>  The existing operators, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, will be able to tender for those 10% of routes alongside other providers.  While this means that the existing publicly subsidised bus market will be partially opened to tendering, all the key decisions affecting the public will continue to be made by the National Transport Authority.  We will apply the same level of control and centralised planning to the tendered routes as to the routes which are currently operated by the two CIE companies.  We will predetermine the routes, the schedules, the vehicle types and standards, the fares and the customer service requirements.  A contracted operator will have no say in fares, routes or frequencies.  Customers will be able to use the Leap card, free travel passes will be accepted and the services will be included in our journey planner and real time apps and on the street-side real time displays.  The branding will also be determined by the authority as well as accessibility standards and emission standards for pollutants and noise, and compliance will be required with employment law in terms of applicable pay and terms of employment.  The object is that this will ensure that the customer's public transport experience will be seamless across the country &ndash; there should be no discernible quality difference to bus users regardless of which operator is operating the services. The services will have been designed and will be supervised, in the customer&rsquo;s best interests, by the authority.<\/p><p>  In the case of Dublin Bus services, the routes that will be opened to tender are the orbital routes and some local routes around the city.  For those who are familiar with them, examples of the routes are route 17 from Rialto to Blackrock, route 33B from Swords to Portrane and route 111 from D&uacute;n Laoghaire to Loughlinstown.  For Bus &Eacute;ireann services, the routes for tender will be the city services in Waterford and certain commuter routes into Dublin along the N4 and N7 corridors, for example, routes 120 from Tullamore and 124 from Portlaoise.  A full list of the routes to be tendered is set out in appendix 1 to this presentation.  We expect to commence the prequalification process in December and at that time we will advertise the tenders in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union<\/i> and in a national Irish newspaper.<\/p><p>  Moving on to the local area hackney licence, the Taxi Regulation Review Report, published by the Government in January 2012, recommended the introduction of a local area hackney licence to address transport deficits in some rural areas.  Certain areas have no public bus services nor have they taxi or hackney services operating in them.  To address this need it was decided to introduce a lower cost local hackney licence to service these isolated areas.<\/p><p>  In November 2013 the authority created, by statutory regulation, a new form of hackney licence, the main features of which are that the vehicle must meet all hackney requirements other than luggage space requirements; it must meet all age rules &ndash; the vehicle must be under 10 years; the fee for the licence issue is to be &euro;50; a tax clearance certificate is required; the licence is non-transferable; and the licence would expire after three years at which time a new application could be made for a subsequent licence.  To ensure that the issue of this licence will address a real deficit in services, we have put in place a number of requirements in respect of the licence application.  It must include the following: written confirmation of the need for the service from either an established group representing local businesses or a community group who has been granted charity able tax status by Revenue; and an analysis of the need for the service carried out by the relevant local authority with a letter to the National Transport Authority confirming the need for the service.  The driver of such vehicle will need to have the appropriate small public sector vehicle licence and a fee of &euro;20 relates to such an application.  We have advised the industry of the new procedure and have written to local authorities explaining their role in validation.  All this only occurred last month and we have yet to receive an application.<\/p><p>  Regarding the rural transport programme, I am sure the members are aware that a value for money review of the rural transport programme was published by the Department of Transport in 2012.  The review identified that the organisational structures were contributing to the high cost of administration.  That is not to say that the individual groups managing or directly providing services were not pursuing efficiencies and operating well - they were - rather the number of groups was simply too high at 35, leading to a replication of administrative charges across the country.  In mid-2013 we devised a new organisational framework for these services and we decided to reduce the 35 groups to 18 transport co-ordination units, based on local authority boundaries or amalgamated local authorities boundaries.  In autumn of last year we initiated an application process from within the existing groups to run these new units. The applications have been assessed and all the groups have been advised, as of Monday as, to who will comprise the new units. The listing is set out in appendix 2 to this presentation.<\/p><p>  Separate from this organisational structure, we asked the Department of transport to bring forward amending legislation in order that we could enter into services contracts directly with those rural transport groups who own their own fleet.  Their fleet contains many wheelchair accessible vehicles and it was vital that we could continue to subsidise those particular service providers.  I am very pleased that the amending legislative provision was contained in the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, which has now cleared the way for us to offer bus service contracts, without competitive tendering, to Bantry Rural Transport, Comharchumann Chl&eacute;ire Teo., Clare Accessible Transport, Meath Accessible Transport, North Fingal Rural Transport Company, the Community of Lougharrow Social project, and Carlow, Kilkenny and South Tipperary Rural Transport Company, known as Ring a Link.  Alongside these major changes, we have proceeded with some other important developments.  We have identified the appropriate IT system for managing such transport provision across the country - the dispatch organisation of services.  The Sligo Leader Partnership, funded by the Department of transport, had developed a system and it has innovated its contract with its system supplier to the authority and we have commenced further development of that system for multiple organisation units for all these 18 transport co-ordination units.  When finalised it will be a standard across the country.<\/p><p>  We are piloting new rural transport services, which co-ordinate with existing school transport services in County Roscommon, in Tramore, County Waterford, and the Copper Coast service also in County Waterford.  These started in December 2013 and they avail of the empty return leg of school services.  In 2014 we will start retendering all of all rural transport services provided by private bus operators.  Currently there is nearly 300 contracts in place.  They need to be refreshed and gradually over the next 18 months these will be tendered by the authority. <\/p><p>  In summary, the overall restructuring has been necessary in order to protect the level of services in rural areas.  As with all State-funded transport services, savings have been required.  Our ambition has been to reduce administration but protect services.  There are challenges remaining throughout the year in the restructuring but a strong efficient foundation will be created that will enable expansion of these services in the future on foot of economic growth.  That concludes my presentation and I hope we can answer any queries that arise. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014012200004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1390383600,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gerry Murphy.

We believe careful management by the bus companies, along with retirement and increased growth and increased demand for services, will mean that the need for transfer of employees may not occur.  If a transfer of employees does occur, they are protected by transfer of undertakings regulations and EU directives in that regard.  Terms and conditions are protected.  The protection of employment on transfer of undertakings regulations are silent in respect of pensions.  We will meet the NBRU during the week and we will discuss pensions and any requirement on the successful tenderer to provide a pension scheme.  In general, terms and conditions are protected.  It is an important item of European legislation transposed into Irish law, which means that when an asset or a service is moved on, the person's job is not lost.  I understand the concerns but there is an opportunity to prepare for the 2016 change.  Some 10% of Dublin Bus services will be tendered and in the case of Bus &Eacute;ireann it would have less of an impact.  Bus &Eacute;ireann also runs commercial operations, such as the school transport services.  We are talking about taking 40 buses out of 1,200 buses, which is only about 3% of its operations nationally.  In the case of Waterford, city services will be taken for tendering but there will be residual commercial services and school transport services.  At the Waterford depot, the services that will be going out to tender amount to only 15% of the depot size.  There was a careful balance between maintaining the coherence of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, being able to run efficiently and opening up for competitive tendering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014012200005#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1390384200,"counter":639,"content":"<p>Will the routes lead to a better service or are they being cherry picked as high-volume routes?

There are two British experiences, one of which is deregulation outside of London.  It allowed for a commercial response that was uncontrolled and unmanaged by the state authorities.  There was a controlled response within London, which is a regulated sector.  Transport for London decided everything and put routes out to tender.  Our model is very similar to that of Transport for London.  There is no case that commercial considerations drive the quality of service for the public.  Senator Mooney asked whether we have cherry picked high-value routes.  In fact, we have done the opposite.  Local and orbital routes for Dublin Bus are, financially, some of the poorest performing routes so it is not the case that we are cherry picking high-value routes.<\/p><p>  Internationally, over the past 30 years, bus tendering has grown throughout the world.  The markets have opened up.  In Europe, only three countries have not used competitive tendering, namely, Greece, Northern Ireland and until recently the Republic of Ireland.  In fact, Ireland used it for M&amp;A Coaches contract in Portlaoise, the first public subsidy service that we put out to tender.  The services we are putting out to tender are subsidised public service obligation services.  While there may be commercial operators on corridors, they are not doing the same job as the public service obligation services.  They are multi-stop services serving areas that commercial services will not serve because they are not commercially viable.<\/p><p>  The Chairman asked me about letters for comfort.  Any letters of comfort that apply within the companies will apply.  It is up to Dublin Bus to identify the staff they consider are changing with the service and it is up to new organisations, if it is not Dublin Bus that wins the service, to take them on.

The 2009 report was not conducted on behalf of the authority but in general it made a number of statements about Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann being comparable with their peers.  One could take comfort from that as it seemed to say they were efficient.  However, a careful reading of the reports gives a slightly different picture.  For example, a case study of the Dublin Bus Finglas corridor was done and the authors identified 17% cost savings that could be made and this could be replicated across 13 other corridors in the city.  They said Bus &Eacute;ireann should subcontract and tender some of its services because smaller operators would perhaps be able to provide them at a cheaper price.  The Deloitte report, therefore, has issues in it as regards their efficiency.<\/p><p>  In general, subvention in Europe ranges between 30% and 70% in some cities.  However, it is not as low as perceived in Ireland.  It probably comes to approximately 50% of the revenue of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, which is the mean throughout Europe.  This comprises the base subvention, the free travel scheme supported by the Department of Social Protection and tax foregone through the taxsaver scheme under which the Revenue supports public transport.  I do not say it is the highest subvention in Europe but it is not the lowest.<\/p><p>  The Deputy mentioned Aircoach and wheelchair accessible fleets.  Aircoach runs a commercial service and currently in Ireland there is no requirement on licensed commercial services to have a wheelchair accessible fleet.  For example, Bus &Eacute;ireann does not have such a fleet on its commercial services.  The State, however, has invested in Dublin Bus and has funded buses that are wheelchair accessible.  I guarantee the Deputy that all the services we provide through the new competitive tenders will be 100% wheelchair accessible.<\/p><p>  He referred to the experience in the UK.  He is correct that outside London, there has been drop in bus services.  There might have been a splurge of growth in commercial bus services outside London but that diminished and the state went on to subsidise services.  I would not recommend that model.  However, within London, there has been massive growth in public transport.  Passenger numbers are as high now as they were in 1962 during the great age of public transport before the growth in car use.  There is continued growth in ridership and continued satisfaction.<\/p><p>  TUPE is a matter we will address.  We will talk to the unions and the companies and we will see what can be done with regard to that within the tender competition.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked why 10% of routes was chosen.  In constructing competitive tendering in any tender competition, one of the keys to realising value for money is to have competition and to have a significant number of people bidding for the services.  We did a market consultation in 2012 with both international and Irish operators and approximately 80 bus routes in the Dublin region would draw in large Irish operators and international operators to compete.  That would enlarge the pool.  If the number of routes is too small, the pool of operators will reduce.  A total of 80 routes may allow us to parcel a north and south tender competition, which we are looking at, and it may allow us to run that concurrently with the tender for Bus &Eacute;ireann commuter services to create a significant market that international and domestic operators could bid for in lots.  Throughout Europe major operators have come into all the cities and jurisdictions that have realised value and they have delivered the value.  Large global operators deliver value through competition.  They leverage their management resources and existing systems, all to the benefit of the contracting authority which can avail of that and pass on the benefits to the consumer.<\/p><p>  I guarantee the Deputy that the service will be the same.  There will be no discernible difference.  We hope it will realise cost savings for us to improve and increase services because the savings will be put back into the public transport system, whether that is in Dublin or in rural areas that have large gaps in services.  Every penny we realise in savings, therefore, will be put back into better services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014012200006#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1390384800,"counter":648,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy and his staff for their presentation.

I am before the committee today because it was an NTA decision.  It was driven by national legislation, and there is a requirement that before giving another direct award contract to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, there should be consideration of whether the public services could only be guaranteed in the economic interest by giving it to the companies.  We have completed the consideration and I am quite satisfied that we have carefully considered and balanced the needs of consumers and the requirement to keep viable companies.  There was no Government decision not to have Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  There is a need to test market pricing, and there are a number of benefits to competitive tendering.  It induces discipline, even in Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, to price and compete with other people for that 10%.  If somebody else wins, we have a benchmark on performance and cost base.  It will also bring competitive attention, for the next five years, on Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, whether they win or not.  That will be apparent for the next tendering phase, so the companies can maintain and manage prices in order to stay competitive.  If this process was not followed, one would end up - as we do - trying to determine fare increases for a monopoly where there is no benchmark or comparator.  It is particularly important to have some comparators in the Irish market so we can benchmark the performance of the State-owned bodies.<\/p><p>  I agree that the subsidy has served us well and we have made the case to the Minister that the subsidy should not be reduced any further.  In considering the next current revenue programme, the subsidy should be carefully protected.  With regard to the rural hackney licence, we have put in a structure with all the protections to ensure it will not knock out other viable businesses.  If no application came to us, we would not be concerned, as that would mean there is not a need.  Anybody going around rural Ireland would say there are gaps in the service at night or at particular times.  If there is some way we can service that need without affecting existing businesses, it would be a good measure.  This does not just involve local businesses, as community groups are also involved.  We are looking at the people in the area and the local authority responsible for the area, which have identified a gap.  The protection is very strong.<\/p><p>  With regard to routes being \"cut to bits\", as I stated earlier, I can absolutely guarantee that we will determine the routes.

I am of the opposite view.  It is very difficult for me to access public transport given where I live.  I commend the NTA on its route planner app &ndash; the national journey planner.  If I were to come from home this morning to work I had three options.  One was to leave on Monday afternoon.  The other was to leave yesterday morning, which would be okay, and the third option was to leave this morning for work yesterday.  On Monday I would have had a seven hour, six minute journey.  On Tuesday I would have had a six hour, 30 minute journey and today I would have had a six hour, 51 minute journey.  That is quite difficult.  That is one of the issues the National Transport Authority has.  In saying that, when one looks at the app and the options offered, it is extraordinary to see the mix of public and private options that are available.  That is encouraging.  It is one of the successes of the app.  That is not a criticism, it a vagary of where I live.<\/p><p>  That follows then to what we are doing.  We had a meeting with the NBRU and SIPTU representing drivers from both public and private companies.  They were at great pains to say they would not apologise for representing their members.  The unions represent their members.  The company, by and large, should represent the company and the customers.  We have a remit to represent taxpayers, both those who use public transport and those who do not.  We are the poor sods that have to represent them all and their conflicting interests.

Is he considering other routes at the moment for a future tendering process?  I am not talking about waiting to see what happens because the pace of change for whatever reason is slow.  Is the NTA considering a parallel process and doing the groundwork to consider other routes under the same criteria or even under different terms to achieve best value?<\/p><p>  I am pleased that it was confirmed that Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus can also tender for the routes.

The company which was delivering the service had an extremely busy year last year, but was unable to make a profit.

The terms of how they can operate are unclear.  Like my colleague, I suspect we will soon get representations regarding displacement and concerns about this.

Unfortunately, I was unable to attend earlier, but I did get the opportunity to read Mr. Murphy's presentation.  One of the concerns I have about the privatisation agenda is that I believe it opens up the potential for the future privatisation of our public transport network.  I am concerned about the possible development of a fragmented network.  I believe the current operators do an exceptionally good job at maintaining the joined-up network, but that may be undermined when the privatisation process starts.  I am also concerned that this process will not necessarily lead to a reduction in costs to the State or the delivery of a better service.<\/p><p>  Some years ago, a previous committee had the opportunity to visit London Bus and it was made clear to us at the time that the privatisation agenda there did not work.  The companies that won the tenders in that case became totally profit centred, with the result the service deteriorated.  Regardless of the existence of service level agreements, the bidding contest became so great that people found themselves unable to provide the service and allowed it to deteriorate.  There was poor timetabling, poor delivery of service, poor quality of buses and consumers moved away from taking public transport.  When the government had, effectively, to take back the operation of London Bus, it had to invest heavily to rebuild confidence.  I accept that the same is not happening here, because of the stepped approach of commencing with 10%, I see it as the beginning of a process I am disappointed the Government has allowed to happen.  I am particularly disappointed the Labour Party has allowed this to proceed.<\/p><p>  There is an issue also of the impact this will have on existing licence holders.  The transfer of undertaking will ensure that the individuals associated with the routes tendered will have to transfer to the new companies.  I suspect this will have some impact on Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.  I also suspect it will add to costs for them because currently costs are spread across 100% of the network, but now they will be spread across 90%.  I believe the change may also lead to increased fares.  We had a similar situation in the case of electricity, where the regulator required the price of electricity to increase to attract competitors into the market.  That was a farcical situation and we may be taking the same route here in order to meet our commitments on the introduction of competition and, perhaps, pursue the privatisation agenda of Fine Gael.<\/p><p>  I believe the NTA could have continued with the direct award process, which would have complied with the EU requirements and ensured we ended up with the best service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014012200009#J00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390386600,"counter":664,"content":"<p>Deputy Harrington asked whether we were considering a future tendering process at the moment for other routes.

Bus &Eacute;ireann either tenders for school transport services or they tender for subcontract operators to help them at peak times in their services.  It has run that tendering operation.  The operations for which we have tendered have been very small, as in the case of the one awarded to M&amp;A Coaches.  That operator provides a good quality service at very good value for money for the State and I presume the operator is earning a profit and is operating satisfactorily.  The requirement in any tendering process is that it is all done on a level playing field and that the person complies with all applicable statutory regulations.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Ann Phelan that low cost is not always the best value.  Quality and price considerations would be the norm for these types of contract awards.  I mentioned the buses in Waterford city.  It amounts to only 16 buses and Bus &Eacute;ireann has a residual 86 buses for its other operations.  I will ask Ms Anne Graham to deal with the questions on rural transport and school transport services.  With regard to picking the bus services, Deputy Dooley mentioned the loss of a joined-up network.  Nobody wants to lose a joined-up network.  The integration of the network is being provided by us in the National Transport Authority.  The only initiatives that have been integrated across all operators have been ours with the Leap card in Dublin, the journey planner app and the real time passenger information system.  As Deputy Harrington said, the options offered under the journey planner app include public and private operators.  For the first time, people have the option of a mix of public and private operators and there are also rural transport operators.  The integrating agent in the State for public transport is ourselves.  There have been examples of non-match of bus services meeting train timetables and all those types of issues which we are trying to address.<\/p><p>  The was reference to the beginning of a process.  I have answered Deputy Harrington's points but perhaps he wanted us to consider other routes.  The simple fact is that this was an authority decision, it is done now and 90% of it is confirmed for the next five years.  <\/p><p>  On the question of increased fares and the direct award EU requirement, definitely direct award complies with EU provisions.  National provisions require a review as to whether direct award is approved.  On the question of increased fares, fares have increased and we have been the agent that has been sanctioning an increase in fares.  There has been a very significant increase in fares to address not only the drop in subsidy but also the drop in patronage.  We hope that we are coming to the end of the cycle of those increased fares and that economic growth and the stabilisation of subsidy will allow us to only have modest fare increases in line with the CPI.  I will ask Mr. Hugh Creegan to deal with the questions on the rural hackney licence and Ms Anne Graham to deal with the questions on rural transport and school transport services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014012200010#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390387200,"counter":668,"content":"<p>On the query raised by, I believe, Deputy Harrington about the effect of this on existing operators, we recognise that is a real concern among operators in the industry and we have tried to get the balance right in the arrangement we struck.  I would make a number of other points on this.  This is not intended to be a perpetual licence, it is a licence for three years.  If it extends beyond three years, a completely new assessment process must be carried out.  We would be very much looking to the local authorities, in terms of the part of the analysis they have to do to support the application, to at least flag up the impacts upon the existing services.  They may not pick them all up but we would expect them to pick up some of them.  It is our intention and we have agreed with a taxi advisory committee, a statutory committee that has been set up, to keep the operation of these initial local area hackneys under review and if there is need for a recalibration or a slight change, we would certainly take that on board.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ann Phelan asked who monitors these licences and if they can make a profit.  To deal with the profit issue first, they most certainly can make a profit.  Because it is a hackney service, the fares are agreed effectively between the passenger and the driver, they are not set by us.  We anticipate and expect that the people provide the service for a profit reason.  Monitoring these licences is the same as monitoring taxi and hackney licences.  The key agency in the State with the most resources to monitor them is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it will have all the powers it needs to do that and, on top of that, we have a small number of enforcement officers who will also be keeping an eye on these licences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014012200010#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugh Creegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390387200,"counter":669,"content":"<p>In terms of rural transport and school transport integration, as we indicated, it is a pilot project being undertaken to see what will happen in terms of the cost efficiency, in particular, of using the same operator to run a school service and follow on by providing a rural transport service.  It will make sense in some locations where the school is based in a rural area rather than in a town where the operator can pick up people in a rural location.  We sought applications with regard to suggestions from all the rural transport groups but we received a very limited number of suggestions.   Waterford came forward and a local councillor suggested the ones in Roscommon and those are the four that we are trying out now.  We would like to extend the service, subject to funding being available.  Before we would retender our rural transport services we would consider the school transport services that are in existence to establish if we could better organise the services before we put them out to tender.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014012200010#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1390387200,"counter":670,"content":"<p>Is it possible for me then to contact Ms Graham with my concerns?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014012200010#K00600","speaker":"964"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1390387200,"counter":671,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014012200010#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1390387200,"counter":672,"content":"<p>Are there any further questions?
