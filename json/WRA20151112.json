This fund will operate on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme (BHJLS), which ran in 2014, and is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  This announcement will come as a welcome boost to the custodians of heritage properties.<\/p><p>In 2015, under the Structures at Risk Fund, an allocation of &euro;624,000 was available,<i><\/i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund which is administered through the local authorities encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  The fund was open to two applications per local authority of which one application may be in respect of a privately-owned building.  The amount of funding available per project was subject to a minimum level of &euro;15,000 and a maximum level of &euro;60,000.  Since 2011, in excess of 130 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.<\/p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department also funds, provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  The announcement of any proposed grant schemes can be monitored on .  It will be primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200052#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cultural Policy","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200052#WRA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[39258\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200052#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of the drafting of Ireland's first national culture policy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1206","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>At its meeting on 20 June 2014, the Government approved the drafting of a National Cultural Policy, <i>Culture 2025<\/i>, which will set out the high level aims and policies of the Government in this area in the period up until 2025.

Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions, is the responsibility of the Irish Film Board.  This includes assistance with locations for the making of films. In 2015, I approved a provision of &euro;14.6m for the Film Board, which maintained its funding at the same level as in 2014.  The allocation of resources from within that provision is a matter for the Film Board, as the statutorily independent agency responsible for the promotion and development of the Irish film industry.<\/p>  <p>  The other primary mechanism by which the Government supports the film industry is through section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - the Film Tax Relief Scheme.  This scheme has undergone a number of improvements, which took effect in January this year.  These changes have been well received and were developed following consultations between my Department, the Irish Film Board, the Department of Finance and the audio-visual industry.  The intention is to ensure that Ireland remains competitive in attracting film projects.  The Film Tax Relief Scheme has been extended to the end of 2020 and in the recent Budget the Government announced an increase in the cap on this tax relief from &euro;50 million to &euro;70 million.  I am confident that these measures will increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for film investment and allow the audio-visual production sector to maintain existing jobs and create new ones.  In this regard, Government Departments and public agencies are often key to assisting film companies in providing locations and other supports for film making. <\/p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental Group comprising officials from my Department and other relevant Departments and agencies was also established recently to examine and report on recommendations to increase foreign and domestic investment in Ireland&rsquo;s film and TV sound stage studio infrastructure in the face of growing demand for audio-visual content across multiple platforms.  This builds on the process commenced last year by the Irish Film Board, which sought expressions of interest in this regard.  The Group has been meeting on a regular basis since its first meeting in January of this year and its work is on-going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200052#WRA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200052#WRA03150"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[39494\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200052#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of the historic houses report which her Department is currently preparing; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were cohabiting.

Within one month of the adoption of a Commission warning, the Council will adopt a recommendation on the necessary policy measures and will set a maximum deadline of five months for implementation of the actions. If the situation is considered serious and urgent, a three month deadline may be set for effective implementation. Nationally, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012, the Government must prepare and lay before the D&aacute;il a correction plan within two months. The plan must be consistent with the Council's recommendations. Under the Act, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is responsible for monitoring if a plan is required and if a plan is performing. <\/p><p>If the Member State does not take effective action within the relevant deadline, the Council can make a decision to this effect by a qualified majority vote.

There is also the unknown market reaction to such an event and how this would impact on the State's ability to borrow and the subsequent debt servicing costs.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, going down this path would increase the risk that the State would not meet the 3% of GDP deficit limit\u00a0in time and be\u00a0made subject to the corrective arm of the SGP, which has\u00a0its own suite\u00a0of recommendations, monitoring and sanctions.<\/p><p>However,\u00a0compliance with the obligations of the preventive arm of the SGP is not and should not be primarily about avoiding sanctions and the wider market consequences that would be likely to follow.\u00a0 It is about\u00a0ensuring sustainable public finances and lower debt levels.\u00a0 Doing so\u00a0is the best way to avoid future crises arising from domestic sources in our public finances and to protect ourselves against crises arising from matters beyond our control because it will assist in the\u00a0rebuilding of\u00a0our fiscal capacity or ability to borrow, if needed in the future.

Generally, such proposals encompass either specific products, such as sugar sweetened drinks, or a range of food products with certain characteristics, such as\u00a0foods with saturated fats above a certain level, foods with added sugar, or foods with added salts.<\/p>  <p>  In 2011, Denmark introduced a tax\u00a0of DKK 16 (at that time &euro;2.15)\u00a0per kilogram of saturated fat on all food products produced or imported into Denmark which exceeds 2.3g per 100g in saturated fat. This tax was provided for the in 'Danish Fat Tax Act 2011', which commenced on 1 October 2011. The Danish 'Fat Tax' applied to meat, certain diary products, animal fats, edible oils and other fats, margarine, spreadable composite products, and other products which are considered substitutes of the above-mentioned foods. <\/p>  <p>  The tax was\u00a0 collected at the first point of supply in Denmark,\u00a0and producers and importers of such products were required to register with\u00a0the Danish tax authorities, to facilitate the collection of the Fat Tax. Such persons could use publicly available information which provided standards for the levels of specific foodstuffs, the amount of saturated fat based on technical analysis of the specific food product, or nutrition labelling. <\/p>  <p>  In November 2012, the Danish Government made a decision to abolish the Fat Tax, citing concerns relating to cross-border shopping and the significant compliance costs imposed on food producers, many of whom were small and medium-sized enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2011, Hungary imposed taxes on energy drinks, snacks with a salt content in excess of 1g per 100g, sweets, biscuits, and ice-creams. In January 2012, these food-related\u00a0taxes were extended to chocolate with added and total sugar of greater than 40g per 100g and a cocoa content of less than 40g per 100g, to all sweetened products with added\u00a0and total\u00a0sugar\u00a0of greater than 25g per 100g, and to syrups or concentrates with a fruit content of less than 25%. All of these taxes are imposed volumetrically, with the duty imposed a specific amount per quantity of the product itself, rather than the added sugar, added salt or saturated fat content as in the Danish case.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that\u00a0Danish\u00a0case indicates that it is feasible to introduce the types of tax referred to by the Deputy. However,\u00a0the feasibility of\u00a0a tax does not imply that it is desirable\u00a0to impose one. I think any proposal would have to take into account, inter alia,\u00a0the compliance cost for smaller producers of products such as meat and cheese, the requirements for additional Revenue resources to administer a tax of this nature,\u00a0the possible cross-border effects and, not least, the potential impact of such measures\u00a0on\u00a0the Agri-Food Sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I would also note that any tax introduced would have to comply with Article 110 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which prohibits Member States imposing internal taxation of any kind on products of another Member State in excess of that imposed directly or indirectly on similar domestic products.\u00a0Furthermore, it is a requirement that a Member State must notify the Commission under Directive 98\/34\/EC ('the technical standards Directive') of\u00a0a draft law to provide\u00a0for the aforementioned taxes. Upon notification, the Commission and other Member States may raise concerns as to whether the draft law is a potential barrier to trade. In addition, such taxes may give rise to State aid concerns.\u00a0While not insurmountable, these are matters which policy makers must be cognisant of when  designing a new tax or levy.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that\u00a0Norway, France,\u00a0and Finland\u00a0currently impose a volumetric tax on sugar sweetened drinks. A number of other non-European Economic Area states impose special ad valorem taxes on soft drinks, including Norway, Australia, and Mexico.<\/p>  <p>  At this time,\u00a0there is not enough publically available information to estimate the yield from a volumetric tax on added sugar, added salt, and saturated fats. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200057#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Policy","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200057#WRF00550"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[39827\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200057#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the impact for Ireland&rsquo;s economy generally, and in terms of reducing Ireland&rsquo;s debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratio, and the Government&rsquo;s deficit, if public expenditure had been increased in budget 2016 by &euro;12.8 billion and taxes had been raised by &euro;16.4 billion instead of the measures adopted in budget 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1030","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":195,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[39828\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200057#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the impact for Ireland&rsquo;s economy generally, and in terms of reducing Ireland&rsquo;s debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratio, and the Government&rsquo;s deficit, if public expenditure had been increased in budget 2016 by &euro;8.7 billion and taxes had been raised by &euro;8.8 billion instead of the measures adopted in budget 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1030","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":196,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 73 together.<\/p><p>The general government deficit and debt figures for 2016, as per Budget 2016, are currently projected to be -&euro;2.8 billion (-1.2% of GDP) and &euro;207.1 billion (92.8% of GDP) respectively.

The resultant impact on a purely iterative\/accounting basis of the proposed alternative measures submitted by the Deputy in this Parliamentary Question are outlined in the table below. <table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Option 1<\/th><th>Option 2<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>2016<\/td><td>2016<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>White Paper 2016 General government balance (% of GDP)<\/td><td>-0.8%<\/td><td>-0.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>White Paper 2016 General government balance (&euro;m)<\/td><td>-1,858<\/td><td>-1,858<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Proposed additional Expenditure (&euro;m)<\/td><td>-12,800<\/td><td>-8,700<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Proposed additional Revenue (taxation) (&euro;m)<\/td><td>16,400<\/td><td>8,800<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Projected General government balance (&euro;m)<\/td><td>1,742<\/td><td>-1,758<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>White Paper 2016 GDP (&euro;m)<\/td><td>222,514<\/td><td>222,514<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Projected General government balance (% of GDP)<\/td><td>0.8%<\/td><td>-0.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Difference in balance compared to Budget 2016<\/td><td>2.0%<\/td><td>0.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Estimated GG Debt based on White Paper (&euro;bn)<\/td><td>206.2<\/td><td>206.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Projected GG Debt based on Options 1 &amp;amp; 2 (&euro;bn)<\/td><td>202.6<\/td><td>206.1<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Source: Department of Finance<\/p><p>From this table it is apparent that option 1 would improve the general government balance (GGB) in 2016 compared to Budget 2016 by 2.0% of GDP while option 2 would improve the GGB by 0.5% of GDP. Assuming that the improvement to the balance did in fact arise as indicated, there would, all other things being equal, be a reduction in the borrowing requirements for the year leading to a comparable decrease in overall general government debt. Under option 1, no borrowing would be required to fund the Exchequer, and, assuming the surplus is used to repay debt, projected debt levels would be reduced by &euro;4.5 billion compared to the Budget 2016 forecast. Under option 2, there would be a reduction in the deficit of approximately &euro;1 billion compared to Budget 2016, thus reducing the projected debt by a similar amount. The nominal debt for 2016 under option 1 would then be circa &euro;202.6 billion and approximately &euro;206.1 billion for option 2 compared with &euro;207.1 billion forecast in Budget 2016. Based on the GDP levels in the White Paper, the debt levels would represent an improvement on the Budget 2016 forecasts of the order of 2.0% of GDP and 0.5% of GDP respectively. <\/p><p>It should be noted that the Gross Domestic Product presented in the table is the same as that utilised in the White Paper and consequently does not take into account the potentially numerous\u00a0second round economic effects that would arise from the alternative expenditure and revenue aggregates proposed by the Deputy in his two questions.\u00a0 Forecasting the overall impact on GDP, which could be\u00a0significantly negative,\u00a0would be a major task, which my Department is not in a position to carry out. For instance,\u00a0much would depend on the precise composition of the revenue and expenditure measures, and these have not been clarified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200057#WRF00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Data","counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200057#WRF00850"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[39842\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200057#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount paid by each eligible bank under the bank levy to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":199,"content":"<p>Section 126AA of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 applies to holders of banking licences and building societies in 2011 that were obliged to collect and pay over more than &euro;100,000 in Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) in that year.\u00a0 The section provides for a bank levy, in the form of a stamp duty, equal to 35% of the amount of DIRT (known as the &quot;assessable amount&quot;) paid in 2011.

This represents approximately\u00a099.83% of the total Ordinary Shares in issue. The forthcoming capital reorganisation will see the conversion of &euro;2.14 billion of 2009 Preference Shares into &euro;2.67bn worth of newly issued Ordinary Shares. The exact number of Ordinary Shares to be issued is currently the subject of discussion between officials of my Department and the bank. A current and fair calculation of the bank's underlying value will form the basis of this discussion. Therefore it is too early to give a precise number of Ordinary Shares that the State will receive, though given that the State currently owns such a high proportion of the Ordinary Shares, the percentage ownership of the company will not change materially.<\/p>  <p>  The State's 2009\u00a0Preference Shares are a perpetual instrument and there is therefore no predetermined maturity date - they are repayable at the option of AIB subject to the bank having sufficient capital and also receiving regulatory approval. The SSM approval for a redemption of &euro;1.36\u00a0billion of the Preference Shares for &euro;1.7 billion is conditional on the conversion of the remainder to Ordinary equity. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement which allows the State to begin monetising its investment in the bank while allowing AIB to normalise its Balance Sheet. The conversion of Preference Shares into Ordinary Shares does not in any way delay the return of capital from the State's investment in AIB, rather the opposite is the case. Conversion of a portion of the Preference Shares fast tracks the bank's ability to remunerate and redeem State aid through the bank's own cashflow and also opens up the possibility of the State monetising some of its equity\u00a0investment through a sale process in the future. <\/p>  <p>  The conversion and redemption will bring to an end the annual payment of dividends on the Preference Shares.

The reduction in the interest rates on the EU element of these loans, achieved in 2011, resulted in estimated savings of some &euro;9 billion over the initially envisaged lifetime of these loans.\u00a0 The repayment of some 81 per cent of IMF loans, which was completed earlier this year, will generate further interest savings, estimated at over &euro;1.5 billion, over the original lifetime of these loans. The current interest rate on the residual IMF loan balance is just 1.05 per cent. <\/p>  <p>  There is limited scope for additional interest savings resulting from further early repayment of EU-IMF programme loans. <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, unlike in the case of the early IMF repayment of late 2014 and early 2015, Ireland would be subject to a break-cost charge were it to repay some of the other loan facilities early. These charges could negate any potential savings arising from a potential early repayment.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the early repayment of programme loans to the IMF, EFSF, EFSM, United Kingdom, Sweden or Denmark would trigger automatic mandatory proportional early repayments to each of the other programme funding partners unless, as was the case with the early IMF repayment, the other lenders agreed to waive the mandatory proportional early repayment clause. \u00a0A condition of this agreement to waive this clause in the case of the early IMF repayment was that Ireland retains a significant element of IMF funding in order to maintain the IMF's participation in post-programme monitoring for the duration initially envisaged, which is out to 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would add that as part of the recent re-financing of a &euro;5 billion EFSM maturity, resulting from the maturity extensions to EFSF and EFSM loans granted in mid-2013, the EU raised funding at a weighted average yield of just over 1.1 per cent and with a weighted average life of approximately 14 years.

In relation to the question of banks being risk averse, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the recently published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey April - September 2015 <i>)<\/i>.  A\u00a0total of 1,500 telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of Irish micro, small and medium SMEs.  The survey shows that, when pending applications are excluded, 85% of credit applications to banks were approved or partially approved. <\/p><p>In addition, both AIB and Bank of Ireland have increased new lending significantly year on year.  Bank of Ireland recently announced new credit approvals for Irish businesses to the end of September 2015 of &euro;3.6 billion, up c.13% on the same period last year.  Permanent TSB have also recently commenced lending to SMEs.  The Credit Review Office (CRO) continues to review loan applications which have been rejected by the banks and is overturning 55% of appeals.  I would encourage any SME who has had a credit application declined to avail of the services of the CRO ().<\/p><p>In relation to encouraging greater competition in the banking sector, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland's (SBCI)\u00a0mandate and objectives include the fostering and driving of competition in SME lending through the provision of low cost long term funding to both banks and non-bank providers of credit to SMEs.  In doing so, it seeks to facilitate the growth of smaller participants and the entry of new market participants by providing them with the low cost liquidity that will enable them to compete with the larger banks.\u00a0 SBCI funding is offered on substantially the same terms and the same price to all SME credit providers that are credible, credit worthy, can meet its operational requirements and pass on the benefit of the lower cost funding to their SME clients.  This creates a new forum for competition in the use of SBCI funding between banks and non-banks and enables emerging and newly entering SME credit platforms to grow their businesses.  Over 3,200 Irish SMEs benefited from SBCI loans in the SBCI's first\u00a0seven months in operation (March to\u00a0September 2015), borrowing &euro;110 million in total through AIB and Bank of Ireland. <\/p><p>More recently, the SBCI has announced its support for two strong emerging non-bank providers of credit to SMEs with a &euro;50 million facility now up and running with Finance Ireland, a provider of leasing and hire purchase financing for vehicles and equipment and a &euro;25 million facility with Merrion Fleet, which provides vehicles and fleet management services to SMEs at a lower cost.  Furthermore the SBCI has a pipeline of new SME credit providers that it intends to bring to the market over the next six months and beyond, which will further enhance competition and support new types of finance in the market.  Further details of the SBCI's current supported products and where they may be accessed are available on its website ).<\/p><p>The counter-guarantee amendments being brought forward by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Credit Guarantee Amendment Bill (2015) are intended to enable the leveraging of related EU financial instruments in this area, such as the European programme for competitiveness of SMEs, COSME; Horizon 2020 funding earmarked for SMEs; and the European fund for strategic investment, EFSI, administered by the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund, better known as the Juncker plan.  This will allow Ireland to optimise its return from such major EU initiatives.<\/p><p>As regards interest rates charged by the banks to SMEs, the recent CBI publication, &quot;Microfinancial Review 2015:1&quot;,\u00a0states that &quot;the mean rate on SME loans during 2014 was 5 per cent in Ireland, compared to 3.5 per cent in the euro area.&quot;  However, the report goes on to note that\u00a0&quot;differences in the underlying lending composition, however, may be a factor here. For example, the data include restructured and renegotiated loans, of which there is likely to be an increasing share in Ireland.  Cross-country differences are also likely in terms of loan type and borrower type.&quot;  It should be noted that in the most recent Department of Finance SME credit demand survey, covering the six month period to September 2015, only 1% of SMEs that did not demand credit thought that it was too expensive to borrow.<\/p><p>Finally,\u00a0I believe that competition is the best way to achieve a sustainable long term solution to the issue of high mortgage repayments and the Government has undertaken a number of initiatives in order to promote competition in the market.  For example, it introduced the changes to Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013 for new entrants.  This section regulates fees and charges and the changes mean that it does not apply for the first three years of operation of new entrants to the Irish banking sector. It is anticipated that new entrants will enter the mortgage market and bring welcome competition to this sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200059#WRH00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200059#WRH00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":241,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200059#WRH00350"},{"type":"question","counter":242,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[39914\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200059#WRH00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding flooding at a location (details supplied) in County Kerry, with regard to a drain that needs to be cleaned out by the Office of Public Works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":243,"content":"<p>The location referred to by the Deputy forms part of the Maine Catchment Drainage Scheme which was carried by the Office of Public Works (OPW) under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.

Sheep farmers in County Galway will continue to benefit under the same wide range of schemes and supports that are available to sheep farmers in other counties in Ireland.  Payments under the former Grassland Sheep Scheme with unspent CAP Pillar 1 funds have been taken into account under the new Basic Payments Scheme (BPS). Many sheep farmers will also benefit significantly from the model of convergence to be applied in Ireland where those with a low initial value will see their entitlements increase over a period of time.<\/p>  <p>  Advance payments under the BPS commenced in Ireland on 16 October 2015, which is the earliest that payments can commence under the governing EU Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  The Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020 under Pillar 2 of the CAP also contains various schemes that have been designed to support the sheep sector. Many sheep farmers continue to be significant beneficiaries from the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme. The ANC Scheme is worth &euro;195 million annually to some 100,000 farmers and in excess of &euro;1.3 billion over the life time of the RDP. Advance payments under ANCs commenced in Ireland at the end of September. The GLAS scheme in the RDP will also benefit sheep farmers. Access to GLAS is on a tiered basis with those in Tier 1 receiving top priority. These farmers are mainly those with Priority Environmental Assets, which include Natura land and Commonage. Therefore, many sheep farmers will qualify for Tier 1 access to GLAS as a result.<\/p>  <p>  I have made provision for improving efficiency and profitability in sheep production under Knowledge Transfer Groups, which has an overall budget of &euro;100 million. In addition to profitability, the emphasis will be on the key issues of business skills, environmental sustainability and herd health, with increased interaction between individual farmers and facilitators in order to customise information exchange. The experience of the nationally funded Sheep Technology Adoption Programme (STAP), in which 4,000 producers participated and with funding of &euro;3 million in 2015, informed the development of the sheep Knowledge Transfer Groups. STAP was continued for a third and final year in 2015, prior to the commencement of sheep Knowledge Transfer Groups in 2016. The farmer will receive a total payment of &euro;750 per annum for his participation.<\/p>  <p>  Capital investment schemes are being introduced under the TAMS II measure in the RDP, several of which will provide for sheep farmers including grant aided support for sheep housing and both mobile and fixed handling equipment for sheep. Furthermore, an amendment has recently been submitted to the European Commission to specifically include sheep fencing under the TAMS II scheme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to support Sheep Ireland which receives an annual operating grant and infrastructure aid. The funding is given to cover a range of areas including data collection infrastructure, operation of a sheep breeding database, geneticists to design a genetic evaluation system that suits Irish grass based production systems and operation of a ram testing programme. Ongoing investment is required in all these areas, in order to provide reliable evaluations on rams and breeding ewes and to encourage better breeding in the sheep sector.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these supports it is important for sheep farmers to try and gain the maximum returns from the market, and to date in 2015 the average factory prices are around 2% higher than the amount in 2014. The combination of buoyant prices, steady slaughtering supplies and increased carcass weights mean that the output of the sector is almost 4.5% ahead of last year in terms of economic value. Growth in the sector will come from an increase in consumer demand and export market opportunities as well as from improved technical efficiencies. Therefore my Department continues to search for new markets in cooperation with Bord Bia, Irish Embassies abroad and the meat industry. For example the market in Hong Kong opened for exports of sheepmeat in 2014 and exports of sheepmeat were valued at almost &euro;9 million in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200060#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Payments","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200061#WRK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[39872\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200061#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide clarification regarding additional top-up moneys from the Exchequer to boost the &euro;13.7 million European Union crisis fund; if he will dispense the funds to enable viability to those engaged in farming regarded as vulnerable who have endured dramatic income losses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Relevant Departments were contacted seeking their views on the Report's recommendations, asking them to identify any impacts and issues that may arise and timescales for implementation.

This reform will simplify and streamline the existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.

Among the measures agreed under the Programme was the establishment of a Network of Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres (EROCs) which would be used to provide accommodation and meet the basic needs of asylum seekers relocated from hotspots in Italy and Greece while their applications for refugee status are processed.   <\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the EU relocation programme, persons considered for relocation who will be accommodated in EROCs upon arrival, must be from countries with a recognition rate for asylum of at least 75%.  Accordingly, the expectation is that a large proportion of relocated persons will qualify for refugee status within a very short time.  These new centres and the services to be delivered therein, must therefore be established in a manner that facilitates a fast throughput of people from arrival to determination of status while still ensuring they receive sufficient orientation on the societal context in which their applications are being processed and additional integration supports to help them integrate quickly into Irish society where refugee status is granted.  <\/p>  <p>  It is in this context that officials in my Department, responsible for implementing the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, were tasked with the sourcing of suitable accommodation and orientation services for the proposed network of EROCs.  This involves an assessment of information regarding available State properties provided by the Office of Public Works which is ongoing, and a request for expressions of interest from commercial accommodation providers, which was advertised in the national media on 9th October 2015.

In the main, these emergency situations arise out of hours. <\/p>  <p>  At present, out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area are provided by Tusla through the Crisis Intervention Service (CIS). The remit of the service is to respond to crisis situations in which a child or young person requires immediate placement either due to child protection concerns or accommodation issues.  The service is delivered by Tusla's social work service. <\/p>  <p>  Outside the greater Dublin area, a more limited Emergency Place of Safety Service (EPSS) is provided for the Agency under a commercial arrangement by Five Rivers Ireland.  Under Section 12 of the Child Care Act, 1991, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may remove a child to a place of safety where they have reasonable grounds for believing that there is an immediate risk to the health or welfare of a child.  Under the EPSS, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can access an emergency placement for such children found to be at risk out of hours.  The child is placed in a family setting until the following working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case.  The intention is to expand this service so that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can consult with a social worker out of hours.  This is presently not the case outside the greater Dublin area.   <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that Tusla has confirmed that it is commencing the Emergency Out of Hours Service (EOHS) later this month.  The EOHS will incorporate the existing Emergency Place of Safety Service.

It is important that children in these circumstances can be brought to an appropriate placement which in most cases will be a family setting.  The aim of the EOHS will be to ensure that the disruption and suffering to which children may be exposed in these situations is minimised and the rights of parents and guardians are respected.  The introduction of the EOHS will assist in maximising inter-agency co-operation and promoting the safety and welfare of children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200064#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Preschool Services","counter":412,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200064#WRN01950"},{"type":"question","counter":413,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[39912\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200064#WRN02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the status of the case of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick regarding a reduced rate of capitation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable of all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011 and required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale.<\/p><p>  Subsequently, following the public service-wide review of allowances and premium payments, the Government decided to withdraw or modify allowances for new beneficiary public servants with effect from 1 February 2012. Under this decision, certain allowances were withdrawn for new beneficiary teachers, including qualification allowances. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.<\/p><p>  These measures were implemented at a time of very difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.<\/p><p>  Alleviation of the salary imbalance between those who entered the public service since 2011 and those who entered before that date began under the Haddington Road Agreement. Improved pay scales for post-1 January 2011 and post-1 February 2012 entrants to teaching were agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. In addition, allowances payable to post-1 January 2011 entrants and such allowances as remain payable to post-1 February 2012 entrants were restored to pre-2011 levels.<\/p><p>  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will, through salary increases and a reduction in the Pension-Related Deduction, begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years. The issue of equalised pay scales was not one which could be resolved in the discussions which lead to the Agreement. However, the flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement will be proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.<\/p><p>In addition, in order to address concerns about the casualisation of employment in the teaching profession, my Department implemented at the commencement of the 2015\/16 school year the seven key recommendations of the Expert Group on Fixed-term and Part-time Employment in Teaching, which was established under the Haddington Road Agreement.  Circulars 23\/2015 and 24\/2015 detailing the arrangements and procedures for the implementation of the recommendations of the report were published on March 27th 2015.

The staffing arrangements for the 2015\/16 school year are set out in Circular 0005\/2015.<\/p><p>  Under these arrangements a school's GAM\/EAL allocation for the 2015\/16 school year is based on its mainstream classroom posts for the 2014\/15 school year. Appendix C of Circular 0005\/2015 lists the GAM\/EAL allocation for all schools.<\/p><p>  Schools have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has recommended the introduction of a new resource allocation model for schools, which will allow schools to allocate resources to pupils taking into account their individual learning needs, as opposed to being based primarily on a diagnosis of a particular disability.A pilot of this new resource allocation model is currently taking place in a number of schools.<\/p><p>  In relation to school buildings, I want to assure you that funding is being made available as part of the Government's continued commitment to fund improvement and upgrading works in existing school buildings throughout the country. In this regard, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, earlier this month, I was able to announce that a minor works grant will be paid to primary schools later this year. I also announced that a multi-annual Summer Works Scheme will be run in 2016 and 2017.  The Summer Works Scheme for 2016 is now open for applications on the Esinet portal with full details of the Scheme itself on the Department's website www.Education.ie. The school in question can apply for funding under the 2016 Scheme for any high priority works needed to the building.<\/p><p>  In relation to funding, my Department provides capitation funding to all recognised primary schools.<\/p><p>  The amount of grant paid to an individual primary school for capitation and ancillary services is determined by the school's enrolment, subject to a minimum grant for both capitation and ancillary services in respect of schools with enrolments up to 60, and a maximum ancillary services grant in the case of schools with enrolments of 500 or more. I have no plans to change these arrangements.<\/p><p>  In 2015 the capitation grant is &euro;170 per pupil, and the Ancillary Services Grant is &euro;147 per pupil.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Circular 40\/2009 clarifies issues relating to the allocation of funding for primary schools. The circular states that capitation funding provided for general running costs and funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.<\/p><p>  I do recognise however the need to improve capitation funding for primary schools having regard to the reductions that were necessary over recent years. In Budget 2015 I was able to secure the first increase in education spending in recent years and a further increase in education spending was achieved in Budget 2016.  I am determined to continue pressing the case for increased investment in education.<\/p><p>  While l am unable to meet the Principal and teachers of this school I hope the information provided in this answer helps to clarify the position for them regarding the issues raised in their correspondence.  if they have any further queries in relation to these issues they can contact my Department directly re same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200068#WRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Reform","counter":524,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200068#WRR02000"},{"type":"question","counter":525,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[39986\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200068#WRR02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to revise the rules regarding student grants for second-chance students (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1010","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":526,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Student Grant Scheme is reviewed annually.

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented in line with Government policy .   The introduction of pay by weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure .    During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria.<\/p>  <p>  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then for a limited time. The vast majority of contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired. In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price. However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households.

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an   independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the quasi-judicial role of the PRTB it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specifics of any case.  The PRTB, as an independent statutory body, will adjudicate each dispute on its own facts and merits and may grant redress and give specific direction as appropriate on foot of a determination order. Receipt of a determination order is the official notification to parties of the final outcome of a dispute resolution case. The order sets out the terms to be complied with, including any payments owing and the length of time given to comply. In making determination orders, the PRTB can make provision to allow for payment of awards in instalments to facilitate recovery of the award, based on the circumstances of the case.  A party who fails to comply with one or more terms of a determination order is open to having legal proceedings taken against him or her in the Courts.   <\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, enforcement of PRTB determination orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case. While there is no legal obligation on the PRTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders very seriously. In 2014 alone it referred 402 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings. It is also open to parties to pursue enforcement independently through the Courts, including the seeking of a garnishee order. It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment of an award. In many cases the best option, and one which the PRTB facilitates, is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments.<\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 is currently before the Oireachtas and will amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, inter alia, for the introduction of a new procedure to enforce a tenant&rsquo;s obligation under section 86 of the 2004 Act to pay rent pending the determination of a dispute.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Government Housing Package announced on 10 November, the enforcement of PRTB determination orders will no longer have to be pursued through the Circuit Court, but may be pursued through the District Court. This will save landlords who are dealing with such situations considerable time and expense. This will allow the PRTB to deal effectively and quickly with tenants who do not comply with their statutory obligation to pay rent during the dispute process. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 has passed all stages in the D&aacute;il, together with second stage in the Seanad , and will return to the Seanad for Committee Stage shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200069#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alternative Energy Projects","counter":555,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200069#WRS01350"},{"type":"question","counter":556,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[39898\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200069#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department has proposals for local authorities to bring forward guidelines for solar farms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":557,"content":"<p>There are no specific planning guidelines in respect of solar farms and I have no proposals to bring forward such guidelines at the present time.

Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions, is the responsibility of the Irish Film Board.  This includes assistance with locations for the making of films.  In 2015, I approved a provision of &euro;14.6 million for the Film Board, which maintained its funding at the same level as in 2014.  The allocation of resources from within that provision is a matter for the Film Board, as the statutorily independent agency responsible for the promotion and development of the Irish film industry.<\/p>  <p>  The other primary mechanism by which the Government supports the film industry is through section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - the Film Tax Relief Scheme.  This scheme has undergone a number of improvements, which took effect in January this year.  These changes have been well received and were developed following consultations between my Department, the Irish Film Board, the Department of Finance and the audio-visual industry.  The intention is to ensure that Ireland remains competitive in attracting film projects.  The Film Tax Relief Scheme has been extended to the end of 2020 and in the recent Budget the Government announced an increase in the cap on this tax relief from &euro;50 million to &euro;70 million.  This increase on its current level will help to attract further big budget productions to these shores.  I am confident that these measures will increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for film investment and allowing the audio-visual production sector to maintain existing jobs and create new ones.  In this regard, Government Departments and public agencies are often key to assisting film companies in providing locations and other supports for film making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200072#WRV00300","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":623,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200072#WRV00350"},{"type":"question","counter":624,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[39950\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015111200072#WRV00400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the degree to which she expects employment prospects to remain positive throughout the Arts and culture sectors, with particular reference to job opportunities now, and in the future; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

This has included intense and ongoing engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and the European Commission. <\/p><p>A long-term compensation scheme has also been introduced to compensate cutters for their loss arising from the cessation.  This cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years, or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog, together with a once-off incentive payment of &euro;500.<\/p><p>Some 3,149 applications for raised bog special areas of conservation have been received under this scheme.  8,521 annual payments have been made in respect of the applications received.  In addition,<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>1,501 once-off incentive payments and 772<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>turf deliveries have been made to applicants from these sites.<\/p><p>The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan was published in January 2014.  It sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the complexity involved, progress in relocating turf cutters to non-designated bogs is being achieved in a number of cases.  Potential relocation sites had been identified for each of the raised bog special areas of conservation where relocation may be required.  When relocation sites have been assessed as suitable, my Department has been seeking expressions of interest from turf cutters with a view to them moving to these sites. <\/p><p>For a number of these special areas of conservation, the relocation site identified may not be suitable or may not have the capacity to cater for the number of turf cutters who may wish to relocate there.  In such cases, and in the context of the finalisation of the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, my Department, in consultation with turf cutting interests, is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of the EU Habitats Directive.  Under article 6.3 of the Directive, consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation where it can be shown that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the site.  Under article 6.4 of the Directive, consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation for imperative reasons of overriding public interest. <\/p><p>Given the clear scientific evidence of the negative impact of turf extraction on raised bogs, it will only be possible to utilise the provisions of article 6.3 in a small number of cases.  Similarly, the flexibility provided for under article 6.4, if required, will only be applicable to a small number of sites.<\/p><p>Some 171 applications from Mouds Bog and 60 applications from Ballynafagh Bog in County Kildare have been received under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme for raised bog special areas of conservation. 463 annual payments, 199 turf deliveries and 46 once-off incentive payments have been made in respect of the applications received from these sites. <\/p><p>Discussions are ongoing between my Department and local turf cutters with a view to relocation from Ballynafagh Bog to a non-designated bog, which has been assessed as suitable for relocation. <\/p><p>Lattins Bog, also known as Mouds North Bog, in County Kildare, has been assessed as a suitable relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog.  My Department had sought expressions of interest from qualifying applicants under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme with a view to relocation to this site.  However, the level of interest received in relocation to this site has been muted. <\/p><p>I am advised that discussions have taken place between external experts, engaged by my Department, and local turf cutter representatives with a view to examining whether turf cutting could take place on Mouds Bog where it can be shown that such cutting would not have an adverse effect on the site, in accordance with article 6.3 of the Habitats Directive.<\/p><p>The <i>Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Areas,<\/i>which is available to download from my Department&rsquo;s website at <i><\/i>, provides details on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 raised bog natural heritage areas.<\/p><p>Carbury Bog natural heritage area in County Kildare is one of the natural heritage areas which are to be conserved.  In the case of this bog, the review envisages the cessation of turf cutting on the site by 1 January 2017 to preserve its conservation value.  Turf cutting may continue on the bog until that date, on plots that have been cut in the five year period prior to the Government decision of 14 January 2014 on the review.<\/p><p>The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme has been extended to land owners and turbary right holders affected by the restrictions on turf cutting in raised bog natural heritage areas.
