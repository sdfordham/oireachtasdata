I congratulate the Irish cricket team on qualifying for the cricket world cup in Australia in 2015.  This is an all-Ireland team and it shows how sport can bring together both traditions on the island.  It is a magnificent achievement.  This is the third world cup in a row that the Irish cricket team has qualified for.  It would be remiss of me not to mention my county, Dublin, whose hurlers won the Leinster championship for the first time in 52 years.  What a fantastic result that was.<\/p><p>I wish to raise a more serious note.  On several occasions I have raised in the House the issue with regard to ambulance coverage and especially the HSE ambulance service.  We are all aware of several instances that occurred recently in Cork and Kerry where ambulances, unfortunately, were sent to the wrong addresses and where tragedies occurred.  I am just as concerned about the fact that there was no ambulance cover in a large part of Dublin yesterday.  This is not the first time it has happened.  An ambulance crew resuscitated a lady taken from the sea last week but yesterday, due to cutbacks within the HSE, there was no ambulance service covering 200,000 people in the north county area.  I have asked for it before but I am asking again for a debate on the emergency services and the resources available, if not in this session, then early in the new session.<\/p><p>I wish to ask the Leader something once more.  Yesterday, my colleague, Senator Thomas Byrne, raised an issue which I continue to raise with the Leader, namely, the revised code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  We should have a debate with the Minister for Finance in the House in respect of the revised code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  I have no wish to sound like a broken record.  I have tried to raise the issue when dealing with other Bills but it has not been allowed, and I understand why.  We need a specific debate on this matter.<\/p><p>I offer one example of what the new code of conduct is doing to the cohort of more than 150,000 people who are in mortgage arrears on their principal private residences.  I received a case yesterday.  Obviously, I will not name the person in question.  He received a letter from one of our pillar banks, the ICS Building Society.  It relates to a principal private residence where there is a father, a mother and three young children.  The bank flatly turned down a proposal although this is a case in which the people involved are making an effort to pay the mortgage.  The bank said it had carefully assessed the request, taking into account the details provided by the customer of his financial situation.  A formal review was carried out by the bank's mortgage appeals board.  What did it come up with?  There were two options.  The first was voluntary sale, whereby the customer is instructed to appoint his choice of estate agent and solicitor to progress sale of the property.  Then, where a sale is agreed at a satisfactory price, the bank would facilitate the sale and, in the event of a shortfall, it will discuss with the customer the repayment proposals for the residual balance.  That is option one.<\/p><p>Option two is voluntary surrender.  This is where the customer could hand back the keys of the property to enable the bank to realise its security in respect of the customer's debt.  These are the only two options for the family home.  The letter states that after that, in the event of a shortfall, the customer would remain liable for the cost of outstanding debt, including accrued interest, charges and legal selling and other related costs.  That is what is happening under the code of conduct for mortgage arrears.  That is a fact.<\/p><p>That is one of many cases that I have received and that I am working on.  I imagine every Senator in the House has received the same.  What in God's name are we actually doing about it?  We are doing nothing.  The Government has caved in to the banks with the new code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The Government has given everything.  The letter from the ICS Building Society is dated this week.  That it what they are operating under.  It relates to a principal private residence, a family home.  Where are these people going to go?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000002#A00500","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373448600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Senator, I must ask you to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000003#B00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1373448600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>With that in mind, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business again today such that the Minister for Finance would come to the House for one hour to allow us to debate the new code of conduct on mortgage arrears and how the Minister believes the new code of conduct, approved by this Government, will assist people like these, who are being given warning letters and told to sell their homes or give back the keys, with no other options available.

I commend the firefighters and the neighbours who, before the fire crews arrived on the scene, helped to evacuate the residents from the apartment block as well.  It was a terrifying experience for all involved.<\/p><p>I join my colleagues who called yesterday for a debate on direct provision.  I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on the matter early in the next session.  It is worth our examining the issue in some detail.  I am mindful that the number of asylum seekers in direct provision has reduced in recent years, but there are still serious concerns about the living conditions of people, especially families with children in direct provision as well as the plight of unaccompanied minors who have come to Ireland and who are in direct provision.  We might have a debate on that.<\/p><p>I warmly welcome the news, following yesterday's Cabinet meeting, that a referendum will be held on lowering the voting age from 18 to 16 years as a result of the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention and on lowering the age of eligibility to be President from 35 to 21 years.  There was a lively debate at the Constitutional Convention on the issue of voting age, perhaps more lively than many commentators had expected.  People were genuinely persuaded by the arguments heard.  I gather the Leader has said that we will have Tom Arnold, chairperson of the Constitutional Convention, in the House in the autumn.  That might be another issue on which he could address the House.<\/p><p>I look forward to our debate tomorrow on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill, which is due to conclude in the D&aacute;il tonight.

I welcome the initiative, which is something very close to my heart.  In this type of weather people are jumping to get into the sea, rivers and lakes.  I join Irish Water Safety in urging people to be careful and cautious.  They need to remember that the sea is very dangerous and has claimed many people's lives over the years.

On this wonderful occasion in Union Hall on Monday, while the Ministers, Deputies Varadkar and Coveney, are very welcome, local councillors and Oireachtas Members should have been notified.  This is the second occasion.  I have made a personal complaint to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that I was given no notice of the event in Union Hall.  It is a disgrace and very mean.  It is not something I would raise here lightly and it is wrong.  Approximately 18 months ago a wonderful &euro;40 million project to develop the harbour and pier in Castletownbere was opened and I only found out the following day that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, had been to the town for that opening.

Now that our Presidency of the EU has concluded, it is time the Minister came in here to discuss the matter fully and frankly with the House.  I raised the matter yesterday during the debate on the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2013.  As Senator Darragh O'Brien knows, I have enormous difficulties with the current code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which is a charter for banks.  On a regular basis I also deal with people who are in this heart-breaking position.  The country will never move on from the banking crisis and economic collapse until the matter is resolved fairly to the satisfaction of everyone.<\/p><p>I wish to speak about the buy-to-let mortgages.  I am concerned that the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, has stated that very few family homes will be repossessed.  His view of a family home is a home that is occupied as a principal private residence.  He said that there was a backlog of approximately 30,000 buy-to-let properties waiting to be repossessed by the banks given the level of arrears.  They are people's family homes.  One in five families live in rented accommodation.  It is one in four in city areas and one in three in some areas of the capital.  Many of those families are in receipt of rent supplement.  In other words, by definition, they are on social welfare payments of some description.  Those are family homes.  There is no code of conduct about how those homes will be treated.  I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister for Finance.  We stand at the cusp of a very serious difficulty if we start repossessing buy-to-let properties without taking into account what will happen to the people living in those family homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000004#C00400","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1373449200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The Government is preparing important whistleblower legislation.

The Senator and Senator Hayden cited examples, as I did yesterday on behalf of a number of people for whom I am acting as intermediary.  The banks are no longer calling it repossession but are calling it assisted sale.  Either way it involves putting families out of homes.  People might be surprised to hear that many of the very few split mortgages that have taken place are for investors in buy-to-let properties rather than people with family homes.  I believe an investigation might show that to be the case.  Was that the intention of the Government of the day in recommending the use of split mortgages or was it done in the spirit of assisting families to stay in their homes?<\/p><p>From the work I have done, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the repossessions being focused on first are not the basket cases.  The banks are saying to the people with real equity in their homes that if those people cannot pay, the banks will put the property up for sale and take the equity to cover the debt.  It is fundamentally wrong.  For generations we will regret allowing this code of conduct to be the only safeguard over the legislation we are passing this week to allow repossessions to proceed.  I accept the anomaly arising from the Dunne judgment needs to be addressed.  However, to do it in isolation without putting tangible options in place, involving an independent debt settlement office, the courts or whoever to adjudicate over what the banks are actually doing for people, is fundamentally wrong.<\/p><p>I have said this since 2009.  Representatives of the banks appearing before Oireachtas committees are able to give the statistical analysis to show how much they are engaging and how they are doing the devil and all for people.<\/p> <p>The reality is that they are superficially engaging and doing nothing other than striving for that bottom line improvement as quickly as possible, and they are happy to burn families, so to speak, in the process.

As the Leader will be aware, negotiations are ongoing between Ireland and the European Union on the regional grant aid available to the various regions and how that will play out for all the regions.  Currently, because of issues in the past the Border Midlands Western, BMW, region has the highest levels of grant-aid where IDA Ireland can give higher levels of investment aid to multinational companies but the south east region has the highest level of unemployment.  It is important, when the Government is reviewing these guidelines, that the south east region is given priority and is on a par with other regions because we need every bit of support we can get.  <\/p><p>Also, we need to discuss the proposals such as those about which Senator Landy spoke.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have constantly called for job subsidy schemes to be put in place, and any schemes that get people back to work must be welcomed but much more work needs to be done.  There are many issues on which the Government is working but it is important that Members in this House are able to feed into those discussions.  I am sure the Leader would wish to have his say about the regional aid guidelines and their impact in Waterford and the south east.  If he could arrange for that debate with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, that would be of benefit to all Members of the House<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000005#D00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1373449800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I second Senator Landy's proposal that we ask the Minister for Social Protection to attend the House and update Members on the final detail of the JobsPlus scheme because it can be highly beneficial to employers.  I believe it can be a great success but we all need to know a little more about the final details.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to the House for a debate on certain health matters because there is much happening behind the scenes without any consultation, and people are being deprived of their rightful entitlements as a result.  In recent weeks I have become aware of changes to medical card guidelines and assessments without any consultation.  I have sought to raise that issue on the Adjournment tomorrow and I hope the Cathaoirleach might oblige me on that.  Under the 1970 Health Act, someone with a medical card is entitled to a wide range of health services free of charge but that is no longer the case.  I know an elderly man who has a medical card.  He is going into hospital for a hip operation in the coming weeks.  He has been told already that he will have to spend five days in hospital after the operation following which he must find a nursing home bed for the next five or six weeks but he cannot afford that.  It will cost him between &euro;5,000 and &euro;6,000.  He cannot benefit from the fair deal scheme.  There is no help with the cost involved.  That is not giving a medical card holder a free health service.<\/p><p>These issues need to be debated and the Minister for Health should attend the House and answer these questions.  It is all very well for people who can afford that type of service but those who can afford it will not have a medical card.  The people who have medical cards are not getting what they are entitled to under the 1970 Health Act.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister to attend the House to debate these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000005#D00400","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1373449800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I support Senator Bacik's comments on the Dublin Fire Brigade.

It beggars belief that those who estimated what it would cost then discovered that contractors were widely different in their estimates.  I appeal to both the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive in this regard.  There is a shortfall of &euro;15 million.  I would hate to see this project lost to the north east, Louth County Council and Newry and Mourne council.  Where will the &euro;17.4 million funding agreed by the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, go?  Can contractors reduce the costs?  We must examine that and appeal to both the Government and the Executive to come up with the shortfall.  As I pointed out previously, the economic and tourism benefits to the Carlingford-Cooley peninsula and the Newry and Mourne areas will be lost and I would hate to see that happen.

The media have reported on the initiative he launched yesterday whereby he intends to cut back the overall budget.  It has been cloaked over with that wonderful term &quot;reform&quot; which is used from time to time when Governments wish to justify their actions.  I have no doubt whatsoever there is a need to reform and review the rural transport scheme, which was first initiated in 2004, but successive Governments have cut back on the budget and it is inevitable any cutback will result in a reduction in services.  I welcome the suggestion the rural transport scheme will come within the ambit of local authorities and that local authority members will have direct input into it.  They input indirectly through their membership of various partnership boards throughout the country.  I was a member of the partnership board during my time as a local authority member and I was very much involved, and have continued to take a great interest, in rural transport because it affects counties such as Leitrim with dispersed populations.  It is important that Members of the House have an opportunity to quiz the Minister of State and put forward their views on how this excellent scheme should be protected.  Such is its importance that today's newspapers have editorials on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000005#D00700","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373450400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I echo the call made by the Taoiseach yesterday for anybody with information on the disappeared victims of the Troubles and conflict in Northern Ireland to come forward to the victims remains commission and give such information in confidence.

The only way we can create jobs is to encourage new enterprise.  The biggest untapped source of enterprise is the 50% of the population comprising Irish woman who face multiple barriers in becoming entrepreneurs and developing businesses.  At present two and a half times more men start up a business than women in Ireland.  The bottom line is the responsibility for raising young children rests almost entirely with women.<\/p><p>My contribution to easing the barriers is to allow fathers share the responsibility of maternity leave.  The Parental Leave Bill I will introduce in Seanad &Eacute;ireann this evening proposes the father of a newborn baby can share the 26 weeks of maternity leave.  This innovative legislation provides for the current maternity leave scheme to be amended to enable a woman transfer a proportion of her maternity leave and benefits to the father of the newborn baby.  This flexibility in the maternity leave scheme would allow women entrepreneurs to devote more time to their enterprises, grow their businesses and create more jobs.

These are gross figures and no net figures are issued in respect of tax deductions in these average earnings.  There is a grossly distorted view when one compares what the person earns in wages and salaries in gross terms compared to the net figures and then compared to social welfare payments which are net figures.  We should also publish figures on net earnings of people after the deduction of tax, taking into account people's tax category.  It is important that correct information is issued.

Pope Francis went to Lampedusa to stand in solidarity with thousands of African boat people and illegal immigrants.  In his comments Pope Francis asked who was responsible for the blood of these brothers and sisters and stated the answer was nobody.  He stated everybody answers that he or she did not have anything to do with it so it must be someone else.  He was warning against this attitude of individualism and the culture of comfort which makes us think only of ourselves.<\/p><p>  These words are very wise and it reminds me that whether said by a Christian thinker such as Pope Francis or an atheist dissident such as Sakharov, words which call us to the best in ourselves and urge us to reflect deeply and conscientiously on very important issues should always be welcome in politics and welcomed by politicians.  It is absolutely contemptible for any Member of the House or anybody else to seek to exclude the voices of church members or church leaders from these debates.  We should be very wary about where such people would take our politics when they seek not to focus on the issues but rather to denigrate those who make arguments with sincerity.<\/p><p>  I am reminded that what Pope Francis had to say has very broad application.  Another famous voice of conscience was the German Protestant pastor Niem&ouml;ller, who famously reminded us,<blockquote>First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a Socialist.  Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a Trade Unionist.  Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.

We have a Government with the largest majority in the history of the State.  We have seen the consequences of such a majority where the Government wants to assume onto itself extraordinary powers.  We have witnessed the totalitarian tendencies, referred to by a number of Members, including me, in the past 18 months or thereabouts, which became particularly apparent in the early stages of the Government.  That has significant risks for democracy and society.  The propensity with which the Government has been quick to apply the guillotine and to use its very large majority in the Lower House and in this House is alarming.  I am amazed the matter has not received much more thorough analysis in the media.  Unfortunately, we have a media that has become very compliant in issues and policies proposed by the Government.  That, in itself, has significant dangers for democracy.  It is not only the thrust of what is happening but in recent times we have witnessed extraordinary pressure, which is unprecedented in my 16 years as a Member.  Some who are Members for longer period than me have mentioned the exertion and coercion of Government Members to comply with the Whip on issues on which they have deep convictions and, in some instances, strong conscientious positions, which oppose some of the polices being pursued by the Government.  They are being pressurised to abrogate  those convictions and their conscientious positions.  While we are debating that and other Bills to which it is particularly relevant in the overall interest of how our democracy functions, it is imperative to remember that this measure, which is before the House and will be put to the people, will have extraordinarily adverse affects for our democratic system.<\/p><p>The Bill was put forward for the purpose of abolishing the Seanad.  The Government has moved away from highlighting the paltry savings which will be achieved because it is aware that will not find attraction, perhaps, with the electorate at large.  Some people are starting to focus on the democratic deficit within our structures and systems.  If we stand back and allow this to happen, ultimately, because of peoples' antipathy in general to the political establishment and also because of the severe pressures under which they are endeavouring to survive economically - debates in this House every day cover issues of people in debt, distressed mortgages and various other scenarios which are a severe and deep challenge for them - it will lead to fractures in society.  It has happened elsewhere and if we allow it to happen here we will have to take responsibility.  <\/p><p>Like others, I have tabled amendments to the Bill because the principle of allowing the people make the decision is one to which any democrat cannot seriously object.  It is extraordinary that this Bill came about because of a whim.  I noted in the Taoiseach's address on Second Stage that he said efforts at reform of the Seanad have been ongoing for 75 years.  That is not quite accurate.  It has been ongoing for a considerable number of years, and perhaps a number of decades.  He forgot to mention that he has been a Member of the Houses for more than half that period of 75 years.  To the best of my recollection, at no stage is he on record as making any serious effort or attempt at reforming or improving the Seanad, nor, for that matter, improving the D&aacute;il.  When we look at the structures of our democratic system - there are three elements to the Houses of the Oireachtas - I would be a strong proponent of everything being done to improve and increase the productivity and effectiveness of the Houses.  I do not deny that the Seanad is in need of reform.  I may have differing views from some of my colleagues as to how that reform should take place.  The position of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann and the D&aacute;il are equally in need of reform, and in my opinion the D&aacute;il is in far greater need of reformation than this House.  <\/p><p>Part of the reason we are suffering so badly economically is due to the structure under which a small coterie of people, generally 15 from the D&aacute;il - there was only one exception where a Member of the Seanad was appointed to Government - with their advisers and public servants, decide most of the policy issues and legislation that come before us.  When the Whip is applied, as is done rigidly in this House, which is at variance with most other democracies including the common law systems from colonial days in other jurisdictions, Members are reduced to rubber-stamping what has already been decided.  The consequences of that, particularly in the economic area, are pretty obvious.  I know from debates and discussions we had among ourselves that many people in the Government parties in the past 13, 14 and 15 years had different views and concerns on economic issues but because of the Whip system and the groupthink which applied, we went with what was decided by that Government.  <\/p><p>I am dealing with the abolition day and the effects it will have on our democracy.  That is reason I am bringing this into the debate.  To put forward the idea of abolition as distinct from giving the people a choice to abolish or reform the Seanad is, in fact, a serious mistake.<\/p> <p>In part, it is done in order to achieve a situation where people, because of their angst and antipathy to politicians and the political system generally, will use that hostility to set aside one of the institutions of our democracy, which is Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>In past debates, comments were made and papers prepared which said that the primary purpose of an Upper House is to provide a system of checks and balances on the legislative process.  The powers of the Seanad were talked about and it was said that the House was a deliberative body with limited powers of initiation and review of legislation, but with the capacity to initiate discussion on matters of public interest.  One such paper went on to advise a new role for the Seanad.  It proposed that Seanad &Eacute;ireann should establish a standing committee for future strategic policy needs.  It said that Seanad &Eacute;ireann should have a particular role concerning the EU and equality issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000012#L01700","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373453400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>All those issues can be discussed in the various sections of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000013#M00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1373453400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Absolutely but I ask the Cathaoirleach to bear with me while I come to the point.

Therefore, we will not have an enhanced committee system, but rather a dysfunctional one.  That, in itself, will have ramifications for the operation and effectiveness of these Houses.

It is symptomatic of town councils across the country.

It is all in the interests of a larger elite in our society, but not in the interests of the ordinary citizen.  Democracy has to be about ordinary citizens.<\/p><p>I am opposed to this Bill on the basis that a clear choice of reforming or abolishing the Seanad should be put before the people.  By virtue of the fact that that choice is not being given to the people we are running a real risk, particularly in the current climate of total disenchantment with politicians and the political system - not just in Ireland but elsewhere, although it is very evident here - that we may get an outcome promulgated by the Government which will not serve future generations of Irish people well. <\/p> <p>Even at this late stage I appeal to those who have influence to make the necessary amendments to the Bill in order that a clear choice will be given to people.  My concern is that if people are offered a choice to abolish the Seanad, they would not vote for its retention because they would not trust either of these Houses, or the Government, to reform it.  There are good reasons for that.  We have all seen the broken promises from the previous election.  We have seen the damage the Government has done.  We have seen commitments made.  One only has to ask any pro-life person about the written commitments from various parties and individuals prior to the election that count for nothing.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, probably told the truth when he said that they are things one does before an election but they are not of any significance subsequent to it.  In that climate, I am concerned that by not offering a clear-cut choice to people, we may well end up with a situation which will not serve the people in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000013#M02100","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373454000,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I do not propose to visit either Yad Vashem or <i>The Dunbrody<\/i>.

Having said what I said, followed by a cough, this is the definition section.  The first note in the section is that the Government intends to abolish the Seanad, to provide for its abolition.  What is the definition of &quot;abolition&quot;?  It is to destroy, to do away with completely, to make null and void and to put an end to.  If that is not enough, if we go to <i>Roget's Thesaurus<\/i> it indicates it is to nullify, to destroy, to abrogate, to invalidate, to cancel, to tear up, to repudiate, to unfrock, to void, to quash and to depose.  The first note in the section is that the Government intends to do all of those things to Seanad &Eacute;ireann but not to reform it, about which several of my honourable colleagues have begun to speak, not to reform the D&aacute;il, nor to view the governance of our State as a whole, but instead to put a piecemeal choice before the people.<\/p><p>  Why abolish the Seanad now without tested Dail reform?  Will the Government's proposals for D&aacute;il reform, some of which the Minister of State identified in his concluding speech last week, work?  The people deserve better than this.  The Government is offering a new politics that is piecemeal.  Why not have a central governance referendum in 2015 that could be inclusive of constitutional reform of the D&aacute;il as well as the Seanad so that people would have a clear choice of how they want the whole political system reformed, rather than getting supposed reform piece by piece and being forced to vote on the abolition of the Seanad without knowing what is coming in its place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000015#O00500","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1373454600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>The next speaker was to be Senator Wilson, but as he is not here, I call Senator Cullinane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000015#O00600","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1373454600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House again to take Committee Stage of the Bill.

I am sure at some point that the Leas-Chathaoirleach will pull me up and say that issues I am raising are not relevant to the section, but to what sections will they be relevant?  We need to be given an opportunity to explore properly and tease out in detail all the issues we raised on Second Stage in general terms, but that opportunity is not even being given to us because all we can do is again make general statements in respect of the sections.  If we try to deal with specifics that are not exactly relevant to the section, the Leas-Chathaoirleach will pull us up on that.  That is regrettable.  We should have been able to debate the amendments which have been tabled.  I do not accept some of the reasons the amendments were ruled out of order but that has been ruled on.<\/p><p>Abolition day is not something to be proud of.  It is a sham, a fraud and a failure.  In reality, it is an acceptance of failure that the political establishment has failed to reform the Seanad.  The Government was very quick to bring forward legislation to abolish the Seanad.  That is what this is, a Bill to abolish the Seanad.  Fianna F&aacute;il has to take responsibility as well as Labour and Fine Gael, having been in government numerous times during the past 30 or 40 years, as all parties had numerous opportunities to bring forward reform Bills and each and every Government failed to do so.  The failure to reform the Seanad has nothing to do with the people inside or outside this Chamber but everything to do with the political establishment which failed in its job to reform the Seanad.<\/p><p>Even when the people had their say about increasing the franchise for university graduates, that small piece of reform was not put in place by way of legislation.  We should not be discussing abolition day but discussing reform not only of the Seanad but also of D&aacute;il.  One thing on which I think we can all agree, even those who have put forward views to reform the Seanad, is that this House in its current form needs to be reformed.  We have two excellent Bills that were agreed on Second Stage but they have been left hanging.  We have the abolition Bill, the one being discussed, but we are not allowed to discuss the reform Bills on Committee Stage of this Bill.  We are not even allowed to discuss reform and are not being given the opportunity to do so, and neither are the people.<\/p><p>I believe the Government made a mistake in rushing to abolish the Seanad and I said that during my contribution on Second Stage.  I believe it was a genuine mistake, not because I believe we can stand over this House in its current form but because I believe in reform and not only reform of the Seanad but reform of the Dail and of local government, and we are not getting that.  We are not getting any reform of local government or reform of the Dail.  All we are getting is abolition of the Seanad.<\/p><p>I cannot understand why the Constitutional Convention was not given the opportunity to discuss reform.  It could very well have said, had it been given the opportunity, that it did not believe in a bicameral system, a second chamber, and that rather it believed a single robust chamber with proper checks and balances would be the best thing for this State.  It may well have decided that but it was not given the opportunity  I know for certain that if the delegates to the Constitutional Convention were to have put forward a proposition that an arm of the Oireachtas be severed, abolished, cut off, done away with - all those the terms Senator Zappone gave, they would not have recommended that in any seriousness had they not also spelled out what would come in its place and how we would reform the D&aacute;il.  In fairness, some proposals have been put forward by the Government but they are only cosmetic changes and will not bring about the checks and balances we need.<\/p><p>We have two dysfunctional Chambers, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, and if we abolish the Seanad, we will be left with one dysfunctional Chamber.  We will have fewer Deputies and the committee system will not work with fewer Deputies and no Senators.  It will fall apart and while it may not collapse, it certainly will not be effective.  It will not do its job.  The committees will not be fit for purpose, and for that reason also, I will oppose this section and abolition day.<\/p><p>For me, the core principles that should underpin political reform are democracy, accountability, representativeness and checks and balances.  No one could argue that this House is democratic.  I certainly would not argue that it is.  It is undemocratic, unrepresentative and elitist and it needs to be reformed, but abolishing the Seanad will not improve democracy.  It will not do anything to improve the situation.  It may get rid of one dysfunctional chamber but where will the improvements be?  How will that improve democracy?  I would challenge the Minister of State and the Government to point out how abolishing the Seanad will improve democracy.  How will abolition day, which is what this section is about, improve accountability in this State?  How will abolishing one arm of the Oireachtas without looking at reform improve accountability?  We know what happened in the banking sector.  There is no abolition day for what the bankers did, for the bankers in this country or for the lack of regulation, but there is an abolition day for one arm of the Oireachtas which is not responsible, despite the contention the Taoiseach, for the problems this country is in.  What will abolition day do for representativeness in the Oireachtas?<\/p><p>The Government made a great play about wanting to improve access to Oireachtas for women, and I accept that and support all the proposals it brought forward in regard to quotas.  However, if we have no Seanad, 60 Senators will be gone and we will have fewer Deputies.  How will that be good for getting women into the Oireachtas?  One of the Government's proposals, which it has talked about, is four-day week, and perhaps five-day week, sittings.  How in God's name will that be good for working mothers who live in Donegal, Galway or Waterford who will be asked to sit in the D&aacute;il four days a week in Dublin away from their families?  These are the kind of cosmetic rushed changes we will get because the Government has not properly thought out abolition day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000015#O01100","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1373454600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000015#O01200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1373454600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>The Government was bounced and rushed into this.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach was head-strong and no one in his party called for reflection on the consequences of abolition of the Seanad.

We have been asked by this Government and previous governments to take several leaps of faith and we all know where they got us.  I do not believe we should take this leap of faith.  I believe that in being asked to support abolition of the Seanad we should know what will replace it.  We have not been given this level of detail.<\/p><p>Another issue in terms of the principle of this is that of checks and balances.  Where are the checks and balances in the system?  We will not have any.  We will have only one House and, with no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, four Ministers running the country.  The reality is that there are four Ministers and a Taoiseach running this country.  Where are the checks and balances?  What new powers will be given to backbench Deputies who, if truth be known, are as powerless as Members of the Seanad?  I see no provision for checks and balances.  <\/p><p>For all of the above reasons, I will be opposing this legislation.  I believe the day on which Seanad &Eacute;ireann will be abolished will be a sad day for this country.  It will be a sad day for this State, the Taoiseach of which refuses to allow debate on reform and for people to vote on that reform.  It is a sham for the Government to say that the people rather than it will be responsible for abolition of the Seanad.  The Government will campaign for its abolition.  This Bill will enable that process.  The Government is not allowing the people to vote for reform.  That is its failure.  It is a sham and a lie to say that the people rather than the Government will make that decision.   The Government is putting only one option to the people, namely, abolition of the Seanad.  There will be no reform, which is a failure of this Government.<\/p><p>It is time the Government stopped peddling untruths on this issue.  It is untrue for the Government to say that it is leaving this decision to the people.  It is giving the people Hobson's choice and no real option.  If the option is for the Seanad to remain as is or be abolished many people may vote for its abolition.  I believe if they had the option the majority of people in this State would vote for reform and for a democratic second Chamber that is fit for purpose.  They would also want to vote on D&aacute;il reform, which opportunity they will not be given either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000015#O01300","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373455200,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Before I call Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, I wish to read a note from the Cathaoirleach.

It is often the case, where a Government has a huge majority, that we go through a ritual not expecting any major change at the end of the day.  One of the reasons for this is the Whips system.  I have been listening to the debate on the abolition of the Seanad, in respect of which I have heard some wonderful contributions from the other side of the House.  It is clear that if they had the choice some Members opposite would be voting against this Bill.  However, the Whip system does not permit this.  While it is necessary to have a Whip system in most cases, as clearly shown by the House of Commons, it is possible to allow people a free vote at times without the whole Parliament falling apart.

Already, there is some light for Senators and what they stand for at the end of the tunnel, even if it is dim.  I have been surprised and delighted at the number of people who during the past few weeks have initiated discussion with me on the proposed referendum.  It is clear that when people realise what is on offer they are shocked.  Up to now, things were quiet, we were moving along at a leisurely pace and people believed the country was in good hands and that everything would come right on the other side.  They then realised we were in recession and began to question our regulatory system and those whom they had looked up to and thought were pillars of society, including bankers and so on.  They are now questioning the reason for the proposed abolition of one Chamber of the Oireachtas, asking questions such as is it because Senators have not done their job well or because they are not aware of who they are?  That is not our fault.  It does not mean we have not contributed in this House, that we have not beavered away for long hours on legislation or that we have not been successful in having hundreds of amendments accepted.  If does not mean any of that, rather it is a lack of knowledge, which is not our fault.  That is a matter for those who make that information available to the public.<\/p><p>The people are beginning to question whether abolition of the Seanad will be good for democracy.  They wonder why this is being proposed and if the Government is genuinely committed to having a better system and structure.  I will be opposing this legislation because as I have said from the outset I do not believe this issue has been handled properly.  There is no question about that.  This matter was dropped into the middle of an emotional election campaign.  Nobody but the Taoiseach knew about it.  Much of the spin around this issue has been deflated.  We were told about savings that would accrue as a result of this measure.  It is clear there were no facts to back that up.  We were also told there was a major restructuring taking place in the D&aacute;il.  That is not true.  There will be no major restructuring of the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>In my experience, the committee system has deteriorated in recent years.  It was proposed, based on a populous concept, that committees would cover up to nine portfolios.  The result has been small attendance at meetings and meetings held at the same time as the Seanad is sitting.  The committee system is not what it is being made out to be.  It has deteriorated.  The idea of replacing the Seanad if abolished with a non-mandated committee has been floated.  While I do not wish to be derogative about our civil servants, who are the best in the world, it is more than likely that most of those appointed to that non-mandated committee will be civil servants.  The accountability provided by this House will not be replaced.<\/p> <p>I am of the view that we still have an opportunity to deal with this matter in a logical and reasonable manner and not in a way which appears to indicate that we just want to defend our own positions.  People are ready to listen.<\/p><p>In the context of the amount of money the Government is going to spend on the referendum campaign, it must be remembered that judgments handed down in past court cases indicated that the way in which money was spent on particular referenda was not legal.  I genuinely hope that will not be the case on this occasion.<\/p><p>The Government is not offering any further arguments in respect of this matter.  Even if the amendments are not accepted, I hope we will be successful in ensuring that, as far as is politically possible, this House will present a united front.  I cannot imagine a situation whereby the Seanad will be abolished and the D&aacute;il will be left as it is currently constituted.  We live in strange times and people are angry.  They expect that some form of remedial action, which will get rid of the difficulties that exist and offer remedies in respect of the suffering and problems they are experiencing, is going to be taken.  If the House is abolished, there will obviously no longer be a reason for Ministers to come here.  I accept that at times Ministers feel somewhat uncomfortable when they are subjected to the type of informed interrogation they are obliged to endure in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000016#P00500","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373455800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>They deserve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000017#Q00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373455800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Unlike the D&aacute;il, this House is not all about personalities and soundbites.

However, this will not help democracy and it will not be fair to the people.  As a result of what is proposed in the Bill, people will not obtain the response they deserve.  The legislation before us does not represent the wishes of the people, nor does it reflect what Senators are hearing from them in respect of this matter.<\/p><p>  There is another bit of light at the end of the tunnel.  When this proposal was first floated, one would have been obliged to peruse the back pages of the newspapers in order to find any type of comment that was supportive of the Seanad.  However, a recent editorial in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i> referred to the vandalism connected with this proposal.  The tone used in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> and other newspapers indicates that a change is coming about.  This is because we have moved away from the stereotyping and the clowning and are now involved in genuine consideration of the democratic structures which obtain in this country.  In my view, this represents light at the end of the tunnel.  When the media - which is coming on board - ourselves and all like-minded people who genuinely respect and support democracy come together, I am convinced that everyone will see the Bill for what it is, namely, an ill-thought-out proposal.  The Bill is anti-democratic.  It takes the people for granted and does not provide them with the leadership to which they are entitled.  If it is enacted, they will not even be given an option in the context of how they might vote in the referendum.  This is because the Bill does not contain any reference to reform.  When the Seanad is abolished, what will be left?  Nothing whatsoever.<\/p><p>  This matter should have been referred to the Constitutional Convention.  There is no argument about that.  The convention would have been the ideal forum in which to discuss the future of the Seanad.  It is an insult to the people to present them with a &quot;to be or not to be&quot; style referendum and not even offer them the opportunity to vote on reform.  I am of the view that they will take that insult to heart.  I hope it might still be possible for us to retrace our steps and - I will not hold my breath in this regard - for once show the nature of real democracy.  People are losing respect for those in public life because they see the shenanigans that occur.  They are also aware of the hypocrisy relating to the systems and structures that are in place.  Let us provide them with real leadership.  This matter does not come down to being opposed to the Taoiseach or ranting against the parties in government or anyone else, it relates to why we are here in this House, namely, to represent the people.  Never has it been more necessary for us to fulfil that responsibility than is the case at present.  Who knows?  We may just experience a miracle when it comes to the vote on the legislation.

His costs are included in the Government's bogus figures in respect of how much it costs to run the Seanad.

In his article in Patrick Geoghegan's book on the Act of Union, Dr. James Quinn states:<blockquote>In the end, the passing of the Union was something of an anti-climax.  Edward Cooke commented on how quietly it was received, even in Dublin.  But the anti-climactic nature of the final debates on the Union to some extent obscured the magnitude of what had been accomplished.

It cannot be a place where people say one thing and do another.<\/p><p>The Government does not like the university seats or northerners.  The Minister of State would not believe the amount of correspondence I have received from my northern voters.  A man from Enniskillen asked me not to let the Government abolish the Seanad because he said it was vital for this country.  The Unionist parties were down last week and representatives from the SDLP were here yesterday.  The man asked why the Taoiseach had become a partitionist Taoiseach.  He said we need measures that unite the two communities in this country and that the Taoiseach would be denying his people their voting rights.  He said that it would go against the Good Friday Agreement and the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Those voting rights were in place when the agreements were signed but the Taoiseach is sweeping them away.  It is too awkward having northerners around here.  What will be next?  Will he ban northerners from the Irish rugby team or ban them from the Irish cricket team?  It would certainly solve the Rory McIlroy problem.  This Taoiseach does not like northerners.  Let him play for the United Kingdom in the Olympic Games.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach does not like universities either.  He is getting rid of the university seats.  I have come to try to help the Government but not only in matters of economics.  The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Kelly, was here.  He did not believe in satellite navigation systems.  We got in the professors in the relevant subjects to explain that it was not necessary to do a written examination for every county in Ireland in order to drive a taxi.  We managed to cure somewhat the technophobia of the Minister of State.  How do we tax heavy goods vehicles on the roads?  We got in touch with the civil engineering department in the college and learned that it should be done by the fourth power of the axle weight, not the unladen weight per vehicle.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy O'Dowd, was here for that.  He said that he could not consider it for six months and that he would have to do the research.  I put it to him that it was done already and it was simply a matter of pressing the button and the data could be printed out.<\/p><p>There is a problem with a lack of technological development in the Civil Service.  We are trying to help mitigate that in the House.  If it is not wanted, that is fine.  Trinity College Dublin ranks eighth in Europe and 48th in the world.  There are many other people who will listen to the type of wisdom that universities bring.  Anyway, it is a shameful act, without any reference to the record of service since 1607, to seek to abolish an entire constituency of people who have served the country splendidly.<\/p><p>Why is this Taoiseach different from his predecessors?  The former Taoiseach, Mr. Cosgrave, nominated Michael D Higgins to the Seanad.  The former Taoiseach, Mr. FitzGerald, began his career here.  Mr. Douglas Hyde became President after serving as a Senator, as did Michael D Higgins.  Why is the Taoiseach in a one-person minority, with people grovelling to him saying that they agree with them now, but they do not put up any argument?  Why is he dominating a traditionally democratic party, which the Fine Gael Party was once?  Senators from the Government side have quoted James Dillon and espoused the creative tension between the two Houses of Parliament.<\/p><p>This is a shameful exercise and I am pleased to see the opinion polls moving in our direction.  I imagine that when the Taoiseach turns up on &quot;Prime Time&quot; for the debate with Senator Norris it will complete the process and we will then have won.  This is such a waste of money and time.  The Government is destroying its political capital.  It is not reforming banks or senior elements in the Civil Service.  They are crucial people.  The Government blamed the collapse of the Celtic tiger on the Seanad without a shred of evidence to support the proposition.  The Government has now backed itself into a corner and, as Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, it should get out now while the going is good.  I will be praying every day that the Seanad will be retained and I believe people on the Government side should say the same prayers for the Seanad to be retained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000018#R00800","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1373456400,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Brilliant.

The Department of Finance answered parliamentary questions on the matter in the other House.  If that is the case, we need a debate and I would welcome that if it was truthful.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach has started off in a very lacklustre way because he is couching this as part of reform.  Senator Barrett put it clearly.  He referred to the abolition of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the reduction of the number of councillors, the abolition of town councils and the reduction in the number of Deputies, which was to be 20 and will now be eight in number.  Reduction and abolition do not amount to reform.  I speak as someone who served in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann during the last D&aacute;il and as someone proud to serve in the Seanad now.  I see many things done in Seanad &Eacute;ireann that would improve what happens in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The simple abolition of this House is not the way forward.  I will campaign vigorously against it, not as a Senator but as a citizen.  Other Senators remarked - as did I - on Second Stage that there have been over 540 amendments dealt with in this House and accepted by the Government.  One could put it that there were either 540 omissions or mistakes from the D&aacute;il which had to be corrected in law.  What is the Taoiseach proposing should go in its stead?  Perhaps the Minister of State will inform us today of what is being proposed in place of the Seanad, should it be abolished.<\/p><p>  It was cowardly in the extreme for the Taoiseach to say that if this referendum is defeated, there would be no reform.  We have tried.  There have been reforms in this Seanad.  I commend the Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, the Cathaoirleach, Senator Paddy Burke, and all Members of the Seanad.<\/p> <p>We have endeavoured to make this Chamber more relevant to open it up to the public, which we have done.  We have far more constructive debates than I experienced in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, and I still watch there.  We have had rafts of legislation introduced here, including another excellent Bill produced by Senator White this evening.  Where do we go if there is no Seanad?  What is in place?  The Taoiseach is proposing to give some additional powers to D&aacute;il committees.  With the exception of the Committee of Public Accounts, D&aacute;il and Oireachtas committees have failed because they have not been given the resources required to carry out their jobs.<\/p><p>There is no scrutiny of European legislation of any note in committees.  We have asked repeatedly for the Seanad to be given that role in scrutinising EU directives and legislation.  Senators could unpick those and report back to Government, which could report back to the EU.  However, the Taoiseach did not allow that either.  The Taoiseach will be remembered as one of the most autocratic taoisigh the country has ever seen.  His reform agenda is simply an agenda to centralise power.

For the past two weeks I have endeavoured to get a one hour debate on the new statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  One hour is all I seek and I cannot get it.  I cannot get that debate here in the Seanad to get a Minister to outline why the Government is proceeding with this.  If we are discussing reform, surely to God Ministers should be answerable, if not accountable, to this House.  As Senators and legislators, we should be able to raise issues on behalf of our constituents, the people who elect us and whom we represent.  That includes university Senators, Taoiseach's appointees and Senators, such as I, who were elected through the panel system.  I cannot even get one hour and yet the Government spent all day last Friday debating a Bill - which is good legislation - on moving to Central European Time.  That is fine.  Let us have that debate if the Government wants.  However, I cannot get an answer on why the Government is pulling the rug from under people in mortgage arrears.<\/p><p>A reformed D&aacute;il and Seanad would enable legislators to raise those points and hold Government to account.  However, we are not permitted to do so.  Apparently we are concerned about reducing the presidential term from seven to five years - big deal - and reducing the voting age from 18 to 16 - big deal.  The Government will not even give people the option of Seanad reform.  It would not even allow it go to the Constitutional Convention to be discussed.  It is putting a referendum to the people on reducing the voting age when only 52% of the Constitutional Convention agreed to that.  However, it is not holding a referendum on how people can get nominated to stand for the Presidency because it did not like the answer.  It did not take on board suggestions Senator Norris has made over the years and that were made at the Constitutional Convention to allow citizens to nominate people to run for the Presidency.<\/p><p>The Government is picking and choosing what it wants to drive the agenda.  It is driving its agenda by ripping asunder Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann which in the main has served the State very well in the time it has been in place.<\/p><p>What checks and balances will the Government introduce to the legislation as published?  In the Taoiseach's Second Stage speech he mentioned the powers of removal and impeachment of a President and removal of a Comptroller and Auditor General.  If the Seanad is abolished, just 60% of the D&aacute;il can vote for the removal of a Comptroller and Auditor General and 70% for the removal of a President.  I asked the Taoiseach directly if that would be done in the context of the removal of a party Whip.  An autocratic Taoiseach, like the current one, could simply propose the removal of the Comptroller and Auditor General because he did not like he was doing with a banking or any other inquiry and then whip every Fine Gael Party Deputy into removing the Comptroller and Auditor General or even the President.<\/p> <p>I hope we never have a Government with as sizeable a majority as the one this Government has, regardless of the lead party in that Government.  It is proven that large majorities are bad for democracy.  There is no question in my mind about that but if a Government had a large majority without a Seanad to make Ministers feel uncomfortable, answer questions, or at least request a Minister to come into the House to answer questions, hold him or her to account on social welfare Bills and produce legislation that was helpful to Government, where would we be heading?  Where is democracy heading in this country?  It is not too late for the Minister of State to change tack on this, even though he has published the Bill.<\/p><p>I do not mean to be derogatory but the Taoiseach did not give me the impression when he was in this House that his heart was in this measure.  That is strange for someone who, until a few years ago, was saying that a reformed Seanad would work and who, in that Fine Gael reform paper, spoke about the then Taoiseach coming to the Seanad once a month to answer questions.  He certainly has not lived up to that when he has been in the House twice in two and a half years, but it is not too late.  All of us must ensure the structures of the Legislature are protected and improved, and there is no doubt in my mind that they can be vastly improved.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach, my colleague, Senator O'Donovan, has produced a very good reform document, as have Senator Zappone and Senator Quinn, who published a very good Bill the Government accepted on Second Stage.  I do not understand the rush.  The Taoiseach continually states this measure is a commitment in the programme for Government, but numerous commitments in the programme for Government have been set aside.  It is not as if the Government is following commitments it made prior to the election or in the programme for Government.  It has ditched many of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000019#S01700","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373457600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1373457600,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Your party is in government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000020#T00300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1373457600,"counter":252,"content":"<p>It was in your manifesto as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000020#T00400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373457600,"counter":253,"content":"<p>You are the one who is proposing-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000020#T00500","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1373457600,"counter":254,"content":"<p>You proposed it in your party's manifesto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000020#T00600","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373457600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>You produced the Bill.

It is the Minister of State's policy.

He will have this fake campaign of reform during which people will be told to trundle out on RTE, TV3 and on radio and be their master's voice about the way the Taoiseach is a reforming Taoiseach and this is a reforming Government when we all know that is nonsense.  The Government is trying to hoodwink the people by diverting them from the decisions it will be taking in the budget in early October.  If the Government wants to have a referendum, why not have it after the budget?  Allow us debate the budget and allow the people see what it is proposing in the budget.

I have not met a Government Senator who agrees with its abolition, yet all of them vote for it on the basis that the people have to have their say.  That is fine, but when will take place?  Will the referendum be held before the budget?  Will the Minister of State give me the date or will he have a rushed two to three week campaign?  That is what he intends to do.  Have the days that the Government and groups of civil servants spent putting together this Bill been useful?  Is that time best spent for this Government?  Would its time not be better spent trying to fix some of the problems it faces, some it inherited but others it created, and some of which have got more serious such as the worsening mortgage arrears crisis?  Will it even allow a debate in this House on issues like that?<\/p><p>We will have other items to raise with the Minister of State but I ask him, in a non-partisan way, to look at the record of this Seanad so far and what has been done by way of debate, amendments to legislation and Bills being proposed.

I am incredibly proud to serve as a Member in this Seanad and I have no doubt that if a truthful campaign is allowed happen and if enough time is given to that campaign, this will not be the last Seanad.  I hope the Taoiseach, on his personal crusade, will be sent away with his tail between his legs on this issue because he has got it incredibly wrong, and I believe he knows that.  If the Government holds this referendum before the budget, it will be an opportunity for the people to give it a bloody nose.  I will be asking everyone in my area to oppose this referendum and send a clear signal to the Government that the electorate is not happy with the road it is taking on many issues.

That was 91 years ago.  After 15 years, the Government of the day decided it did not like the second House and then put forward a Constitution in 1937.  At that time it considered the options open to it, and these were such that it could have done without having a second House but it thought it through.  I believe the Government, and the people of the day who supported that Constitution, thought that through and decided they wanted checks and balances in place on the power of the larger House, which was democratically elected.  On that basis we have had a second House since then,and in 75 years it has served us well.<\/p> <p>Since the Constitution was introduced in 1937 we have had the experience of looking around the world and seeing how few countries have maintained their constitutions in spite of what happens.  I have not done my history and must get Senator Barrett to have a look at it.  In 1939, the Second World War began and our Constitution was under very severe threat I am sure, but the Government of the day stated it intended to stay neutral and did so.  We operated through the war with a Constitution which survived when many others did not.  I am probably the only Member of the House who remembers that time.  I remember going with my family to Rush on a Sunday in 1940 and being very excited by the sand dunes.  The following day Russia entered the war.  I was a little bit confused at that age between Rush and Russia and told everybody I had been there the day before and now the soldiers were fighting there.  I remember this very well.  I also remember my first visit to Croke Park in 1943.  Senator Barrett has spoken about Northerners.  My father who came from County Down told me as a young fellow not to cheer for the fellows in red because they were from Munster, but to cheer for the fellows in blue because they were from Cavan, which was in Ulster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000020#T01500","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373458200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>He was a very bright man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000021#U00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1373458200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>On that occasion the Ulster team won.

In 1958, I had an opportunity to spend a winter in France, and what an exciting time to spend in France because Alg&eacute;rie fran&ccedil;aise took place and the revolution or coup d'&eacute;tat occurred.  The army took over the French Fourth Republic and the constitution failed.  They got Charles de Gaulle to come in and take over and he introduced the Fifth Republic.

We held a referendum and it was a big challenge to our future.  We joined the EEC as it was in those days.  Our Constitution survived as did our democracy.  In 2008, the Minister of State was a Member of the other House and, like everybody, I remember the banking crisis of that year.  It threatened our future, our Constitution and our democracy.  The economic collapse which occurred in those days and seeking the bailout were major challenges but no abolition day was discussed.  Several years later, in the run-up to an election, a man hoping to become Taoiseach sprung this suggestion on us and proposed an abolition day.  We are not quite told when this would occur but we know the intention is it will occur.<\/p><p>Our Constitution will survive, as will our democracy, but only if we manage to have checks and balances and ensure we have a second opinion.  If a doctor tells me he or she wants me to have a serious operation, I will seek a second opinion.  If I go to a lawyer who tells me he or she wants me to go to court, but it will cost a very large sum of money if I lose, I will seek a second opinion.  Senator Norris spoke very well today about the second opinion in this House.  Senators Zappone, Crown and I have tabled two Bills which have passed Second Stage and they are worthy of consideration.  These Bills are with regard to a reformed Seanad.  Reform of the Seanad will not take place if we do not vote the correct way on abolition day.  I want our democracy and Constitution to survive.  This will not happen unless we commit ourselves to where we are going.<\/p><p>The Bill need serious consideration today.  Everybody should have a view on it and everybody should speak on it.

We must ensure it gets attention today.  I hope every Member of the House has an opportunity to speak his or her own mind, particularly those who are party members and obliged to have a Whip.  They should be able to speak.  Those on the Government side can state they are not in favour of an abolition day being fixed as proposed in section 1 but, as some have already stated, are in favour of holding a referendum so the people can decide.  Some have stated they intend to vote &quot;No&quot; and not to campaign in favour of a &quot;Yes&quot; vote.  If we argue the case well and make the case clearly, we will put off this abolition day; we will decide there is no need for it because there is a need for a second House which will provide a second opinion and the checks and balances which other nations have.<\/p><p>The United States is a good example.  Without having a strong Whip system in its Senate or House of Representatives, its constitution has survived since 1792 and has worked very well.  There have been amendments to it but it has not had an abolition day.  One of our tasks today is to ensure we debate this and ensure we do not have an abolition day as proposed in section 1 of the Bill.  I urge the Minister of State to listen very carefully and I urge the House to consider everything being said.  I also urge honesty and integrity from those who speak.  We should not shorten the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000021#U00500","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1373458200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House for another joust.

The history books show us that those who subverted democracy did so in an insidious way by inches.  All of a sudden, one woke up in the morning to find one's parliament was gone.<\/p><p>  For our ancestors in the cave, there was no democracy.  The biggest caveman with the biggest club became the tribal leader and everyone else did what he said.  To a certain extent, this approach still obtains in undemocratic countries, except it is no longer a club that he wields, but an army of tanks and guns.  It was a primitive way of organising society.  Somewhere along the line, wiser heads decided that there had to be a better way.  In ancient Greece, democracy first found the light of day.  The word &quot;democracy&quot; comes from two Greek words, &quot;d&ecirc;mos&quot; and &quot;kratos&quot;, meaning &quot;rule of the people&quot;.  The Athenians were the first to formulate society on the will of the people when they formed their city states.  The Greek work for a city state was &quot;polis&quot;, from which we get the word &quot;politician&quot;.  Everyone had a say.  In fact, there was too much of a say, because Athens needed to consult almost its entire population to make any decision before it trimmed the process down.<\/p><p>  The Athenians began to hone and perfect a form of democracy.  They even used a plebiscite, a crude type of referendum.  For example, if a piece of broken pottery - this was called an ostraka - with a man's name on it was put into a bowl and a sufficient number of people followed suit, the man would be ostracised, in that he had to leave the city state for ten years.  This is where the word &quot;ostracised&quot; comes from.  I am giving a Greek lesson.  The Athenians perfected their democracy and it worked.  Athens went on to become one of the wealthiest states in the world.<\/p><p>  The Romans picked up on this.  Although they had kings at one point, they quickly turfed them out and put in place the<i> senatus populesque romanum<\/i>, the senate and people of Rome.  The tribunes represented the people and the members of the senate, while a privileged class, had a democratic semblance.  They made sure that no dictator could come to the fore.  As we know, they dealt with the great Julius Caesar in a certain way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000022#V00300","speaker":"1142"},{"type":"speech","time":1373458800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>It was effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000022#V00400","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1373458800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Yes.  In more modern times, we have seen how fragile democracy can be.  With the exception of the French revolution, which was an overnight and sensational affair, other governments were gradually taken over.  The classic example was the fascist movement.  Mussolini appeared to be a man of the people at the beginning, but he then decided to usurp control and famously marched on Rome, frightening the life out of the king and everyone else.  Hey presto, he was in government.  He ruled through fascism and hatchet men, the Blackshirts.<\/p><p>Observing this, Hitler decided that it was the way to go in Germany, leading to the Brownshirts, the bully boys.  He did not get into power overnight.  He fought umpteen elections, going from 5% of the total poll to 28% or 29%.  Clever people believed that they could handle him and they allowed him into government but he was smart.  Like the cuckoo who got into the nest, he quickly kicked out the other eggs and took over.  Then he decided that parliament was a hindrance to him because people like the socialists and communists were saying things with which he did not agree.  Then there was the mysterious fire in the Reichstag one night when the entire building went up in smoke.  I think the Taoiseach missed out on that one.

Clearly, they have no stomach for this debate.<\/p> <p>I was speaking about the danger to democracy and how a previous Government, under the leadership of &Eacute;amon de Valera, also had to contend with a subversive organisation, the so-called IRA.  It spent the Second World War collaborating and playing funny games with the Germans and raided the Magazine Fort in the Phoenix Park.  The organisation also brought German spies into this country and in doing so was totally at odds with the then Government.  The IRA remained a threat to democracy in this country until recently, when it finally decided to pack in its activities.  Some remaining splinter groups of that organisation believe democracy is not important because they, even though they represent only 1% or less of the population, do not agree with it.  That is the background to my opposition to section 1.  It is important democracy is protected.  Erosion of democracy starts small and continues until it is gone.  <\/p><p>The Taoiseach's commentary around an alternative to the Seanad was ill-advised.  Following that commentary, the Taoiseach was immediately called aside by his handlers and we have not heard any more on the matter.  The Taoiseach suggested that this House should be peopled by so-called experts and others of exceptional wisdom, to be appointed by him.  Such people are to have no democratic mandate.  While we may be flawed in many ways we have been through an electoral process.  It is not easy to get elected to this House.  It is a difficult and testing process.  The Taoiseach proposed to wave a wand and fill the seats of the Seanad with his friends and people in whom he has confidence and trust.  It was a hair-brained idea, one which the Taoiseach has not repeated.  However, it is a matter that will have to be addressed if the proposed referendum is to proceed.  I hope it will not.  I hope this Bill will be defeated by a sufficient number of Senators, not because I want to deprive the people of a vote - far from it, we are all democrats - but because they should be offered a proper choice.  If this Bill is defeated, the Taoiseach and the Government, to its relief, will be forced to reconsider the matter and introduce alternative legislation based on proposals such as those put forward by Senators Zappone, Quinn and O'Donovan.  Let those proposals be put to the people.<\/p><p>Those Senators opposite who say they support retention of the Seanad but propose to support the passage of the Bill in order that the people will have an opportunity to decide on the matter are doing a disservice to the people.  There is no point putting the wrong question to the people.  To do so is unfair.  It is giving the people a Hobson's choice.  Let us defeat this Bill, following which the Taoiseach might come back with a more considered, intelligent and progressive approach which, if put to the people in a referendum, we could all support.  We do not want a star chamber in place of the Seanad.  The star chambers were invented by the kings of England in medieval times.  When they needed advice they would convene a star chamber, the people of which would advise on how to proceed.  They quickly became a dictatorship themselves.  That is what would become of what is being proposed.  Such a chamber would be answerable to nobody but the Taoiseach, who could probably dismiss them as quickly as he or she appointed them.<\/p><p>We have seen from the debate on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013 how important this Chamber is.  There has been much more debate on that issue in this Chamber, even if only on the Order of Business, than there has been in the other House.  It has also been a much more enlightened debate.  I am in the minority among my party in the Seanad in that I will be supporting that legislation.  I have listened with great interest to the commentary of people on all sides of the debate.  Without the Seanad, that debate would be greatly diminished.  While I am critical of the Taoiseach in terms of his attitude to the Seanad and his arrogant behaviour of late on many other issues, he has shown great courage in staying the course in the debate on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill despite fierce and unprecedented pressure from within his party and from powerful institutions and organisations, some of them public and others anything but public.  <\/p><p>I recently raised the issue in this House of who is funding the group opposed to the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000022#V01300","speaker":"1142","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373459400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>It would be nice to know that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000023#W00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1373459400,"counter":287,"content":"<p>That information will have to be made known because there will be other debates in which this group will get involved.

I look forward to continuing this debate should this legislation be passed.  Those who support it have nothing other than codology to say, with which they are trying to fool the people.<\/p><p>There is another issue worth mentioning.  Two groups are responsible for electing the 43 panels of Senators.  These are made up of the nominating bodies and the electorate, made up in the main of county councillors.  The nominating bodies take their responsibilities seriously.  They will not nominate a person for election to the Seanad unless they have interviewed and vetted him or her.  It is a stiff process.  Once nomination is secured, the person then has to face his or her county councillors.  As I said earlier, county councillors do not vote for fools.  They put candidates through a rigorous process before electing them to this House.  These people are legitimately entitled to a vote in respect of a chamber like the Seanad.  They have earned that right.  There is a real connection between Parliament and the people because every county councillor represents an average of 2,000 people.  The quota in County Kerry when I was up for election was 2,500 voters.  Those elected are answerable to those 2,000 people and the councillor who votes for them.  As such, if one gets 50 county councillor votes, one has a lot of people to account to and look after.  Councillors know how to use this privilege.  They use us as a conduit to Government.  We make arrangements for them to meet Ministers, present them with information, circulate them with legislation and so on.  This will be taken from them.  Also, university graduates will no longer have the privilege of voting for someone from their college.  It is proposed that this system will not be replaced.  This must also be resisted.<\/p><p>The timing of this referendum has been raised a great deal.<\/p> <p>I would say a lot of midnight oil was burned by the mandarins to get this particular date lined up.

I listened to Senators David Norris and Ned O'Sullivan and I am in a quandary not about whether the Seanad should be retained or abolished but about whether there is a need for a bicameral model.  I believe there is a need for a bicameral model.  The subdivision of that debate is whether the Seanad, as it exists, should be abolished.  That is quite a nuanced debate and there are plenty of arguments to be made on both sides, some of which have to do with the way the Seanad is run.  <\/p><p>The Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, were involved in what is called the &quot;Mary O'Rourke report&quot; in 2004.  The Minister of State made a lot of suggestions in the deliberations on how to reform the Seanad but the clearest sentence in the report was that the Seanad had no distinctive role in Irish society, or in Irish politics.  It was not a subjective comment or a kind of judgment on the Seanad but it was the House itself saying in 2004 that there was no connection or no emotional, philosophical or, indeed, constitutional connection between the citizens and the work of the Seanad.  That is not the fault of this Seanad or its Members but it was a very clear statement of the shortcomings of the Seanad.<\/p><p>We have been put in a position where we cannot discuss the nature of bicameralism.

I urge other Members to read the Leader's remarks because they were very smart and intelligent.  I suspect I know how he will vote if this Bill is passed and the question is put before the people.<\/p><p>I mentioned &quot;Four Roads to Glenamaddy&quot; as a metaphor earlier.  There are four roads in terms of political reform.  It really is disheartening and depressing to think that this Government came into power on a tidal wave of reform, a sense that it could re-imagine Irish politics and heighten that level of trust and participation between citizens and the Oireachtas and yet it is taking quite a piecemeal and disruptive approach to political reform.  The first of the four roads is the Presidency.  We are looking to reduce the term of office of the President, a matter which was discussed at the Constitutional Convention.  <\/p><p>The second road is D&aacute;il reform which has been really piecemeal.  It was interesting to hear somebody as moderate as Deputy Charlie Flanagan, who is chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party, being quite clear and critical of his own Government not only in regard to the progress of reform but the depth of it.  The famous Friday sittings - I am reminded of the catch phrase &quot;It's Friday, it's five to five and it's Crackerjack&quot; - do not, in any way, prove that the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government is interested in reform because those sittings are not a coherent response to reform.<\/p><p>The third road is the committees.  Potentially, the committees are the one area in which real engagement and real action can occur.  I have had the privilege of sitting with Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and for the year and a half before Christmas, we watched the brief of six or seven Ministers.  Clearly, there are not enough committees.  I would not hold the popular view that we need fewer politicians.  If anything, we need a sufficient number of politicians to do the work.  The committee system, as it operates, disincentivises Deputies and Senators from investing in the work as there are no votes there because of the fourth road to Glenamaddy, local government reform.  There is still a sense that Deputies and Senators need to spend more time in their constituencies dealing with important work.<\/p> <p>I am not in any way undermining that but the time to spend on policy and research is quite limited.  The engagement and the level of expertise at the committee level should be greater, and there should be more committees.  I can see the possibility of improved committee structures leading to greater trust, engagement and deliberation on legislation.<\/p><p>The nearest I have come to what could be called non-adversarial and constructive politics are debates in the Seanad.  I know there is difficult legislation ahead of us in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill but I know we will respect each other's views.  There will be grave concern and disagreements but the process will work in a way that will show manners and respect.  I can see this at committee level too, although some reform is necessary.  The problem is we are being asked to assess this Bill when critical political reform is non-existent in other areas of our parliamentary democracy, which is a concern.  We are being asked to vote on this either on a nod and a wink or as a promise without evidence of political reform.<\/p><p>I have been quite proud of the Constitutional Convention and I previously worked on the We the Citizens programme, which showed how such a convention can work.  I know Senators Norris and Zappone wanted to amend the work of the committee but could not because the Oireachtas agreed a work programme.  One of my amendments to the Bill was rejected as being out of order, and I got the notice this morning although I put the amendment in last Friday.  I prepared a long speech but I cannot give it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000024#X01400","speaker":"1167","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373460600,"counter":312,"content":"<p>The Senator may do so on the section.

I have plenty of other research.  The Minister of State will enjoy this.<\/p><p>  The Seanad was abolished in 1936.  This is fascinating and relevant.  Why was it abolished in 1936 and restored?  The Seanad was abolished in May 1936 after serious clashes with the D&aacute;il over the Seanad's use of its powers to delay legislation, in particular, the implementation of priority legislation of the Government like the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Bill 1932, which was very close to the heart of &Eacute;amon de Valera, and the Wearing of Uniforms (Restrictions) Bill 1934.  The enactment of the Bill to abolish the Seanad was also delayed.  The Government did not have a majority in the Seanad at the time.  Professor Tom Garvin attributed the political imbalance which resulted in the abolition of the Seanad to triennial elections.  Abolition of the Seanad featured in the Fianna F&aacute;il election manifesto in 1933, according to Professor Dermot Keogh and Dr. Andrew McCarthy in <i>The Making of the Irish Constitution 1937<\/i> (2007).  I had an audience with de Valera in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in in 1972 with my wife who was then Mary O'Connor.  He was a wonderful, inspirational man.  <\/p><p>  Although de Valera was opposed to having a Seanad, he established a commission, which the Minister should possibly look at, to look at the proposal for a second Chamber in 1936 as part of preparations for a new Constitution.  It was a concession to the many people who felt that a second Chamber was desirable.  The same applies now.  The Commission produced three reports - a majority report and two minority reports.  Each of them supported the proposal for a second Chamber but recommended different powers and compositions.  The constitutional provision for the new Seanad took ideas from all three reports.  To de Valera, the value of the Seanad lay in its legislative role.  Introducing the draft Constitution in a D&aacute;il debate on 11 May 1937, de Valera stated that:<blockquote>My attitude is that, even though some of us may be largely indifferent to the question of whether or not there is a Seanad, if a large section of the people of the country think that there is something important in having a Seanad, then, even if we ourselves are indifferent to it, we should give way to the people who are anxious for it. <\/blockquote>In 1937, the Constitution - Bunreacht na h-&Eacute;ireann - was voted for by my and other Members' parents.  To my knowledge, nobody in this House voted for it but their parents and grandparents certainly voted for it.  It provided for a Seanad based on ideas of vocational representation and corporatism popular in Europe at this time and which were endorsed by the papacy in the encyclical produced in 1931 by Pope Pius XI.  He was a brilliant man.  This stressed, as an alternative to class conflict, an institutionalisation of sectoral divisions based essentially on groupings----- <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000026#Z02100","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1373461200,"counter":344,"content":"<p>When are we going to get back to section 1?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000026#Z02200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1373461200,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I am dealing with section 1 because this is the genesis of abolition.

That is what we are here for.  Its role as a check and balance was limited to the legislative process because the Government is responsible to the D&aacute;il.  The new Seanad would have 60 Members with a term following that of the D&aacute;il.  Its power over money Bills was the same as that of the old Seanad and its suspensory power over legislation was reduced from 18 months to 90 days.  If this Bill is rejected here, 90 days must pass before the D&aacute;il can overrule our decision.  That is three months, which will go into next year - September, October, November and December.<\/p><p>The panel elections were provided for in legislation in 1937 and later under the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act 1947.  The 1937 Act provided for 355 electors:  Deputies, Senators and seven city and council electors who were elected from the councils.  The Cathaoirleach benefited greatly from that and was a most popular choice of councillors from all over Ireland, north, south, east and west.

I served as Minister of State at the Department of Transport and Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from 23 March 1982 until 14 December 1982.  I also served as Minister of State at the Department of Health from 12 March 1987 until 12 July 1989.  I will talk about the main legislation I steered through the Seanad while serving as Minister of State to show the benefit of this House.  This is the point I made here.  I am the longest serving Member of the Oireachtas in this House and the only former Minister in this House.  How and why did I respect this House?  I can prove my respect for this House.  I respect the Minister of State coming here as he has always treated this House with enormous respect and given it an enormous amount of time.  I brought in the Adoption Act 1998.  The primary purpose of this Act was to enable the adoption of certain categories of children, mainly legitimate children with a parent or parents alive, who were not eligible for adoption under the law as it existed.<\/p> <p>During the Seanad Committee Stage I, as the then Minister of State, accepted an amendment proposed by the late Senator Nuala Fennell, Fine Gael, and supported by Mary Robinson, Independent, to delete the word \"illegitimate\" from the Bill.  That amendment was not proposed when the Bill was brought through the D&aacute;il.  That is another example of a very important issue.  The word \"illegitimate\" hurt many people and was banned in that Bill.<\/p><p>The Health (Amendment) Act 1987 provided for the imposition of charges in respect of outpatient services.  It sounds familiar.  I did not like bringing in that Bill but I had to.  In introducing the Bill, as the then Minister of State I said I was pleased to have an opportunity for the second time that day to come before the Upper House.  I had not previously been a Senator.  The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990 was initiated in the Seanad.  The purpose of the Act was to provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with powers to take bodily samples such as blood, urine or saliva from a person suspected of serious criminal offences for forensic testing.  The main purpose of the Trade and Marketing Promotion Act 1991 was to merge C&oacute;ras Tr&aacute;cht&aacute;la and the Irish Goods Council.  The Liability for Defective Products Act 1991 gave effect, in Irish law, to European Community directive 85\/374\/EEC on liability for defective products which was adopted on 25 July 1985.  The directive was described by me as the then Minister of State as, &quot;without question, the most significant measure to emerge so far in the Community in the areas of consumer protection&quot; and that, as a result of the Bill being passed the &quot;Irish consumers will be advanced in a very significant way by providing additional legal redress.&quot;  One of the contributors was a former Senator Pat Kennedy, who was an expert in that particular field.  I listened to him.  We debated the Bill for days and he made a great contribution.<\/p><p>There was also the Patents Act 1992.  I was then Minister of State with responsibility for trade.  The main purpose of that Act which replaced the Patents Act 1964 was to establish examination procedures for patent applications which were less officially time-consuming.  The Act also enabled the State to ratify the European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty.  I got great support from the Elan Corporation which happened to be located in my constituency.  It was more than helpful and I took much advice from Don Payne who was then managing director who created about 500 jobs in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000026#Z03300","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373461800,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Will the Senator please return to the section?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000027#AA00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1373461800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I am trying to make the point how effective the House has been.

There is something seriously wrong with our system of government.  The evidence for this has been apparent for the past several years.  Those of us who have a visceral, emotional and fanatical devotion to the concept of absolute democracy will freely admit that, to paraphrase the old adage, democracy is a terrible system of government but it beats the hell out of all the others.  There are many historical aspects to our stable democracy of which we can be very proud.  I refer to the peaceful transfer of power in the early days of the State between the two rival parties whose members had actually shot at one another during the Civil War some years before, the fact that we survived the Second World War, sundry economic emergencies and armed sedition - from within and without - on the part of the forces of extremist nationalism.  Those forces sully the word \"republicanism\", which should itself always be spelled with a small \"r\".   However, there is still something seriously wrong with our democracy.<\/p><p>I say this because it is fairly obvious that most of the events surrounding the economic meltdown we experienced in recent years were not acts of God.  These could have been prevented by the actions of certain men and women if they had been in the right place and made the right decisions.  However, that did not happen.  While we are delighted that we have a system of government which minimises, but does not entirely eliminate, the potential for despotism and which maximises, although does not completely translate into, the will of the people being reflected in the halls of Government, it does not operate optimally.  How else can one explain the fact that, with the honourable exception of the Labour Party, all of the major parties helped to inflate the Celtic tiger economy and then supported the blanket bank guarantee, two actions which, as we now know, were catastrophic?  How else can one explain the fact that those who are now loudest in their criticism of the actions of the then Government were proponents of such actions when they were in opposition?  Nobody was prepared to put his or her hand up and say &quot;Stop&quot;.  The reason for this is that our system of government often - although not always - incentivises the election of the wrong people in the wrong way.<\/p><p>We hold local elections which are fought by people who basically campaign on local issues and who invoke a thin veneer of national interest from time to time.  This bizarre system is brought to its apotheosis in circumstances where if one is running for election to the D&aacute;il, one's bitterest opponent will be one's party and constituency colleague.  I am not a professional politician and I do not like it when people refer to me as a politician.  I like to think of myself as an advocate and that my day job is my day job and that is how it will always be.  I can, therefore, consider this matter from the outside and perhaps wag my finger in a slightly accusatory manner when I say that it seems awfully bizarre that two individuals who are supposed to be buying into the same ideology and the same set of values, aspirations, goals and ambitions for their country can find themselves locked together like feral beasts during that quinquennial gladiator festival that is our general election cycle.<\/p><p>I intend no disrespect and I am a great believer in absolute democracy.  I am also of the view that democracy should reflect the will of the people.  I am not instinctively in favour of technocracy.  In view of the fact that all the decisions relating to a very complicated economic situation are currently being made by three teachers - I am sure they were very good teachers - and a former union representative and that no one in the Lower House, or among the front-line officials in the Department of Finance, possessed a PhD in economics when critical decisions were being made in the late summer and autumn of 2008, one must ask whether we are putting forward to run for election the right people who possess the right expertise and national perspective.  Even though I am sure there were smart people in the previous D&aacute;il who understood that Ireland was not going to be the first country in the world which, despite the evidence of history, was going to have an infinite and ever-accelerating property bubble that would never collapse, no one stated - in the national interest and despite the fact that it might not be wise to do so from an electoral point of view - that it might be time to stop, even if doing so would precipitate the inevitable decline in property prices that eventually occurred.  Had someone done so, that decline might have happened in a more controlled fashion.  However, no one was prepared to speak up because all people were interested in was the next election.<\/p><p>That is one of the reasons I decided to run for election to the Seanad.  In many ways, this House is &quot;D&aacute;il lite&quot;.  It is a place to which people who do not want to give up their day jobs but who are prepared to sacrifice their time can come and can hopefully make some contribution to the national discourse.  I would like to believe that the latter was the original intention of those who framed the 1937 Constitution.  The Seanad was never supposed to be another Chamber filled with full-time politicians and functionaries of political parties.  It was supposed to be a House with limited powers and a well-defined role which could augment the pure democracy of the D&aacute;il by introducing an extra level of scrutiny and expertise without in any sense trying to foster some notion of elitism or make an attempt to subvert the D&aacute;il's role.<\/p> <p>However, that is not what happened.  We all know what happened.  Again, I am not pointing fingers.  Those who are full-time politicians and who are interested in political careers and political parties will always consider ways to advance their careers in politics.  The Seanad was a great big turkey waiting to be plucked.  It was another prize that could be grasped by politicians and used as a place where careers could either be built or sheltered and nurtured during the rocky times of rough weather in the D&aacute;il, and where there could be a gentle let-down towards the end of their careers.  It was also seen as a place where people who did not necessarily want to be full-time politicians but who were party loyalists could obtain some degree of reward.  That is what happened in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000028#BB00100","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373463000,"counter":386,"content":"<p>It is obvious that the Senator never ran on the panels from which we were elected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000029#CC00200","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1373463000,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Senator Crown, without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000029#CC00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1373463000,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Senator Crown interrupts me now and again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000029#CC00400","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1373463000,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Senator Crown, without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000029#CC00500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1373463000,"counter":390,"content":"<p>The Seanad became one of two highly dysfunctional Chambers which we have now in the Oireachtas.

As she is aware, I am one of her biggest fans.  The purpose of the Parental Leave Bill 2013 is to provide for both maternity and paternity leave for parents of newborn children.  It allows fathers the opportunity to share the maternity leave allocation of 26 weeks from the workplace if the mother so wishes.  This innovative legislation proposes that the current maternity leave scheme be amended to enable a women to transfer a proportion of her maternity leave and benefits to the father of the child.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill, which provides for maternity and paternity leave for parents of a newborn child.<\/p> <p>This is part of an overall Fianna F&aacute;il strategy aimed at creating jobs and stimulating growth in the economy by encouraging women entrepreneurs to develop their businesses.  It seeks to amend Part II of the Maternity Protection Act 1994 to provide an entitlement to maternity or paternity leave after the birth of an employee's child.  The Bill also has the added impact of enabling fathers to have a more hands-on opportunity in the rearing of their children, including newborn babies, while underpinning the concept of a shared responsibility for the care of children.<\/p><p>The greatest challenge facing the country is to create employment to offer hope and a potential living to the 300,000 unemployed and the young people in our schools and colleges.  The only way we can create jobs is to encourage new enterprise.  The responsibility for raising young children rests almost entirely with women.  The biggest untapped source of enterprise is 50% of the population, women, who face multiple barriers in becoming entrepreneurs and developing business.<\/p><p>My contribution to easing the barriers is to allow fathers to share the responsibility of maternity leave.  This flexibility in the maternal leave scheme would allow women entrepreneurs to devote more time to their enterprises, develop their businesses and create jobs.  International studies show that women entrepreneurs are lagging significantly behind their male counterparts and Ireland reflects this international trend with women early-stage entrepreneurs in Ireland outnumbered, with two and a half times more men in top business positions than women.<\/p><p>The Bill is one of a series of innovative initiatives contained in the forthcoming Fianna F&aacute;il policy paper I have produced and which will be launched next week.  It is about promoting women entrepreneurs.  It offers fresh thinking in employment solutions.  I have experience having started up Lir Chocolates with Connie Doody in 1986 and the company now employs 150 people.  I know from experience what are the difficulties.  I never thought that women were discriminated against because I never felt discriminated against.  From my research and based on all the academic studies, Irish women are not as self-confident as Irish men about their ability to start up, run and grow a business.  One of my key recommendations is to establish a national office for women entrepreneurs within Enterprise Ireland - we would not need to set up a new organisation.  We should encourage women to work in teams rather than operating solo.  That is why Connie Doody and I were able to create a business.  We worked 24 hours a day and seven days a week for 16 years, but it was a team effort.  One hears very little of State bodies encouraging people to start up as teams.  My paper contains approximately 14 initiatives, one of which is encouraging teams.<\/p><p>When we started Lir Chocolates the philosophy and policy was a step-by-step approach, involving learning everything about one's local domestic market first, which we did.  We then moved to the North and then further.  When Tesco took over Quinnsworth my world fell apart.  However, it gave us an opportunity and we took it.  We went straight into 700 stores in the UK.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Quinn for his support.  I will tell a little anecdote.  We could not afford to have outer cases for our boxes of chocolate in the beginning.  So every week I used to go to Superquinn in Ballinteer where we live and the ladies in the deli used to keep the Castlemahon chicken outer boxes.  I used to collect ten or 12 of those and deliver our boxes of chocolates to the shops with which we were doing business.  I pay thanks to both Senator Quinn and Tesco.  I also thank Mr. Tom Nolan.<\/p><p>Half the population are women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000029#CC01000","speaker":"1156","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373463300,"counter":396,"content":"<p>More than half.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000030#DD00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1373463300,"counter":397,"content":"<p>More than half.

Our party leader, Deputy Martin, asked me to prepare a policy paper on women entrepreneurs.  We will launch it towards the end of next week and we will deal with it here in the Seanad because I believe we will be here the following week.

I have high regard for the Minister of State and I believe the Bill is worthy of being accepted on Second Stage.  As a father, I recognise that should a woman decide to share the maternity leave - it should be her choice - with her partner or husband that should be allowed.  The Bill would amend Part II of the Maternity Protection Act 1994 to provide an entitlement to maternity or paternity leave.<\/p><p>Maternity leave has been extended considerably over the past 20 years.  Women are entitled to 26 paid weeks and an optional 16 weeks unpaid maternity leave.  Under the current State benefit maternity leave system only the mother is allowed to avail of that payment.  The current system does not allow a woman to transfer part of her paid maternity leave should she wish to do so to the father so that he can share in caring for the child.  If such a partial transfer was possible it could allow a woman greater options, control and flexibility over the time she decides to take off after the birth of her child.  Amending the current maternity leave scheme to enable a woman to transfer a portion of her maternity leave and benefits to the father of the child would allow the woman to work outside the home and spend more time in her job.<\/p> <p>It would also have the added effect of a better, more hands-on approach being taken by the father.  It does not seek to make any compulsory change.  That would be the choice of the woman in that instance should the Bill be accepted.<\/p><p>It is interesting to note that paternity leave is not recognised in our employment law.  There is no obligation on employers to grant male employees special paternity leave, either paid or unpaid, following the birth of their child.  Annual leave taken following the birth of a child is treated in employment in the same way as any other leave at any other time of the year, and it is at the discretion of the employer to decide who can and cannot take annual leave at a given time.  I am aware of instances, particularly in a challenging economic environment, where employers will not grant annual leave for a life-changing event for a father such as the birth of his child.  The Civil Service, for example, provides for a period of paid leave for male employees following the birth or adoption of their child.  Fathers employed in the Civil Service are entitled to a special paternal leave period of three days with pay in respect of children born after 1 January 2000.<\/p><p>The Bill Senator White has put forward will bring us further into line with some of our European colleagues, but I believe it will go even further than that.  Austria, Denmark, Italy and France provide two weeks paternity leave.  Iceland grants its fathers three months away from work at 80% of their salary.  We know that is not an option at the moment, and Senator White knows that too, but this proposal would not impose any additional cost on the Exchequer or on an employer.  It simply gives the option to share that leave up to a maximum of 14 weeks.  The mother might take 22 weeks fully paid leave, with the father taking four weeks.  We are not proposing an exact split; it is flexible.<\/p><p>I would hope that this Bill, which has been very well put together and which I believe is workable, will have the effect of putting more responsibility on fathers on the birth of a child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000030#DD00500","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373463900,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000031#EE00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1373463900,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I remember when my four year old was born and it is far more onerous for the mother than for the father, particularly for a woman working outside the home.

I would caution against increasing maternity leave from 26 weeks to 28 weeks.  I would consider, in the current climate, that in the short term at least that is not sustainable financially.  I understand we have among the best maternity leave periods in Europe.  The Minister, Senator White and Senator Moran would know more about this than me but it is not too long ago when it was ten weeks and then 14 weeks.  Coupled with that, a woman expecting a baby might have to go on maternity leave two weeks prior to her due date but for health reasons could not contemplate returning to work other than after four weeks.  There is a six-week period in which, with the best will in the world, there will not be equality, for obvious health reasons.<\/p><p>The principle of equality beyond that for fathers of children in terms of maternity leave is something I would espouse.  Senator O'Brien has a four year old child.  I do not have any children and therefore I am not as equipped as others to comment on this area but Senator O'Brien always makes good contributions, and the points he made are compelling.  I agree also with the principle of fathers having responsibilities beyond even what is contained in Senator White's legislation.<\/p><p>I concur with Senator O'Brien's comments about the American phraseology but what it is depicting is not appropriate.  I have often said that fathers who renegued on their responsibilities when it comes to maintenance should have it deducted at source or their tax increased to take account of the maintenance due.  When social welfare is being paid a deduction at source should be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000031#EE01000","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1373463900,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000031#EE01100","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1373463900,"counter":411,"content":"<p>In terms of the provisions, the financial difficulties that would be imposed in the current environment by increasing the leave from 26 to 28 weeks is an issue but if the principle of the Senator's Bill was accepted, all these issues could be thrashed out on Committee Stage.

I would like to see an enhancement of parental responsibility beyond the 26 weeks and a loosening up in terms of people wishing to take unpaid leave, not just in the public sector but in the private sector also.  Incentives should be given whereby if a family is in a position financially to allow one of the spouses take time off to care for a child until the age of four or five, the State should not stand in the way of parents doing that.  The public service is reasonably flexible in terms of people trying to achieve that goal in life.  It is probably more difficult in the private sector, particularly for someone in management and those with specific expertise.  With the greatest will in the world employers do not want to let good staff go and probably are not in a position for production, managerial and a raft of other reasons to facilitate unpaid leave.<\/p> <p>The Government should take any opportunities it has to act as a partner in such an environment.

I will speak in support of the Bill and highlight some issues which could be addressed on Committee Stage to strengthen it and broaden its scope.<\/p><p>Sitting here on such a beautiful day we are all aware of work-life balance and getting it right is notoriously difficult, particularly in the current economic environment where parents feel their choice to take leave to be with young children has been significantly diminished and in some cases removed.  Children often lose out with regard to bonding time with both parents in early years.  It is important we support parents of young children in this difficult balancing act of caring for a young family and working.  The best outcome for children is a quality early childhood experience with their parents and quality early years education.<\/p><p>Parental leave is very important because it gives parents an equal role in caring for their children and helps break down negative and prevailing gender stereotypes about child care.  In this regard I express my support for the overwhelming vote of the Constitutional Convention in support of considering Article 42.1 of the Constitution which refers to women in the home.  A total of 98% of delegates voted in favour of a proposal to alter the article to make it more gender neutral and acknowledge the important role of other carers in the home.  It would be an important amendment to our Constitution in the fight against gender stereotyping.<\/p><p>If fathers taking and sharing paternity leave in the early part of their children's lives were the norm and actively encouraged I believe employers would be far less likely to apply, intentionally or unintentionally, bias in terms of hiring and promoting staff.

Making this change with regard to parental leave would encourage and enable women to remain in the workforce after they have children by taking and sharing leave entitlements with their partner.<\/p><p>Ireland has a birthrate of 16.2% which is the highest in Europe and these children are our future labour force and contributors to our pension fund.  We know supporting a healthy birth rate is very important.  I will contrast this with Germany, which has a birthrate of 8.1% which is the lowest birth rate in the EU.  A connection has been drawn between its maternity leave arrangements, which in effect saw female employees getting sucked into an inequitable model of child care and losing their career footing after spending lengthy periods of leave in one go, and a slump in the birthrate.  In 2007 the system was overhauled to encourage fathers to take up more parental leave.<\/p><p>Sweden has a very flexible parental leave system and either working parent can take and share an entitlement of 16 months paid leave per child at 80% of salary.  This cost is divided between the state and the employer.  Norway has a paternal quota scheme.  Norwegian parents may take 46 weeks of parental leave at 100% pay or 56 weeks at 80% pay, with three weeks before and six weeks after birth reserved for the mother, while ten weeks of total parental leave is reserved for the father.<\/p><p>All these systems reinforce the importance of the first year of a child's life, which has been shown by research, and also shows the importance of balancing between the father and mother.  I am concerned because there is a gender bias throughout our legislation.  If we look at current parental leave only if the parents work for the same employer can they look to share their parental leave entitlements.  The Government has stated it plans to reform this area and bring us into line with the European directives allowing parental leave to be interchanged between new parents.<\/p><p>We need to be ambitious.  I understand the economic climate we are in, but when we examine legislation we should aim for where we wish to go.  We want gender equality in caring responsibilities and I would like to see a paternal quota and not a mother's entitlement to give leave to the father.  We should clearly state in legislation that fathers have a role.  In Sweden if the father does not take up the leave it is lost.  This means employers look at men and women in the same way and it ensures the leave is taken.<\/p><p>I suggest we also examine and include adoptive leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000032#FF00400","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1373464500,"counter":416,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000032#FF00500","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1373464500,"counter":417,"content":"<p>It is certainly something I will raise on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000032#FF00600","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1373464500,"counter":418,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000032#FF00700","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1373464500,"counter":419,"content":"<p>At present only a mother is entitled to adoptive leave, except where a male is the sole adapter.

I welcome the Bill tabled by Senator White and commend her for it.  I broadly support the principles of the Bill, which I will speak about, and I will further delve into it as I would also like to discuss the area of adoption.<\/p><p>As a mother of five children and a former school teacher I have real-world experience in the area of maternity leave.  Perhaps I was fortunate in that I worked for a Department, had a public service job and was entitled to maternity leave.  As somebody who took maternity leave five times in six years I will admit the fourth time I felt almost embarrassed to be asking for maternity leave again.  I did not have any issues, but some people commented to me that I was lucky to work in the public service and was entitled to it.  Only once did I ever hear comments that I felt should not have been made.  I feel very strongly that women should not be ashamed, feel intimidated or be hindered in their career or profession.  In interviews they should not be looked at differently because they are women in their 20s or of childbearing age or are pregnant.  It should not have any bearing.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill and the importance it would give to paternity leave.  At the time my maternity leave was at least half of what it is now, and while the opportunities available now have been curtailed by the economic situation some sectors still enjoy good maternity leave.<\/p><p>An important and welcome aspect of the Bill is the proposed time off for antenatal classes.  A pregnant employee should be entitled to take time off for one set of antenatal classes without loss of pay and we need to discuss this further.  The father should also be entitled to a once-off period without loss of pay for the purpose of attending antenatal classes.  My husband was self-employed and there was never a question he would come because he could not take time from work.<\/p><p>I agree the measures laid out in the Bill would place Ireland on a firmer footing with our European counterparts.<\/p> <p>Currently, parental leave is predominantly in favour of the mother, without much time afforded to the father.  Neither is there a statutory entitlement to paternity leave.  In the Civil Service, fathers receive three days of special paternity leave following the birth or adoption of a child.  Elsewhere, it is usually left to the discretion of the employer.  Some employers are more generous in granting paternity leave than others.<\/p><p>In the UK, which we should examine closely, it has been proposed that fathers would be entitled to one or two weeks of paternity leave and could also share in the mother's maternity leave, which is termed &quot;additional paternity leave&quot;, to be taken after the baby is 20 weeks old and before the baby is one year of age.  This proposal will take effect in 2015.<\/p><p>I support the call in broad terms and agree that women should not be made to feel as if their professional development or progression is adversely affected by taking maternity leave or by not returning earlier.  Sometimes, women feel under pressure to return earlier than scheduled.  As Oireachtas Members, we are tasked with providing the conditions for fair and equal employment for all citizens.  Just as we do not want women to encounter issues, the same should be the case for men.  There should be a balance.  No mother of the 21st century should have to narrow her professional prospects to have a family, but this raises the issue of child care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000032#FF00900","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373465100,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000033#GG00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1373465100,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I experienced difficulties in that regard.<\/p><p>I commend the Bill, as it opens up possibilities and provides the House with an opportunity to debate the matter.

This Bill is also welcome.  Senator White has put a significant amount of effort into it.  As someone who has run a business and is also a mother, which is not easy, she has a great deal of experience of this matter.  I was delighted to hear Senator Moran's reference to a prenatal clinic.  My wife and I have five children.  With our first child, my wife had the opportunity to attend the late Kathleen O'Rourke for antenatal clinics.  Fathers attended on the last day as well to get experience.  My wife benefited in the form of pain control through breathing methods.<\/p><p>Senator White has introduced an interesting Bill.  Changes may be made on Committee Stage, given everything that has been stated.  The Senator has invested her commitment on that basis.  The Bill is worthwhile.<\/p><p>People often refer to gender equality, but they forget to mention that this concept also applies to men.  In terms of parental leave, we must strike a balance.  Ireland is lagging behind in this regard, even compared with our neighbours in the UK.  Having an employer who is a parent is a considerable benefit.  A manager of one of our supermarkets, Mr. Jerry Twomey, has a wife named Yolanda.  He arranged a little initiative - it does not deal with birth as such - whereby parents got the morning of their children's first day of school in September off.  This was appreciated by the parents.  As he and his wife have four girls, he is aware of the day's importance.<\/p><p>Currently, men do not have the ability to spend as much time with their children at a crucial stage of their development.  According to some studies, fathers who take more responsibility for small children are more likely to stay in contact should their families break up at a later stage.  From the employers' perspective, I can understand the concerns that they may have with such a Bill.  Some have been mentioned.  However, if we were to balance out the leave, we would lessen their concern that a woman was more likely to leave her job because of childbirth if she knew that men were entitled to the same leave.<\/p><p>However, we must also be careful about placing too many regulations on business.  It is one matter for a large multinational to offer paternity leave, but the effect on a small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, employing five or six people could pose difficulties.  These are the sorts of issue that we can address on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>What will this measure cost the taxpayer?  Has a cost-benefit analysis been conducted?  If more leave days are taken, which is a reasonable assumption, productivity will decrease.  Senator White mentioned unemployment but competitiveness must be considered first, as it will attempt to solve the unemployment problem.  It is difficult for me to support a Bill through which more costs will be placed on business.  More importantly, if more costs are placed on the taxpayer, who is already under significant financial stress, how difficult will that be?  Should the Government offer paternity leave just because some private companies offer the same benefit?  This fundamental question is worth considering.<\/p><p>If we are going to go down the route of paternity leave, we must ask more questions about its day-to-day functioning.  We must bear in mind the situation in other countries where paternal leave is in operation and the lessons they have learned.  Listening to Senator O'Brien's comments was interesting.  I mean Senator Darragh O'Brien - there are two Senators O'Brien in the House and we must be careful about which one we are speaking.<\/p><p>Some Scandinavian countries have found that there is a low take-up of paternity leave.  According to this Bill, fathers and mothers &quot;shall be permitted to share between them the minimum period of maternity or paternity leave.&quot;  I am unsure as to whether this is the way to go.  One of the proposed solutions would be to scrap the transfer of leave between parents.  Some claim that this is the only way to encourage men to take up paternity leave.  This would be a somewhat drastic measure, but I would be interested in the opinions of other Senators.<\/p><p>In Germany, mothers get bonus weeks of maternity leave if their husbands take a minimum amount of paternity leave, which encourages the uptake of paternity leave.  Should we consider doing something similar and offering a bonus?  Should we also consider a plain split between maternity and paternity leave?  In Iceland, three months are reserved for the mother, three for the father and three for them to decide.  On average, fathers only took 103 days leave compared with the 178 days taken by mothers.  This approach is more favourable than that of other countries with paternity leave.<\/p><p>Iceland is going even further.  Recently, its Government passed legislation for a system of five months maternity leave, five months paternity leave and two months parental leave, which the parents must decide how to use by 2016.<\/p> <p>Should we consider this as an example?  The Bill is admirable in looking towards real gender equality.  I have some reservations but they arise on Second Stage of every Bill.  This Bill is very worthy of consideration.  It is likely the Minister of State will agree to Second Stage, about which I am delighted, and I encourage her to ensure we can debate it on Committee Stage.  I know Senator Mary White has a very open mind on making changes to it to make it a more perfect Bill than it is.  The heart and soul of Senator Mary White are in this Bill and we would like to think it will become law.  If that means some improvements or changes, then so be it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000033#GG01000","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373465700,"counter":432,"content":"<p>We should always be very careful about falling into global assumptions about men or women.  The one thing I discovered in my work on equality, about which I was a bit surprised, is that women who have children work longer hours because of the financial imposition, and it is an area in which Senator Mary White has had an interest long before I ever got this job and we have discussed it on several occasions.  We need to be careful we do not impose on people what we consider to be their protective role.  That is something which surprised me.<\/p><p>A Europe, Middle East and Africa manager for Dell told me that it has taken a root and branch approach to ensure it supports and maintains, as far as possible, as many women as it can in its workforce because it considers them to be so valuable and the company asks them what they think would help them.<\/p><p>This Bill would clearly have an equality bonus because one would not have the obvious first impression by an employer in terms of women of child bearing age.  Women of that age may not intend to have children or it may not be possible for them to have children but how can one convince someone sitting across a desk of that?  I think it would have an equality bonus.  This issue will bring us into different areas which are not necessarily connected to maternity issues at all but will open up the discussion in regard to other areas.  <\/p><p>I think that for a while people thought the two officials sitting behind me and I lived together because we spent the six months of the Presidency working on the whole maternity-paternity leave area in Europe.  We met all the relevant Ministers in Europe.  I am sure that some day someone will make a freedom of information request in regard to that and thank us for our efforts.  Unfortunately, there are some people who are more conservative than us, although sometimes one would think that was not possible, and they refused to move on this issue.  However, we have not given up.  We do not hold the Presidency anymore, so we do not have the type of influence we had but we worked extraordinarily hard on it and I think our efforts were appreciated.  We are not the only ones thinking about this issue; other people in Europe are thinking about it also.  Other countries are worried about the cost implications, as was Senator Feargal Quinn.<\/p><p>I thank Senators Mary White, Diarmuid Wilson and Darragh O'Brien for bringing forward this proposal.  Their intentions are laudable, as I would expect, and worthwhile, as they recognise the important role that mothers and fathers play in the caring and nurturing of young children.  I am well aware of the difficult work that goes into the development of a Private Members' Bill and, on many occasions since I have become Minister of State, I have paid tribute to colleagues in both Houses who have undertaken this task.  I again acknowledge the hard work undertaken by the Senators in bringing these proposals forward.<\/p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, has asked me to acknowledge the work of the Senators in preparing these proposals.  As they may know, in his time as a backbencher, he was responsible for a number of Private Members' Bills which became law - I think more than anyone else.  In the light of that record, he has asked me to say - and I agree completely with him on this point - that it is his firm conviction that Government should not automatically oppose a Private Members' Bill where it contains a good idea, even if it needs more work at a technical, drafting level.  There are a number of problems with the detail of this Bill, as distinct from the principle, which I will come to those in a moment, but I would say to Senators and Members of the other House who may be thinking of bringing forward Private Members' Bill in the justice area in future that they might consider availing of a confidential consultation with the relevant departmental officials in a advance of publication.  That is always helpful.  The Department cannot express an opinion on the merits or on the politics of it and cannot help with the drafting but could point out any obvious technical problems with the draft Bill and give the sponsoring Member an opportunity to have these corrected.  This would actually be a useful step as we parliamentarians could then concentrate on the substance when we debate the Bill rather than having to point to technical issues.<\/p><p>There are a few technical problems with the Bill, as published.  I am slightly confused by a number of elements of this draft legislation, which I hope Senator Mary White can explain.  These include that the Bill proposes to increase the number of weeks of maternity leave from 26 to 28 weeks and provides that this new allocation be shared - 14 weeks for the mother and 14 weeks for the father.  This appears to be the intention, although the Bill has a number of drafting defects, including the proposed new section 8(1) to be inserted in the existing Act, which creates an entitlement of not fewer than 14 consecutive weeks leave for the pregnant employee or the father, that is, the word &quot;or&quot; means this is not for both.  I am sure this is an error but the Senator might confirm this.  It is easy to see how these things can happen without the help of draftsmen.<\/p><p>I might also mention the Title of the Bill, Parental Leave Bill 2013.  The Bill, in fact, proposes to amend current maternity leave legislation and not parental leave legislation.  For the benefit of doubt or confusion, I wish to set out the current position in regard to the various types of leave available.  Maternity leave of 26 weeks, which attracts a social welfare benefit, is currently available to mothers, as is an unpaid period of 16 weeks.  Adoptive leave of 24 weeks, which also attracts a social welfare benefit, is currently available to mothers, as is an unpaid period of 16 weeks.  I note that the Senator's Bill is silent on the issue of adoption.  I am not the only one who picked up on that but I am sure it is something which can be looked at.  Parental leave of 18 weeks, which is unpaid, is available as an individual right for both mothers and fathers.  This leave can be taken in respect of a child up to the age of eight or, in the case of a child with a disability or serious illness, up to the age of 16.<\/p><p>We currently have no provision for paternity leave which, in a number of other countries, is available to fathers.  We should have provision for paternity leave in our system and the Government has agreed that we should have paternity leave.  On this point of principle, therefore, the Government will not oppose the Bill.  However, the Government cannot support the introduction of this two additional weeks paid maternity or paternity leave at this time.  To come to Senator Feargal Quinn's point, last year close to 24,000 women received maternity benefit at a cost of over &euro;300 million to the social insurance fund.  It is estimated that the cost of such an additional two weeks would be in the region of &euro;11.4 million per year.  This, in itself, does not sound like a huge amount of money but it is just not feasible in the current economic climate.  We need to avoid creating perverse economic incentives where higher paid men in employments that offer maternity leave on full pay would take the leave rather than the mother who is in a lower paid employment which only attracts the social welfare maternity benefit.<\/p> <p>We need to take our economic realities into account and avoid increased costs and any dislocation in the labour market as far as possible in making progress in this area, although we are committed to making progress.  Essentially, people in well-paid employment could gain an advantage rather than having people benefiting right across the spectrum.  These are issues to be teased out.<\/p><p>A much more substantial frailty in the Bill is that the entitlement to 14 weeks leave for fathers is created without any qualification and without giving the mother any choice.  We must be careful about that and there are many permutations.  A mother currently has 26 weeks leave, which attracts maternity benefit, a social welfare payment, and this Bill would reduce that to 14 weeks without any consultation with the mother.  This new right is given to fathers without any qualification, regardless of whether there is a continuing relationship between the parents, the circumstances of the conception or whether the father is spending any time of any nature with his child or making any contribution to his child's support.  Are we serious about reducing a women's entitlement and transferring it to the man without regard to whether he has any involvement with the child?  I do not think we are but the issues can be examined.<\/p><p>I do not support the removal of an existing right, especially in this area, where women have had to fight over the generations for the right to maternity leave and not be discriminated against because they take such leave.  That relates to Senator Moran's point.  There is also the right to return to work and to the same pay and conditions as before.  Nothing in this proposal should weaken the rights of women, and I am sure everybody agrees with that point.  This proposed Bill also requires the mother and father to take the leave at separate times and I do not understand the reasoning behind this aspect of the proposal.  I imagine that in certain cases both the mother and father may wish to consider taking leave together to cope with the demands of a young child, and anybody in that position knows that it is great to have another person available when the other takes a rest or takes a break from night feeds.  Nevertheless, I am interested in understanding the Senator's views on this aspect.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the obvious flaws in the Bill as published, it is timely to take on board the idea of creating a provision for paternity leave by allowing maternity leave to be shared with the father in certain circumstances.  As I stated earlier, we do not have a statutory provision for paternity leave but it is important that fathers and their important role in nurturing children are acknowledged.  I consider this an omission in our current system, especially in terms of promoting greater equality in society by encouraging a fairer sharing of domestic responsibilities between men and women.  Evidence from countries such as Norway indicates that paternity leave - aside from its social benefits and positive impact on fatherhood - promotes equality for women and supports a higher level of female participation in the labour force.<\/p><p>I favour a flexible approach to address modern workplaces and give working families maximum flexibility in choosing how to divide leave and life.  There must be a period of compulsory leave for the mother for health and safety reasons, and that is currently six weeks in our system, with two weeks before the birth and four weeks afterwards.  I favour an approach whereby the mother remains in control of the leave but can decide to share some of it after the compulsory period with her partner.  How much can be shared would need to be considered in detail and we would need to consult relevant parties, not least with mothers.  Such a flexible system would help to create a system of parental leave that works for modern lives and respects a family's right to choose how to care for children.  This flexibility would also enable working fathers to take a more active role in caring for their children and help towards reducing the gender bias that currently applies to women's careers.<\/p><p>In summary, the Government cannot support the proposal to increase the overall length of maternity or paternity leave and cannot support a proposal that fathers would have an automatic right to 50% of the available leave allowance, regardless of whether there is a relationship with the mother.  However, I am suggesting to Senators that the Government will accept the principle of the Bill, which is that we should have provision for paternity leave on a shared basis in our family leave system.  We will accept it on the basis that we will not take Committee Stage until the first quarter of next year.  This will allow us to consult more widely with employers and trade unions, relevant non-governmental organisations and with women groups, as well as with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Social Protection in order to design an approach that is affordable and feasible.  This would also include consultation with the Equality Authority, soon to become part of the human rights and equality commission, on the gender equality aspects.  The path to be followed will also have to ensure no major increase in public expenditure in the context of the State's current circumstances.<\/p><p>Following this consultation, the Government will bring forward Committee Stage amendments early in the new year.  The shape of an amended proposal could possibly include maternity leave remaining vested in the mother; and the mother having the choice to share a part of the leave, to be defined and in any event excluding the minimum period which must be taken by the mother for health and safety reasons and to meet EU law requirements, with the father.  The father will also have to meet the necessary social protection requirements in his own right with regard to social insurance contributions, etc., in order to receive payment.  That point was raised by Senator Moran.  Proposals may also include safeguards to avoid any dislocation or perverse incentives, and Senator White may know more about tackling this than anybody else because of her involvement in commerce.  There would also need to consider similar provisions applying to adoptive fathers and mothers.  We need to design an approach that will work and we need a full impact assessment on the amended Bill.  I ask the Senators now for time so the Government can consult fully on the implications of the Bill and to allow for the development of a number of detailed Committee Stage amendments to address the issues of concern I have outlined.  If that is agreed, we will not oppose the Bill.<\/p><p>As many Senators are aware, the Government approved proposals last December to draft a family leave Bill.  This will consolidate all the family leave legislation, including that dealing with maternity, parental, adoptive and carer's leave, into one Bill.  Responsibility for carer's leave is being transferred from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Department of Justice and Equality in the context of this statute law consolidation exercise.  This consolidation will involve examination of possible discrepancies and anomalies between the various Acts with a view to making the code more accessible and streamlined.  This is a significant statue law consolidation and revision project on which work is ongoing.  It is too soon to say when the Bill will be published but we are aiming for early next year.  Depending on the timing of publication of this Bill, it may also be possible to incorporate the principle of the Senators' proposals in the consolidation Bill and still come back in the first quarter of the year.  If that is not possible, we will return with amendments to the Bill in the first quarter of 2014 as a stand-alone exercise which can ultimately be incorporated in the family leave Bill.<\/p><p>I thank the Senator for her difficult work and I hope we can all agree on a way forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000034#HH00200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373466300,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.  I also join my colleagues on this side of the House in complimenting Senator White, as the Minister of State has done, on her initiative in bringing this forward.  It is rather interesting that while the main thrust of the Bill is about specific details, as discussed by the Minister of State and outlined by Senator White, the overall objective is not just about equality, but to try to encourage more women into work.  Specifically, it is about ensuring that women in work will not have any obstacles in their advancement.  There is a glass ceiling not alone for executive positions, but also with the pay issue right across all strata of society.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the fact there are some technical issues outlined by the Minister of State that need correction, I am particularly pleased that the overall thrust of the Bill is being accepted.  That will bring us in line with best practice in other parts of Europe.  The Minister of State is correct in saying women have fought long and hard to get the rights they currently enjoy with maternal leave.  Based on international statistics from across Europe, we were not unique in Ireland in the view that the nourishment of children from birth to early childhood years was the responsibility of the mother, with the father traditionally seen as the bread winner, but there have been considerable changes over the past 30 years in particular.  I suggest that Mr. McCreevy's individualisation concept may have changed the system utterly.  I do not know if a terrible beauty was born but I am not sure as much emphasis was placed on people who wished to have a working woman in the home as there was in getting women into the wider economy.<\/p> <p>I often suspected that there was a great deal of pressure coming from the increasing number of multinationals coming into this country to get more and more women into the workforce, not always to the benefit of the nurturing of their children.  I am not suggesting that all of that had anything to do with the anti-social problems we are currently experiencing, all the other aspects of marital life or the raising of children but certainly I do not think much thought was given to the social impact of individualisation.  <\/p><p>I do not necessarily want to take up the time of the House in respect of this.  My primary role was to support Senator White in putting forward this proposal and to hear the Minister of State's response.  There are elements of her response that need further amplification.  It is vitally important that the rights mothers currently enjoy would not be eroded in any way as a result of the initiative brought forward by Senator White.  I do not think that this was what she intended to do.  I will leave the House with the thought that this is as much about equality in the workforce as it is about the nurturing of children in the home.  It will be interesting to get the views of the Government when Committee Stage of the Bill is reached and to hear how it will protect and encourage more women who are currently in the workforce to ensure there is more equality in the workforce as distinct from just looking after the needs of young children.  <\/p><p>All of us know, particularly mothers, that the most critical part of a child's development is in the first two years.  In that period of time, insofar as is possible, the mother needs to be with child and bond with it.  Unfortunately, due to economic circumstances, that has changed.  It goes back to the early part of the past ten or 15 years with the changes in the tax code.  It was something I did not necessarily agree with at the time and I still do not agree with it.  I still think it is important that the mother is with her children in those critical early years as much as is possible.  At the same time, needs must and the economic realities that most families now face mean that where they can, both parents work so some sort of new system must be brought to bear to bring the father into the equation.  That is the thrust of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000035#JJ00200","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373466900,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I did not intend speaking on the Bill but sitting here and listening to the debate, I found it very interesting.  I commend Senator White for bringing this Bill forward.  It is amazing that in all the years in which Government and the Oireachtas has been dominated by men, it takes a woman to look for paternity leave.  Well done to Senator White for that.<\/p><p>We cannot overestimate the importance of the father.  I recall an experience I had with my first child.  I came home on a Thursday with the baby and my husband collected me and stayed off work from Thursday to Sunday.  On Monday morning, he was going out to work and the baby started crying.  I started crying and I did not know which one of us was worse.  My poor husband did not know what to do.  He had to ring work to see if he could stay at home for the day.  It shows how coping with a small child can be demanding.  Many people get post-natal depression and it is quite horrific to go through.  I am not saying I went through it but I know women who suffered badly from it.  Some even ended up in hospital.  I can see the importance of having someone there to support one.  I know one's family can but one is calling them all the time.  If one's partner or spouse is there to help one, nothing can beat that.  <\/p><p>Senator White would like to share leave so that while the father was at home, the mother would work.  Having the father in the home to help even during the few days when one comes home from hospital is very important.  Like others, I have reservations about some aspects of the Bill but we can thrash them out as we go forward on Committee Stage.  Obviously, the financing of it is one issue.  Given the climate we are in, who will pay for paternity leave?  Will it be the employer or the State?  Will the father take over the maternity benefit?  Will he have contributions?  There are a range of technical issues that must be sorted out but the sentiment and idea are good.  I commend Senator White for bringing it forward.  In fairness, the Minister is not shelving it or turning it down.  He has agreed to look into and tweak it.  It has the makings of a good Bill and will reflect well on Senator White because she brought it forward.  <\/p><p>I deal, as do all of us, with young women who are in one-parent family set-ups.  In some cases, they really do not want any connection with the father of their child and the father is fighting for his right to be associated with the child and to have his name on the child's birth certificate.  I worry that if this is introduced into law, the father would have a right to take paternity leave and the mother would have to let him take over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000036#KK00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1373466900,"counter":437,"content":"<p>It is the mother's choice whether to share or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000036#KK00300","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1373466900,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Is it a choice if it is introduced into law?

They are some reservations I have.<\/p><p>On the flip side of that, there are some very good proposals here.  In particular, women participating in the workplace is fantastic.  We have come a long way because women can make a valuable contribution to the workforce.  We have come a long way from the days of the marriage bar, about which I spoke this morning at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  Women could not even go to work in those days, never mind get maternity leave.  They had to give up their jobs just because they were married.  It did not matter whether they had children or not.  We have come a long way where we are now looking for leave for fathers, never mind women returning to work.  This morning, I again raised with the Minister for Social Protection the fact that those women should have been entitled to a credited contribution.  That has all been sorted and we have what is known as a homecarer's credit for women at home looking after children.  Back in those days, it was not their fault.  They had no choice because that was the law.  One had to give up one's job simply because one got married.  <\/p><p>The Cathaoirleach is giving me notice that my time is up.

I thank the Minister of State; Senator Conway, who always speaks in that frame of mind; and Senator Moran as well.  I also thank Senator White for the Bill and all the work that went into it.  I thank Senator Moloney for sharing her experiences.<\/p><p>The sharing within the family is a good idea and does not involve an increase in expenditure.  I am sure that interests the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as well.  How would we ensure the sharing is genuine?  This is a benefit we have decided to give to women and I support that.  Will some unscrupulous men take it for themselves against the real wishes of the woman?  This is one of the things we have to discuss on Committee Stage to make sure there is full assent because it could be a handy grab in a way Senator White and the House would not intend.  <\/p> <p>In Ireland the responsibilities of fatherhood are being taken more seriously.  When the Minister of State is compiling her thoughts it would be interesting to know what social research is available now.  I get the impression, given the better housing conditions, that the pub society which many men would have frequented in the past has lost its attraction, that maybe there are not so many fellows married to the GAA, Fianna F&aacute;il or whatever excuse they used to stay out of the house and that there is much more sharing.  I discussed this issue with Senator Feargal Quinn and he said he remembers when the first man wheeled a pram down Grafton Street, the newspapers were out taking photographs as this was such a historic event.  I do not think it is such a historic event any more.  We welcome the fact that the joys of family life and the responsibilities are shared and there should not be the gender stereotyping that the Minister of State described.  <\/p><p> I still have a complaint against HPAT Ireland which keeps women out of the study of medicine.  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, agrees with me but it still happens.  The excuse is that the women would leave to have children.  I say that is more customers for the medical profession so why object to them being in medical school?  It also deprives girls of a role model when they go to see doctors.  I hope that kind of discrimination will be always tackled.  The Minister is on our side in the argument but the universities still do it and that should not happen.  <\/p><p> In looking through the points made by the Minister of State, I appreciate the one about the well-paid leave takers costing more by transferring the leave between them and her impact assessment.  That is very important in all laws and I welcome what she has said.  Sometimes we do not think through the consequences and it would be worthwhile to do it.  This Bill is optimistic, it is positive, if it frees up the women entrepreneurs that Senator Mary White wants.  If it strengthens and deepens the family, at which we may be better than we are given credit for, that is all to the good. <\/p><p>  In regard to individualisation, I lived in the Kildare constituency and many women liked it and put Charlie McCreevy at the top of the poll.  It was not liked in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>but many people who were working enjoyed not being part of their husband for tax purposes.  Maybe he was more revolutionary than people are saying now.  I look forward to Committee Stage and the generous and welcome response of the Minister of State and the response of the House.  It has been a good afternoon's work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000036#KK00500","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373467500,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I wish to speak on the Bill because it is important and deals with parental leave.  Anything that has to do with parents, children, child care, the home and how we can make things more acceptable and easier for children and parents in the home place is worthwhile.  I am aware the Minister of State pointed out that there are many flaws in the Bill.  However, one cannot get everything perfect at the first hurdle.  Bill drafters are there to ensure the corrections are made.  The spirit and the idea are good.  I listened in my office to the many flaws mentioned by the Minister of State.  I am not going to repeat them but they can be corrected and, hopefully, they will be corrected.<\/p><p>On the issue of gender equality, a new regulation or report from Europe was published about a month ago.  The new gender equality index ranks Ireland ninth and the Minister of State had something to say about that and the fact that there was a need for more work to be done in Ireland on gender equality.  I think it was Senator Feargal Quinn who said when one is talking about gender equality it plays both ways.  There is male gender and female gender.  We had the male gender take precedence over the female gender.  In family life both genders are important.  When speaking about gender equality it is important to recognise the role of the father as well as the mother and the choice that either the father or the mother has to make.  I commend Senator White on bringing the Bill to the House  I am aware she has put much effort into the drafting but, as I said, not everything is perfect at the first hurdle.<\/p><p>Child care is an important aspect.  I have worked, lectured, promoted and advocated for it for the past 20 years.  It is the most important area of policy to get right because if we get it right in the early stages, the future will look after itself.  The Government is committed to improving child care facilities.  In the short time that the Minister, Deputy Francis Fitzgerald, has been in government there have been many advances.  The establishment of the new Department is a recognition of the importance of children and child care in terms of providing a home-life balance and care giving to children.  <\/p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, introduced legislation that increases the entitlement to unpaid paternity leave by a month from 14 to 18 weeks.  These changes bring into effect the 2010 EU directive allowing parents more than months leave.  That is welcome.  Always when speaking on equality, I say that very often Ireland has to be dragged kicking and screaming but we are getting much better.  I congratulate the Minister of State because she has been noted for her advocacy and Trojan work in bringing much of the equality legislation on the Statute Book to the fore, all through her political career.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000037#LL00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1373467500,"counter":442,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000037#LL00300","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1373467500,"counter":443,"content":"<p>The EU regulations the Minister and the Minister for Justice and Equality introduced will give parents a right to request a change in working hours for a set period on return from parental leave.  Employers are not required to grant it but under the EU regulation they must consider it.  This is an advance.  It is important that we support parents of young children in the difficult balancing act of caring for a young family.  This regulation will improve the quality of home-life for working parents.  In this connection, one must always mention the people, who by choice, be it the mother or the father, want to care full time for their children at home and not avail of child care.  That is a choice we must provide.<\/p><p>The increase in parental leave given effect in the European Union parental leave regulation 2013 is also very important because it gives parents an equal role in caring for the children and helps to break down the stereotypes about child care.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the Minister, Deputy Shatter, will encourage women to remain in the workforce after they have children if that is their wish.  <\/p><p>Other Senators have outlined the parental leave that is available compared to what was available only six to eight months ago.  The Government is committed to improving child care facilities.  Only last week the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, announced the national child care capital allowance of &euro;2.74 million which comes as part of the second round of capital grants to the child care sector.  They are old but important grants.  They were introduced many years ago and this is one of the areas where there could have been cuts but the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, recognised the importance of the grants in achieving a home-work life balance.  <\/p><p>An important aspect is sharing and being willing to participate.  Senator White has included in the Bill that the choice must be made between the parents.  It is important that something be written into the Bill to ensure that the choice is freely made, whether it be witnessed or otherwise.  We do not know what happens in households.  It is important that a provision in included to ensure the choice is made freely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000037#LL00400","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1373467500,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House to discuss another important issue.  The issue of child care is very important, as is maternity and paternity leave.  I commend Senator White for bringing forward the Bill.  I always commend Senators who go to the bother of tabling legislation because it is very important.  It is easy to table motions on issues but when somebody goes to the trouble of drafting a Bill and doing all the research that is involved in it, he or she should be commended.  There is no need to be worried about flaws in it because that is what Committee Stage is for.  We can pick up on flaws.  It is the substance of the Bill that we should celebrate and accept is a good thing.<\/p><p>There is cross-party support for us collectively to do more in the area of child care generally but also in the area of maternity and paternity leave, especially paternity leave, given the very low levels of cover we have in this State.  While male employees are not entitled under Irish law to either paid or unpaid paternity leave, they may be entitled to parental leave.<\/p> <p>Parental leave entitles parents who qualify to take a period of up to 18 weeks unpaid leave, generally in respect of children aged up to eight years.  There is no provision for a social insurance-based payment for periods of parental leave, but employees may be entitled to credited contributions to maintain their social insurance record for the period.<\/p><p>The Minister is on record as saying that the introduction of a social insurance-based payment would involve a cost to the State.  It is something we need to examine because people do pay more taxes now than they did before, including PRSI, the universal social charge and income taxes.  Parents are entitled to a level of maternity cover or paternal leave when that opportunity presents itself.  <\/p><p>We all accept that society has changed.  It is not the role of women simply to care for children - that is the role of both parents who have equal responsibility for raising their children.  In the early stages of a child's life it is important that they should spend as much time as possible with both parents, rather than just with the mother.  Obviously, the mother has a critical role but so too does the father, although very often that has not been recognised for historical reasons.  <\/p><p>There is no reason we cannot have more paternity cover in this State.  The only reason against it is one of cost, in addition to the fact that there might be issues arising from employers' organisations.  Nevertheless, we must face up to the fact that we need to do more.  In that respect, this Bill is a good step forward.<\/p><p>In the past, Sinn F&eacute;in has backed Labour Party motions supporting the introduction of paid paternity leave to redress the imbalance in family life.  While undertaking research for this Bill, I came across an interesting statistic which showed that, on average, women are working longer days than men.  I found that amazing, but it is a fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000037#LL00500","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373468100,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000038#MM00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1373468100,"counter":447,"content":"<p>One cannot expect women to work longer hours while also being the main carer for their children, while men have no such responsibility.

That must also be recognised by the State, however.  If the State does not recognise it, that creates a prejudicial view among some people who will elevate the mother's role in raising children above that of the father's role.  Equality is important and it works both ways.  The Bill before us gives a choice to parents but we should be moving towards paternity leave in any case.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has given a good response and is accepting the Bill in principle.  I commend Senator White who has brought forward many policy papers in this House.  She has used her time in the Seanad to undertake policy research.  One of the criticisms of Oireachtas Members - not just Senators but also TDs - is that we are too locally focused and a big part of what we do is constituency-based.  It is said that we should be spending more time on policy matters.  Senator White has been one of the exceptions by introducing many policies and Bills.

They are timeless and will be used as reference documents into the future.<\/p><p>A lovely partnership is developing here today between the Minister of State, the Government side and Senator White.  There is a particular tone in the Minister of State's response which is excellent.  We could hear a lot more of that.  It should be put on the record once again that the Government should not automatically oppose a Private Members' Bill, particularly when it contains good ideas.  That is exactly what we should be hearing.  In a way, it is all about job sharing and we should be sharing the work that has to be done.  It should not be a matter of them and us, it should be us all the time because we are acting on behalf of the people.<\/p><p>We are dealing with a very changed society, including changed family roles.  Senator Quinn referred to the man pushing a pram and that picture was also in my mind.  I come from the small town of Cashel which has a population of 3,000.

Now that has changed and it is important to underpin, consolidate and support the family unit.  That is what this Bill is all about.  We accept there may be technical aspects that must be considered, which is understandable.  It is not a matter of Senator White or anyone else wanting all the kudos for at least responding to a necessity.  It is important for us to get an opportunity to tease it out.  People were worried that women might suffer as a result of maternity leave, but I see from the Minister of State's response that that matter is handled exceptionally well by stating the woman may wish to opt for sharing, although there would be certain restrictions and constraints, and rightly so.  It is not quite as simple as we would like it to be.<\/p><p>In introducing this Bill, Senator White has made us all think about and discuss parental leave.  In that way, we can exchange ideas and views.  I compliment the Minister of State for having allowed the Bill to continue but on Committee Stage we will have to examine and discuss several items.  There is also room for consultation with many groups representing mothers, fathers and families generally.  I accept that Senator White has already done quite an amount of consultation but it is important for us to consult further in order to develop the best legislation.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane made a good point about costings, but there is a right thing to do even before one considers such costings.  That may sound a bit irresponsible on my part but the House knows where I am coming from.  First of all, we should put down the legislative marker and then decide on the priorities involved.  I do not think we should balk at the idea of doing what is right simply because there is currently not as much in the national purse as we would like to have.  <\/p><p>I have read many letters in newspapers and journals from the father's perspective of the family.  It may always have been in the back of one's mind but one did not stop to think about it.  At the end of the day, a family is about sharing responsibility.  Many families are currently going through an exceptionally difficult time as a result of the recession.  Many of us cannot fully contemplate how difficult those times are.  A person with &euro;10 in their pocket is rich, but if one has no money and must look after children, it is devastating for morale and spirit.  While this is only one aspect, it is an important one.  Very often when people need support most, they do not get it from agencies or voluntary organisations but from within their household.  It is only by underpinning that support through legislation that we are giving the matter accreditation and recognising it.<\/p> <p>It can bring much peace of mind and comfort to families.  Senator White is making us all quite animated and energised on this subject and she is making us think.   I compliment the Minister, Deputy Shatter, for his input on the issue.

It is evident that she has put a lot of hard work into it.  I congratulate her.<\/p><p>The Bill proposes to increase maternity leave from 26 weeks to 28 weeks and to provide that the new allocation would be shared &ndash; 14 weeks for the mother and 14 weeks for the father.  That has been mentioned by all speakers and that appears to be the intention of the Bill.  However, the Bill contains a number of drafting defects, including on page 8 where the proposed new section 8(1) to be inserted in the existing Act creates an entitlement of not less than 14 consecutive weeks leave for either the pregnant employee or the father but not both.  That is merely an error but a more substantive defect in the Bill is that the entitlement to 14 weeks paternity leave is created without any qualification and without giving the mother any choice.  It is paramount that the mother has a choice, regardless of whether there is a continuing relationship between the couple.<\/p><p>The Bill makes no provision for adoptive mothers who are also entitled under current legislation to an equivalent length of leave &ndash; or for adoptive fathers for that matter.  Previous speakers alluded to the fact also.  I am concerned about the proposal that the father would have an automatic right to 50% of the available leave allowance, regardless of whether there is a relationship with the mother.  In many cases the relationship after birth might not be as good as it should be and in such cases one could have fathers claiming the leave when they are not entitled to it.<\/p><p>The Minister will bring forward amendments in due course to provide that maternity leave will remain vested in the mother.  As a father I believe that is the right approach.  There will not be an increase in the current 26 week ceiling of paid maternity leave.  The mother may opt to share some of the maternity leave, other than the minimum period which must be taken by her for health and safety reasons.  That is currently two weeks prior to the birth and four weeks afterwards.  Leave is available to the father subject to him qualifying in his own right on the basis of his social welfare record.  The provision will be made for both maternity leave and adoptive leave situations.  The Minister of State committed to bring forward Committee Stage amendments to achieve that outcome.  She has sought time to consult with relevant Departments, the social partners and the Equality Authority.  It is essential that Committee Stage is deferred until early in 2014 to enable the drafting of the relevant amendments.<\/p><p>As a parent and grandfather who got married when it was the law that a wife gave up her job until the children became teenagers and she went back to her employment, I commend and recognise the part played by my wife in those early years with our three children.

She has a very distinguished record in this House in providing a series of well-researched and detailed reports on a wide variety of subjects but often dealing with areas relating to what one might generally term infirmity or disadvantage, such as the elderly.  She has done the Seanad and the Oireachtas a good deal of service in that regard.<\/p><p>The idea of shared parental leave is good for children because it gives a balance.  It is something in which many fathers would also rejoice.  I recall my closest friend who has been married for many years.  A long time ago it turned out that his wife was capable of earning more money than he was.  It was a very practical situation.  He withdrew from his employment and became a house husband.  A lot of his friends jeered him.  I did not know that and I said to his wife that it was wonderful.  It was great for the children.  He has turned into the most superb cook ever since then.  I am very much in favour of that.<\/p><p>A number of issues arise in the context of the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  First, I am sure Senator White would agree with the idea of consultation between the parents.  That seems to me to be a good idea, in particular in a situation where, for example, there may be an absent or irresponsible father.  Politically correct people deny that and say that all fathers are wonderful.  No, they are not.  Some of them are blackguards and others take no interest whatsoever in their children.  I do not think they should have any rights at all.<\/p><p>The Minister rehearsed the various Bills in which he was involved.  I compliment him on that.  He mentioned the Adoption Act 1991, which was only the second Private Members&rsquo; Bill in 32 years.  The first one originated in the Seanad.  It was introduced by Professor W. B. Stanford and was about the humane treatment of pigs in abattoirs.  Again, a first for the Seanad.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s suggestion that Members of the Seanad might avail of an opportunity for consultation with civil servants.  I remember doing that some years ago on a tax proposal I had and it was very helpful indeed, in particular if the person involved is more clever than oneself.  I organised a consultation with the late Paul Tansey who was able to argue the case mathematically for me.  That is a very good thing.<\/p><p>I noticed the Minister said the Department cannot express an opinion on the merits of the politics.  That is fine.  However, she also said that it could not be of any assistance in drafting a Bill.  However, someone should.  That is a lamentable defect in our parliamentary system.  My colleague, Senator Quinn, introduced legislation, as has every single person on our benches.  Senator Leyden has introduced legislation.  We should have assistance.  Drafting a Bill is a highly technical undertaking.  An officer should be appointed by Government to assist us in producing legislation.  It is not good enough for someone to say, &ldquo;Oh, what do they do?&rdquo;.  They give us damn all help and they expect us to make bricks without straw.  It is amazing the quality of bricks that come out of the Seanad.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to take back the idea to her Cabinet colleagues.  The Minister accepted that a number of other countries have paternity leave and accepts the principle of the Bill.  I very much welcome that.  It is a good day and I am sure the Bill will be tidied up.  We in this House will be of increasing assistance to the Government in putting legislation for it to consider from Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Watch this space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000039#NN00500","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1373468700,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan had planned to contribute.  He would like to be associated with the remarks I will make on the Bill.  I compliment Senator White on introducing the Bill to the House.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, for being so open and generous in her approach.  She indicated that she will take the best of what has been presented and will incorporate it into a Government Bill.  That is worthwhile.  Senator White has invested much research in the Bill and that will be of great assistance to the Government.  This is not a simple or straightforward area, it is a complex one.  The benefit of breast-feeding, which is essential in the early months, cannot be provided through paternity leave.<\/p> <p>It depends on all those types of issues and on whether there is agreement between couples.  It would be a great help to any new Member of the Oireachtas if his or her spouse or partner could be at home to assist in bringing up the children.  This Parliament, this D&aacute;il and Seanad, is very much geared towards men in politics as opposed to women, particularly women who have young children.  When I was elected to the D&aacute;il in 1977, I could come up here on a Tuesday morning and leave my four children at home with my wife and family.  They were looked after, fed, dressed, educated and supported in every way possible.  I was here three or four days a week and I had clinics at the weekend.  This is not a very family-friendly place.  We hear now that the D&aacute;il may sit until 2 a.m. and that shows that this place is quite impractical in terms of being family friendly.<\/p><p>It would be easy to reform the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and modern technology could be used.  It would be possible through a system for Deputies to vote safely in their own homes if they wished to do so.  There is no reason that could not be done.  On crucial votes on a budget, the Members would have to be called up but on normal legislation voting in that way would be quite in order.  Many changes could be made.  <\/p><p>Deputy Lynch has been far more generous to Senator White than the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, has been to me.  I introduced a wills Bill in 2007 on which I received the support of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party and we got it through this House.  It is a simple straightforward proposal to have a system in place for registering the last will and testament of people.  There is no such system in Ireland.  One can register one's dog but one cannot register a will.  Instead of the Minister saying she would accept it, she said that the advice she got from her Department was that it was not practical.  It is still on the Order Paper and I have kept it on it to try to persuade the Minister and the Government of its value.<\/p><p>I compliment Senator Norris on his point of view in this regard.  The Government could consider such legislation.  This House has provided extremely good legislation.  Senator White has been very proactive not only in producing legislation but on producing wonderful documents on promoting women entrepreneurs, reports on the issues of suicide, child care and older people, which is fantastic material, and a Bill she introduced on the issue of mandatory retirement, which was very progressive.  The Seanad has done the State some service, as Senator White and others have been very proactive in using the Seanad, as it provides a framework for introducing legislation.<\/p><p>On a point of clarification, I received a phonecall from a journalist just now.  I am not worried about people tweeting from here but I am referring to when something is tweeted from here out of context.  For instance, I spoke earlier today about the fact that certain fascists were Christians but that that did not excuse their monstrous behaviour.  They were monsters, let us be quite about it.  I hate being misrepresented.  The then Pope brought in an encyclical in 1932 and even though there was two fascist leaders, they disregarded the Pope and religion and became absolute monsters, murdering people in the Holocaust.

I went a bit further by the way and said that General Eoin O'Duffy was also a fascist who was linked to the Brownshirts and the Blueshirts who amalgamated with Cumann na nGaedheal to form Fine Gael.

I am transparent, probably too much so for the business we are in.  I am overwhelmed by the support from everyone who spoke on the Bill today.  This legislation is very much part of the point about allowing half of the talent of our country, the women of Ireland, to participate.  We are not being competitive if we are not using the brains of half of the country.  We have to further encourage men in Ireland to fully participate in the rearing of their children.  Despite all that we have heard about men, I love to see a man wheeling a pram, but we still have a long way to go because the women are carrying the burden of the rearing of the children.  There is no question about that.  We need women, as Sheryl Sandberg said in her book <i>Lean In<\/i>,  to push more as well to participate in society.  The more helpful a man is in supporting his wife if they have children and, if they do not have children, the more he supports her in what she does, the more happy their lives will be in this world and  the more they will be able to develop their potential to the full because they will be living in a happy environment.  The more men help women to fully participate, the better.  I sincerely believe that the women of Ireland have every right to enjoy family and work the way men do, and their fulfilment and peace in their family life, whether they have children or do not have children, makes for better adjusted people, and the home is their nest.  I am overwhelmed.

The legislation is fully within the parameters laid down by the Supreme Court in the Abbeylara case.  It is very clear from the views expressed in the Supreme Court judgment that the Oireachtas is not empowered in general to make findings of fact adverse to the good name of any person who is not either a Member of the Houses or an officeholder or otherwise directly accountable to the Houses.  Accordingly there is no scope under the legislation to make findings of individual culpability unless there is a specific constitutional authorisation for such a finding.<\/p><p>  Research following the defeat of the Oireachtas inquiries referendum in 2011 has confirmed that while there is a distrust among the public of the political system, in particular in relation to making findings of culpability, there remains broad support for the Oireachtas itself to be able to carry out legitimate inquiries.<\/p><p>  This Bill provides the necessary framework for such inquiries and represents a very important step in the process of clarifying the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in securing accountability through investigations into matters of significant public importance.  One of the lessons for parliamentarians from the referendum is that while the public is not innately opposed to granting further powers to the Oireachtas it is clear that public representatives will have to earn the public's trust.  Such inquiries could represent a very substantial strengthening in the effectiveness and contribution of the Legislature to our democratic system by not only helping us learn vital lessons from past events but through their recommendations identifying the legislative reforms and policy changes essential to making sure that egregious policy errors are not repeated.<\/p><p>  I have long advocated the need for an effective and legally robust parliamentary banking inquiry into the events that occurred on the night of the bank guarantee and the systemic failures that led to our current fiscal position.  It seems that the case for a parliamentary inquiry into the banking collapse is a strong one.  One of the best reasons to proceed with a parliamentary inquiry at this stage is that none of the other possible models has been successful at meeting the public demand for a full account of this issue, nor are they likely to do so.<\/p><p>  The investigations being conducted by the Director of Public Prosecutions for instance are against a number of named individuals and on a number of reasonably narrow grounds.  These prosecutions do not hold out the prospect of establishing a narrative around the events that have caused such damage to our State and society.  We have already had a commission of inquiry via the Nyberg report, which, while offering a macro analysis of events, has not succeeded in explaining the perspective of the individual participants involved.<\/p><p>  Ironically, the time being taken to get prosecutions right is stymying the public's desire to understand and have an account of what happened.  Earlier this week it was reported that the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> had withheld further publication of tapes, at the behest of the Director of Public Prosecutions, for fear of jeopardising prosecutions.  As far back as two years ago the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board was asked to delay public inquiries into the involvement of individual members and accountancy firms in respect of the events which came to light in 2008.<\/p><p>  Nobody wants to prejudice inquiries or professional investigations.  Nor is it satisfactory that more than five years on from the time these events came into the public domain we remain in the position we are in.  Nor have we any guarantee, given the nature of our legal system that the position would be fundamentally altered in the near future.<\/p><p>  This Bill will facilitate such an inquiry provided the terms of reference of the inquiry are correctly framed.  However, the proposed legislation does substantially more than facilitate a banking inquiry.  I want to underscore to the House that the primary purpose of this legislation is to create a comprehensive legal framework which is of general application.<\/p><p>  An Oireachtas inquiry can work and successfully deliver essential public accountability providing it follows three key principles.  The terms of reference for an Oireachtas inquiry must not seek to specifically investigate the conduct of individuals and make findings of individual culpability.  The inquiry itself must be carried out in a manner consistent with the terms of reference.  The inquiry respects the legal and constitutional rights of all witnesses called.  The secretariat of Oireachtas committees and members have a wide experience on a day-to-day basis of carrying out committee business subject to these requirements.  The weakening of trust in our politicians is not a good thing for our democracy.  The Oireachtas comprises experienced and capable members motivated to act in the public interest.  We need to have faith in them to do their job.  The conduct of a banking inquiry will assist in strengthening the effectiveness of the Oireachtas and enhancing trust in the political system.  It will require a disciplined approach by Members to ensure that inquiries are fair, balanced and effective.  I am confident that the statutory framework provided in the Bill provides assistance in this regard by giving clarity to the Houses on their powers and by setting out guidance in relation to matters such as fair procedures, avoidance of bias and so on.<\/p><p>  The Bill contains explicit requirements to observe fair procedures.  The extensive fair procedure requirements apply to all types of inquiries conducted under this Bill, notwithstanding that the inquiry may have no scope to make findings that could have a direct adverse effect on the reputation of individuals.  Access to the courts for directions in respect of any dispute is provided for in the Bill.<\/p><p>  The Bill also contains provisions in relation to the behaviour of Members to avoid any perception of bias.  An assessment of whether a perception of bias has arisen will depend firmly on the circumstances of the individual case.  It is for the Oireachtas to make an assessment of bias in the first instance.  The matter could ultimately be determined by the courts by assessment of the view formed by a &quot;reasonable&quot; person.  I would like to emphasise though, that bias provisions will not stifle the healthy debate that we, as politicians, engage in on a day-to-day basis.<\/p><p>  Members of the Oireachtas would be expected to have strong views and to have articulated them previously on important matters of public policy that are relevant to their legislative and parliamentary role.  This was made clear in the Abbeylara judgment itself.  However, a disciplined approach by members of an inquiry committee will be essential, once the inquiry is established.  It would not be appropriate for members of an inquiry committee to make public comments both immediately prior to and during the course of an inquiry on the subject matter of the inquiry where its findings had the potential to impact adversely on the reputation of an individual.  Furthermore, in line with the commitments in the programme for Government relating to civil servants giving evidence to Oireachtas committees, the Bill makes provisions to expand the scope of evidence that civil servants may give.  Civil servants will not be restricted from giving evidence for the purpose of establishing facts and giving the committee the full narrative of a series of events.<\/p> <p>This will be the case both in regard to an inquiry conducted under this Bill and also in the context of committees conducting daily business.  The current restrictions on the Oireachtas committees from asking a public servant to otherwise express an opinion on the merits of policy will be maintained.  It is not expected that disclosing policy-specific policy advice should occur other than in exceptional circumstances where it is essential to terms of reference of an inquiry.  This will be set out in revised guidance to all civil servants, which is currently being prepared by my Department and which will be made available once this legislation is enacted.<\/p><p>The Bill respects the principle that the Houses, pursuant to Article 15.10, should be afforded significant autonomy to regulate their own affairs.  The legislation envisages a central role for the Houses of the Oireachtas in both initiating and conducting a parliamentary inquiry.  There should be no confusion, as the Bill empowers the Oireachtas - and not the Executive - to conduct inquiries.  There was a conscious decision to do this as a common critique of Irish politics is that it is dominated by the Executive.  Under the Bill, responsibility is assigned exclusively to the Houses of the Oireachtas to determine the requirement for a formal inquiry, the terms of reference of that inquiry, the appropriate committee to conduct the inquiry and the procedural and organisational aspects of the inquiry.<\/p><p>The Bill will not impede the important and valuable work currently being conducted by Oireachtas committees.  The Bill fully replicates and restates the powers available to committees contained in the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997, as well as providing for a simplification of the current process of invoking compellability.  The Bill will therefore repeal the 1997 Act.<\/p><p>The programme for Government contains a commitment to address the issue of confidential communications with Members through constitutional change.  Following a detailed policy assessment and on the basis of legal analysis, it has now been decided to legislate in regard to this issue.  The Bill provides for qualified privilege for confidential communication from members of the public to Members of either House of the Oireachtas.  This will facilitate those who wish to draw wrong-doing to the attention of Members of the Oireachtas without having their identities disclosed.  The Bill provides for qualified statutory privilege for private papers of Members and official documents of the Houses.  These provisions are intended to apply in all circumstances and are not restricted to inquiries carried out under the Bill.<\/p><p>I would now like to turn to the Bill before the House.  This Bill, as I have already indicated, establishes a comprehensive statutory framework for the Houses of the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries.  I will now go through the Parts of the Bill and give a brief outline of its content and purpose.  Part 1 of the Bill contains sections 1 to 5, inclusive, and deals with standard preliminary and general matters, including the Title of the Bill and provisions for its commencement.  Part 2 is divided into two chapters detailing the types of inquiries that may be conducted in accordance with the Bill.  Section 6 outlines the scope of chapter 1 and section 7 provides for an inquire, record and report inquiry; this is a power to undertake inquiries by way of recording and reporting evidence and making findings of uncontested facts.<\/p><p>Section 8 provides for a power to undertake inquiries and make findings of fact relating to the legislative functions of the Houses.  Section 9 provides for a power to undertake inquiries relating to the removal of certain officeholders as provided for in Article 33.4, relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General, or Article 35, relating to judges of the Supreme and High Court, of the Constitution or arising from legislation relating to the removal of other judges or officeholders where a resolution of both Houses is required.  Section 10 provides for a power to undertake inquiries in respect of the conduct of a Member of either House in his or her capacity as a Member.  Section 11 provides for a power to undertake inquiries to hold the current Government to account pursuant to Article 28.4 of the Constitution and also to hold to account any person who is liable to D&aacute;il scrutiny by virtue of the terms of his or her contract or statutory appointment.  Section 12 provides for a parliamentary mechanism whereby a proposal by a committee to conduct an inquiry is assessed by the individual or committee designated by the rules and Standing Orders of the House or Houses.  Section 13 makes provision for the passing of a resolution by the House or Houses to establish an inquiry and the setting of terms of reference for a Part 2 inquiry.  Section 14 outlines the finding of failure to co-operate with a Part 2 inquiry that a committee is entitled to make.  Chapter 2 contains sections 15 and 16 of the Bill and contains details of an inquiry related to the impeachment of the President under Article 12.10 of the Constitution.<\/p><p>Part 3 contains sections 17 to 32, inclusive, and provides for a range of fair procedures to be followed by an Oireachtas committee conducting an inquiry pursuant to the Bill.  As outlined, the requirement to observe fair procedures applies to all Part 2 inquiries conducted under the Bill.  I draw Members' attention to the following sections in this part.  Section 18 makes it clear that a witness to an inquiry has the same privileges and immunities as a witness giving evidence to the High Court.  Section 19 permits the committee designated by the rules and Standing Orders of the House or Houses to issue a wide range of guidelines, consistent with the Bill, relating to the procedures of Part 2 inquiries.  Section 21 prohibits a Member of the Houses from sitting on a committee where a perception of bias might arise in a reasonable person.<\/p><p>Section 22 provides that a witness to an inquiry has the right to be accompanied by his or her legal practitioner while giving evidence if he or she so desires and attend any public session of the inquiry or the giving of evidence by any witness relevant to him or her.  Section 24 outlines the rights of a person whose good name is or may be in issue.  These rights include the right to be given advance notice of evidence proposed to be given against him or her in so far as that is possible, the right to cross-examine witnesses, the right to give evidence to the inquiry, the right to call witnesses and the right to make a submission at the close of evidence.  Sections 26 to 28, inclusive, provide for a notice to issue of a committee's intention to exercise its compellability powers, set out the standard of proof and its duty to inform witnesses of its powers.  Section 29 makes it clear that evidence compiled for the purposes of an inquiry will not be admissible in any other proceedings such as criminal and disciplinary proceedings.  Section 31 makes provision for the taking of evidence to be conducted in public and states this evidence may be broadcast to the public, unless the Chairman of the committee is satisfied that it would not be in the interests of the inquiry or fair procedures to do so.<\/p><p>Part 4 contains sections 33 to 41, inclusive, and makes provision for interim and final reports of a committee conducting an inquiry.  These sections make provision for the form and content of such reports, matters relating to the amendment and publication of reports and the confidentiality of such documents.<\/p><p>Part 5 is divided into five chapters and concerns costs.  Again, I will highlight the most significant sections in this part.  Chapter 1 contains sections 42 to 45, inclusive.  Section 43 requires a committee, prior to commencing an inquiry, to prepare a report containing an estimate of the legal costs and expenses expected to be incurred in the conduct of the inquiry.  Section 44 provides for the appointment of a panel of legal costs accountants willing and able to act as a parliamentary legal costs adjudicator in certain circumstances, whereas section 45 sets out the powers of the adjudicator.  <\/p><p>Chapter 2 contains sections 46 to 52, inclusive, and contains provisions relating to Oireachtas inquiry legal costs.  The focus in the Bill is on providing for recoupment of legal costs only in the limited cases where the good name of a person is at issue.  Section 46 empowers the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to issue guidelines in respect of inquiry legal costs.  Section 47 provides for the recoupment of third party costs in specified circumstances.  Section 48 provides that where a committee conducting an inquiry, or another person, has incurred additional legal costs as a result of the behaviour of a third party, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission may direct the third party to pay such costs, provided that the grounds for the belief have been confirmed by the High Court.  <\/p><p>Chapter 3 contains sections 53 to 55, inclusive, and concerns the payment by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission of inquiry expenses and the power of the commission to issue guidelines and direct third parties to pay expenses in certain circumstances.  <\/p><p>Chapter 4 contains sections 56 to 61, inclusive, and makes provision for legal costs in respect of private bills.  These provisions allow for the updating of 19th century and early 20th century legislation in respect of private bill costs to bring it into line with the other costs provisions included in the Bill.<\/p> <p>Chapter 5 contains sections 62 to 64 and contains miscellaneous provisions in relation to costs.  Parts 6 and 7 largely mirror and update the provisions of the Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability Privileges and Immunities) Act 1997.  Part 6 contains sections 65 to 75 and concerns compellability, privileges and immunities and applies only to an Oireachtas committee while it is conducting an inquiry pursuant to the Bill and on which a power to send for persons, papers and records has been conferred by the House.  This Part outlines the powers of such a committee in relation to obtaining evidence and makes provisions relating to irrelevant evidence and exempt evidence.<\/p><p>Part 7 contains 5 chapters and concerns compellability privileges and immunities.  This Part applies to an Oireachtas committee while it is conducting non-inquiry committee business and on which the power to send for persons, papers and records has been conferred.  Chapter 1 contains sections 76 and 77 and contains relevant definitions in relation to the Part.  Chapter 2 contains sections 78 to 82 and concerns privileges and immunities of witnesses in circumstances where a committee is conducting its ordinary business, outside of formal inquiry mode.  Chapter 3 contains sections 83 to 90 and makes provision for directions that may be given by a committee while it is exercising its compellability powers.  Chapter 4 contains section 91 and provides for the payment by the Oireachtas Commission of the reasonable expenses of a witness in proceedings before a committee.  Part 8 contains sections 92 to 93.  Section 92 provides that a Member of either House shall not be amenable to any court and authority other than the House by which the relevant committee was appointed in respect of any utterance in or before a committee.  It also provides that certain documents may be privileged.  Section 93 places restrictions on the evidence of certain persons and contains the reformed procedure in relation to the evidence of civil servants which I outlined earlier.<\/p><p>Part 9 contains sections 94 to 103 and provides for applications to the High Court in relation to the conduct of an inquiry.  Section 94 clearly provides for an application to the High Court for directions in respect of the proceedings of an inquiry where a person is of the opinion that any matter relating to the proceedings is not being inquired into or otherwise dealt with in accordance with the Act.  A committee may itself apply to the High Court for directions and section 95 makes provision for such an application when a committee is of the opinion that a report could prejudice criminal proceedings.<\/p><p>Section 98 permits a parliamentary legal costs adjudicator to refer a question of law arising in the context of an application for an adjudication of costs for the opinion of the court.  Section 99 permits a committee to apply to court where a person fails to comply with a direction of the committee or the Chairman.  Section 100 allows for appeal to the court where a direction from a committee could prejudice criminal proceedings which are pending or in progress.  Part 10 contains Sections 104 to 111 of the Bill.  As outlined earlier, this Part provides for a statutory qualified privilege for the private papers of Members and confidential communications from members of the public to Members of the Houses.  I will highlight the main provisions of this Part briefly.<\/p><p>Section 104 sets out definitions and also makes clear that the operation of the privilege does not prejudice the power of each House to make rules and standing orders pursuant to Article 15.10 to create a protection for the private papers of Members.  Section 105 provides for qualified privilege for the private papers of a Member and confidential communications from members of the public to Members of the Houses and sets out the circumstances in which such papers of confidential communications may be accessed or disclosed.  Section 106 permits a person who has communicated with a Member and who is otherwise entitled by law to disclose the fact or content of the communication to make such a disclosure.  Section 107 provides for the determination of what constitutes a private paper or confidential communication.  Section 108 provides for guidelines to be developed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, while section 109 sets out the arrangements which will apply to the private papers or confidential communications of former or deceased Members of the Houses.<\/p><p>Part 11 contains sections 112 to 116 of the Bill and, as I mentioned earlier, provides for a statutory qualified privilege for the official documents of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 112 sets out definitions and also makes clear that the operation of the privilege does not prejudice the power of each House to make rules and standing orders pursuant to Article 15.10 to create a protection for official documents.  Section 113 provides for a power for an Oireachtas committee designated for that purpose to make rules designating categories of official documents.  Section 114 provides for qualified privilege for official documents of the Houses and sets out the circumstances in which an official document may be accessed or disclosed.<\/p><p>Part 12 contains sections 117 to 119 of the Bill and governs the power of the Houses of the Oireachtas and any Oireachtas committee to examine witnesses and administer oaths.  Part 13 contains sections 120 to 122 of the Bill and contains provisions in relation to the laying of documents and allows for the repeal of the 1966 Houses of the Oireachtas (Laying of Documents) Act.<\/p><p>Part 14 contains sections 123 to 133 of the Bill and provides for miscellaneous matters including provision for offences by bodies corporate in section 123, provision for proceedings in court in section 124, matters relating to the prosecution of an offence under the Bill in section 125, clarification on the status of court proceedings in the event of a discontinuation of an inquiry or the dissolution of either House in section 126.  Section 127 contains restrictions on the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003.  Sections 128 to 132 provide for the consequential amendments of other legislation.<\/p><p>The Schedule provides for a repeal of previous Acts relating to the Oireachtas that are either obsolete or are replaced by this Bill.  It also provides for part amendment of a small number of Acts.  I am conscious that this is a large and complex Bill and I have dealt with its provisions in summary form in my contribution to the House today.  That will explain why we have taken such great time and care with the Bill.  I thank both Houses for the degree of input into the Bill.  Having carried out an analysis of the referendum result in 2011 we asked for the views of Oireachtas committees.  They looked at the heads in some detail and provided useful debate before we published the final Bill in May.  I am happy to expand on any of its provisions during the course of this debate.  If Senators wish to raise any particular issues they are welcome to do so.  They will have an opportunity on further Stages to examine the Bill in detail.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of Senators during this debate.  I hope the House will support the passage of the Bill and assist in securing its early enactment because there is a public view that this is a piece of legislation that should be passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000041#PP00400","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373471100,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage.  I agree with the Minister that Committee Stage will provide an opportunity to debate the provision in some detail because it is quite a long and complicated Bill and it is important that we go through each section to tease out exactly what it means.  From the outset, it seems that the Bill is really putting together what is already law and setting it out in a relatively accessible statutory format.  Inquiries can already take place but the Bill sets out the procedures clearly.<\/p><p>  The Government and nobody else bungled the referendum in October 2011.  Historians will look back in shock at it because all parties supported the referendum, which in retrospect was an outrageous proposal to put to the people, notwithstanding the fact that we supported it too, in terms of trying to restrict the rights of people going before committees.  It gave people no rights or no recourse to the High Court.  The Oireachtas was the sole judge of the committee's functions.  It was an act of collective political madness by the entire political establishment.  I am grateful to those who pointed out the wrongs of the proposal and the people in their wisdom voted against it.  That was a power grab by the Oireachtas and the Government but it was rejected by the public.  We must tread carefully on the issue.<\/p> <p>The main danger seems to be in respect of politicians grandstanding.  I must say that this is what politicians do best.  They do it all the time and if they are not seen to be doing it, people wonder if they are doing anything at all.  There was grandstanding involved in the Abbeylara decision and inquiry.  That was referred to in the Supreme Court judgment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000043#RR00200","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373471700,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Maybe the Senator should say \"we\" rather than \"they\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000044#SS00200","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1373471700,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I am saying \"we\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000044#SS00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1373471700,"counter":490,"content":"<p>No, he said \"they\" three times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000044#SS00400","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1373471700,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I apologise.  I will say \"we\".  It is the third person - the posh way of saying it - but I am including myself in it.  We must be wary of that grandstanding because what the public wants at all times is fairness.  The public does not want show trials or political investigations.  The public wants to know what happened.  For all the faults, failings and criticisms of tribunals of inquiry, and there are many, they did come to conclusions on many aspects.  They reached conclusions on corruption that could not have been reached here and have not yet been reached in the criminal courts.  There are things a tribunal can do.  There is a Bill before the Oireachtas to reform tribunals and it might have been wiser to look at that for the banking inquiry and to look at changing the law on tribunals to reign in the costs because they were excessively high.  We on this side of the House must take responsibility for that because they were not sufficiently reigned in.  I am worried about that in terms of these inquiries.<\/p><p>While it is the case that the Oireachtas has the power to decide in respect of inquiries - the Minister set that out - and this is a significant decision by the Government, the reality is that the Government controls the Oireachtas.  Let us not say that somehow an independent Oireachtas is going to make all these decisions.  The Government controls the Oireachtas.  That is the way it is, always has been and is likely to remain no matter who is in power.  The idea that there is some independent body with independent thought making the decisions separate from the Executive is a nonsense.  We should not be saying or repeating it because it is not true.  The Oireachtas of the day will, 999 times out of 1,000, do what the Government of the day wants it to do.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for the inquire, record and report style of inquiry.  That can already happen and has happened, which is fine.  It provides for inquiries that are forward-looking and empowered to make findings of fact in the context of investigations relating to our legislative functions here and inquiries relating to the removal of certain office holders like the President or judges.  This is very important and the Oireachtas has again fallen short when it is inquiring into office holders and Members of the Houses.  It provides for making findings of fact for the purpose of holding the Government to account under Article 28.4.  The major difficulty there relates to individuals.  There is no difficulty with holding the Government to account but the problem arises when one is making findings of fact against individuals.  Reading the text, I see that the Oireachtas can make findings of fact that directly impugn the good name of an office holder or former office holder.  The Minister stated on the radio last week that this would not apply to people who are not Members of the D&aacute;il.  Certainly it is not my reading of it but I heard the Minister say on the radio last week that former Ministers who are not Members of the D&aacute;il could not have findings of fact made against them.  I think this is what the Minister said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000044#SS00500","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1373471700,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Or former Ministers who are current Members of the D&aacute;il could not have findings of fact made against them in respect of their previous-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000044#SS00600","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1373471700,"counter":493,"content":"<p>If that is the case-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000044#SS00700","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1373471700,"counter":494,"content":"<p>That is the legal advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000044#SS00800","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1373471700,"counter":495,"content":"<p>It is legal analysis but that is a major flaw.

Is the purpose of this Bill really to have televised hearings in the run up to the local elections?  We will then find out it does not work.  Political charges will be flying around the place, as they have been in the past while.  They have been flying around.  The Taoiseach started the ball rolling.

I must agree with Senator Byrne.  The referendum of which all sides were in favour was rejected by the people but, in hindsight, the people would probably prefer if they had not rejected it at the time.  I commend the Minister because he has spent a considerable amount of time on this Bill, which structures a framework for the holding of inquiries.  Much time has been spent on this and the Minister must be commended for his efforts.<\/p><p>The Bill establishes a comprehensive statutory framework for the Houses of the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries within the current constitutional framework.  It represents a very important step in the process of clarifying the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in securing accountability through investigations into matters of significant public importance.  There is a broad scope under the Constitution for the Oireachtas to carry out legitimate inquiries into matters of public importance.  I am confident the Bill contains explicit requirements to observe fair procedures and contains provisions in respect of the conduct of Members to avoid any perception of bias.  <\/p><p>To that end, I believe the chairman will be most important for any inquiries that will be carried out.  I suggest that the chairperson's role should not be permanent, regardless of who the chairperson might be.  <\/p> <p>For instance, in the banking inquiry it is important that the person would have experience and a background in the matter, and that it would be carried out with due process.<\/p><p>The Bill fully respects the Supreme Court judgment in the Abbeylara case.  It is underpinned by extensive legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General and external counsel and is framed to ensure that it fully meets current constitutional requirements, including the right to fair procedures.  The Bill contains explicit provisions for full access to the courts.  This is overarching legislation which will structure how inquiries are to be conducted by this House and by the other House in the future, including inquiries in regard to the impeachment of judges, the impeachment of the President, should it ever arise, inquiries into legislation and on the gathering and presenting of facts. <\/p><p>I am confident that this legislation will allow for a banking inquiry to be held in public, to lay out all the facts of what happened here in relation to the banking scandal in the past five years.  I advocate the need for an effective and legally robust parliamentary banking inquiry into the events that occurred on the night of the bank guarantee and the systems failures that led to our current fiscal crisis, a fiscal crisis that continues to impact on households throughout the country.  We continue to pick up the pieces of the previous mismanagement of our economic affairs.  The people demand answers as to what happened and we, as legislators, must do everything in our power to ensure that this banking inquiry happens.  This Bill will facilitate such an inquiry provided the terms of reference of the inquiry are correctly framed and I believe that will happen.  That said, this Bill is about more than a banking inquiry.<\/p><p>The primary purpose of this legislation is to create a comprehensive legal framework which is of general application for any future inquiry.  Parliamentary inquiries under this legislation can be cost effective, efficient and resilient to any legal challenge, provided they have focused terms of reference and comply strictly with fair procedures.  The Bill provides all of the constitutional safeguards to protect the rights of individuals consistent with the outcome of the referendum on Oireachtas inquiries.  This legislation is essential to conducting a parliamentary banking inquiry and I welcome the Bill, and the Minister's efforts on same.<\/p><p>Having read through the Bill, there are one or two queries I want the Minister to address.  He dealt comprehensively with costs.  As a member of the Commission - I do not want to get into any trouble here - the Minister would be well aware of the large fees sought from the Oireachtas commission following a previous inquiry and the somewhat lesser figure, which was still exorbitant which was paid to the legal team in question.  I urge him, in as effective a manner as possible, to ensure that does not happen again but that the fees would be laid out prior to witnesses appearing before the commission.  What happens in the case of non-cooperative witnesses?  My learned friend on the other side will have spent time in courthouses, thankfully I have not.  From watching relevant television viewing, if people take the fifth amendment and refuse to answer direct questions, can the Minister ensure they are dealt with in the Bill?  Will the State agree to pay the legal fees of witness who are non-cooperative?  What will happen if there is a P. Flynn moment at one of these investigations, whereby a witness divulges information that heretofore had not been in the public domain and it is of an extensive nature that it may lead to a court case?  Are safeguards provided for that eventuality in the legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000044#SS02000","speaker":"1163","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373472300,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House with a huge piece of work.  It is obvious he has been very busy.  I avail of the opportunity to mention some of the other legislation which has been passed, published or pending.  They are relevant because they are all part of the reform of the political system which we can say with no exaggeration has seen the near destruction of public confidence in politics, politicians and the democratic system in the past six years.  That is the type of destruction that is difficult to repair.  It is also difficult to notice it because it is not about directly creating jobs or paying bills and, therefore, it always receives less attention, except when it does get attention that everybody has an opinion.  It is the kind of glue which binds the political system together and makes it function in a more organised and accountable fashion.  In many ways it does not get headlines in the way it might.<\/p><p>I am speaking about the whistleblowers legislation just published which provides comprehensive safeguards for whistleblowers, an issue in which I would have a personal interest and would welcome.  I am aware that in the Department, the Minister is involved in the overhaul of ethics legislation and taking lessons from the Mahon tribunal.  There is the reform and strengthening of the freedom of information legislation which, I think, is extended to all bodies and a strengthening of Civil Service accountability, which is very welcome.  The reform and enhancement of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction to all public bodies is an issue which did not get a huge amount of notice and yet it is extremely important.  We are delighted to see the current Ombudsman step up to the European plate and, no doubt, she will be replaced in due course.  It is good that job is being strengthened.<\/p><p>I understand the Bill on the regulation of lobbying should be enacted later in the year.  It was promised for a long time and I hope it will see the light of day under this Government because it is an extremely important part of building the public's faith and confidence in the political system.  There is now the pending inclusion of the Government in the open Government forum which binds this Government to particular regulations relating to openness on information and performance and to disclosure on the part of politicians and civil servants and also being part of that partnership which was set up only some years ago will provide opportunities for this country to draw on and learn from experiences in other countries.  It was set up in response to the public's desire for transparent, effective and accountable government and it will require much knowledge and political leadership.  I understand we should take part in that partnership as and from next year.  We will join with about 53 other countries, including Costa Rica, Colombia, Armenia, Azerbaijan who have already signed up.  Perhaps it is time we did and I welcome that. <\/p><p>I welcome the work that has gone into the preparation of the Bill including all the consultations.  It is timely and is a work of great detail.  I suppose asking questions and sitting on committees and tabling amendments are part and parcel of what we would recognise as our work as parliamentarians.  It is part of the necessary scrutiny of legislation but it is very much the contemporaneous work that we do while legislation is going through the House but a parliamentary inquiry should be just as important a duty for us.  The purpose of Parliament is to scrutinise and hold the Government to account after the event, not just at the time of the formulation of laws and policies.  While I recognise the limitations of this legislation, because of the so-called Abbeylara judgment, I welcome it.  It is there to establish a comprehensive statutory framework for the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries within the current constitutional framework as set down by the Supreme Court in the Abbeylara judgment.<\/p><p>The Bill also aims to provide thorough safeguards to protect the constitutional rights of witnesses, to confirm unfettered access to the courts and to guarantee fair procedures.  It offers a variety of different types of inquiry ranging from inquiries limited to recording and reporting evidence to inquiries of an adjudicative nature where this flows from the constitutional powers of the Oireachtas.  Ultimately the Bill should clarify the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in securing accountability in matters of significant public importance and therein lies a question in itself.  Who defines matters of significant public importance?  <\/p><p>At the moment I know that the banking inquiry is the matter which most people are rightly focused on. <\/p> <p>The Oireachtas inquiry, hopefully, can build on the information that has already been provided in the Honohan report, the Regling and Watson report and the Nyberg report.  Witnesses that have not spoken can be called and documents can be discovered to provide a somewhat complete picture of the events that led to the banking collapse.  Senator Byrne has pointed out that the provision may not work.  One thing is certain, if we sit and do nothing then there will be nothing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000045#TT00200","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373472900,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000046#UU00200","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1373472900,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Personally, I am in favour of proceeding.  A lot of care and attention has been put into the Bill and I do not want to see the void that we have continue.<\/p><p>Equally, the matter of those held for a long period in direct provision accommodation, for example, could be the subject of an inquiry.  If we do not act now a future Government will have no choice but to inquire into the way in which men, women and children are being treated by the direct provision system in this country.  I cite it as an example of something that is very pertinent and unrelated to banking, and to show that there will be many areas in which the legislation can be used. <\/p><p>Of course there will always be a need for inquiry as organisations of the State fail in their duties of care not deliberately - perhaps sometimes - but not usually.  It is generally because humans fail and we need the capability to go back and check on our failings.  The public needs to know that elected representatives have a duty to investigate these failings.  They also need to know that such inquiries would be prompt, thorough and sufficiently independent of Government so that they can succeed.  As the Minister has said, that is on the part of the Oireachtas.  Can he tell me what is meant by &quot;prompt&quot;?  How would the investigations be brought forward?  What is the timeframe? <\/p><p>We learn from our mistakes and inquiries play a valuable role in learning that lesson, but they do more.  They can also help to secure accountability, although the legislation is limited in that regard, they can show the country and the world that we are able to go back and examine our own decisions, or lack of them, in a mature and organised way.  They can also show that we can hold a light up to our own failings in an organised non-hysterical fashion and not by way of a witch-hunt.  <\/p><p>The ability to inquire breathes confidence into Parliament.  The public can see that their elected representatives do care about the things that go wrong and have the capability to go back and ask about them.  It strengthens the fabric of democracy.  Passing this legislation will make it the business of politicians to step up to the plate to take on that responsibility and that all adds to the building of confidence in politics and society.  The organs of State will know that there is a level of accountability and, hopefully, it will encourage better practice and enhanced transparency.  All such inquiries must be carefully constituted in order to avoid the risk of prejudicing any further criminal proceedings.  <\/p><p>The legislation is welcome and has been a long time coming.  Since Abbeylara 12 years ago there has been precious little investigation in the Oireachtas.  It is almost the equivalent of cutting off an arm of the activity of Parliament, something that was allowed to happen under the previous Government.  <\/p><p>The style of inquiry allowed under the Bill will be very particular.  It will require Deputies and Senators to come to terms with the limitations of the style but limitations do not spell disaster for the process.  On the contrary, it can work to focus the effort on ensuring that information is sought correctly and placed in the public domain.<\/p><p>Allowing for investigation into the heads of public bodies and senior civil servants is also welcome, not because they all need investigation but because it enhances their role and responsibilities if they can be investigated and can give their version of events when asked.  Anonymity for civil servants should be passed.  Just as some have got away with bad decisions and bad behaviour so some have been conveniently scapegoated for ministerial errors and mistakes.  I appreciate that the legislation outlines the way in which civil servants can give their evidence.  <\/p><p>The comment is often made that politicians could not carry out this investigative function in an appropriate fashion due to their party bias.  First, most politicians are quite capable of suspending their partisanship when required.  When asked to do so in a public forum, and under scrutiny themselves, means it will be harder to pursue party politics in that way.  I welcome the Minister's observation that Members of the Oireachtas are experienced, capable and motivated to act in the public interest and I found that is true, in the main.<\/p><p>Second, not all politicians are members of a party.  Most importantly, the idea that any other form of investigation is truly independent is naive, at the very least.  Everyone in every walk of life brings their prejudice, bias and opinion to their work overtly and covertly, consciously and unconsciously.  All investigations have a measure of bias yet we pretend that the only people liable to bias are politicians.  <\/p><p>My final comment is for the Minister.  I am unclear as to who in the Oireachtas will be the investigators.  Is it every committee as the matter falls into their remit?  Will there be a special investigations committee?  What will be the role of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, of which I am a member?  The committee was originally set up to be the investigations committee but when the referendum failed that part of the job failed with it.  We now have jurisdiction over public petitions and oversight through the various ombudsmen.  We have the very specific function of oversight of public service delivery &quot;with a particular focus of investigating and identifying improvements in the delivery of such services to the public&quot;.  I would appreciate if the Minister could comment on where the committee fits into the process?  <\/p><p>In the legislation, what is meant by &quot;advice&quot; from the Office of the Attorney General?  What are the implications for Cabinet confidentiality?  Who ultimately decides what constitutes a matter worthy of inquiry?  The Minister has said that it is not the Executive but the Oireachtas.  In the absence of a particular committee who will make that decision?  <\/p><p>Reforming legislation works only if it is designed and intended to bring reform, not to pay lip service to public demand for transparency and accountability.  I welcome the legislation because I believe that it is designed and intended that it would bring reform, particularly in the case of the banking inquiry.  The other legislation that I have mentioned will strengthen our democratic system and public trust in the current system which can only be a good thing.  I welcome the Bill.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000046#UU00300","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1373472900,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I shall keep my comments as brief as possible because previous Senators have said a lot of what I was going to say and posed my questions.<\/p><p>  As the Minister will know from the other House, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill based on the principle that the Oireachtas should have the power to conduct inquiries.  Clearly, the defeat of the referendum limits the scope of the Bill and that of any subsequent inquiry but the legislation is still valuable.  As has been mentioned, a lot of the discussion that took place over the past couple of weeks has been in terms of the banking inquiry.  As the Minister and other Members of this House have stated, it is important to remember that the Bill is about much more than that specific inquiry in terms of the framework that it will establish.  Future Oireachtas inquiries cannot make adverse findings against individuals.  My colleagues and I in the Sinn F&eacute;in Party find that provision regrettable but we respect the outcome of the referendum.<\/p><p>  I shall touch on the referendum.  Given that the people have spoken on the referendum it would be regrettable if the Government chose to rerun the referendum.  The people have spoken on the matter and they are not minded, at present, to extend extra powers to politicians and that is due to their distrust of politicians.  If we, as politicians, wish to regain their trust then we must respect the outcome of the referendum.  As I said, the result has limited the scope of the legislation and that of a future Oireachtas inquiry, probably more than we would like.  <\/p><p>  Earlier I mentioned the banking inquiry.  It will not be able to make adverse findings of fact and cannot interfere with criminal proceedings against any individual.  The only forum will be a court of law.  I share the frustration felt by many people about the delay in establishing the banking inquiry.  That is regrettable.  To date, the public's knowledge of what happened or surrounded the events in 2008 has been based on leaked information to national newspapers.  The <i>Irish Independent <\/i>has done us all a great service by putting the information into the public domain but that is no substitute for an open, transparent and detailed public inquiry. <br \/><i><\/i>As I said, many of my comments and questions have already been raised but the Sinn F&eacute;in Party supports the Bill and the establishment of the banking inquiry.

It is very welcome to be debating the Bill here and it is particularly timely given the publication of the Anglo tapes.  Obviously, the tapes are of great interest and concern to everyone in the country.  We have been drip fed the revelations and the so-called humour of bankers has been exposed.<\/p> <p>In the context of the Bill's introduction, as a criminal lawyer, the key priority is to ensure that criminal investigations are expedited.  The public most wants to see that those individuals responsible for the economic collapse will be held accountable under the criminal law where relevant and necessary.  The criminal process is undoubtedly taking a long time.  Charges have been brought and one must be careful because cases are pending but, as the Minister said, the DPP advised the chartered accountants some two years ago, on foot of certain information, that charges were imminent then.  More recently, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>was also asked to withhold publication of certain aspects of the tapes.  We all very much hope that charges are imminent but it is important to put in place necessary resourcing both for the Garda fraud squad and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to ensure that investigations are not hampered and are brought forward in a timely fashion.<\/p><p> It has been alleged that there have been clear breaches of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act.  A more straightforward defence is available for prosecuting fraud under that legislation, rather than the more complex corporate criminal offences which are also being investigated.  It seems to me that certain investigations could be carried out in a more timely fashion.  <\/p><p> Leaving aside the criminal process, however, the issue at stake here is about holding broader Oireachtas inquiries.  The Bill provides for six different types of inquiry, while the focus of public debate has been on one particular type - the inquiry to hold the government to account.  However, there are also important provisions in the Bill which deal with inquiries relating to the removal of office holders, the impeachment of the President, and the inquire, record and report inquiries.<\/p><p> The inquiry that everyone is interested in, however, is the one into the collapse of the banks.  The public may want to know &quot;who dunnit&quot; but that is a question for a criminal process.  Given the parameters of the Abbeylara judgment and the failure of the referendum in 2011, Oireachtas inquiries are limited to an equally important question which is, what happened?  People are anxious to know what occurred.  That question is a key one but none of us knows the answer.  Five years after the fateful night of the bank guarantee we still do not know what happened or, indeed, how it happened.  Those are questions that an Oireachtas inquiry - carried out within the constitutional and statutory framework of this Bill - could and should answer.  It is good to see the Minister bringing forward this Bill so swiftly so that we can see that inquiry being set up in the autumn.  <\/p><p> The questions of what happened and how events unfolded are appropriate to an Oireachtas inquiry conducted in public with the specific powers provided for in the Bill before us.  The legislation contains measures such as the protection of whistleblowers - which is qualified privilege for confidential communications for members of the public to Members of either House - and the section 21 prohibition on Members sitting where there is a perception of bias.  Senator O'Keeffe has spoken eloquently about that.<\/p><p> It is important for us to defend the principle of Oireachtas inquiries.  During the referendum campaign in 2011, unfortunate language was used.  I know that many lawyers were swayed by the gimmicky slogan &quot;kangaroo courts&quot;, which I thought unfairly characterised what was being attempted.  It was to set up a sort of inquiry that could be conducted by parliamentarians in a dignified and robust fashion.  I am referring to the sort of committee inquiries we have had in the past, including the Committee of Public Accounts' inquiry into DIRT.  I have been present at hearings of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on contentious issues such as prostitution.  These issues are dealt with in a forensic but respectful fashion by members of the committee who have left aside party political allegiance in the context of such directed inquiries.  When Oireachtas committees work well they can be impressive.  It will be positive for the Oireachtas to see a committee of inquiry being carried out under this legislation.  <\/p><p> A great deal of work goes on under the radar at committees and there is much criticism about people turning up.  When they work well, however, they really are impressive.  In a broader context, it will enhance people's trust in parliamentarians.  There is currently a vicious circle with people saying that they do not deserve our trust.  At the back of the kangaroo courts slogan was the idea that somehow parliamentarians are unworthy or unfit to conduct inquiries.  Yet we are elected by the people and the people must have trust in their parliamentarians.  Providing more detailed and comprehensive powers to conduct inquiries as set out in this Bill will enhance trust in parliamentarians and give them more responsibility to conduct the sort of important inquiry we all want to see carried out.<\/p><p> I want to make one final substantive point about the Bill.  I am glad the Minister emphasised in his speech that the Bill empowers the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries, and not the Executive.  As the Minister said, this was a conscious decision because of the critique that Irish politics tends to be dominated by the Executive.  Of course, having two Houses of Parliament should enhance the power of the Oireachtas as against that of the Executive but that is an argument for another day.  Indeed, we have been having that argument here at length, and will be doing so, on the Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution (Abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann) Bill.  <\/p><p> I am grateful to my colleague, Professor Gerry Whyte of the TCD Law School, who has raised the issue of Cabinet confidentiality.  I know the Minister is aware of this issue.  Article 28.4.3<sup>o<\/sup>of the Constitution states that the rule on Cabinet confidentiality can be set aside by a High Court order for disclosure, but that the application must be made &quot;...by a tribunal appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government on the authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas...&quot;.  I have discussed this with colleagues and we wondered if this means an Oireachtas inquiry.  I have looked through the Bill to see and it is very much an Oireachtas inquiry.  These inquiries will be creatures of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> Senator O'Keeffe has raised an important question about the process by which the inquiry is set up and which committee will do it.  Clearly, however, they are being set up by the Oireachtas, rather than by the Executive, which is a significant strength of the Bill.  I wonder nonetheless if that will hamper access to Cabinet records.  That will obviously be very important in the context of a banking inquiry.  It may also be important for some other sorts of inquiry the Bill envisages that Oireachtas committees will conduct.  <\/p><p> I referred to the central questions of what happened and how it happened.  In this context, an inquiry would need to have some access to what went on in Cabinet deliberations, so I wonder how that can be dealt with without, I dread to say, having a referendum on amending Article 28.  The latter article was clearly drafted to envisage a tribunal of inquiry.  That is the model that was envisaged but we have moved on greatly since then and this Bill will add these new sorts of Oireachtas inquiries.  However, I do not see them being allowed for within the current wording of Article 28.  I hope I am wrong about that but the point was raised with me and I think it is worth raising again now and later on Committee Stage.  <\/p><p> I welcome the debate we will have on the Bill's more detailed provisions on Committee Stage.  I also welcome the Bill and the inquiries we will see being conducted within its parameters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000046#UU00500","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373473500,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I will deal individually with the points that have been raised.

I do not confuse that, as the Senator has, with the robustness of debate on the Order of Business or Taoiseach's Questions.  At Westminster, one can have skin and hair flying during Prime Minister's Questions, but that does not negate the possibility of the same people doing a discrete job of work in a committee room, without bias or bringing in those particular issues. <\/p> <p>That is important.

I sat in these Houses during a decade or more of inquiries when personages were still involved at the core of political life but we could not raise the issue in the Oireachtas because it was all going on somewhere else.  That would be acceptable if a tribunal sat for a month, six months or even a year but the notion that normal political business has to carry on in a vacuum while somewhere else that sort of inquiry was going on is not fit for purpose.

We need reform because there will be occasions when a tribunal of inquiry will be appropriate again.  What we are trying to do is to create another model.  The Commissions of Investigation Act will allow for some forms of inquiry that could be conducted behind closed doors where that is appropriate and then produce a finding.  For example, the Murphy report was a very good example of that.  Most of the focus in today&rsquo;s debate has been on a future banking inquiry, although as I stressed, this is an overarching Bill.  What people want is an inquiry where people would simply be asked the questions everyone wants answered in a public forum under oath.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne is correct; I do not think there would be great reluctance on the part of many participants to attend, answer or to tell the truth.  No more than people do not need a newspaper editor to come to conclusions for them, when people have the full evidence they can weigh up their own views on the issues.  In a way, it is assistance.  I do not wish to sound as if I am not in favour of further powers for the Oireachtas but it is an assistance if it is an inquiry that cannot find culpability because then it can be more probing and less restrictive in the way it operates because it simply wants to set out the truth and let people come to their own conclusions.  I do not accept the political charge that because somebody says something on the Order of Business or during Taoiseach&rsquo;s Questions that we are all disqualified.

That is covered extensively in the Bill.  In terms of costs, we have taken a great deal of care to have a determining process for costs that, first, must be scoped out in advance of an inquiry being embarked upon.  A formal scoping must be made with a presentation of estimated costs.  At the end of the process, for those who are entitled to get legal costs, an independent process, as set out in the Bill, will be used to make that determination.<\/p><p>  The Bill contains extensive powers to deal with non-co-operating witnesses.  I refer to the offences sections, namely, sections 64, 75 and 90.  Section 64 specifies: <blockquote>64.--(1) A person who--(<i>a<\/i>) on examination under oath under <i>section 45<\/i>, or in any affidavit referred to in that section, gives evidence knowing the evidence to be false or misleading in a material particular or being reckless as to whether it is so false or misleading, or<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) knowingly gives a document referred to in that section which is false or misleading in a material particular or being reckless as to whether it is so false or misleading,is guilty of an offence.<\/blockquote>On conviction or indictment, such a person could face a fine of &euro;500,000 or five years in prison.  That is the penalty for giving false evidence.  Section 75 covers other offences.  Subsection (1) states:  <blockquote>(1) A person who-- (<i>a<\/i>) having been directed under <i>paragraph (a) <\/i>of <i>section 67(1) <\/i>to attend before a committee and having had tendered to him or her any sum in respect of the expenses of his or her attendance before the committee which a witness summoned to attend before the Court would be entitled to have tendered to him or her, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with the direction,<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) being in attendance before a committee pursuant to a direction under <i>paragraph (a) <\/i>of <i>section 67(1)<\/i>, refuses to take the oath on being required by the committee to do so or refuses to answer any question to which the committee is entitled by law to require an answer,<br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a direction...<\/blockquote>is, again, guilty of an offence.

There are very robust powers on compellability, answering questions and attending if one is required to so do.<\/p><p>  I thank Senator O'Keeffe for her complimentary words on the reform agenda.  This should be cited in that.  Most of the publicity I get in my job is on the fiscal side, which is important in terms of balancing the books.  That is the focus of most attention but the reform side of my Department - the name &#8220;reform&#8221; - is as important to me.  I said publicly that if there is to be a legacy in my Department it will be on the reform side rather than the fiscal side.  Getting the books balanced is extremely important if we are to have any future but restoring broken politics or a broken polity would be more important in the longer term.  There is a huge agenda of change, much of which is being constructed below the horizon at present in terms of participation in the Open Government Partnership and Open Data so that we almost move beyond freedom of information and that all data will be accessible as a matter of routine.  If one adds to that the legislation on lobbyists, whistleblowers and freedom of information, the corpus of work will have a very important impact which, to put it bluntly, has not been seen since we were last in government when we introduced the Freedom of Information Act, the ethics Acts, the electoral Acts and all the reform that has not been advanced very much since.<\/p><p>  Senator O'Keeffe asked a number of questions.  She referred to the capacity of Members.  I have already addressed that.  I believe that no more or less than elected Members of Parliament in any other analogous parliament we have the capacity to do the people's business.  We are not particularly infirm in this country because of the good weather or whatever else to do the business any less than British Members of Parliament, US Members of Congress or the French Members of the<i> Assembl&eacute;e Nationale<\/i> among others.  On the question of who is to investigate, in preparation for this Bill I originally wrote to the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and to the Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il because I thought they would be the persons to determine in each House if there was a request who should conduct the inquiry and other such matters.  In the other House it will be a committee determined by the House itself, most likely to be the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which will determine whether there is to be an inquiry and its scope.  The Cathaoirleach will be involved in this House.<\/p><p>  Under the Constitution the Attorney General has two roles.  One is to be the legal adviser to the Government and the other is to be the defender of the Constitution.  The Attorney General is not the legal adviser to the Parliament and will not be.

I strongly agree with the Senator that it is important that we, as politicians, regain the trust of the people before we would ask them to give us further authority in terms of strengthening the investigative powers of the Oireachtas to come to conclusions that would adversely impact on the good name or character of people who are not subject to the constitutional oversight of the Houses already.

I am a little concerned that she would raise the expectations of people that there would be wholesale criminal prosecution because criminality is confined to a narrow range of behaviours.  There will be a lot of people who, in some people's minds, would be considered reckless, who they consider did not do their jobs or were careless, and much of that might not amount to a criminal offence that could be prosecuted.  Obviously, that process needs to be brought to its normal conclusion.  All of us are a little bit frustrated but there is a separation of powers.  The prosecution authorities are independent of political interference and that is right and proper.  That is there for a good reason.  We do not want political prosecutions but we expect prosecutions to come when all the evidence is adduced and the Director of Public Prosecutions is ready to bring prosecutions to the court, but that should not negative our wish to have, to use Senator Bacik's words, the full narrative of what happened seen.  We have to look at the oversight of all the principal players, the Department of Finance, the regulator, the Central Bank and the Cabinet, who ultimately made the decisions.  Who was imputing, what state of knowledge did they have and how did they come to make those decisions?  I think this can be done.<\/p><p>  Senator Bacik talked about the conduct of the last referendum and the issue of kangaroo courts, which were words displayed in a discordant poster during the campaign in that referendum.  No more than inquiries in any other jurisdiction, parliamentary inquiries are so described and we should not be so weak in the capacity we give our own Parliament that we weaken its hand to have proper oversight, but the decision in that referendum was a decision of the people and we have to accept the decision of the people and build trust.  To answer Senator Reilly's question directly, there will be no rush to have a further referendum because we need to get on with this process, within the confines laid down by the people and the courts, of the constitutional demands upon us.  This Bill is crafted within those confines.  It is a comprehensive Bill and, if implemented effectively in a way that I believe is within the encompass and the capacity of Members of these Houses to do, it will greatly strengthen the people's trust in our capacity to hold people to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000049#XX00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373474700,"counter":538,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1373474700,"counter":539,"content":"<p>  Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 16 July 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000049#XX00700","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373474700,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 6.30 p.m. and resumed at 7 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":" An Bille um an Dara Leas&uacute; is Tr&iacute;ocha ar an mBunreacht (Deireadh a Chur le Seanad &Eacute;ireann) 2013: C&eacute;im an Choiste (At&oacute;g&aacute;il) - Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution (Abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann) Bill 2013: Committee Stage (Resumed)","time":1373475300,"counter":542,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000050#YY00200"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373475300,"counter":543,"content":"<p>ALT 1\r\nSECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373475300,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Atairgeadh an cheist: &quot;Go bhfanfaidh alt 1 mar chuid den Bhille.&quot;<\/p><p>Question again proposed: &quot;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1373475300,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to the House.

For the sake of attribution, I called for the quorum.<\/p><p>While many sections of the press and commentariat have already had a mini-referendum on the Seanad and abolished it, it is as yet one of the two Chambers of our democracy, which is one of the longest continuously functioning democracies in Europe.  It is perhaps without self inflation a somewhat weighty matter that when we are discussing matters related to abolition of one half of our national Parliament there is an appropriate audience present for the discussion.  While I have not done so before, I would like to put my colleagues on notice that I propose to try to ensure we are quorate throughout this debate.<\/p><p>I was looking forward to getting to know the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, better over the course of this evening.  I reckon we would have had a much lengthier interaction in this session that we are likely to have in aggregate in the remainder of our time in Parliament.  I am equally pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, is in the House and that we will get to know each other a little better over the next while.<\/p><p>For the sake of fairness, I will return to the point I was making prior to the adjournment of the debate.<\/p> <p>We were discussing certain aspects of the Bill, particularly the assumption that we are dealing with establishing an abolition day in respect of one House of our national Parliament.  As already stated, this is a weighty matter.  Democracy is an untidy form of government but its lack of tidiness is more than compensated for by the multiple advantages it has to offer.  I also stated earlier that it can be a pretty gruesome form of government but it beats the hell out of all of the alternatives.<\/p><p>I am an absolute democrat and I fully believe in trying to transliterate the wishes of the people as closely as possible into the policies which are formulated for them and on their behalf.  Parliamentary democracy has been the best means of doing this.  As we are aware, however, one House of this Parliament is extremely undemocratic.  When I first ran for the Seanad just over two years ago, in my one and only item of election literature I stated that I would campaign for its reform or abolition and that the affront to democracy which its existing electoral system represents outweighs any potential benefits the House, as currently constituted, has to offer.  I am very much of the view that the Seanad must be reformed but I accept that we are not debating a reform option.  I am a member of one of the two groups in this House which authored Seanad reform legislation.  The Bill with which I was involved was dealt with in a spirit of noble co-operation by the Minister of State's party, which put the petty considerations that can sometimes guide discourse to one side and allowed it to remain on the Order Paper following Second Stage.  This also happened in the case of the legislation tabled by my esteemed colleagues, Senators Quinn and Zappone.<\/p><p>Even though we are not debating a reform option, I am of the view that we must briefly consider both what might be the alternatives and why we are discussing the abolition of the House.  The reasons which have been advanced in respect of abolition are in some cases very reasonably and in others greatly flawed.  The democratic deficit relating to and the alleged elitism of the Seanad are the most sustainable reasons for abolishing it.  This is why I truly believe that if we only ever have a choice of leaving the House as it is currently constituted or abolishing it, I would state - with a heavy heart - that it should be abolished.  I have, however, decided to campaign for another outcome, namely, reform.  In order to advance the reform agenda and ensure that it survives, we must oppose abolition in the first instance.  Once the House is gone, it will be very difficult to get it back.<\/p><p>Why is it that the elitism and undemocratic nature of the Seanad emerged as they did?  The reason is that the very people who are now most loudly decrying that elitism and undemocratic nature are those who allowed the latter to emerge in the first instance.  It was they who created the reality.  The original intent of the 1937 Constitution is actually relatively clever in that in the D&aacute;il we would have a powerful, rigorously democratic Chamber elected by means of universal suffrage.  It was envisaged that this would be where the power would lie and where decisions would be made.  The Second Chamber was designed to incorporate a different - though not necessarily elitist - skillset among its Members which would contemplate certain technocratic  aspects, life experiences and perspectives that might not be well represented in a single-chamber parliament exclusively and overwhelmingly comprising full-time politicians affiliated to large and well-organised political parties.  This is why our system - with its various panels, university Senators and, to avoid logjams, Taoiseach's appointees - developed as it did.  That system failed because we ended up with a D&aacute;il and a D&aacute;il lite or mini D&aacute;il.  The membership of the Seanad by and large comprises good and often very able people who have a good record of public service and representation.  In general, however, they are also the same type of people as their counterparts in the D&aacute;il.  The seats relating to the Administrative Panel, the Agricultural Panel, the Industrial and Commercial Panel, etc., were not necessarily filled by people who brought the relevant expertise with them - although in many cases they did - but rather by individuals whose parties felt, for very good reasons I am sure, were deserving of seats in the national Parliament.  What occurred, therefore, was what one might describe as a sort of gentle, low-level coup.  It was certainly a subversion of the intent of the original authors of the 1937 Constitution.  What they did effectively led to the Seanad developing into something that was never envisaged.<\/p><p>While the argument that the Seanad merits abolition because it is undemocratic is both defensible and sustainable, it must be countered by the fact that the people who created that sad reality are those who are now seeking to abolish it.  The Seanad was never given the opportunity to fulfil the role originally envisaged for it.  I have no intention of being judgmental and I am very cognisant of the unbelievably accomplished people who have been Members of this House and who made a far greater contribution to Irish life than I could ever hope to make.  However, when considered in the context of its entire lifespan, it could be argued that Seanad &Eacute;ireann has not been a successful political entity.  If the House was seeking to ensure its survival on the basis of what it has achieved, then it would be a hard sell.  I will paraphrase another old adage at this point and state that some see things as they are and say &quot;Why?&quot;, while others look at things that never were and say &quot;Why not?&quot;<\/p><p>The second argument in favour of abolition, which is wholly illegitimate, is that it will save money.  In the context of a debate which took place approximately 18 months ago, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, informed us about the necessity for a constitutionally reformed Oireachtas hearings process in advance of the failed referendum to allow committees of the Houses to hold inquiries.  He also stated that the money saved as a result of the abolition of the Seanad could be usefully redeployed to powerful, interrogative D&aacute;il committees.  Let us stop for a moment and consider the case of an average person who thinks that we - a bunch of well-heeled fat cats sitting in leather chairs in Leinster House - should be fired because his or her daughter has been waiting two years for an operation to have her spine straightened at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  That individual is being misled into believing that the money saved as a result of the abolition of the Seanad will be redirected into the health service, the area of social protection or - in order to employ additional special needs assistants - the education system.  If I knew that was going to happen, I would have a very difficult time trying to oppose abolition.<\/p><p>If I knew that the fights we are having on a near weekly basis to obtain cancer drugs for the patients would be aided by the redeployment of the moneys in question to this end, I might be on the other side of the argument.  However, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has bluntly stated on three occasions, in this House, in an RTE interview two weeks ago and in a private conversation with me, that the moneys in question will be redeployed to D&aacute;il committees.  In fairness, I would not reveal what the Minister said to me in private had he not reiterated it in public.  In that context, when I asked he if it was still intended to redeploy the money to the committees he answered in the affirmative.  An argument can, perhaps, be made in favour of that.  Let us consider, however, the committees which will be created and to which this money will be redeployed if the Seanad is abolished.  Will those committees be more democratic?  The answer is no.<\/p><p>I believe Senator Hayden wishes to ask a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000050#YY01100","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373475600,"counter":553,"content":"<p>No.  I raised my hand to indicate a desire to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000051#ZZ00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1373475600,"counter":554,"content":"<p>Okay.

Effectively, there will still be a second level of scrutineers fulfilling the role set aside for this House, namely, examining legislation in a more dispassionate, non-partisan, technocratic, expert and contemplative fashion.  We will not get the latter, however.  Instead, what will happen is that people from among the ranks of the commentariat, those in academia, etc., will probably be appointed.  This will not happen on the basis of the peer review which leads to individuals such as Senator Barrett being elected to the House.  Rather, they will be appointed because the Taoiseach will want to appoint them.  The current Taoiseach appointed some fine people to serve in this Seanad.  However, in the interests of trying to get legislation through - in the knowledge that there will no longer be in place a second Chamber place which will it in the way I have outlined - he will appoint those he is certain will ensure it is passed in an unhindered and uninterrupted fashion.  That does not constitute good scrutiny, nor does it indicate that there will be proper checks and balances in place.  It is the type of self-policing about which the profession of which I am a member was so criticised and which led to the Irish Medical Council being completely reformatted.  The abolition of the Seanad will not lead to money being saved or to better scrutiny.  It will instead give rise to a form of scrutiny in respect of which those who will be appointed by the Taoiseach ill be less answerable.  I am of the view, therefore, that what is proposed fails on every single ground.<\/p><p>Two great arguments have already advanced in respect of this matter.  The first of these, which is defensible, is that the Seanad, which the second, which is not defensible, is that it is a waste of money.  There is a third great argument which is put forward and which, to me, is the most troubling.<\/p> <p>At the time when I was still wrestling with my conscience on the issue of how much I wanted to involve myself in the Seanad retention or reform campaign, some of my other colleagues were taking early and vocal positions suggesting that there was a core threat to democracy implicit in the possibility of abolishing the Seanad.  In theory that could happen.  In some hypothetical constitutional scenario there may be some threat to the State, but it is not likely.<\/p><p>In looking over the history of Seanad &Eacute;ireann it is clear that it has done some wonderful things.  It has been superb in building bridges to the Northern community and giving a voice to fringe groups that might not have had a voice otherwise.  It has also brought us expertise.  I am sorry to keep pointing him out but we have someone with a doctorate in economics in the Oireachtas, some five years into our economic crisis.  We got him three years into the economic crisis, but it was three years too late.  The reality is that it is difficult to make a case that it has been powerful in defending democracy but it is easier to make a case that the way it is proposed to abolish it makes no sense when there is a Constitutional Convention that has not been given permission to examine the most fundamental and critical question of our Constitution, that is, how many chambers we should have in the Parliament and how to elect them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000051#ZZ00500","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373476200,"counter":558,"content":"<p>Even if we did, they would ignore it.

I was vocal in my support of the alternative government with the implicit understanding that Deputy Kenny he would be the Taoiseach.  I do not buy in to the theory that he is some kind of incipient autocrat or some of the somewhat uncharitable historical comparisons made between a certain fringe of his party at one time in the past and contemporaneous fringe political movements in other countries.  I put it gently to my colleagues who have suggested as much that, in truth, that suggestion is unfair.  I do not believe that the man's instincts are anything other than democratic.  However, I believe he backed himself into an almighty corner when, on the spur of the moment, he made a decision at a time when he was having some internal political difficulties.  I am not criticising him for it, but he latched on to a suggestion which appears to be completely at variance with everything he had said previously about the Seanad, that is to say, that it should be reformed and that it could be constructive.  He quoted the extraordinary contributions that individual Senators of great standing had made over the years.  Then, in a quasi-social environment he threw out the idea, apparently written on the back of an envelope and in a manner unplanned, un-counselled and not co-ordinated with any of his senior political staff, or , I strongly suspect, his Senators, that he would put a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" abolition case to the people.  He has been unshakeable in terms of allowing discourse to occur on this issue.<\/p><p>We have a situation where my good friend and colleague, Senator Norris, attended the Constitutional Convention and I was happy and proud to yield to him to try to force the issue and raise the discussion at that wonderful democratic assembly of 33 parliamentarians and 66 fellow citizens.  It includes folk from North and South, from every walk of life, including people who are involved in politics and people who are not, people who knew who some of us were and people who had never heard of any of us but who were simply there to give their opinion.  None of these people were given the chance to debate this critical question.  While I do not believe it indicates any level of incipient despotism, autocracy or dictatorship, it may perhaps indicate a stubborn streak.  I believe it would have been far preferable had the convention been given the opportunity to discuss this issue.<\/p><p>There is another obvious point that merits raising and I will call on the Minister of State to go on the record in that regard when I conclude - in several hours' time, that is.  We have had a range of opinions from people occupying the ministerial chair in this House.  They have stated how helpful they have found the Seanad and the contributions Members have made to legislation, how the House has pointed out things that slipped through the net following several D&aacute;il Stages - that can happen in any area of human endeavour - and how the Seanad has greatly strengthened a good deal of legislation.<\/p><p>It seems to me that there was no great consensus among the Taoiseach's close advisers.  Certainly, there was no consensus among those who strongly supported him at the time of the most recent leadership contest in Fine Gael that the Seanad should be abolished without any discussion concerning potential reform options.  The Constitutional Convention was not given a chance.<\/p><p>We have seen a situation in the Houses whereby Members of the Seanad and D&aacute;il have been effectively whipped to varying degrees on this issue.  This has come across as undemocratic.  Although the analogy about turkeys not voting for Christmas has been trotted out we could be left with an even more extreme example of what I term veterinary orthopaedics, because we are all aware of the idea that we may be lame ducks if the House is abolished but we are still sitting here drawing a salary for several years.<\/p><p>This brings me to a final point from this initial section of my contribution.  The Taoiseach himself raised a particular issue in a somewhat off-the-cuff speech recently.  He stated that one of the key reasons the Seanad needed to be abolished was because it failed to do anything to stop the Celtic tiger.  We all get face-slapping blinking moments of incomprehension from time to time - I have had several of them in recent years since I came to the House - but my face was truly red with self-slapping when I heard that comment and I could not quite believe what I had heard.  The Taoiseach, who, to his great credit, is the father of the Lower House, our longest serving D&aacute;il Member, despite his youth, has been deeply dug in to the system of politics in the country, in opposition, in government, on the frontbenches, on the backbenches and every kind of bench around.  In truth he was a member of the party that did not really do much to try to deflate the Celtic tiger.  I mean no disrespect to my current colleagues from the other party, but while the principal fault lay with the Government of the day, it was aided and abetted by the principal party in opposition at the time.<\/p><p>Is there a record for the number of Ministers of State who can attend one speech?

The most guilty entity was D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, which elected the Ministers who were insufficiently expert in economic matters to see what was happening and who in turn supervised the appointment of the senior officials and advisers who, incredibly, were not in a position to either predict a problem or to see it unravelling in real time.  I have, perhaps uncharitably, said that the Taoiseach criticising the Seanad for failing to stop the tiger was perhaps about as valid as if Neville Chamberlain had decided to blame the Mexicans for failing to stop Hitler even though he had been appeasing the Nazis throughout the immediate pre-war years.<\/p><p>All of the arguments which will be advanced in favour of section 1 of the legislation, which gives us an abolition day are arguments which, in the case of the economic one, are utterly unsustainable, in the case of guilt of the Seanad unsustainable and in the case of the democratic deficit, in truth, remediable.  I freely acknowledge the great contributions of Senators Quinn, Zappone and their supporters in formulating their Bill, about which I am sure we will here in the coming days.  We articulated an alternative vision for the Seanad because we need to fix the whole darn Parliament.  Within the constraints and confines of our current Constitution there is a limit to what we can realistically do.  We attempted to maximise radical Seanad reform within the confines of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann such that it would not require any constitutional amendment and which exists within the existing Constitution, including the various amendments and legislation passed over the years.<\/p><p>If we abolish the Seanad as proposed in section 1 of the Bill, we will never get the chance to look at the alternative mechanism short of there being a near insurrection-like democratic coup in the country which would shake the party system to its core and install a new wholly reform-oriented entity which had as its first item on the agenda writing a new constitution.  I must admit that in the odd moment of megalomania, the thought occurred to me that perhaps we should try to do that, but that is another day's work.<\/p><p>Today we are discussing what alternatives might be available if the abolition, as outlined, is rejected.  Our Bill proposed a universally enfranchised electorate electing the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  They would elect all 49 non-Taoiseach nominees - a constitutional referendum would be necessary to change the selection process for the other 11.  The 49 would sit on the existing constitutionally mandated panels and on the day of a D&aacute;il general election every voter would also pick the Seanad panel electoral ballot of his or her choice and would elect to vote in any one of the panels.  There would be certain restrictions in terms of who could vote on the university panels to satisfy the Constitution.  However, a university graduate who voted in the university panel could not vote on the other panels so we would be preserving the principle of one vote.  That is fine.<\/p><p>An entire constituency is currently affected by section 1.  A currently enfranchised body politic of our citizenry will have rights taken from them by other citizens if section 1, which we are trying to amend into extinction, is passed.  They are the graduates of the universities who currently live outside the State.  At the moment they have a voice in electing Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  If the Seanad is abolished, they will lose their voice in having any say in electing any Member of the Oireachtas, our national Parliament.  It is offensive to democracy at its most core level that one group of people within a currently enfranchised electorate are making a decision to exclude the input of a group currently enfranchised and to disenfranchise them.  What other precedent do we have?  It would be as if all of the men passed a vote to take the vote away from all the women without letting the women vote or if people over a certain age made a decision to take the vote away from people under a certain age or if people who paid tax made the decision to take the vote away from people who do not pay tax.  It is wrong and offensive.  It is very worrying that no thought has been given to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000052#AAA01500","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373476800,"counter":573,"content":"<p>It is the repartition of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000053#BBB00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1373476800,"counter":574,"content":"<p>The other essential element in our reform was that not only would we democratise the election process, but we would totally \"de-elitify\" it.  I may be making up a new word, which has a medical name, neologism.  People with various illnesses sometimes make up new words.  I hope I am not going to be diagnosed by any of the tens of thousands watching us right now.  In an attempt to remove elitism from the selection process, our reform proposes that any citizen could run for the Seanad if he or she had the signatures of 1,000 of his or her fellow citizens.  In addition we would extend the franchise to Irish citizens living abroad.  Great fears have been expressed over the years that we might have some horribly artificially inflated input of misty-eyed sentimentalised Irish abroad who were not really in contact with the realities of our country.  I believe that does a disservice to our diaspora and our system would have a check and balance in it.  A person living abroad wishing to vote would need to be a citizen and would need to go to the trouble of registering as a voter in his or her local Irish consular service.  This would be a wonderful way to bring the voice of our diaspora into the House.<\/p><p>In addition we proposed extending the franchise to non-Irish citizens legally resident here and who are currently eligible to vote in local elections.  We are culturally not used to being an immigrant society.  We think of ourselves as the praetorian guard of emigrants but do not tend to think of ourselves as immigrants.  We have neither the cultural skill set nor in many ways the administrative procedures to deal with immigrants.  In other countries the passage from legitimate immigration status to citizenry is smoothed rather more easily than it has been here.  This would give another opportunity for those wonderful contributors to our society who were not born here and have been contributing by working and they may be paying taxes.  Their children may be taking part in our sports events and they are enriching the cultural potpourri which is our country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000053#BBB00300","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1373476800,"counter":575,"content":"<p>Popery?

It would have given them expanded access into the halls of Parliament.  If we vote for section 1, I am afraid all those opportunities are cut off at the knees and we will not be able to pursue that any further.<\/p><p>Why is this political nirvana so important?  I believe the real political problem in the country is the composition of and the electoral system used for the D&aacute;il.  I mean absolutely no disrespect to my D&aacute;il colleagues.  I have come here as an outsider and still consider myself somewhat of an outsider and not a real politician.  My respect for their work and the commitment they show to what is in general an extremely difficult job has increased enormously.  I have a professional sense of understanding of the concept many of them have of being continually on call - at the end of a phone for somebody who has a problem in a way that I can relate to in my day job.<\/p> <p>However, there is still something very wrong with the way we are doing it because we have a three to five year electoral cycle, depending on political variables, at the end of which we have a large number of simultaneous local elections.  The principal skill sets that get one elected, and I say this not in an insulting way, are, first, negotiating the Byzantine ways of the local party structure and getting on the nominating process and, second, being a sound, solid constituency worker.  In general, if one sits at home in one's lonely garret on a quiet Thursday night in any rural or urban place in Ireland and thinks about what we need to do to fix the education system, the health system, the welfare system or something we need to do to increase equity in our society, no matter how good the idea it will never be one's highest professional priority as a politician because one's highest priority in our localised system - the word \"parochial\" is correct and I use it not in any pejorative sense - is how one can impress sufficient numbers of local people that they will return one to Leinster House at the next electoral cycle.  It makes it difficult to be the bearer of bad news or the person who, as the political equivalent of Morgan Kelly, could have stood up during the time of the previous Government and said: \"Guys, it has never happened in the history of commerce that a bubble of the kind we are experiencing did not stop and in the overwhelming majority of cases, when they blow up that fast they crash disastrously, and they stay crashed.\"  It must be said that not all economists were clever enough to see that coming, but the reality is that there were no PhD economists in the first line either of our Government or our Department of Finance.<\/p><p>The current system in the D&aacute;il is dysfunctional and is resulting in people being elected who have refocused on local rather than national issues.  The Minister will be aware that in general in the other House, and even among the Members of this House who may aspire to being a Member in the other House, often one's bitterest political rival and most proximate threat to one's own career advancement in terms of being elected or re-elected is not the person who is one's ideological foe but the person in one's own party who is in the same constituency.  There is something fundamentally crazy about that.  If our country is to be run by a bunch of people who believe they have a set of ideas to try to fix it, they should at least be able to work in unison and in a way that maximises their collective chance of getting to where they can make the decisions and have the power to do something about it, but instead we have the opposite.  We have people who are wondering what part of the constituency so and so from their party is strong in, and what they can do to undermine him or her in the constituency and make themselves stronger there.  Again, because of the system we have, we end up with people who are not only not fixated on the national issues but are not particularly incentivised to be fixated on thought and thinking things through.  It is a much more visceral reaction.<\/p><p>Into this heady mix of dysfunction we throw the rather strange structure of our two major political parties who, in truth and with no disrespect to them, and I look at them from the outside, are indistinguishable.  There is a cultural difference in terms of remote Civil War affiliations and a somewhat more subtle cultural difference in terms of some of the extreme aspects of their demographics of support but, by and large, they occupy the same part of the left-right debate in economic matters.  It is interesting that in the current debate on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill, one group was subject to the Whip and one group was not, but the same spectrum of opinions is apparent across both parties.  I suspect that if both were subject to the Whip and both were not subject to the Whip, we would see a roughly similar proportion of Deputies going with and against the party's wishes on this Bill and its contentious amendments.  We have this strange system that places a high premium on personality, because if one's policy vision is the same as that of the next man or woman and one is looking for what we call product differentiation, one is differentiating it on matters other than one's political ideas.<\/p><p>I would love to see fundamental reform of the entire Oireachtas.  Imperfect as the Seanad is, and we are speaking on section 1 of the Bill to abolish the Seanad, if the contention in section 1 were defeated and instead the reforms Senators Quinn, Zappone and I had suggested, and there are only nuanced differences among them, were included as part of a reform process, we would at least have one House of our national Parliament that was elected with a national focus.  It would be a less powerful House, it would not be one which could thwart the wishes of the other House under our Constitution, but it would still be nationally focused.  Instead, what we will have is one House that will be regionally focused, with no one with a national focus, and which will have a scrutineer function that will be taken from the imperfect quasi-democracy that is the electoral system of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and entrusted completely to a group who will be appointed by the Taoiseach.  Everything about section 1 is wrong, and that is the reason I believe it should be defeated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000053#BBB00600","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373477400,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I remind the Senator that section 1 is about the definition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000054#CCC00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1373477400,"counter":580,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000054#CCC00300","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1373477400,"counter":581,"content":"<p>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1373477400,"counter":582,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000054#CCC00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1373477400,"counter":583,"content":"<p>As the contributions are three times longer than the Second Stage contributions it is obvious we need more time.

We are making the case that the Bill commences with references to the abolition of one of the Houses of the national Parliament, before the matter has been put to a referendum.  I think arguments in defence of that House are valid arguments to make.  This is not part of my main speech, but I am on record as having said that the House, as currently constituted is an affront to democracy.  It is very difficult for me to make a case rejecting the abolition without saying this is not some crazy turkey voting against Christmas but is part of a more plausible strategy for Oireachtas reform.  We will not go there now.<\/p><p>Some of the implications or downstream effects, as we would say in biology, of a rapid unthoughtful insufficiently prepared abolition of the Seanad is that if the Seanad were to cease in a country which has traditionally poorly developed local government structures we would have a colossal lacunae in terms of public governance.  If it was decided that we were having a fundamental reform of the structures of governance with stronger local government, one could make an argument that if the power was devolved to regionally-based local governance, we would not need a second scrutinising Chamber because in truth much of what would happen would be scrutinising the activities of the local authorities anyway.  With great respect, there is no significant evidence of that kind of fundamental reform happening, reform that would delegate both authority and responsibility to the local governance.  We have seen a number of cosmetic changes in terms of numbers and structures but in terms of actually changing what they do, we have not seen much.<\/p><p>Again, I hope I am not expressing disrespect for those who have expressed this opinion but I do not believe our Taoiseach is some kind of incipient autocrat, a despot in waiting who is trying to systematically dismantle many of the organs of democracy in the country in an attempt to stage some kind of an oligarchic power grab.  I do not believe that at all.  The effect of taking away organs of democracy before other ones are developed is that there will be a de-democratisation of many aspects of public governance in this country.  It is bit like the old argument to ban cars from coming into the city, but why not build the public transport first.  We are saying that we will get rid of one problem but we will not actually set up the structures that will deal with.<\/p><p>The other issue that desperately needs to be dealt with is our committee system.  I sit on a committee and I am sure as I was as variable an attentive attender as the average parliamentarian but because of the way things are structured they are somewhat low impact.  If we were to have a fundamentally reformed system of central government and Parliament we would have to have in place a really good scrutinising committee system, a system which is accountable and comprised of elected officials.  Instead we are being told we will lose the quasi-democratic second Chamber.  In truth it is fashionable to decry its lack of democracy, and I have been a principal decrier but the vast majority of Members in the Seanad are voted by people who are themselves voted on the basis of popular franchise, one person one vote and an open voting system.  Our local authority representatives are I believe a valid, if surrogate, electorate to select the Members of one of the Chambers of our Parliaments but instead what we are going to have is a reformatting of the current parliamentarily weak committee system apparently with some kind of jury rigging add-on of unelected technocratic experts, who will be there to provide the technical scrutinising function which at present is conducted by Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We will lose the veneer of the surrogate democracy we have in the Seanad and replace it with something that is wholly technocratic.<\/p><p>With no disrespect to the Taoiseach, whom I mentioned to one of the many previous Ministers who was present when I was speaking today, I believe is one of the better persons to have served as Taoiseach and the best Taoiseach we have had for some time.  He has brought great honour to the office and I believe his instincts are democratic but in this case, I believe he is making a mistake.  In addition, his proposed model of Taoiseach and Government-appointed technocrats as the substitutes for the Seanad scrutiny function is flawed.  It is basically self-governance.  It is the same type of model that was felt to have failed in terms of the old structures of the Medical Council, which many believe currently fails in the other professional organisations.  This idea of self-policing and self-regulation is not a system that is in vogue right now.  There is a move away from that system in all types of areas of public governance.  For that reason I think the Taoiseach is making an error on this.<\/p> <p>Has that scrutinising function been successful?  Others who are more serious students of parliamentary history than I am can quote the numbers.  I have heard of the hundreds of amendments that were proposed, many of which were accepted and which strengthened legislation that arrived in this House.  In addition to that, we are not just scrutineers, we are initiators.  <\/p><p>People looking at the process of Parliament from the outside will ask whether a lot of what goes on will affect them.  Some of what has occurred in this House will affect people.  The human rights advocacy for gay people and other monitories in our society, which has long been espoused by Senator David Norris, is critically important.  This one-man dynamo of legislation, Senator Feargal Quinn, who is not here this evening, has brought his considerable professional and life experience to bear in very practical ways in a number of critically important pieces of legislation which, to be honest, people thinking of the big picture might forget - for example, having a label which tells one from where one's food actually came.  If it states: &quot;Made in Ireland&quot;, is it just packaged in an Irish sausage casing but has come from somewhere else?  This is important.<\/p><p>If Senator Feargal Quinn's defibrillator legislation is passed, people will be alive at the next general election who would not be alive if that legislation had not been initiated in and enacted by this House, and I speak with some authority on this.  I know many patients whose lives were saved by defibrillators and many people whose lives were saved by rapid extra hospital resuscitation.  It is important to acknowledge that.<\/p><p>In a small way, the Bill which Senators Mark Daly, Jillian van Turnhout and I have advanced to ban smoking in cars with children has already had an impact, even though I regret to say, parenthetically, it is lost some place in the bureaucracy.  If Seanad &Eacute;ireann is abolished, as recommended in section 1 of the Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution (Abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann) Bill 2013 which we are debating, any impetus which we would have to see that Bill come to fruition would disappear because I think it is low down in terms of legislative priorities.  <\/p><p>Parenthetically, I should also add that I am a great admirer of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and I strongly support his efforts to fundamentally reform our health system.  I am particularly happy that we have a man of his strength and courage who is now starting the flex the muscles against the tobacco industry, a battle to which, in truth, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice and Equality dealt a blow when they rather inappropriately met the tobacco industry a while ago.  <\/p><p>In the current D&aacute;il structure, despite having a good Minister like the Minister for Health, one piece of legislation has gone through in the smoking control area but that Bill makes it easier for the tobacco companies.  The Minister advanced that Bill through gritted teeth and in the face of great personal opposition because he was forced and mandated to do so by diktats which came from the European Court of Justice and the EU competition authorities.  The reality, as of July 2013, is that this Government which set itself out as a campaigning Government to tighten the noose on tobacco legislation following on the leadership Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin showed in a previous Government, has not succeeded in doing that.  The one Bill which is going through and which would tighten the noose is our smoking in cars Bill which would be lost if the Seanad did not exist.<\/p><p>Has the mere fact the Seanad started a debate on that issue succeeded in putting it on the public interest agenda?  I think it has.  We outlined in this House and in various media the extraordinary level of harm which could accrue to children if incarcerated in a car with a smoking adult, something which people were not aware of.  I think it has already caused a behavioural change.  I always said the purpose of that Bill was not to fill prisons but primarily educational and I believe it probably has had that educational role.<\/p><p>Similarly, as an epiphenomenon related to Senator Feargal Quinn's wonderful defibrillator Bill, the debate about whether we should charge VAT on defibrillators has been reignited.  I believe we had a role in accelerating the process of the legislation on the regulation of sunbeds.  There were 400 cases of malignant melanoma in 2008 and 995 cases in 2010.  Sadly, one pretty much assumes that the proportion of those which are fatal is approximately one quarter of cases.  If that proportion stays constant, the absolute number of patients who will find themselves battling potentially fatal melanoma will have gone up.  Again, taking the VAT off sunblock products and regulating the sunbed industry was suggested in this House, as was increasing the number of dermatologists.  I do not mean to blow my own trumpet here but one message which I have got onto the public agenda because of my debates here and at the committee is the extraordinary shortage of specialists per head of population.  It is just bizarre and bears no resemblance to any other country in the OECD, with the exception of the UK which is the second worst.  If one has a spot on one's skin which might be melanoma - maybe one is one of the 950 people who get it - one could be waiting months for an appointment here.  This issue was brought up in this House and has the effect of changing the public agenda.  <\/p><p>Some other things could be lost if we go ahead and approve this Bill, including the contribution which has been made historically by other great Senators.  The reasons for the success of peace in troubled Northern Ireland are complex.  It is a success which, understandably, has many fathers but I have no doubt that some of the more directly responsible fathers were the bridge builders, some of whom sat in this House.<\/p><p>I am not demeaning the role of any of the others who were involved at the front line of the conflict and who adopted the path of peace, for which I salute them.  However, there were others who were in this House and who were never particularly involved in the war in the first place but who, at a time when it was not particularly fashionable, were trying to preach the gospel of reconciliation and compromise.  One incredibly wonderful man in this regard was the late Senator Gordon Wilson.  My family knew his family in north Leitrim for many generations and I had the privilege of associating with some of his children when I was younger.  What a phenomenal contribution he made and what a phenomenal message it was when he was appointed as the bereaved father of a Northern Ireland Protestant girl, a beautiful young nurse, who lost her life in a terrible episode in Northern Ireland.  She had not even been put in her coffin when he pleaded for reconciliation and no revenge but he then incurred the wrath of his own community by accepting a seat in the Seanad.  His record of reconciliation is one to which we can only aspire to.  The list is endless.<\/p><p>The criticism is often made that Seanad &Eacute;ireann is the incubator or retirement home for people at either ends of their careers, and I am sorry to use the cliche because everybody hears it and it upsets Members with D&aacute;il ambitions.  Incubators are sometimes a good thing.  We have a lot of healthy babies which needed to be incubated.  The reality is that many fine and very worthwhile political careers in the D&aacute;il, in government and in the Taoiseach's office were launched by people who wet their feet and cut their teeth in this House.  Maybe some part of it is a prep school, a finishing school or an educational process.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000056#FFF02500","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373478900,"counter":664,"content":"<p>Retirement homes are great as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000057#GGG00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1373478900,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I will reserve my comments on the other sections until later and will stick to section 1 for the moment.

There is precedence for this kind of very confusing technical referendum occurring.  It occurred in 2002, which is one of the referendums whose consequences we are currently grappling with in terms of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.<\/p><p>I looked in from the outside and put in writing that the Seanad should be abolished or reformed.  I still believe that but I would prefer to reform it.  As somebody who is in here and sees the dysfunctions of the two Houses, I see an extraordinary argument for launching a process of parliamentary reform which would involve, in effect, writing a new constitution.  I do not think there is a shortcut around this.  We do not have a good mechanism for doing that in Ireland because our current Constitution cleverly keeps unto the Taoiseach and the Government the sole right to introduce amending provisions for the Constitution.<\/p><p>There does not seem to be a shortcut other than democratically seizing power and advancing a new constitution in a very radical format.  We can, within the existing Constitution, examine the two Houses we have.  We have it within our gift to advance meaningful reform of the House which would give us, instead of the de-democratised, single chamber parliament we would have operating in a lacuna with no strong committee system, fewer checks and balances and without local government, one nationally focused house which would still, because of its constitutional mandate and limitations, be a reflective scrutinising chamber which could not thwart the wishes of the more powerful D&aacute;il but which could act the nidus for more fundamental reform.<\/p><p>I do not want to make personal comments.  Most Ministers, given the system we have, do a very good job.  In truth, as I have said before, the reality is that we do not have a particularly good system for picking Ministers.  We have a particular pool of available people which may contain people who are talented, skilled and have skill sets which can match various Departments, but it also contains those who may not.<\/p><p>I understand populism when people say things such as our first reform should be to abolish the Seanad and our second reform should be to shrink the D&aacute;il.  That would create a lacuna.  If one shrinks the D&aacute;il before one changes the way one appoints Ministers, I am not being pejorative when I say we will have an even shallower talent pool from which to pick Ministers.  We will have a smaller number of people from which to pick critical and, in some cases, highly technical ministerial appointments.  Poor Descartes must be turning in his grave.<\/p><p>We have a need for a shopping list of mandatory constitutional reforms.  It as if a mother has taken a basket with a screaming child through a supermarket, has ignored milk, meat and potatoes and nappies and has instead gone straight for the sweets at the checkout, bought them first and worried about the rest later.  It is a simple and populist option which gives the illusion of reforming zeal and momentum to the process of parliamentary reform without grappling with the core issues which need to be fixed.<\/p><p>In 2007 and 2008, when critical decisions could have been made, but were not, which might have ameliorated the worst aspects of the economic collapse, the fault was not with Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  To do an analogy to death, the Seanad was asleep at the tiller but was guilty of sins of omission rather than commission.  It was the D&aacute;il which ratified the Ministers who made the decisions.<\/p><p>Even though we have now had a change of Government, a similar process is in place as well as policies which are very similar to those of the post-meltdown policies advanced by Fianna F&aacute;il.  There was broad consensus between the two parties as to the mid-course corrective actions which needed to be taken.  I am sure my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues will resonate with that, but there is not that much difference between what they said after the terrible mistakes they made in the post-meltdown process and what the incoming Government did.<\/p><p>Imagine if instead we had a Government which included some economists - I will not mention names because they are broadly divided - and people who really understood banking.  People who knew about banking and looked at it from the outside have been documented as saying there was a real problem, even though they did not predict the last recession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000058#HHH00800","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1373479500,"counter":674,"content":"<p>Kevin Cardiff, for instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000058#HHH00900","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1373479500,"counter":675,"content":"<p>None of these people works in influential positions or is sitting around the Cabinet table.  As a result of the quirks of our Constitution and 43 local elections which determine who will make the major macroeconomic decisions for the country, we had a group of people who were, without being critical, heavily personally incentivised not to break bad news.  They did not want to be the ones who would say there would be a problem.  They did not want to tell people who suddenly felt rich because the three bedroom houses they had owned for years were suddenly worth multiples of hundreds of thousands of euro, who believed that because of some fundamental rewriting of the laws of economics, they had changed into wealthy people, even though they were still doing the same meaningful, skilled jobs and working as hard as they always were, that there was a problem.  Salaries were no bigger and people still did what they did before, but they felt richer.  It is very difficult for a politician focused on local electoral issues to say he or she is sorry to have to tell people that there is a shell game going on, people have been scammed and we need to change things.  Maybe if we had a different system of selecting Deputies and Ministers we might have had a better way of dealing with such a situation.<\/p><p>I have a day job and I like to think I am perhaps what the framers of the Constitution had in mind.<\/p> <p>They wanted to bring in people who on the one hand, understood that there were more politically sophisticated people who were full-time politicians and made the big decisions while they, on the other hand, could bring a different perspective on some of the decisions made and offer different skills.  I like to think I have done that in my little area.  I know for a fact that this man sitting on my right has done it in a colossal way in economics and I believe he has been an educational resource for Members of both Houses.  One must then ask how Senator Barrett would have functioned with the current Whip system.  There a few people in the dominant party of Government who, although they might not have been economists with PhDs, had strongly dissenting views on some issues, particularly those related to banking, and it would appear that they were whipped into submission.  We had the strange situation of one Deputy who, at his own committee, spoke one way and voted another because his expertise and heart told him one thing and his Whip told him to do the other.  One of my colleagues has just informed me that the home of Irish horse racing - <i>horseracing.ie<\/i>- has stated that there are numerical limits relating to the number of times the whip can be used in a race.  It can be used seven times in a flat face and eight times in a jumps race.  Whoever is in charge of Deputy Mathews would have been disqualified and a steward's inquiry would have been held within about three days of the initiation of the first meeting of the current D&aacute;il.  <\/p><p> Sadly, the Whip system works in here.  I know this for a fact because I have become very friendly with many of my colleagues on both sides of the House.  In many cases, they have sincere, well-thought out and well-informed positions which are at complete variance with those of their party and as a result, are whipped into submission.  Again, I do not wish to personalise this.  I have huge personal and professional regard for the extraordinary, methodical and forensic scrutiny of Bills, particularly health Bills, by Senator Colm Burke in this House.  To see him advance a really important Bill addressing a technical niche that had been neglected in the programmes for Government of successive governments and be defeated by his own Government was instructive.  It tells us something about where reforms really need to take place.  <\/p><p> What was that great line during the week?  One should always use the words &quot;in conclusion&quot; multiple times in a speech because it gives one's audience hope.  In summary, I am a complete reformer.  I believe the arguments advanced for defending this House as it is currently constituted as a critical bulwark of democracy are not very strong.  The principal arguments are those relating to what it could be and the opportunity cost of losing something that we cannot easily get back in a reformed format.  I mentioned it to the Minister of State's colleagues who were here before.  To most of us who have looked at this, it is simply and deeply offensive that this was never considered for discussion at the Constitutional Convention.  What could be a more fundamental constitutional question for a democracy than the structure of its national parliament?  Most of us have had the privilege of visiting the convention on a number of occasions.  I found it to be a very rewarding experience and a wonderful way of engaging with and hearing the opinions of our citizenry - not just some elected elite of our citizenry but real citizens, many of whom were no more involved or interested in or knowledgeable about politics than the average citizen.  What a wonderful idea it would have been if they had been given the opportunity to discuss the actual structure of their national Parliament.  I am sorry if I am being repetitive.  Both the Cathaoirleach and Minister of State were not here when I said it earlier.  The fact that the convention discussed whether the President, which is a largely ceremonial office although potentially constitutionally crucial given the right circumstances, would have a five-year rather than a seven-year term but it was not considered valid to discuss the entire structure of our Parliament is very regrettable.  <\/p><p> Our considered opposition to section 1 of the Bill relates to the heart of the matter which is that, without invoking any dictatorial autocracy, it comes across as being arrogant.  There was no constituency pushing for this.  There was a certain constituency pushing for retention and a larger constituency for reform.  The reform constituency prominently included our Taoiseach.  He was one of those who at a summer school articulated very fine ideas about what the Seanad could do in a reformed structure.  Apparently without any particular consultation and in a country with colossal economic problems caused by people, politicians and the political system we had, he did not decide as his first constitutional priority to ask what we could do to prevent those set of circumstances occurring again by possibly giving us a different level of expertise in Government.  Instead, he decided that we will do it because it is a waste of money when the Minister most directly responsible for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Howlin, told us while sitting in the chair in which the Minister of State now sits that it will save no money and that the money will be redeployed to less democratic D&aacute;il committees buttressed by technocratic appointees who will become the non-accountable scrutineers of legislation, supplanting the role of our surrogate democracy, which is the Seanad.  <\/p><p> On that, I must freely admit that I am spent.  I urge the Minister of State to take our message on board and consider that this rushed, unthoughtful, pointless, non-money-saving, misleading and misleadingly blameful initiative to abolish the Seanad without giving our people any chance to discuss its reform should be reconsidered in good faith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000058#HHH01000","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373480100,"counter":677,"content":"<p>Senator Crown's contribution made a number of very valid points.

It may not accept the amendments and may need to tidy up technical amendments but the overall thrust of the amendments has influenced legislation significantly.  It may not be overtly done but it is covertly done.  Legislation that has passed through the Houses in the past couple of years has been enriched and enhanced as a result of the contributions of all Senators but particularly Senator Barrett in the whole area of economics.  Had more of his amendments been accepted, it is possible that legislation would be even more enhanced and enriched, specifically the Taxi Regulation Bill which passed through recently.  I was present for much of the deliberations on that legislation which was insightful and informed Members who may not be up to speed on that issue of a new way of doing business.  I tabled a motion which was unanimously accepted by the House in the area of restorative justice.

As I was saying before the quorum bell, the restorative justice community was happy with the Seanad, in particular.  Certainly it has raised the profile of the Seanad for the many people who are promoting and supporting restorative justice.  Restorative justice has worked extremely well in Northern Ireland and there are other examples in New Zealand and parts of Germany, while in Canada there is a significant advancement in the whole area.  I have always felt that Ireland has proved itself as a country in terms of, for example, the smoking ban, where we led the way in Europe and I think we can lead the way in Europe with a whole new way of dealing with the victims and the perpetrators of crime.  Certainly, the Seanad opened up the debate in that area.<\/p><p>There are many issues in the area of disability that need to be dealt with, for example, Irish sign language.  In the next term I intend to be prominent in pushing the issue whether through a Private Members' motion or Private Members' legislation to get recognition for Irish sign language.  People who come from minority backgrounds, whether they are people with disabilities or from other communities, have a role to support in the Seanad to ensure minorities have a voice.  In the past the Seanad has successfully provided a voice for many minorities.  We have seen the work Senator Norris has done in legislating for the area of homosexuality along with many other very useful contributions.  <\/p><p>When the people get their say and reflect on the decision they have to make they will, I think, vote to retain the Seanad.

I will elaborate further on this point.  I listed the various Bills that I, while a Minister of State, debated in the Seanad to show that the Seanad was productive.  On 28 April 1988, I was in this Chamber when the late Nuala Fennell, a wonderful Deputy and Senator, moved amendment No. 14 to the Adoption (No. 2) Bill 1987 on Committee Stage (Resumed).  It read: &quot;In page 6, line 31, to delete &quot;illegitimate&quot; and substitute &quot;a child whose parents were not married to each other or an orphan.&quot;.&quot;  She went on to state:<blockquote><br \/>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  In making this request I am conscious of the fact that this is not something to do with money.  It has nothing to do with legal costs.  It should be an extremely easy thing to do.<\/blockquote>The amendment was supported by Mary Robinson, former Senator and former President, who stated:<blockquote>I am in favour of the removal of a concept which we have determined should not form part of our law relating to children any more; to substitute a formulation, either exactly as in Senator Fennell's proposed amendment, or one which represents the sense she has put forward, that it is a child not of a marriage who would be eligible for adoption under the first part of the proposed amendment of section 10 of the 1952 Act.<\/blockquote>This was a good point.  As the then Minister of State for health, I replied: &quot;I propose to accept this amendment.  In fact I intend to go further, to delete section 6 altogether.&quot;  That debate showed the House's influence at the time.  I did not need to refer the matter to the Cabinet.  Sometimes, we feel that the Ministers of State who enter the Chamber have had no powers delegated to them.  I had those powers and I used them.<\/p><p>  People might not have realised that I used to attend the Chamber as a Minister of State where I debated with Mary Robinson and Nuala Fennell and accepted their reasonable point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000061#LLL01000","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1373481300,"counter":698,"content":"<p>Is the Senator on section 1?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000061#LLL01100","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1373481300,"counter":699,"content":"<p>Yes.

It states:<blockquote>In broad terms, our recommendations involve new ways to choose Senators that involve the public much more closely, combined with significant changes to the Seanad's functions.  We believe that these changes will give a much greater public legitimacy to the Seanad while ensuring that its composition differs from that of the D&aacute;il.  In addition, we feel that it will enhance the prospects of people with particular valued expertise being able to make a contribution to the work of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The significant changes to the functions of Seanad &Eacute;ireann that we have recommended involve the definition of a new role for the House in the areas of legislative consultation, EU affairs, social partnership, North\/South Implementation Bodies, and the scrutiny of public appointments.  In making these recommendations, we have sought to define a new division of labour between the two Houses of the Oireachtas and to identify important jobs that currently fall between the cracks in our political parliamentary system.  We acknowledge that this report will have considerable political implications.  Difficult decisions will have to be taken involving sensitive political matters.  But if progress is to be made, we believe that there is an urgent need to accept the political reality that Seanad &Eacute;ireann really must be reformed if it is to make a viable and distinctive contribution to the economic, social and political affairs of our country.  We feel strongly that the recommendations in this report provide the framework for doing this in a reasonable and balanced way.  They offer a new start, and a new sense of purpose to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We are confident that, when implemented, they will empower the Seanad to make a major contribution to meeting the challenges facing twenty-first century Ireland.<\/blockquote>  It is signed by Senator Mary O'Rourke, Chairperson and Leader of the Seanad; Senator Brian Hayes, Leader of the Fine Gael group; Senator John Dardis, Deputy Leader of the Seanad and a member of the Progressive Democrats; and Senator Joe O'Toole, co-ordinator of the Independent Group.<\/p><p>  That is an extremely good document which should be read and could provide a framework for reform.  If this referendum is defeated, the Government should consider putting this document in the form of legislation.  This excellent document should have been implemented but unfortunately at the time - that is, from 2004 to 2007, close enough to the general election - we did not get results from the Minister of the day.  It then went to the next stage when Mary O'Rourke was elected to the D&aacute;il and so was Deputy Brian Hayes.  Joe O'Toole and John Dardis were both returned to the Seanad but were not in a position to push this forward.  <\/p><p>  The period from 2007 to 2011 saw the economic collapse.

Those who have been calling for its abolition will then be silenced.  The referendum is a type of stress test.  If the people opt to retain the Seanad because they believe it serves a purpose, it will require more powers.  When speaking recently at a conference with a Dutch MP who had read about the proposed referendum on abolition of the Seanad, he told me that the Senate in Holland has powers and that the Dutch Parliament is generally afraid of it in terms of getting legislation through.  Even though it meets for only four or five days a month, it has a great deal more power than Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>When the Seanad was reconstructed in 1937 by &Eacute;amon de Valera, it should have been given more teeth.  Subsequent Governments retained it as is because it suited democracy at the time.  The public, in voting for retention of the Seanad, may require that it be given more powers, which will give them more say than they currently have, and that it take cognisance of public opinion on particular issues such as those currently being discussed.  Often, the Seanad serves only as a rubber stamp on legislation already discussed in the Lower House.  The banks now have to be more careful when lending money because there will be consequences if people cannot repay.  It is important that if the Lower House passes legislation, the public can, through this House, put pressure on Government to amend it.  While many good Bills have gone through the Seanad and to which many amendments were tabled, regardless of what the Seanad does, it cannot prevent legislation being enacted.<\/p><p>The Senate in Australia has immense powers.  It runs more or less two-track with the Parliament.  It is a system on which I would like the Seanad to be modelled.  The thinking in Government circles is that there is no point to having two Houses within one democracy.  We need a second opinion on this issue.  There have been many militant Labour Governments in the UK but none of them has abolished the Lords system, which when compared with the Seanad is totally undemocratic.  While the Lords system was pared down by the Labour Party, it remains an appointed body that is respected by the English public.  I have not heard much talk in the UK about abolishing the House of Lords for any reason, financial or democratic.  Where there is democracy, this must be questioned.  The House of Lords is an important part of the English system.  People generally look to it for the real opinion on matters of law.  The former MP, John Prescott, is a member of the House of Lords.  Many of the people who have been through that system use that experience when offering an opinion on legislation.<\/p><p>It is constantly said that the Seanad is a retirement home for some politicians and a waiting home for those wishing to get elected to the D&aacute;il.  Those who retire from the Lower House and are then elected to this House bring great experience with them.  They are often not under the extreme pressure they were under when they were a Deputy, and they can pick a particular subject or area on which they can concentrate.  The public will decide in October what type of Seanad or second Chamber is required in this country and will be of benefit not only to political parties but to the people.  I do not fully support the current structure of the Seanad.  I believe all Members would be happy if the Whip was loosened.  While many Members on the Government side support some of the proposals put forward by the Opposition side, they are unable to support them because of the Whip system.<\/p><p>Turnout for the 1979 referendum was below 29%.  I imagine turnout this time round will be about the same.  This means only 25% to 35% of the population will engage on the issue.  Most people in this country do not really care about the Seanad.  Those who are talking about it are political parties and pressure groups.  People in legal circles appear to want a more elite Seanad than currently exists.  I resent the statement that Members of a reformed Seanad should be paid &euro;10,000 per annum.  This might suit retired professionals with money, but people from Sligo, Cavan, Cork and so on cannot afford to take on membership of the Seanad as a hobby.  It might be a nice pastime for wealthy people.  In my view, it would be a glorified Law Library.  That is not what the public wants.<\/p><p>I ask that when the people make their decision, they do so based on their needs, including more influence over what is going on in the country at this time.  While many U-turns are made for good reasons, this could in future be done by the Seanad in terms of taking the Government out of a hole.  Ministers are often castigated for making U-turns.  If the threat came from this House that issues would not be agreed, this would begin in the Lower House.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, will agree that not all legislation that goes through the Lower House is perfect.  If the Seanad is abolished, there will be greater onus on the Lower House to scrutinise legislation.  I do not believe a Minister or Minister of State has the time or foresight to do this because of the frequent urgency of getting legislation through.<\/p><p>The public will decide whether the Seanad is to be retained.  All Governments are guilty of not reforming the Seanad.  While the 1979 referendum was passed by the people, the then Government said the decision was irrelevant and gave the two fingers to the people.  If this referendum is passed, the Government will be quick to implement its decision.  The 1979 referendum was just as important as the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad, but both results will be treated differently.  I ask that the Minister of State consider this and offer his view on the reason the 1979 referendum decision has never been implemented.  Is it possible to implement it at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000065#PPP00500","speaker":"1144"},{"type":"speech","time":1373483700,"counter":844,"content":"<p>I call Senator MacSharry and remind him that we are on section 1, which deals with the abolition date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000065#PPP00600","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1373483700,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to the House and thank him for the amount of time he has been present in the House for this debate.

However, it is a fact that Ministers take the view that they can simply give the legislation to the Chief Whip to get it over the line and they do not care about the views of parliamentarians.  We all sit in the House whistling &ldquo;Dixie&rdquo; out the window giving our views on whatever the legislation is.  By the admission of the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, he wanted to explain to us what the legislation means.  I can speak English.  Thankfully, I can read legislation.  With a mere 11 years' experience in these Houses I have a view on the legislation before us without recourse to the help or assistance of whatever Minister is in the House.  While I fully appreciate that we are on the all-important issue of the abolition day, if we are to accurately consider these issues, we must do it in a way by starting at the beginning.<\/p><p>I was doing a radio interview during the week with the Fine Gael director of elections who was promoting the abolition of the Seanad.  It was on Highland Radio in Donegal.  Unless people are from Donegal they would not have heard it.  I gather it was broadcast midweek, but since Senator Harte was here on Thursday he probably did not hear it either.  I asked the Minister whether he could tell me how many times the Government amended legislation in the Seanad last year.  He said that it was far too easy for Senator MacSharry to be asking quiz show questions in such an interview.  The interviewer put it to the Minister that he did not know.  I told him, but I said another thing as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000067#RRR01300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1373484900,"counter":904,"content":"<p>Too often.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000067#RRR01400","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1373484900,"counter":905,"content":"<p>I put it to the Minister that I would make it easy for him and I asked him how many times he, as a Minister, amended legislation in the Seanad last year.

It is interesting to note that in 1978, the number of Bills initiated in this House was as low as 6%.  We then had the 1979 amendment to the Constitution which no Government has bothered to implement by law.  By 1988, some 9% of all legislation was initiated here, and by 1998, it was 24%.  It was 23% in 1999, the same in 2000, 19% in 2001, 33% in 2002, 45% in 2003, 41% in 2004, 34% in 2005, 31% in 2006, 33% in 2007, 31% in 2008, and it has been somewhat higher than that in the past two years.  The figure for amendments last year was 1,500, a figure the Minister of State did not know.  He has used this House to make improvements to his Department's legislation on one occasion.  He did not know that, but why would he want to know that when he is trying to direct the abolition of one third of the Oireachtas?  At a minimum he will get a better briefing before the next interview on wiping out one third of the Oireachtas.  In 1999, 130 amendments were made in the House; in 2008 it was 1,199; in 2007 it was 764; in 2006 it was 946; in 2005 it was 1,547; and in 2004 it was 1,861.<\/p><p>We wonder how soon the abolition day might come.  The Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and some others, who have been talking on the issue, have mentioned how we are going to have such an enhanced local government system that there will be no need for the kinds of checks and balances the Seanad would provide.  They point to many northern European countries with no second House but good local government.  That is an incomparable situation.  The level of devolved powers in northern European countries is completely different from that in local authorities here.  This is in a year when we are digging up the pitch further in terms of local democracy with the abolition of town councils and making county councils in certain areas exceptionally small.  We are telling the people in the north west, for example, that a county such as Sligo, with a population of 65,000 and the ninth largest urban centre in the country with 22,000 people can make do with 18 councillors.  However, a few miles down the road, County Leitrim with a population of 33,000 people will also have 18 councillors.<\/p><p>There is insufficient joined-up thinking.  We are using enhanced local government as a defence for the abolition of the Seanad.  As I have always said, someone wanting true power, who is not one of the very few who gets to be Taoiseach or a Minister having the benefit of using two tools in Parliament - the D&aacute;il and Seanad - and who cannot make it to become Secretary General of a Department, should become a county manager.  As anyone who has served on a local authority knows, the county managers are the people who are in complete command of local authorities.  Having vandalised the local authorities, the Government is now proceeding to vandalise the Constitution and the Oireachtas by getting rid of one third of it.<\/p><p>No Member of this or any previous Seanad, even those who are Ministers and Government Deputies, although they might not like to say it in public, would not be avid enthusiasts for and promoters of not only Seanad reform but radical Seanad reform.  Senator Leyden spoke about the many reports over the years - I believe there have been 12 - most notably the report by Mrs. Mary O'Rourke's group to which the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, contributed.  Many of us made submissions to that group and the report had a broad welcome across the board.  It was on the programme for Government in 2007 but it seemed to disappear and the wheels came off the economy subsequently.<\/p><p>Then there was the rush of blood to the head in October 2008 in Citywest preparing for the Fine Gael presidential dinner.  As Senator Norris said earlier, we then saw the greatest example of a jaw drop from the then leader of the Fine Gael group in the Seanad, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, when to her shock the leader of Fine Gael and now Taoiseach proposed abolishing the Seanad.  In this game I can fully understand anyone playing the ball and I can even understand people playing the man, but why we must go and dig up the pitch is beyond me.<\/p><p>A Member on the Government side mentioned earlier today it is not the fault of any Senator that reform has not taken place over the years.  However, blame lies almost exclusively with the Taoiseach of the day.  Whether that was Se&aacute;n Lemass, Eamon de Valera, Jack Lynch, Charles Haughey, Garret FitzGerald, John Bruton or the present Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, it is fundamentally wrong.  Sadly, it is at a time when there is public apathy with politics because they see in reality we are living in a functional dictatorship with three or four people are in absolute command.  The Whips impose and people vote through legislation.  Regardless of whether it is on abortion, banks, social welfare or capital expenditure, that is the way it is.  I know how it operates - I sat in the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party room shouting my head off for ten years only to get nowhere.  Fine Gael Members are up in the same room now and they probably go in one after another asking Ministers and the Taoiseach to get certain things, but the reply is: &quot;No, you won't.  We're doing this and get in there and support it.  If you don't like it, there's a queue outside the gate looking to take your place.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000068#SSS01200","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1373485500,"counter":918,"content":"<p>We are on section 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000068#SSS01300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1373485500,"counter":919,"content":"<p>We are on section 1, which is a very important section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000068#SSS01400","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1373485500,"counter":920,"content":"<p>However, the Senator is not on section 1.

I think of people in other countries who were striving for civil liberties and went for a particular choice but ended up with something so much worse.  It is inappropriate simply to put the question and capitalise on the level of public apathy for politics that exists at the moment.  I believe if the question of abolishing the D&aacute;il were put to the people, there would be a risk that people would abolish the D&aacute;il.  If they were asked to abolish the Judiciary and replace it with something else, it is conceivable that people would consider such an issue.<\/p> <p>However, the Taoiseach wants to abolish it.  Everybody in these Houses knows that, including most of the journalistic crew, many of whom would be happy to see the end of the Seanad.  As we can see from the overloaded Visitors Gallery, the level of interest in this House has been non-existent but they conveniently bury that by saying that if the Seanad did anything useful, they would cover it.  I do not know any Senator who is on the editorial team in RTE, Independent Newspapers or any of the other news agencies around the country.  In fairness, local radio stations and the local media are very good in that regard because they tend to cover the politicians from the various counties but the national media does not cover it, and that has been one of the problems.<\/p><p>In its relatively flawed state in terms of its election system, most of us might like to see universal franchise, the scrutiny of public appointments and proposed European Union directives, and the opportunities afforded us under Lisbon II but we will not be given that option.  The question will be simply &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to its abolition, and it is a risky one.  We must be careful what we wish for.  The election was bought on a manifesto of promises and the only one the Government is prepared to carry through is the abolition of the Seanad - the vandalisation of the Constitution - without giving people an option or asking if they want it abolished or reformed.  If it asked that question and the answer was that it should be reformed, by all means it should be given to a body such as the Constitutional Convention, which deals with Mickey Mouse issues compared to what it is capable of considering, to examine the most appropriate reform.  I would suggest considering the Mary O'Rourke document, the debate on which all of us, including the Minister, participated in.  I regret I do not have the submissions before me because I wanted to read the submission of the former Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael, John Bruton, into the record of the House, which would be useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000068#SSS01600","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373486100,"counter":923,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000069#TTT00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1373486100,"counter":924,"content":"<p>To take up from where Senator Leyden concluded, it is important that we would examine some of the suggestions in that document as a way forward, which are important if we are to consider any aspect of this legislation, and no better place to put it on the record than when dealing with section 1 because if we are to consider the abolition date, we must consider also all the options available for reform.

If this legislation is passed as a result of the Government majority, and the people running the whole show I spoke about earlier succeed, this question will be put to the people and if the people vote to abolish the Seanad, Irish society will spend 50 years trying to replace it, and it will not be able to get agreement on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000069#TTT03200","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1373486100,"counter":954,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000069#TTT03300","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1373486100,"counter":955,"content":"<p>The Minister of State can wince all he likes but I know that the day he saw the Schedule and was told he was taking this Bill in the Seanad, he said, \"Oh my God, what did I ever do to the Taoiseach that he is sending me here for this debate?\".

A cost of &euro;24 million is bandied around recklessly by Ministers.  The truth is completely different.  I have a document which refers to the cost of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which I am sure has some bearing on the abolition day.  I went back through this because I thought it was important to do so.  The salary for a Senator is at present approximately &euro;65,000. The figures in the document date back to 2009 when the average figure for a Senator's salaries, allowances and expenses was &euro;119,000.  The total for Senators' pay was &euro;4.5 million.  At the time salaries for senior Members or longer-serving Members was as high as &euro;78,000.  The total for Senators' staff was &euro;2.4 million.  In total, between salaries and allowances the cost in 2009, when such figures were much higher, was &euro;6.9 million.  That is all.  We hear a figure of &euro;24 million being bandied around.  During the radio interview, when the Minister, Deputy Bruton could not remember what he had done in the Seanad himself although he is director of elections for its abolition, he got a little ratty with me and stated it is rigged and the Government is guaranteed to win all time.  That is wrong.  I suggested he might abolish the Whip for a month and see how it would operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000070#UUU00500","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1373486700,"counter":985,"content":"<p>Or abolish the D&aacute;il where the Government has a bigger majority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000070#UUU00600","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1373486700,"counter":986,"content":"<p>If there was to be reform I would like to see this done.  I would like there to be no Whip and for the House to deal with EU scrutiny and ratifying public appointments.  Not one Bill would need to be passed for this and it would cost nothing.  However we cannot have this because senior civil servants would not like it and neither would Ministers.<\/p><p>I spoke about an axis of collusion earlier and I stated a number of them exist.  There is one between the banks, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance and there is another between the Secretary General of each Department and their counterparts in the relevant section of the European Commission.  They tell the Ministers what suits them and Ministers are compelled to act accordingly.  Perhaps they do so willingly in some instances.  The House always wins.  From Government to Government from the 1970s through to today, whether they were Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael in single party or coalition governments of various parties what were the real policy differences?  What was the fundamental game-changer from one government to the next?  The answer is nothing.  The Government is following the banking policy of the previous Government.  In fairness it has watered down the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and I must give it that.  We are mere pawns and tools in the game whereby the senior outfits decide what happens, the Whips are sent down and the fear factor dictates what happens.  With regard to costs we can see it is pure mythology to speak about &euro;24 million or &euro;25 million.<\/p><p>In the Seanad over the years various amendments have been made and Private Members' Bills have been introduced, some of which were accepted by the Government of the day but most were not because it was not the Government's idea and governments do not like to give kudos to opposition parties for anything.  Occasionally the Independents get their Private Members' business through but in the main they do not.  These issues are rarely covered by the media.  In fairness, Senator Norris, and other high profile people in civil society who happened to be Senators such as Joe O'Toole and Shane Ross, receive media coverage arguably because of their stature outside the House.  They have made exceptional contributions here also but they have received media coverage as a result of their outside contributions.  The rest of us do not.  We are swept aside, and if it were not for an intemperate outburst by either myself or Senator Leyden we would not make it into the media.<\/p><p>Sadly, this is what will inform the decision to be made by the public, assuming the legislation is passed.  This is what will happen.  People will judge the House on what colour writers such as Lise Hand and Miriam Lord write about intemperate outbursts, which are a tiny percentage of the actual work done on the scrutiny of legislation.  Even in its flawed state, if the public was truly informed about what goes on in here I believe it would have much more confidence in the political system.  That said, of course it needs reform but it does not need the political will of a single Senator to have it reformed although all Senators past and present have the will to engage in reform.<\/p><p>Ministers hate coming to the Seanad which is why so many Ministers of State, with respect-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000070#UUU00700","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1373486700,"counter":987,"content":"<p>I come in here often.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000070#UUU00800","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373486700,"counter":988,"content":"<p>-----are sent here.  I acknowledge several Ministers, such as Deputies James Reilly and Alan Shatter, always come themselves to the greatest possible extent.  Arguably they are among the busiest Ministers and it goes to show that if one wants something done one should give it to a busy person.  I thank those Ministers for coming but they do not enjoy coming here because it holds up the legislative process.  If we put ourselves in the position of a Secretary General we can imagine he or she would not want to go to the Seanad to listen to another six hours of debate and would rather have the legislation guillotined.  This makes sense to them and they believe they are right.<\/p><p>I dread to think what will happen the country if there is no reformed Seanad.  If any members of the media are covering this debate let the message go out loud and clear that none of us want an unreformed Seanad.  As for the cost, &euro;6.9 million is a lot of money but salaries for the Houses of the Oireachtas and expenses should be set by an independent external body which has nothing to do with any Members of the Houses, and probably should be benchmarked against international parliaments of countries of similar size and not businesses or entrepreneurial salaries.<\/p><p>The Seanad has had some big legislative successes over the years, such as with regard to equality legislation in the early 1990s, and there have been many examples since.  The NAMA legislation was amended by the Seanad.  The Seanad debated the legislation for 70 hours and could have spent another 70 hours trying to get it right.  It is delinquent in the extreme as a political gimmick to effectively vandalise the Constitution.  Real leadership is about having the courage to take on the vested interests and reform.  No Taoiseach from any party has had the courage to do this and this one clearly does not either.<\/p> <p>That is sad, although not for any of us.  If it added credibility to a new Seanad, I would have no difficulty agreeing this second not to be a part of any future Seanad, not to run for it or whatever.  However, as a tool for the people rather than one for the Cabinet of the day, the Seanad could be very useful if reformed.  Before we throw the baby out with the bath water, we should attempt to implement some of the great reforms.  There is the Mary O'Rourke document from the early 2000s and there are others.  I would support a referendum if the choice was abolition or reform.  If reform was chosen, which I believe it would be, the Constitutional Convention could consider whatever terms of reference it is given and could consult widely and we could press ahead with reform.  However, without the political will of the Taoiseach of the day, that is an impossibility.  It is not how it should be and it is fundamentally wrong that it is like that, but sadly that has been the practice over the years.  <\/p><p>I know there are others who are very anxious to speak and that the Cathaoirleach is very anxious that I sit down.  In the context of explaining my disappointment with section 1 and the abolition date, I had to put a number of other things on the record which clearly the Government feels are unrelated but nevertheless, given my experience however flawed it may be, I have resolved to do so.  I hope other Members will try to add to that and continue where I left off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000070#UUU00900","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373487300,"counter":990,"content":"<p>I cannot believe I am attempting to protect a third of our Oireachtas, a pillar of our democracy, which has been the base of our State for 91 years.

In these particularly settled times, we apparently have the arrogance to think we can simply abolish or retain the Seanad as opposed to reform it, with emphasis on the electoral process.  Our Seanad has the capacity to formally represent diverse constituencies - regional, class and ethnic as well as experts and experience.  Our Seanad hinders the passage of flawed legislation, acts a check to the D&aacute;il and offers a cooling period.  The Minister of State will know that, as he was one of our good Senators.  With two legislative bodies, our Oireachtas has enhanced oversight of the legislation, excluding EU legislation which is not scrutinised as it should be, although many Senators have alluded to the fact that they would like to do that in a reformed Seanad.<\/p><p>The level of reasoned and informed debate which takes places in the Seanad, as opposed to the D&aacute;il, is well recognised.  It seems to be a much better form of debate.  The Government Senators often debate as if they have a free vote compared to what goes on in the D&aacute;il where one feels the Government Deputies are trying to score political points for the media or the twitterati.  I really look forward to the day, in the not too distant future, when the people vote to keep the Seanad and that this valuable artery of our Oireachtas can be reformed for the betterment of our country and democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000071#VVV01500","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1373487300,"counter":1004,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000071#VVV01600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1373487300,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm a bheith in ann cuidi&uacute; leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht anocht mar is d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht iontach t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute;.

When I dealt with this on Second Stage I referred to the Act of Union and it has been brought home to me even more what it must have been like in the dying hours of the debate on the abolition of Grattan's Parliament as Members fought and strove valiantly to try to change the minds of not only the Minister but the rotten boroughs.  I do not for one moment suggest the deafening silence from the other side can be in any way equated with rotten boroughs, but at the same time the effect and impact are the same.  Those who had been bought kept their mouths shut and trooped through the lobbies when the appropriate time came, and so it ended.<\/p><p>Prime Minister Pitt was determined in the immediate aftermath of the 1798 rebellion that Ireland was full of sedition, and those in charge of England's economy were afraid the Irish were getting too stroppy.  He was determined, and got into its head that he alone would pursue a policy of abolition of the Irish Parliament and enact the Act of Union.  There is a parallel with the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny.<\/p><p>In discussions I have had with friends and colleagues on both sides of the House I have tried to understand and get inside the mind of the Taoiseach on that fateful evening when he made a decision in front of a shocked audience and went on a solo run.  It was, is and will continue to be a solo run until referendum day.  I have wondered what was the catalyst.  Rather interestingly, and the Cathaoirleach will be interested to hear this if he has not heard it before, the House shut down for a week for perfectly legitimate reasons - I was not here at the time - at some stage during the previous 12 months and this is what got into the Taoiseach's head from what I have been told.  He decided it was not an acceptable way of dealing with the Upper House and that enough was enough and it was time it went.<\/p><p>If this was the catalyst perhaps I am doing him an injustice because rather na&iuml;vely I had thought he had given it considerable reflection.  If this anecdote is included in the evidence it seems it probably was a knee-jerk reaction.  Some weeks prior to it, all of the focus in the Fine Gael Party and on its Front Bench was on reform and not abolition.  Policy documents were being prepared in this regard.  People are entitled to change their minds.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin changed his mind; he may have been helped along by some of us but he did change his mind because in the previous election he campaigned on the basis Fianna F&aacute;il supported abolition rather than reform.<\/p> <p>Current Fianna F&aacute;il policy, which needs to be repeated, is that we are opposed to abolition and are in favour of reform.  <\/p><p>Professor Marsh of Trinity College, in an article about 12 months ago on the general context of referendums held in this country since the 1937 Constitution, said, &quot;On each and every occasion where there was a lack of political consensus the referendum had failed.&quot;  In other words, when over 90% of the representatives in the Houses agreed on a constitutional amendment and put the question to the country the question was carried.  This was not the case when there was a lack of political consensus.  One of the most obvious examples of that was the attempt by the de Valera Government to change the political system.  It attempted to introduce the single transferable vote, single seat constituencies and do away with multi-seat constituencies.  There was no political consensus in the D&aacute;il and Seanad at that time because the main Opposition parties, the Labour Party and Fine Gael, were opposed to it.  So it came to pass that not once but twice the Fianna F&aacute;il Administration failed. <\/p><p>The most recent case was the referendum on establishing committees of inquiry.  Again, there was no political consensus at the beginning or when the question was put to the people.  Civic society, represented by former Attorneys General, came out within a week or ten days of the vote to point out a number of flaws in the Government's case.  So it came to pass that the referendum did not pass. <\/p><p>I would be reasonably confident that when one considers all the component parts of referendum campaigns in terms of people who vote in referendums there is an absence of political consensus.  Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il are not in favour of abolition; we are in favour of reform.  The overwhelming majority on the Government benches, if they care to be truthful, in both Houses are not in favour of abolition, rather they are in favour of reform.  I suggest if a straw poll was taken among the Cabinet the chances are it would be at worst lukewarm about abolition and at best opposed to it and more in favour of reform. <\/p><p>When one adds everything up, the portents look reasonably good.  The hope is that the momentum which was started by some of our colleagues in this House, such as Senators Quinn and Zappone, to name but two, and those representing civic society will continue.  Senator Zappone can correct me if I am wrong, but I understand some 500 or 600 people attended a meeting during which they pledged to be actively involved in overturning the Government's proposals. <\/p><p>A recent opinion poll followed familiar lines.  When people are asked a question far out from a referendum date they tend not to be engaged and the figures tend not to be truly representative of their feelings.  As a referendum date gets closer, the arguments start to mount and the momentum builds, things narrow.  Last Sunday was an example.  It is nothing new to people who have studied similar opinion polls which have taken place in the 12 or 18 months leading up to a referendum.  <\/p><p>The electorate is volatile when it comes referendums.  There is a totally different sense among the general public when they are electing a Government or voting for political parties.  Referendums are separate, strange animals.  Ultimately, what will happen, as happened in every other referendum, is that people will vote and answer a question they have not been asked.  It happened most notably in the first Nice treaty referendum when a coalition of hard left representatives managed to convince a sufficient number of the mothers of Ireland that their sons and daughters could end up in body bags fighting for a European army in far-flung fields, when in fact Nice was about housekeeping details internally within the EU and had nothing whatsoever to do with European armies. <\/p><p>I ask both sides of the House whether we have heard any mention of European armies since the first Nice treaty referendum.  They have not been mentioned.  It forced the Government of the day to introduce the triple lock as a response to assuage people's fears.  I mainly put that down to the mothers of Ireland, many of whom I met around my table, who genuinely believed that if they voted &quot;Yes&quot; there would be a European army and conscription.  <\/p><p>The context and background in regard to abolition day are that there is still an awful lot to play for in this regard.  When the arguments are put forward to the Irish people, the most potent of which is that a Government which enjoys a unprecedented majority in the other House and an equally unprecedented majority in this House, can call on up to 40 extra Deputies to support any legislative measure it cares to bring before the D&aacute;il.  That invariably leads to things fraying at the edges.  Even the best democrats get drunk on the intoxication of power.  <\/p><p>The saying that all power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely was not coined today or yesterday.  I am not for one moment suggesting there is anything corrupt about the proposal.  Rather, I am talking about the use and exercise of power.  I saw it happen when my party was in government.  It became tired, arrogant, unheeding and, in its latter days, as Mary O'Rourke famously said about another situation, it went around like headless chickens.  I know that, as do most of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues.  Ultimately, the people were right to throw it out.<\/p><p>In a very cogent contribution Senator Crown talked about the main arguments presented by the Government for the abolition of the Seanad, namely, that it is costly, unnecessary for a unitary non-federal state with small population, has proved to be relatively ineffective since its establishment in 1937 and that the Government argued that Ireland has too many politicians.  In another context I said most US states with, I understand, the exception of Nebraska - I am not sure why - have two houses, a senate and house of representatives.  The purpose of the Declaration of Independence and the American constitution was that one house would look after the other and there would not be an excess of power.  <\/p><p>George Washington summed up to some degree what I am trying to say when he said, &quot;The purpose of a bicameral parliament is to act as a check on the power of the lower chamber.&quot;  Second chambers were famously described by George Washington as, &quot;Providing for a cooling period during which further deliberation on a piece of legislation can take place.&quot;  Proponents of bicameralism argue that in allowing for additional deliberation by a different group of individuals the quality of legislation is enhanced. <\/p><p>Philosopher Henry Sidgwick saw the main purpose of a senate as being that all legislative measures may receive a second consideration by a body different in quality from the primary representative assembly and, if possible, superior or supplementary intellectual conversations.  I would like to think that is possible every day in this House.  Why would one want to get rid of the House which contributes that much to democratic norms? <\/p><p>We should forget about all the amendments which are passed or the other work done here.  The main purpose of the House from its inception was to act as a check and balance on the other House.  It was to bring forward legislation which would be dealt with in a reflective and expert manner.  It was not set up as a challenge to the Government.  In fact, de Valera, rather coincidentally, having been thwarted on more than one occasion by the first Senate, arrived in my town of Drumshanbo in County Leitrim during the general election of 1933.<\/p> <p>It was captured on film.  This was most unusual to see - a small country town in the west of Ireland with cameramen and there he was on the main street.  We have a High Street in the town of Drumshanbo.  It is a bit continental and rather unusual.  He was on High Street looking down on this mass of people.  I can still picture it.  It was part of <i>Seven Ages: The Story of the Irish State<\/i>, which was shown on RTE several times and pops up in the archives from time to time.  Before he said anything at all, the significant memory I have was of all the cloth caps that seemed to spread from the back where the camera was to de Valera on the platform.  I am paraphrasing him here but he more or less said that if the Seanad did not pass the Bill, he would abolish it.  That was the first time he came out in public and said it and of course, he did.  For some rather interesting reason - I am sure Senator Barrett and others have more information than I have on the deliberations leading up to the drawing up of the Constitution and putting it before the people in 1937 - he changed his mind.  He changed his mind in that he put in what in political terms was an emasculated Chamber.  He was not going to agree to a second Chamber that would be like the first Seanad from 1922 to 1937 that could thwart or thumb its nose at the Government, which it did on a number of occasions.  In a way, it was a pity that he was in power at the time and was able to carry that out because what a great Seanad it would be if it had been the continuation of that first Seanad.  The names stand out.  There have many iconic figures in the second Seanad but they were also in the first Seanad.  <\/p><p> If this piece of legislation goes before the people and is defeated, somebody somewhere in the body politic might look at that first Seanad and say it is the way to go.  Of course, it should be tweaked.  It cannot be seen to be a challenge to the other House.  However, if it needs to be elected by direct universal suffrage, as most reformers seem to suggest, it will put itself forward as a challenge to the other House to some degree because it will then be seen to have a democratic mandate, although I would question those who criticise this House for not having a democratic mandate.    <\/p><p> They are the wonderful possibilities that arise out of the rejection of this proposal, of there not being an abolition day and of the Government being faced with a challenge the people will have given it.  This challenge is how to construct out of the ashes of a Government proposal that has gone wrong a Seanad that will be relevant to the people, enhance democratic institutions and, at the same time, create the balance needed between the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  The critical challenge is how one balances the two.  <\/p><p> I will touch on another aspect that has not been mentioned.  Much of the information I have comes from an excellent document prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  It refers to the use of the guillotine by the Executive and relates to the D&aacute;il.  We hear much talk about the Seanad and its flaws but one of the great inherent flaws in the D&aacute;il because of our centralised form of government is the use of the guillotine by the Executive.  I was talking about the parties that favoured abolishing the Seanad.  It seems that all the parties at one point agreed with the abolition of the Seanad, with the exception of the Green Party.  <\/p><p> In his Damascus-like change, Deputy Martin described this particular proposal as a major power grab by the Government.  It was a good soundbite but there was a certain element of truth in it.  Looking at it from the outside, that is how it seems.  When one allies a Government with a massive majority with its actions on the wider front of democratic accountability, one asks what has it been doing.  What is its record?  When one looks at the credit and debit sides of the balance sheet, what has it been doing so far that has encouraged the Irish electorate to think it is in favour of an all-embracing democratic norm?  It is abolishing town councils completely.  It is creating these new electoral areas around former boroughs where one individual will be nominally elected as a mayor.  One can take any of the examples across the country one cares to mention.  Most of the towns in question are expanding.  I think Senator MacSharry referred to Sligo with 22,000 people as the seventh largest town in the country.  The Mayor of Sligo will be competing with nine other councillors spread across a large geographical area way beyond the boundaries of Sligo town as it is currently constituted for borough council purposes in order to ensure they get a fair share of the allocation of money, services and resources from the county council.  There is nothing terribly democratic or modern about that.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is another example where elections have been abolished.  <\/p><p> If one adds it all up and on top of that, the Taoiseach of the day says he is going to abolish the second House of Parliament for reasons that have since proved to be spurious, as we pointed out, particularly on the financial front, and puts it to the people as somehow being a saver, anybody who looks at the argument logically when he or she comes to vote on the day will probably think &quot;Hold on a minute, something isn't quite right here.  Why do they want to do this? Why don't they go for reform?&quot;  As the ad on the radio says, &quot;Once it is gone, it is gone.&quot;  That would be my greatest fear - that once it is gone, it is gone because what would be put in its place?  <\/p><p> Here, I will adopt the position of a cynic of some years' standing in this House.  Successive Governments have pledged reform, particularly reform of the D&aacute;il.  The ending of the dual mandate was wrong in my opinion because Deputies and Senators who sat on local authorities focused on the minds of the real power, namely, county managers who were much more careful than they have subsequently been in terms of watching their back.  It is just an opinion but is one that many subscribe to.  When former Minister Noel Dempsey proposed ending the dual mandate at a parliamentary party meeting, one Deputy responded by asking him what the brave new world for Deputies would be, what greater power he would have as a backbencher and what greater relevance he would have as a Government supporter.  The Minister pointed out that there would be enhanced powers for committees and an enhanced role for the D&aacute;il as a collective, none of which happened.  The same mantra is being pronounced by this Government about reform.  Of course, it can point to certain elements of reform.  In every Government, the Whips have got together at some point and have agreed certain adjustments to procedures but there has been no fundamental reform.<\/p><p> When one looks at those countries referred to by the Taoiseach as being similar in size to us and which have ended the bicameral arrangement, it is salutary to learn that, taking Denmark as the best example, they developed a system of national, regional and local government that is interlocked and where the very lowest level of a town council is responsible for far more than our county councillors are or will be in the brave new world presented by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  That is real democracy.  The Government could present that sort of reform package to the Irish people and tell them the Executive was going to be more accountable within the D&aacute;il and by that, I mean strengthening the committees.  I sat on the Council of Europe because I have a particular interest in European and foreign affairs, more so than any other subject and sometimes to my detriment.  I remember inquiring how the system worked in terms of European Union directives in Denmark and the relationship between the Executive and the committees.<\/p> <p>I discovered that the European Union Minister - in our case the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Lucinda Creighton - could not and did not take any decisions on behalf of her government in Brussels without first referring the matter to the European affairs committee in the Danish Parliament.  Under its constitution, the Minister is precluded from so doing.  Ministers cannot unilaterally make any decisions.<\/p><p>Let us contrast that with what goes on currently in Europe where, according to Senator Mark Daly who did the figures some time ago, 75% of the legislation coming through these Houses, comes directly from Europe without scrutiny or debate.  Decisions that are taken around the Council of Ministers and proposals emanating from the Commission, passing through the Council of Ministers, are voted on at the Council of Ministers and are then, essentially, transcribed into Irish law with only the minimum of scrutiny.   Many of us sit on committees where a form of scrutiny is in operation.  While it is adequate, it is not comprehensive enough and it certainly does not get through to most Irish people that we are even engaged in that process.<\/p><p>That is one example of real democracy in action, where the Government and the Executive are held accountable by the elected members within it.  Not only do they do that in Denmark but they created a form of regional government which was given real power, influence and resources.  It subsequently took a third tier at the level of town councils in the smallest towns and villages, with real power.  I am not sure of the number of these but it is in the hundreds.<\/p><p>There is nothing comparable to that here, nor is it on the agenda of this Government in terms of the reform package it is proposing.  To suggest that Ireland is comparable to those states that have given up the bicameral system and that there will be a brave new world of democratic accountability, I am sorry, cynic and all as I am, I do not believe it.<\/p><p>In 1997, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution concluded that any savings from the abolition of the Seanad could be illusory because some of the functions it carries out would need to be reallocated to other parts of the political system.  I am not going to dwell too much on this because it has been covered by many other people.  The figure involved, according to Mr. Kieran Coughlan at the Committee of Public Accounts when he was pursued on this issue by former Senator, now Deputy, Shane Ross, was about &euro;9 million.  I think the Government's budget - the Minister of State will be more familiar with the figure than me - is currently around &euro;55 billion of spend nationally.  I think we are borrowing in the region of &euro;1 billion per month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000073#XXX01400","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373490300,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000076#AAAA00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373490300,"counter":1027,"content":"<p>The figure of &euro;9 million is being put out to the people-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000076#AAAA00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1373490300,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>It is more than &euro;9 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000076#AAAA00400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1373490300,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>According to Mr. Kieran Coughlan, the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, the figure is &euro;9 million.

Rather interestingly, there are bicameral legislatures in 40% of the countries in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, in 56% of OECD countries and in 13 of the 27 member states.  In European Union states with unicameral parliaments, lower houses have alternative checks and balances, such as powerful committee systems, which make it difficult for governments to rush through legislation.  No proposal along those lines is contained in any of the \"reform\" proposals that have emanated from Government so far.  There has been some tinkering around the edges but I have not seen any element of the Executive power being relinquished by one iota.<\/p><p>The argument about the abolition of the Seanad not performing a role envisaged for it in the Constitution and that its partisan nature means that it offers little additional opportunity for improved legislative security needs to be looked at.  I referred earlier to George Washington's famous speech about a cooling period.  That is the essence of this House and what it should be about.  The other argument that is used in its favour is from a former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Michael McDowell, who said that the Seanad considered legislation is a far more bipartisan spirit or, perhaps more correctly, a non-partisan spirit than the D&aacute;il.  He argued that introducing major reform legislation in the Upper House had the effect of defusing the adversarial atmosphere in the D&aacute;il as the more contentious issues had been explained and resolved in an amicable way in the Seanad.  While our political differences show on occasions in the House, because we are a political Chamber, I have never been able to understand people who have been appointed to the Seanad and said it was not a political chamber.  Of course it is a political Chamber.  Despite that, there is an understanding across all sides when a Minister presents legislation that it is the spirit of the House that comes out the strongest.  The spirit and the desire of the House is that when the legislation leaves this Chamber, it is enhanced and people find they do not have to score political points most of the time when it comes to the legislative model presented here.  Of course, there will be negativity about the Government proposing and the Opposing opposing.  However, I am talking about the level and content of debate in general.<\/p><p>The Ministers who come to the House with Seanad Bills, as distinct from D&aacute;il Bills, usually do so in the knowledge that when they leave this House, they will be considerably enhanced.  The most recent example was the Animal Health and Welfare Bill which was introduced by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, who is a regular visitor.  Other Ministers have also been mentioned.  That was one example of a Bill, when it eventually got back to the D&aacute;il, had been subject to amendment by this House and which the Minister took on board, and more than 75% of the amendments emanated from this House.  It was debated for some time with the support of the Leader who ensured sufficient time was provided, because he realised its importance and that it was not a hugely contentious Bill to the point where there would be a row between the Government and the Opposition.  He understood it from his own experience and I am sure he gave that advice, as I am sure he has done on other occasions.  I was aware of that because with Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, I was a central contributor to the Bill.  That was the most recent example of complex and very comprehensive legislation.<\/p><p>There are constitutional safeguards that need to be examined.<\/p> <p>The significant role given to the Seanad by the Constitution to safeguard democracy is sometimes under-rated.  In the removal of the Comptroller and Auditor General and judges and the impeachment of the President, the thresholds required to support resolutions of the D&aacute;il have been increased in the Bill to reflect the loss of the Seanad's check on the Lower House's power.  I am unsure as to whether the Judiciary is happy about this.  That the Judiciary stated its opposition to this measure was unprecedented.<\/p><p>Another constitutional check, the power of the majority of the Seanad and a third of the D&aacute;il to ask the President to put legislation before the people, is proposed to be removed.  There are anticipated implications for D&aacute;il reform stemming the abolition of the Seanad, but this is as far the document before us, which is comprehensive and runs to some 43 pages, goes.  It is the only line on parliamentary reform that is relevant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000076#AAAA01100","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1373490900,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>That says it all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000077#BBBB00200","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1373490900,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>It also makes another reference to the effect that there are calls for enhanced scrutiny of secondary and EU legislation.<\/p><p>  Another set of commentators, who have together formed an independent group called Democracy Matters, proposed that Executive dominance should be addressed by reform of the Seanad.

Based on these arguments at this relatively early stage in the campaign, I do not doubt that the people of Ireland will do what they have always done, that being, scrutinise and reflect on whether the change is in their best interests and the best interests of the country.

Lessons should have been learned from what happened before that we should not sit so late.<\/p><p>  The independent Boundary Commission published the Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee report <font color=\"#222222\">at the end of May.  <\/font>We have, however, a real problem with the electoral division boundaries.  The net effect of the boundary review in County Meath is that there are now six districts: Laytown-Bettystown, Ashbourne, Ratoath, Trim, Navan and Kells.  The Ashbourne-Ratoath and Laytown-Bettystown boundaries are anomalous.  As far as I can see from the maps, part of the village of Duleek, the Millrace estate, is in the Ashbourne area.  It is in the townland of Bellewstown, which includes the road along the new lines of Duleek cemetery.  Parts of the school road in Duleek are in the Ashbourne area.  This is highly anomalous because there is a local authority headquarters in Duleek.  It is a stone's throw from the Millrace estate to the local authority headquarters, but a large part of that estate will be in the Ashbourne area, so residents will not be able to deal with the nearby office.<\/p><p>  I recall that there is a &quot;Welcome to Duleek&quot; sign in the Ashbourne electoral area, despite the fact that Duleek is the administrative headquarters for the Laytown-Bettystown area.  That is anomalous.  <\/p><p>  The same applies to the townland of Baltransna, which is very much part of Ashbourne but is in the Ratoath electoral area.  In fact, there is a &quot;Welcome to Ashbourne&quot; sign in the townland of Baltransna which is in the Ratoath electoral area, not in the Ashbourne electoral area.  That is also an anomaly.  <\/p><p>  I will not blame the commission, which did respond to a submission from a political party and that was accepted.  I think there is a problem with the district electoral division boundaries.  I do not know when they were last reviewed or examined, but they are the building blocks of all boundary reviews, either for D&aacute;il or local electoral areas.  They do not reflect the towns involved.  For example, the district electoral division boundaries go through the village of Duleek, rather than the village being in its own district electoral division.  That may be a technical matter but I think the Minister of State gets the point.  The bottom line is that the village of Duleek is partially split into two different electoral areas.  In addition, part of Ashbourne is not in the Ashbourne electoral area.  That situation is highly anomalous and the Government should re-examine it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000079#DDDD01300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1373492100,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne for bringing this matter before the House.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis n&iacute;os luaithe san o&iacute;che.  T&aacute; Gaeilge an-mhaith aige.  Chuir s&eacute; pointe an-mhaith romhainn.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the points raised by Senator Byrne and welcome the opportunity to clarify issues regarding the recent report of the 2013 Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee.  Each Member of these Houses is no doubt interested in the recommendations of the committee, especially as they relate to their own county or city.  As the Senator will be aware, I am familiar with many parts of County Meath.  Parts of the county are in County Louth in terms of the D&aacute;il electoral area.<\/p><p>The committee was established by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, in November 2012 and its report was published on 30 May 2013.  In publishing the report, the Minister announced his intention to accept in full the recommendations therein and to make in due course the necessary local electoral area orders to give them effect.  The local electoral areas specified in these orders, and the number of members to be elected for each area, will apply at the 2014 local elections.  Arrangements are currently in train to prepare these orders and they will be ready in good time for next year's elections.<\/p><p>The completion of the report was an important step in the Government's programme of local government reform.  The review had a specific goal of improving balance and consistency in representational ratios in local government, while taking particular account of factors such as the location of towns in the new municipal governance arrangements provided for in the action programme for effective local government.  The terms of reference provided for minimum levels of representation in lower-population counties and cities.  <\/p><p>Arising from the recommendations in the report, a total of 949 councillors will be elected at the 2014 elections, in 137 local electoral areas, to 31 local authorities.  Much of the commentary on the report has focused on the reduction in the number of council seats from 1,627 to 949 and the number of local authorities from 114 to 31.  However, beyond these reductions is the development of a far more integrated approach between county and municipal government which will better serve the needs of all citizens.<\/p><p>This radical structural reform will provide a sound platform for the wider development and strengthening of the local government system in the future.  The current number of councillors in local authorities was set in the distant past.  There have been huge changes in population in recent decades and, indeed, one of the counties particularly affected has been Meath.<\/p><p>Whereas previous local electoral area reviews left the total number of members in each local authority unchanged, this review involves a fundamental reform of the system.  One practical consequence is that the number of members of Meath County Council will increase from 29 to 40.  That is a very significant increase.  <\/p><p>The recommendations in the report stand as they are.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, accepts them in full, for Meath and for every other local authority area.  As the Minister mentioned some months ago, when the new arrangements for D&aacute;il constituencies were being debated - and more recently when Senator Cullinane raised the local electoral area boundaries for Cork in this House - there are pluses and minuses in constituency and boundary reviews.  In nearly every situation there are multiple options and a range of solutions.  However, every change or move has a knock-on effect, with consequences for other parts of a county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000079#DDDD01400","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1373492100,"counter":1065,"content":"<p>I think the problem lies with the district electoral division boundaries which are really old.  In fact, there are huge anomalies in the St. Mary's electoral division.  The Minister of State lives on the Louth side, while I live on the Meath side of that division.  The Ardcath electoral division comes into Duleek, as well as Ratoath and Ashbourne but they do not reflect the towns or villages they are supposedly named after.  I do not know how long they have been there, but they have certainly been there since the 1901 census or even earlier.  We should examine those electoral boundaries so that towns such as Duleek would have their own district electoral division.  In that case, there would be fewer anomalies when the Boundary Commission creates local electoral areas or D&aacute;il constituencies.  It could work well, but that is the root of the problem in my view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000079#DDDD01500","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1373492100,"counter":1066,"content":"<p>I take Senator Byrne's point.

Arising from the findings of the HTA, HIQA's advice to the HSE was that, despite some promising results on the effect of IPC in people with severe peripheral vascular disease, who are not suitable for revascularisation, further high-quality studies are required to reliably demonstrate its effectiveness.  It also advised that until such evidence is generated in the context of well-designed research studies, the efficacy of this treatment remains unproven.<\/p><p>Within the Irish health care system there has been limited use of IPC.

On a more serious note, I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House.  It is the first time I have raised a matter in the wee hours of the morning so I am grateful he is here.  The matter relates to the upcoming legislation which will be debated in the House on the proposal to address the legal lacunae which exists following Ms Justice Elizabeth Dunne&rsquo;s judgment in 2011 on the rights of mortgagers repossessing property belonging to mortgage holders.   I am fearful that the implementation of the Land and Conveyencing Law Reform Bill 2013 will negatively impact on those homeowners who fell into mortgage arrears prior to 1 December 2009 and who, as a consequence of this Act, will be at severe risk of losing their homes.  I am fearful that we as a Government will fail not only to help those struggling with mortgage debt, but also homeowners who may not yet be subject to court proceedings but are in mortgage distress as we speak.  Some of these people may have some equity in their homes and have a legitimate expectation that they will be able to sell their properties.  However, due to the potential flooding of the market with possibly tens of thousands of properties this will adversely affect the value of these properties.  By taking action and allowing potentially tens of thousands of properties on the market for sale as a result of this legal lacuna in that many of them will be coming on the market at one time, this could, and possibly will, lead to a depression in house prices.  It will play monopoly with the lives of thousands of people who are struggling to pay their way.  We must be mindful of the fact that although house prices have slightly increased in the Dublin area, if we strip out this locality we will see a decrease in house prices right across the country, and they are down as much as 3% which indicates that house prices on the whole remain on a downward trajectory.   House prices in my constituency of Galway East are predicted to fall by 0.3% next year.  Some analyses estimate that as a result of this conveyancing Bill between 6,000 and 20,000 homes are at risk of being repossessed which will put considerable pressure on house prices throughout the State and will contribute to the continued downward trend in house prices.  There is no doubt that this influx of repossessed properties and homes will only exacerbate the situation further.  Some of my constituents who unfortunately are in mortgage arrears at this time are on the verge of this predicament.<\/p><p>While commentators in the ESRI believe that the future is bright for the country and I believe there is no doubt about that, the Government is taking significant steps to ensure that this is the way it will be into the next few years.  Hopefully, next year many more will be gainfully employed and the economy will have improved and, as a consequence, house prices on the whole will begin to rise again.<\/p><p>As last week's figures suggest, we are back in a recession technically, and as a result, I contend, that the prospects for stabilisation or an increase in house prices remain minute.  While I recognise the fact that the ugly truth is that these financial institutions must be become self-sufficient again, my question for the Minister for Justice and Equality is whether he has discussed any of the repercussions of the potential number of home repossessions may have on the housing market with the financial lenders and analysts and, if so, what approach are they going to take in that respect in the interests of stabilising the housing market?<\/p><p>I want to raise a related issue regarding the legal costs associated with financial institutions hiring barristers and solicitors to act on their behalf when issuing repossession proceedings and seeing these proceedings right through the courts.  I know of a number of people who have been asked to pay tens of thousands of euro to have their homes repossessed or, worse still, to stop the bank from repossessing their homes.  Would it not be better for the banks to hire in an in-house counsel or solicitor to act on their behalf as this would lead to lower legal costs and would not result in further indebtedness for  their borrowers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000081#FFFF00100","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1373493300,"counter":1075,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue.<\/p><p>As the Minister indicated to this House just yesterday, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2013 does not create any new right of repossession on the part of lenders.  It restores a right which was specifically intended to continue to exist under reforming legislation enacted by the Oireachtas in 2009 in circumstances in which certain High Court judgments have raised doubts about the ability of lenders to exercise that right. The main provision in section 1 restores necessary certainty to Irish law in these circumstances.<\/p><p>While there is a troika commitment to introduce this legislation, the legislation is necessary in any event because we cannot sustain an ongoing lack of certainty with regard to the legal position on mortgages and we cannot sustain a situation in which banks are expected to lend money by way of mortgages on the one hand and on the other hand there is a lack of certainty about the exercise of their rights when it comes to major default by a borrower.<\/p><p>As the Minister and the Government have stated a number of times, repossession of a family home or a principal private residence is intended to be the very last resort after all other avenues have been tried but have failed.  Even where the point of a court action for repossession of a person's home is reached, this Bill makes very specific provision for a late intervention safeguard for borrowers by allowing for an adjournment for the parties to investigate the alternative of a personal insolvency arrangement.  In addition, the Bill also provides that repossession proceedings in relation to the principal private residence must be commenced in the Circuit Court which will reduce the cost of the proceedings for the parties.<\/p><p>This Bill is not an isolated measure.  It exists within the context of a range of interventions which this Government has made to assist with the debt and mortgage arrears crisis which we face.  For example, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 introduced major bankruptcy and insolvency reform, in the year after this Government took office, where precisely nothing had been done in this area by our predecessors.<\/p><p>I do not believe, as has been suggested both in the Oireachtas and in the media, that the passing of this Bill will open the floodgates for repossessions.  One of the main reasons for this view is precisely the issue raised tonight by Senator Higgins.  It makes no economic or financial sense for financial institutions to place too many houses on the market as it would, as the Senator suggests, depress house prices even further.<\/p><p>In respect of the potential number of repossessions actions which will come before the courts on the passing of this legislation, the Minister has asked me to say that it is impossible to put a figure on this issue given the number of variables that exist. The Minister hopes that, rather than going directly to repossession proceedings, parties will seek to avail of the insolvency mechanisms contained in the Personal Insolvency Act when the Insolvency Service of Ireland becomes fully operational within the coming weeks.<\/p><p>I will the Deputy last point regarding legal costs to the attention of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000081#FFFF00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1373493300,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I want to make it clear that I am not against the introduction of this law.  I was a practising barrister for a number of years and would have acted for and against financial institutions during that time.  It is important that banks and those people who are availing of loans have certainty.  For banks in particular, it is a commercial reality that they would have certainty in that if they lend money and somebody is not able to pay it back they are entitled to call in the loan in certain circumstances.  I raised this issue because I am concerned about the impact on the property market of a plethora of houses, or even increased number of houses coming on the market or being released for sale at any one time.  I feel my question has not been answered.  I am worried about the possible saturation of the property market and house prices being further depressed.  People who have houses that are in-equity and are trying to salvage something by way of mortgage repayments, or in terms of being able to sell their house and pay off some of their mortgage, will be left in a very difficult situation.  I have put up with the answer I have been given but I appreciate that the Minister of State will bring to the attention of the Minister the matter regarding the excessive legal costs that are being presented to people who are already indebted and trying to save their homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000081#FFFF00300","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1373493300,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her views and assure her that I will convey them to the Minister.  I repeat that for a lender to seek a court order to repossess the home of a mortgagor who has defaulted in repayments that should be a last resort where all other avenues to resolve the arrears situation have been exhausted.  That is the context of the reply, namely, that it will be done as a last resort after everything else has been tried.  Ultimately, the recourse, when it becomes absolutely necessary, that our legal system provides, and is seen to provide, are processes which work properly to give effect to a lender's age old right to repossess, as a very last resort, where there is a very serious default.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013071000081#FFFF00400","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1373493300,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>It is very important for the Government to get that message out.
