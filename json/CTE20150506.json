Thank you very much Mr. Boucher.  So now I propose that we go into public sessions, is that agreed?  Agreed.  As we have a quorum, the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now in public session.  Can I remind members and those in public gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?  Todays' session one is public hearing discussion with Mr. Richie Boucher, group chief executive of Bank of Ireland.  In doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the 23rd public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with senior bank executives who had roles during and after the crisis.  This morning we will hear from Mr. Richie Boucher, group chief executive, Bank of Ireland.  Mr. Boucher joined Bank of Ireland as chief executive of corporate banking from the Royal Bank of Scotland in December 2003.  He was appointed chief executive of retail financial services Ireland in January 2005.  He has been the group chief executive officer since February 2009.  He is the past president of the Institute of Banking in Ireland and of the Irish Banking Federation.  Mr. Boucher you are welcome before the inquiry this morning.<\/p><p>Before I hear from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should therefore be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the gallery, those documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and should not publish any of the documents so displayed.  The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis and you have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to Mr. Boucher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050600002#C00100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1430866800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>The following witness was sworn in by the Clerk to the Committee:\r\n\r\nMr. Richie Boucher, Group Chief Executive, Bank of Ireland.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1430866800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Okay, with that said, I now invite Mr. Boucher to make his opening remarks.

I was also required to provide a written statement in relation to those themes.  The Chairman's opening remarks to the inquiry in December 2014 identified that the purpose of the inquiry was to identify mistakes which were made, to learn from these and to avoid their recurrence.  I've provided the inquiry with a comprehensive written statement and have provided documents within, and not within, the public domain relating to my written submission.<\/p> <p>  Chairman, may I suggest that if yourself and the committee feel that it would be the most productive use of your time, rather than me continuing on a prepared a statement I could move straight to questions and answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050600002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher"},{"type":"speech","time":1430866800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Okay, Mr. Boucher, and just to inform you as well, the committee will be publishing your statement in full so we can take that as being read this morning, with your agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050600002#D00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430866800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Yes, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher"},{"type":"speech","time":1430866800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Okay.

Yes, I think and these are strategies that went back to 2001, 2002, I obviously joined the bank, I implemented strategy, I ... subsequent to 2006 I was part of that strategy but there was a belief that we should diversify outside of Ireland, that ... I believe that you obviously have to fund yourself, we didn't have natural customer deposits, long-standing customer relationships, branch networks etc. and as a belief how we could do that it.  So it is a belief that you could get your loans, you could bundle them and you could sell them on - I would not sell them on.  You could use them as collateral, so you'd get a group of mortgages etc,. use them as collateral and you'd raise funding from the market for that.  That was a model that was being done for ... and is still done.  It was a belief, you know, so there was an investigation of the depth of those markets, what were other people doing, you know, what was the advice, the best advice.  It was considered at that time an appropriate model to grow your business.  As it transpired, when the markets freeze or when, like I said, you had particular technical issues in certain markets and that, the money is not available.  Core customer deposits, franchise deposits, where people provide you with money because it's part of their day-to-day banking activities etc. is a much better model.  So, if I go to the UK, so this was our mistake, I think it was our biggest mistake with the UK, what we have done since is we've incorporated in the UK, we gather our deposits, primarily, in our Northern Ireland business, it's self-funded so that the customer franchise in Northern Ireland funds the personal lending business and corporate lending in Northern Ireland.  In Great Britain, so that's England and Wales really for us, we gather deposits through our partnership with the Post Office in a separately incorporated subsidiary and we grow assets within that.  We didn't do that, we didn't have those core customer deposits, it was a massive mistake.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050600002#Y03900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richie Boucher"},{"type":"speech","time":1430866800,"counter":534,"content":"<p>So all the behaviour that you are talking about now which is currently in place is obviously based on a more prudential approach and a reduction of exposure and risk.

Good afternoon Chairman, members of the inquiry.  I welcome the opportunity to appear before the inquiry and I'll be as helpful as I can to assist you in your work.  I've submitted a witness statement to the inquiry which addresses the lines of inquiry, as requested.<\/p> <p>  As you all know, Ulster Bank is a universal bank operating primarily in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It is owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland.  My own background, as it relates to the inquiry, as the Chairman said, is as follows.  In 1998 I joined First Active from Woodchester Investments as head of finance.  Two years later, I was appointed chief executive.  Following the acquisition of First Active by Ulster Bank in January 2004, I was appointed to the position of chief executive of the enlarged Ulster Bank Group.  I left Ulster Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland in May of 2011.  The objective of Royal Bank of Scotland in combining RBS ... Ulster Bank with First Active was in to form a credible third force in Irish bank ... in the Irish banking market, to enhance competitiveness and to challenge the dominance of AIB and Bank of Ireland in particular.  You will all recall that the need for a credible third force in Irish banking was strongly promoted by politicians, the media, business groups and consumer advocacy groups.<\/p> <p>  As chief executive of the Ulster Bank Group, I was responsible for all of the operations of the bank.  On assuming the role I was tasked with combining and integrating a management team from Ulster Bank and First Active, whilst maintaining the two brands, working with RBS to move the banks technology platform to those of RBS, developing and executing a strategy to avail of the growing Irish economy and creating a real universal banking alternative to AIB and Bank of Ireland.  I was very much enthused by this opportunity, believing that by being a part of RBS, the Ulster Bank and First Active combination could bring something to the Irish market that was both needed and unique.  The scale and sophistication of RBS, allied to the on-the-ground capability and experience of the existing indigenous banks, underpinned the opportunity.   At that time, all of the economic indicators in Ireland pointed towards sustained growth.  I was assured by RBS following my appointment as CEO that capital and funding support would be made available to support growth, obviously with the appropriate group risk framework.  I'd like to spend a couple of minutes explaining the governance structure at Ulster Bank Group, as it does differ from the other banks appearing at this inquiry. <\/p> <p>  The RBS governance model which was in place before the First Active acquisition remained unchanged.  Integral to this was significant RBS oversight of and involvement in the Ulster Bank business, particularly where credit, regulatory and operational risk was concerned.  Ulster Bank management in each of these areas had solid and dotted reporting lines into senior RBS management.  This also applied to the CFO, the head of HR and the head of internal audit.  Members of RBS senior management were either formal members of Ulster Bank boards or committees or had rights of attendance.  In addition, the Ulster Bank Group had a board of directors comprising independent, experienced and high-calibre people.  This board also had RBS representative member.  The chairman of the board had open access to the chairman and chief executive of RBS and engaged with them regularly, independent of Ulster Bank management.  Ulster Bank Group had three legal entities in Ireland, each of which had a separate board of directors with independent chair persons and non-executive directors.  The bank had, what is called, a high level controls framework which underpinned the RBS governance model.  The governance structure at Ulster Bank Group was identical to the governance of all RBS subsidiaries.  It was, and is, entirely appropriate for a bank with a single share holder.  Having both a local board and RBS governance felt like we had the best of both worlds, with the benefit of being part of a significant global bank and the comfort of having local boards populated by respected and well known business and public figures.<\/p> <p>  The approach to strategy was also dictated by the same high levels control framework.  This included, amongst other things, an annual off-site strategy session with the board where the proposed business strategies and five-year plans were reviewed and challenged.  The outcomes were fed into the RBS strategic planning and budgetary process, which was a detailed and rigorous exercise in itself.  Performance against plan was closely monitored by RBS on a monthly and quarterly basis.  The business plans were constantly evolving, based on detailed reporting and forecasting.  And this was subject to detailed engagement between myself, our CFO and the RBS CEO and CFO.  I was required to report directly to the RBS board annually on Ulster Bank strategy and performance.  In a nutshell, the bank's strategy was to grow all aspects of our retail business and corporate business throughout Ireland, North and South, availing of strong economic conditions and positive indicators.  Each of us is looking ... each of us in the room is looking back at the period between early 2000 and 2008 with the benefit of knowing what happened.  It is a sobering perspective, particularly given the impact the outcome has had on so many people's lives.  It is, however, important to consider what the prevailing perspective actually was back in 2004 to put in proper context the development and adoption of strategies and decisions.  All of the economic indicators in 2003 to 2007 regarding the demand for housing in particular over the median ... medium term were positive.  This included underlying demographics, particularly in the household formation bracket, numbers per household, economic growth, migration and interest rates.  It was estimated in 2003 that a minimum of 40,000 housing units a year would be required through the period to 2010, following which there would be a lower but still significant ongoing requirement.  In aiming to become a genuine third force in Irish banking, Ulster Bank lent too much money to too many people on the basis of assumptions which turned out to be seriously flawed.  This was not to say that we adopted a cavalier or reckless approach to banking, we didn't.  What is clear is that our strategy, while genuine in its motives and ambition and backed by one of the worlds largest banks, was ultimately proven the have been ill-judged and mistaken in the light of what transpired in 2008 and beyond.  I deeply regret that this happened while I was chief executive of Ulster Bank. I'd like to spend a couple of minutes guiding you through the banks approach to risk and credit.<\/p> <p>  Business divisions in Ulster Bank were given general, non-specific growth targets that were to be achieved within acceptable risk policies, appetite parameters and lending caps.  Hence, as a full service bank, there was no formal sector-specific lending focus.  Sector risk appetite over the period was set out initially at a high level.  Appetite didn't set limits but articulated the banks view of a sector which influenced business development.  Over time, sector reviews and appetite statements became more detailed and prescriptive.  The only property-related portfolio cap was in respect of speculative lending on commercial property.  This was set at 3% of total loans and this cap was adhered to throughout my time in the bank.  The Ulster Bank Group had a risk policy and controls committee.  Policies were structured around rules and guidelines.  Rules had to be followed and if breached, were strictly subject to exception reporting and higher level approval.  Guidelines which were exceeded had to be justified.  All credit policies were subject to annual review.  Under the Ulster Bank credit committee and delegated authority policy, the most significant credit risks were presented to the most senior credit committee for approval.  Delegated authorities to other committees were based on a combination of the aggregated amount of facilities and the borrower's credit grade.  Credit authorities for the credit committees were approved by the RBS risk committee.  Loans above certain thresholds had to be submitted to an RBS credit committee for approval.<\/p> <p>  In retail banking, Ulster Bank branches had no lending authority and every loan application was referred directly to credit.  First Active branch managers had authority to approve mortgage lending up to certain limits, subject to policy rules.  A detailed process was put in place to deal with exceptions to lending policy.  All policy rule exceptions had to be reviewed and approved by the appropriate credit authority as set out in the policy.  Exceptions within retail, were reported monthly to risk policy and controls committee and RBS Group credit risk and also presented to the relevant board.  Responsibility for monitoring sector concentration risk rested with the risk policy and controls committee.  Reports in this committee were presented to the board.  The nature and purpose of concentration analysis evolved throughout the years to 2008.<\/p><p>In 2004 and '05 residential lending, commercial real estate and construction accounted for over 60% of the bank's lending portfolio.  We did introduce a sector exposure framework in 2005 to develop a more systematic approach to concentration analysis in line with Basel II and RBS Group policy requirements.  In 2006 a policy of producing quarterly operational reports was introduced to provide a risk-focused approach to the management of sector concentrations in the lending book.  This was supplemented by periodic reviews.<\/p><p> Stress testing was carried out as part of the Central Bank and regulator's biannual process.  This examined baseline versus shock scenarios provided by the Central Bank and regulator.  The return for July 2008, following shock scenario testing, showed minimum tier 1 and total capital ratios of 7.9% and 8.8%, compared to base case ratios of 8.6% and 9.9%.  These stress-testing processes were supplemented by macroeconomic stress testing, involving input from Ulster Bank Group economics and John FitzGerald of the ESRI.  They tested three global shock scenarios and John FitzGerald used the ESRI Hermes model to simulate the impact on Ireland over the period 2006 to 2010.  The results of the medium-term shock scenario were used as a basis of the Ulster Bank 2007 ICAAP return to the Financial Regulator.<\/p><p> I would like to address the issue of the introduction of 100% mortgages, because I know that it's a concern of the inquiry.  In 2004 the First Active mortgage market share was coming under pressure in the first-time buyer segment, where mortgage brokers in particular were gaining increased traction.  Following market research and customer feedback, two things became clear to us.  Firstly, whilst dated market maximum loans to value were already at 92%, some of our competitors were increasingly prepared to stretch LTVs to 100% or more to secure first-time buyers' business.  Secondly, our customers were increasingly having to rely on expensive short-term debt, through credit cards and personal loans, to fund the excess between the maximum LTV and the house purchase price.  We already had a 100% mortgage product in existence for some years for professionals on which our experience had been very good.  Given this experience, together with factors to which I already referred and the positive economic and demographic backdrop, we decided to recognise the market reality through publicly introducing 100% mortgages in what we judged to be a controlled and restricted way - no exceptions policy, reduction in maximum term.  Before launching it, we put the mortgage through a rigorous risk assessment program in RBS and we notified the regulator of our intention.  In the three years between mid-2005 and mid-2008, Ulster Bank and First Active combined advanced &euro;1 billion worth of these mortgages to approximately 4,000 customers, which amounted to 4% of our total mortgage lending in this period.  The introduction of 100% mortgages had little impact on our market share of mortgage lending, for which the period between 2004 and 2008 remained at 16%.  In reality, the collapse in house prices has been of such a magnitude that almost any mortgage written after 2004 with a loan to value in excess of 50% subsequently went into negative equity.  With the benefit of hindsight, the introduction of 100% mortgages was a detrimental initiative which became all too apparent as property values collapsed.<\/p><p> I appreciate that much of the inquiry's work has been taken up with the bank guarantee and in my witness statement I have touched on the difficulties which it created for Ulster Bank.  I should also confirm, Chairman, the first I knew about the guarantee was when I heard about it on the news on the morning of 30 September 2008 and I was surprised, since I have been in touch with the Financial Regulator on two occasions in the preceding two weeks because of the obvious stresses in the funding market.  Following the putting in place of the guarantee, we immediately made significant efforts to address the difficulties this was causing us.  In the end, we were afforded the opportunity to enter the scheme but the terms involved proved impossible for us.<\/p><p> In conclusion, Chairman, I can say to you today, hand on heart, that all of the decisions I made were made in good faith on the basis of the best information to hand at the time.  I never anticipated the circumstances that transpired in 2008 and beyond and I was mistaken not to have done so.  I greatly regret that decisions I made while chief executive of Ulster Bank have had the impact they have had on so many peoples' lives.  Thank you, Chairman, I'm happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050600002#EE00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430866800,"counter":754,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. McCarthy, for your opening statement.

A typical mortgage, a standard mortgage underwriting has a standard policy and there is typically exceptions allowed to that, so the core portfolio management limits, and we would have allowed exceptions of 10% for loan to value and 10% to debt service ratios.  And what we did is in all the cases even though they were, if there was somebody looking to lend outside those particular limits that we had in place, it had to come into the centre.  And in doing that we managed these exceptions so in the loan to values, it would not have been unusual for there to be a 10% variation or within a 10% variation.  For example, a good chunk of those, as I understand it from my research, were very small changes in loan to value they weren't significant amounts, and on the debt service ratio, for example, if someone, 50% typically of those outside policies would have been for people with incomes of &euro;75,000 and greater, so the greater your income the greater your debt service capacity so we had very clear policies on these but we had portfolio management exceptions that we allowed but they had to be underwritten centrally and then these were reported to the board.  <\/p> <p>  As an aside it's interesting that even with the new rules that the regulator has in place there are exceptions allowed of anywhere between 10% to 20% as I understand it for loans to value and debt service ratios, so that accommodation has continued into the current environment.  So what we were doing was, as was entirely appropriate, we were reporting these to the board.  And having done the research and having presented to Professor Brennan and the board in 2004, as the minutes indicate she spent time with Mr. McDonnell outside the meeting and satisfied herself on the matter.  And those reports would have gone to the board serially subsequent to that over the coming periods and the board minutes don't show until 2007 that there were concerns. <\/p> <p>  In 2007 as you rightly point out, the board again brought up the issue of outside policy and we agreed that we had exceeded loan-to-value policy in March 2007 in particular, again going back to my 10% limits, following which action was taken to deal with that and the records show that subsequent to that date, the LTVs outside policy and debt-service ratios outside policy all declined further.  So what we were doing was doing the right thing in reporting these to the board.  We we were managing within portfolio management limits that exist to this day, and reporting them to the board, there was good debate and discussion at the board and to the best of my knowledge, the minutes reflect this, reflect this subsequently, the board was satisfied with the explanations it received from management.  <\/p> <p>  With that said Senator, I accept that we let our standards slip in many ... in some occasions and I do regret that but we were managing within, you know, tried and tested and understood limits. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050600002#GG00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430866800,"counter":785,"content":"<p>Because the regulator reported in February 2006, there is no evidence that exceptions to policy are being reported to the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050600002#GG00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1430866800,"counter":786,"content":"<p>With respect Senator, that was erroneous.

Firstly our reply crossed, so our reply to that letter which has been submitted to the inquiry was sent out two days before that particular letter, so our letters crossed with the regulators.  Yes it took too long, if I could explain why it took too long.  Typically, what the regulator did in their inspections was they visited your institution, they did their work independent of discussion, there was limited enough discussion with management.  Typically, they would take files away they would look at those files they would return those files, then they would finish their inspection, go back to the Central Bank or their own offices and write their report.  It was a matter of continuing frustration that there wasn't on-the-ground discussion with management at the completion of their review.  So typically, what would happen is, you'd expect there to be a dialogue that would say, 'We found this, can you help us with that'.  That didn't happen and typically you got a letter and then we would have to spend quite a bit of time going back over the individual files that the regulator would have pulled to see exactly what the nature of the query was and if the documentation had been in place.  And what the reply to the regulator that we issued on, I believe, 22 July, indicates is that in a number of cases we were able to say to the regulator, well actually this document was there or that had been done.  So unfortunately, the process was elongated by the fact that there was very limited dialogue at the conclusion of a review and it resorted to paper.  I do regret that it took as long as it did to respond but the reality was that we had to do a lot of work after we received the regulator's report to make sure we got a full response in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050600002#GG00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430866800,"counter":789,"content":"<p>Because the queries raised in their documentation to you from the banking supervision department, March 2008, included their concerns for security of loans, reluctance of large developers to provide an independently-certified net worth statement, group exposures, that UBIL understanding of the wider group is extremely disappointing, wider group liquidity, the bank not at a position to have full understanding of liquidity, the lack of robust credit review and a 15-month gap between inspections, which the regulator wanted to have at least annually, the absence of valuations, no forward-looking cash flow statement, no development cash flow statements, no information for the purpose of potential equity release and the extent which UBIL expected its relationship managers to be aware of the purpose of funds being sought from the bank.

What this programme tried to do was rally the flag and get, you know, the organisation united round a unified ambition to be the No. 1 bank.  And what these numbers were purporting was to say that if you were the No. 1 financial institution in the country this is what the numbers would look like.  So none of the shares that are up there, or indeed the numbers if looked at, the market leading position in the market at the time would've been different.  So, we were not seeking in any way to be bigger than the existing leader in the marketplace.  And so what these set out was what that ambition in five years, if we were to achieve the ambition of becoming No. 1, that's what it would look like.  Governing all of this is risk.

I don't ... in the time available to me I haven't been able to find a copy of it, but from the board minutes that I've been .... managed to get a hold of in Ulster Bank and First Active subsequently, again, I am satisfied that we answered the regulator's concerns.

On the individual file by file cases, we would have gone back to the regulator on each one of those, and, in many cases, as subsequent reviews have shown, we were in a position to be able to answer, and, in some case, correct the regulator's misapprehension about files, because when you look at mortgage files or loan files, they can be quite thick and lengthy.  They're not one page on a computer document or an A4 sheet, so there can be quite a degree of paperwork involved, and sometimes you need someone to guide you through it.  So we took these letters very seriously.  Every year the regulator would do thematic reviews.  We always brought them to the board, we always replied, we took action where it was appropriate, and the evidence of that is in the regulator's either lack of follow-up or follow-up subsequently, but these particular letters, again, were thematic industry letters, and the points that were made regarding Ulster Bank were addressed and followed up with the regulator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015050600002#KK01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cormac McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1430866800,"counter":873,"content":"<p>But, just to be clear, was Ulster Bank in breach, as per those letters notwithstanding they were sent to other people?

Therefore, we were comforted by that to a degree, in terms of why would we grow more than the market, and the second point was our incorrect assumption about continued economic growth.  The backdrop to what we were doing was, No. 1, we can grow by more than the other guys because we are smaller and can take market share.  It didn't transpire that way.

You yourself, Mr. McCarthy, summed up as follows, \"Despite Ulster Bank Group's significant growth during this period [that is 2004 to 2007] it is probably fair to say that the Bank's competitive position at the end of this period was, in reality, no different to that which it found itself in at the start.\"  Could I ask you, would it be fair to sum up the situation in this way or not, that you all engaged in vicious competition, you all massively overextended in terms of property loans, you created a huge bubble and crash that devastated countless lives around Ireland, and apart from short term profits which you had in a few years, you all finished up in mutually assured destruction?

We have had an office in the growth markets, specifically in Tokyo, since the mid-1980s, and have had a part-time presence in Sydney since the mid-1990s.  However, it was not until 2006 that we began our growth markets journey in earnest by establishing our first office in Shanghai.  Until the late 1990s, our efforts were almost exclusively concentrated on the US and the EU.  The US was and continues to be Ireland's main source of foreign direct investment, FDI.  In the late 1990s, though, matters changed.  There was a shift eastwards and the emerging markets began generating significant levels of FDI.  IDA Ireland needed to adapt and change to reflect the change in the investment environment.<\/p> <p>  With this in mind, we began our growth markets journey by setting up our first office in Shanghai.  In the following years, we built up a portfolio of offices in the growth markets region.  We followed Shanghai with an office in Mumbai, India, and a second China office in Shenzhen.  We went on to Moscow and opened a second Indian office in Bangalore.  We went to S&atilde;o Paulo in Brazil, Seoul in South Korea and Singapore.  Most recently, we opened a new office in the Irish Embassy in Beijing.  We also established a growth markets division in Dublin to support and work through the consequences of all of the activity in the marketplace.<\/p><p>In terms of measuring our performance, we set targets in 2010 of achieving 4% of all new name investments for IDA Ireland from growth markets regions.  From 2010 to 2014, we increased that significantly.  Last year, 20% of all new name investments for IDA Ireland came from growth markets regions.  Today, we have more than 100 growth markets clients who employ more than 9,500 people throughout the country.<\/p><p> We see growth markets as an excellent opportunity for the future of the country while recognising the challenges of operating in these environments, which are very different from the USA and Europe.  The primary difference is by way of business culture.  The business culture within each country is different.  There is a complexity of language across many of these economies and the reality is that Ireland is relatively unknown in many of them.  The geographies are absolutely vast and populations are measured in billions, not millions.  At the same time, there are millions of trading companies through which we have to navigate.  It is a complex market.  The other significant challenge is that there are no direct air links with some of our major markets.  Despite these challenges, there is a compelling investment case for IDA Ireland for the future from these markets and we need to box clever in terms of how we work out there to maximise our impact.  In the growth markets arena, we work very much as part of a team Ireland effort.  There are not that many people representing Ireland in these regions so we work as a team.  We get very valuable support from our own Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and work closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance, the NTMA and Enterprise Ireland.  It is very much a team effort in these regions.  In some of the countries and in China in particular, government-to-government relations are a very important element of the business development case.  In that context, ministerial visits to these countries play a critical part in business development activity.<\/p><p> In approaching these vast markets, we aim to attract major brands and household names.  That way, we get Ireland and IDA Ireland associated with household names, which has an impact in terms of our further development.  It leads to more sustainable investment projects here.  We also develop special marketing programmes and marketing materials which are specific to each territory.  They are geared to the particular culture of a particular country.  In the presentation packs circulated to members, we have included some examples of different presentation materials in different languages.<\/p><p> In summary, increasing the share of investment from growth markets is an integral and critical part of the IDA's new strategy.  For 2015 and beyond, our aim is to increase significantly the level of investment we get from these regions.  That is a reflection of the importance we place on our activities in these markets.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015050600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Sharpe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430902800,"counter":1420,"content":"<p>I was conscious while reading the presentation of the drop in investment from Britain, which is the most dramatic thing that has happened in the past ten to 15 years.

The employment of 9,500 people in companies which have come from that particular emerging markets area is of great significance to our economy.  We often hear figures quoted about there being in excess of 100,000 people employed by US companies in Ireland.  We know that there are a similar number of people employed by Irish companies in the US.  Are there Irish companies with significant presence in those emerging markets and is there a chance to internationalise our business and our companies from that point of view as well?<\/p> <p>  Ms Sharpe mentioned the business culture and the complexity of language.  Is there enough being done at educational level, particularly in third level colleges, universities or institutes of technology, on the need to equip people for the business culture which prevails in that region and also in regard to proficiency in languages?  I know that some students are studying Mandarin in UCD, but how clued in are our education system, institutes and universities to upskilling people for those particular language needs.<\/p> <p>  Ms Sharpe mentioned that Ireland is relatively unknown.  I can imagine that to be the case, which takes me to the point that I am sure the people out there do not know that Cavan-Monaghan, the constituency I am privileged to represent, even though it is in this State, is part of Ulster.  Is there enough collaboration between the IDA and Invest Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Department or its promotion agency?  If we are to move on the potential of the Good Friday Agreement, and we welcome the establishment of the all-Ireland implementation bodies, there has to be scope and potential to market all of Ireland, all of our country, through one organisation, especially in regions where we are not known, where Ireland is relatively unknown, to quote Ms Sharpe.<\/p><p>I hope progress can be made on that issue.  I know that there is some collaboration through trade promotions and visits, but can we move it a step further to have much needed momentum?  The bringing together of two promotion bodies with a particular focus should help in areas where markets are being promoted.<\/p><p> When companies decide to locate in Ireland, I am sure there a number of ingredients that help them to determine to do so.  In what order would IDA Ireland put the determining factors in making such a decision?  Is the main factor access to EU markets, our skills base or the huge investment in research, development and innovation in the past 15 years or so?  While we have made great strides in leading research in some areas of activity, what are the key ingredients which bring companies to this country?<\/p><p> While I know that this area is not the concern of our guests, I hope they will bring back to their colleagues the fact that areas such as Cavan, Monaghan and other rural counties have a continued well founded grievance about the lack of IDA Ireland promotion of these areas and the lack of inward investment.  I compliment IDA Ireland on its ongoing successful work during the years, but we need a greater focus on delivering for the regions.  Years ago when I first became a Member of the Oireachtas, we were told that one of the huge obstacles in promoting an area such as Cavan or Monaghan was road access, but that obstacle has been eliminated.  The areas mentioned have a huge pool of skilled young people; I hope, therefore, that there will be a particular focus on Cavan, Monaghan and similar counties in an effort to attract much needed investment.  I do not expect our guests to comment on this issue, but I hope they will relay this message to their colleagues who have responsibility for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015050600002#D00500","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430902800,"counter":1427,"content":"<p>I apologise for missing some of the presentation, but based on what I have heard, I congratulate IDA Ireland on the phenomenal work it has done on behalf of Ireland Inc.<\/p> <p>  I apologise that, owing to the bank holiday weekend, I have not fully read the background documentation, but I have a couple of questions to ask.  How relevant to our guests is the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, given that there are probably other more important Departments in creating employment?  We are experts on Irish Aid, tackling poverty and dealing with problem countries, be they the difficulties of Balochistan in Pakistan to those in Biafra and Bosnia-Herzegovina, but none of us is particularly expert in trade or business.  Therefore, how relevant is our role in the promotion of trade?<\/p> <p>  Having been involved in the Dublin-Beijing twinning arrangements and visited China a number of times, including the time a deal was signed with the mayor of Beijing, I wonder if IDA Ireland sees a role for Ireland at local government level?  In particular, does it see itself having a role in capital cities with which Dublin has been twinned?  Our guests will be aware, for example, that Dublin City Council has a reasonably sophisticated international office which deals constantly with companies or visitors from all around the world, including Oman, China and elsewhere.<\/p><p>Does the delegation think we are adequately co-ordinated with local authorities?  Local authorities do excellent work in many cases.  Does the delegation think we are building on the relationships that were established under the twinning arrangements?

Does the authority play a role, for example, in education?  As we all know, there is a huge benefit to be gained from every foreign student registered in an English language or, better still, a third level educational institution.  Last week speakers attended here who were very critical of the uncoordinated behaviour of the universities and colleges of technology in these countries.

Does the authority confront, is it aware of or how does it handle institutional corruption?  We are aware that many of the countries in the world are emerging democracies.

We gained a lot of information from the encounter.<\/p> <p>  I wish to commence by congratulating the authority on the outstanding work it has done.  I note from its report that it had set a target of achieving 4% of new investments in Ireland, or companies investing in Ireland for the first time, to come from so-called growth markets.  The authority has excelled itself by achieving 20% of new investments which indicates its professional approach.  Such success gives people much desired glimmers of hope that the economy is improving.  What attracts many of those new companies to invest?  Deputy Smith asked a similar question.  US companies have told us that they are attracted by a corporation tax of 12.5% and the rate can be lower in a lot of cases.  Other people have spoken in terms of the quality of life, security, accommodation, schools, transport, public services, libraries, theatres and so on which is another package that the authority can sell to people.<\/p> <p>  Although we have been successful there has been criticism that many of the new jobs are on the east coast and around Dublin.  Is it more difficult, as one moves away from the major cities, to secure investment because certain regions lack particular services?  Growing public services, community services and cultural organisations will not only benefit Irish society but will also help attract foreign investment.<\/p><p>This is not just for the benefit of Irish society.  That is the link.  How important is this?  Does the IDA have a structured input in terms of what is lacking in an area?<\/p><p> Last week, I asked about the importance of the hotels and other accommodation provided for people from different cultural backgrounds whom the IDA brings to Ireland for the first time, that is, whether they are knowledgeable about those people's cultural norms when, for example, asking whether they would like a drink, pork or bacon.  These are simple matters.  Do we have specialist hotels?  Does this form part of the IDA's preparations when bringing people to Ireland?<\/p><p> In terms of new name investments from growth markets, particularly non-English speaking countries in Asia, is the approach taken to incentives the same as it is for the North American market?  How important is the continuity of the 12.5% effective tax rate when selling Ireland to companies?<\/p><p> Hundreds of growth markets clients are operating in Ireland and employ 9,500 people across the State.  Do they bring many workers with them from their own countries?  I asked the exporters about difficulties with visas and so on.  Is the IDA's co-ordination of this issue seamless or are there difficulties?<\/p><p> I can see the successes, but what are we getting wrong?  I assume that our committee's role is to make recommendations.  What could be done better?  Last week, the closure of a university's language course was mentioned.  Does this issue arise on the IDA's agenda?  How does it feed into the Department?<\/p><p> The all-Ireland economy was mentioned.  What co-operation does the IDA have with its counterpart in the North?  We sell Ireland on an all-Ireland basis.  Many of our trade missions are all-Ireland.  When planning investments, do companies raise issues about the Border?  This and the European committees are discussing the possibility of Britain withdrawing from the EU.  How important a factor is that?  Will difficulties arise if there is a Conservative Government in Britain?<\/p><p> Are there structures for returning immigrants?  The exporters stated that they worked closely with chambers of commerce, but is a separate structure required in those countries?  Chambers of commerce attract a particular type of individual, but I am more concerned about people who attended language schools, worked or were educated in Ireland before returning to their own countries.  Is it important that we use their good will?  What of creating initiatives for former emigrants in Ireland who worked in the emerging Asian markets and so on?  The exporters stated that there was a great deal of good will.  A meeting could be pulled together.  As we grow more successful, this will take off, but is such work being done in those countries?  It is probably more difficult to do in Ireland.  Is there a role for such structures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015050600002#F00700","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430902800,"counter":1436,"content":"<p>Before turning to the IDA, someone has his or her telephone on and it is interfering with the communications system.<\/p><p>The telephone must be turned off and not just put on silent mode.

I welcome the IDA delegation.  Like other members I am well aware of the good work the IDA has done in the past, and continues to do.  It is probably not the witnesses' area but a concern I have is that we are a developing a two-tier economy, one in Dublin and one in the rest of the country.  There must be much better regional focus by the IDA than is currently the case.  Most foreign direct investments, FDIs, coming here - I dealt with the IDA regarding a number of companies that came to Wexford over 25 years ago - want to locate in Dublin so there must be active encouragement to get them to locate in the provinces, and that does not seem to be happening.  I do not believe the regional hubs we set up are serving the regions well.<\/p> <p>  It is significant that the IDA has increased to 20% investments from those developing areas.  That is a positive development.  Can the witnesses give us an idea of the figures?  They said there were 9,500 employed here but what about Irish companies that have enterprises in those regions?  Many companies now have bases abroad, particularly in Asia.  It was put to us previously, and I hope the witnesses recognise this, that in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, there tended to be an over-concentration on China but putting all our eggs in one basket, as we found out in this country, is not a good idea, be it geographic, sectoral or whatever.  That is my first point.<\/p> <p>  Second, the witnesses mentioned that Ireland was relatively unknown abroad.  What initiatives do they have to create awareness around Ireland?  In particular, have they considered the music industry?  I have been on holidays in Indonesia and other parts of Asia and I am always struck by the fact that people will talk to me in restaurants and so on about Enya, Chris de Burgh, U2 and other groups.  Is there any way the IDA could leverage that knowledge about our musicians?  When one engages with the people they do not realise those artists are from Ireland; they are just familiar with the names.  There might be potential in that area, and perhaps the IDA is doing that already.<\/p> <p>  Third, does the IDA operate as a one-stop shop?  Apart from attracting foreign direct investment, particularly in view of what has been said about the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union, we should be looking to diversify our exports.  One of the failures has been that our exports to Britain now are nearly as high as they were in the distant past when there was a stated policy intention to reduce the dependence on that market.  The proximity, the language and so on assisted in that but are we operating as a one-stop shop and helping those companies exporting into those regions as well?  The witnesses might expand on that.<\/p> <p>  My fourth point is to do with access.  A number of people mentioned that not being part of the Schengen Agreement can sometimes be an obstacle to attracting tourists but also business people here because of the bureaucracy involved in visas.  Do the witnesses have a view on whether we should be part of Schengen?  I find it difficult to understand the reason we are not at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015050600002#H00400","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1430902800,"counter":1441,"content":"<p>There is only one more speaker.

They differ depending on the company involved and the activity it wants to undertake.  The common theme throughout is probably skills.  One of the members of the committee asked if it was access to European markets which drove them to Ireland.  Access to European markets drives them to Europe.  It is a set of other characteristics, characteristics of Ireland, which attracts them here.<\/p> <p>  By and large, to companies from growth markets, with a particular focus on Asia, skills, not just technical skills but management skills also, are vitally important because many of the companies with which we deal are internationalising for the first time.  They come from countries where there is no real blueprint for internationalising.  There is no real superstar within their industry sector to which they can look for guidance.  They are, therefore, looking for skills in Ireland, including management skills.  They are looking for individuals who have previously helped US companies, by and large, to break into European markets.<\/p> <p>  I will touch on another question that was asked: what is the difference between our selling approach, or our messaging, in the US market and these markets?<\/p><p>In many ways our big challenge is to persuade our Asian prospects that the challenges they will face in growing a European business will be exactly the same as for US companies.  It is sometimes assumed in Asia that companies from the United States come to Ireland because they know Europe and that it is all somewhat homogenous.  However, when we discuss the details and the fact that the European Union is a single market with 26 flavours of legislation, language and cultures, the complexities become apparent.  The skills that have been developed in Ireland to help US companies build their European businesses are also relevant to Asian companies.<\/p><p> Where investments have a business development theme, management skills are important.  Technical skills and expertise emanating from the research community are also important.  Huawei, a large Chinese electronics company and the second largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment in the world, was drawn to Ireland by our skills in an area of telecommunications known as automated support systems.  It viewed Ireland as being world class in that field thanks to a mixture of multinational and indigenous companies operating in that area.  <\/p><p> While skills top the list, they are followed by telecommunications and transport infrastructure.  Most Asian markets are brand aware, not only in consumer activities but also in terms of investment decisions.  They like to know who else has invested in Ireland.  <\/p><p> Tax is probably fourth on the list for the companies with which we engage in growth markets.  Our tax regime is probably largely symbolic for these companies because it indicates consistency in Government policy.  A change to the policy would indicate that other aspects of legislation were orienting towards the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015050600002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Nolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430902800,"counter":1450,"content":"<p>Ms Sharpe spoke about branding Ireland.

We work hand in glove with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the embassy network to build our profile.  This is probably more important in growth markets.  I worked in the United States before moving to growth markets.  A collaborative approach is much more important in areas in which we are not as well known as in the United States, with which we have done business for 50 years.  In China and India we are trying to build relationships at different levels, including business, cultural, diplomatic and Government engagement through ministerial visits.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to Irish music, when President Higgins visited China last December music was used throughout his programme to profile Ireland's culture.  Culture, music and books are very important in a country such as China.<\/p> <p>  We do not have a large diaspora in these countries, but we are thinking about the diaspora in a different sense.<\/p><p>We try to use people who have studied, worked or had relationships in Ireland.  The various universities try to get foreign students to become their students, but their graduates also attend these gatherings.  Each of the embassies will be trying to build a diaspora of that type.  The last time the Minister was in Mumbai, for example, one of the universities held a function that was attended by many of its graduates, in addition to potential new students.  We use that arrangement as much as possible to build connections with companies.<\/p><p> We absolutely encourage city to city relationships.  The more cities that have relationships with these countries the better.  As we are very small and unknown, we are in favour of anything that will add to our profile.<\/p><p> With regard to Irish brands abroad, ministerial and trade visits are certainly integrated.  I attended one in Australia last summer that involved a combination of IDA Ireland businesses, Enterprise Ireland businesses, co-operation and political meetings through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Visits tend to be integrated.  There were over 20 Irish companies in attendance during the Australian visit.  They actually show Ireland as a whole, including foreign direct investment plus the very good Irish companies which are operating.<\/p><p> An interesting point on China is that infant baby formula has helped to build Ireland's profile.  Some of the companies carry the tricolour on their products because they are made in Ireland.  Many Chinese people do not know very much about Ireland, but they know that we make very good baby formula.  Any initiative such as this concerning any brand helps us also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015050600002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Conlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1430902800,"counter":1454,"content":"<p>On education and the phenomenon of universities competing, are we doing enough in the case of foreign languages?

His flight was due to leave in three hours and within an hour his visa was in a taxi on its way to the Irish consulate and was brought to him to enable him to travel.

An initial start-up team does come to transfer knowledge and business culture, but the intent in all cases is to supplement staff with locally hired people and for some of those people hired locally to travel to the headquarters for knowledge transfer there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015050600002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1430902800,"counter":1474,"content":"<p>That is good news.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015050600002#N00700","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1430902800,"counter":1475,"content":"<p>How well is the IDA resourced in order to maximise its impact in the growth markets mentioned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015050600002#N00800","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1430902800,"counter":1476,"content":"<p>I do not know why the Senator is asking that question.

The geography is vast and our job is to be focused on how we apply ourselves to and do the work.  We have a strategy for each market and have an operational plan.  This means we must identify what sectors, sub-sectors, activities and specific companies we want to target.  We then match these with the capabilities of the people we put on the ground.  To give an example, China is huge, but what we target there is specific.  We target two sectors, international financial services, IFS, and information and communications technology, ICT.  Therefore, we have put an IFS specialist in the embassy in Beijing, because Beijing is where the decision-makers and influencers of decision-makers reside.<\/p><p>We apply the same  principle all over the markets.  This year we were delighted to bring on board a winning abroad team.  The initiative was launched by our own Minister.
