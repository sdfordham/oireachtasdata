We look forward to hearing their views on the development of coastal and island communities.<\/p><p>  The sub-committee was established to focus on the socioeconomic situation of these communities and on promoting sustainable industries.  The main industries identified by the sub-committee are aquaculture, island and coastal fisheries, inshore fisheries, especially sea angling, and tourism.  We have departed from the norm.  Since the sub-committee tends to be a smaller group, we can fit all the witnesses across the front and this seems to be more conducive to better dialogue.<\/p><p>  Before we continue I draw the attention of the witnesses to the matter of privilege.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>  We have no preference for who speaks first but we will proceed in the order that the witnesses are seated, if it is agreeable to everyone.

I have prepared some slides to go with my opening statement from the Marine Institute.  The ocean economy is very important to island communities and it is broad and diverse.  I will focus on the work we do at the Marine Institute to provide scientific advice on the sustainable exploitation of the marine fisheries resource.<\/p><p>  The seafood sector in Europe is big business.  It employes 141,000 people and has a fleet of 85,000 vessels.  The catch sector is worth approximately &euro;7.7 billion.  One important point about this industry is that it is centred on the coastal communities of Europe.  We can get a picture of the importance of the industry if we consider its value.  It is up there between Coca-Cola and Google.  More important, it is focused on coastal communities.<\/p><p>  The science that supports this industry is important as well.  We have data collection in Europe that is worth &euro;57 million annually, and approximately &euro;190 million is spent annually on fisheries research throughout Europe.  There is a large research vessel fleet, and many scientists and laboratories work on the bedrock of the seafood industry, the fisheries resource.  Another important point about the seafood industry and the fisheries resource is the vast demand for seafood, and that demand is growing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000003#B00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367327100,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Connolly.

It is useful to present to the committee, particularly with our colleagues from our sister agencies, the Marine Institute, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and our colleagues from Udar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, with whom we have an excellent working relationship.<\/p><p>  We understand that the main focus on is the communities&rsquo; socioeconomic situation and on promoting sustainable industries.  I will present on aquaculture, island and coastal fisheries and inshore fisheries.  I have a brief opening introduction and my colleagues, Mr. Donal Maguire and Mr. Michael Keatinge, will be happy to take questions later.<\/p><p>  I believe that the Irish seafood sector represents a tremendous opportunity to create much needed jobs in our remote, coastal communities as well as adding more export value to the Irish economy.  In BIM&rsquo;s new five-year strategy for 2013-2017, which will be launched in the next few weeks, we have set out key targets for jobs and value growth in the sector, which on realisation will have a very positive impact on the communities socioeconomic situation and, most important, on promoting a natural resource based on sustainable industry.  The importance we are attributing to this is reflected in our vision which is &quot;A scaled Irish seafood industry capitalising on the growing opportunities for seafood in global markets and providing sustainable employment in our coastal communities&quot;.<\/p><p>  The opportunity for Irish seafood will come from expected growth in market demand.  The Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, and the World Bank predict that the global population will reach 8 billion by 2025, and this will necessitate a substantial increase in food production to meet the demand that will be created by this population surge.  Coupled with the fact that the world&rsquo;s centre of economic gravity is moving towards the east, with more than half the world&rsquo;s middle classes living in the east by 2020, resulting in continuing income growth in Asia where there is a strong cultural preference for seafood, this means there will be a strong local demand for a product which previously had been exported.  Thus, it is our view that supplies into Europe, which is heavily dependent on imports from the east, will also be reduced.  Currently, Europe imports approximately 65% of all the seafood it consumes.  From a whitefish perspective, the volume is as high as 90%.<\/p><p>  I believe Ireland is strategically well placed, given its proximity to lucrative fishing grounds, to take advantage of this market opportunity.  The FAO estimates that an additional 42 million tonnes of seafood will be absorbed by the global market each year by 2030.  Given that world capture fisheries are at their maximum sustainable yield and will not, in all likelihood, alter significantly, the FAO suggests that additional supplies will be largely met by an increase in aquaculture production.<\/p><p>  While in the short term the continuing recessionary situation in key seafood markets such as Spain, Italy and to a lesser extent in France will make trading conditions more challenging, in the longer term the shifting of global seafood supply to the east will inevitably create shortages and thereby present opportunities for Irish producers in these important traditional markets.  Thus, either through developing new markets in the Far East or by finding niches in the traditional markets, there will be exciting opportunities for Irish seafood and Irish seafood producers to capture.<\/p><p>  The committee may be interested in some current facts on the state of the<b><\/b>Irish seafood sector.  The industry provides 11,000 full-time and part-time jobs in fishing, fish farming, processing and ancillary services including net making, fish distribution and a range of other activities.  As my colleague Dr. Connolly pointed out, the industry is predominantly located in coastal locations at some distance from other centres of economic activity, and the jobs are critical to maintaining viable communities in these regions.  By way of example, BIM has conducted studies on Killybegs and Castletownbere which illustrate the critical role and contribution of the seafood industry in both of those key coastal locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jason Whooley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367327700,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Obviously somebody has a laptop or mobile telephone placed near a microphone.

On behalf of my fellow authority members I wish to express our welcome for the initiative to focus on Ireland&rsquo;s inshore and aquaculture sectors.  The SFPA welcomes interest in the public services we provide.  We believe that our work is integral to the support and protection of a profitable future for these sectors.  In these, and all seafood sectors, SFPA&rsquo;s role involves the promotion, verification and, if necessary, enforcement of compliance with sea fisheries conservation and seafood safety legislation.<\/p><p>  The authority was established as Ireland&rsquo;s competent authority charged with ensuring compliance with both sea fisheries conservation and seafood safety legislation in Ireland.  This two-fold role sees us working with wild catchers and aquaculture producers and includes seafood processors up to, but not including, retail.  Key components of our work include inspection of fishing landings, co-operation with the Irish Naval Service regarding monitoring and inspection of vessels at sea, sampling of shellfish production areas, inspection of processing establishments, certification of exported seafood consignments, and representation of Ireland&rsquo;s approach to fishery protection and seafood safety at various EU and international fora.  The authority works with its sea fisheries protection consultative committee.  We are happy to report that the recent appointments made by the Minister to the committee included representatives of inshore fishing and the fin-fish and shellfish aquaculture sectors.<\/p><p>  With regard to the inshore wild catching sector, the vessels involved in the sector numerically constitute the largest component of the vessels in the Irish fishing fleet.  Approximately 75% of the 2,162 vessels in the Irish fleet are less than 10 m in length.  In general, these inshore vessels operate on a day-trip basis and target high value fish such as prawns, pollock, turbot, brill, mackerel, crustaceans such as lobsters, crayfish or crab, and shellfish such as razors clams, scallops or whelks.  The fishing gear used and fishing patterns of these inshore fishing vessels leave a generally light environmental footprint as their operating range and capacity is restricted by the size of the fishing vessels used and their vulnerability to bad weather and sea conditions.  The value of the harvest from these waters contributes significantly to the local economy of our coastal and island communities.<\/p><p>  There is generally a culture of compliance in inshore fisheries in Ireland.  For example, the v-notch and berried lobster schemes have proved successful initiatives in protecting and improving inshore lobster stocks.  In general terms, the SFPA has found a laudably strong sense of ownership and responsibility shown by inshore fishers in the conduct of their business.  That is not to say the sector is without compliance issues.  Fishing by unlicensed and unregistered fishing vessels continues to be something we detect.  It is unfair competition for legitimate fishers who have invested their money to operate their fishing vessels in a compliant manner.  Also, a small number of disreputable restaurants seek undersized lobsters from fishermen in an effort to maximise the profits they make from their gourmet clients.  Illegal commercial fishing for bass is also a problem in some parts of Ireland.<\/p><p>  The authority's role in verifying compliance with fishery conservation legislation is performed on a risk basis.  We tailor our inspection programme to ensure the best possible protection of Ireland&rsquo;s marine resources.  Inshore fishing vessels are generally viewed as being low risk given their catching ability relative to other fishing vessels.  There is no sector that  receives zero official controls, but the frequency of inspections increases with vessel size.  Collated 2011 figures of inspections of Irish vessels by the SFPA at port, or the Irish Naval Service at sea, indicate an average of 0.3 inspections per under-10 m Irish vessel per year.  The analogous figure for over-24 m Irish vessels is 6.8 inspections per vessel per year.<\/p><p>  To ensure an appropriate platform from which to base a meaningful regulatory support to inshore fishermen, the SFPA has procured its own rigid inflatable boats, RIBs.  The boats were purchased following a previous appearance by the SFPA before the Oireachtas joint committee where a committee member observed that we should have sea-going capacity for this work.  The authority works closely with Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Naval Service to maximise efficiency in promoting compliance with the management rules for the inshore sector.  While we cannot be at every landing point every day of the week, the often close-knit nature of the inshore sector ensures a useful flow of information to our confidential line which we follow up.<\/p><p>  Our legislative mandate includes an explicit role in promoting compliance.  The authority has identified particular challenges faced by the inshore wild catching sector when it comes to an awareness and understanding of its legal obligations.  The intricacy of the regulations, the frequency with which they change, coupled with the part-time seasonal nature of this work and absence of a representative organisation with whom we can discuss these issues can hamper overall compliance levels.  Therefore, the authority took the initiative to engage with representatives of the inshore sector in the south east to develop a comprehensive, user-friendly guidance document for use by the sector.  The outcome is a Guide to Compliance for the inshore sector that outlines in one document the key legal requirements for these fishers.  We printed the leaflet, including a leagan Gaeilge, and made it available free of charge through our regional port offices to these fishers.  It was printed on tear-resistant and moisture-resistant paper.  We have included the leaflet in the pack that we provided to the sub-committee today.  We have received reassuringly positive feedback from fishers.  I ask members to browse the leaflet and we are happy to receive feedback.<\/p><p>  The authority is committed to the minimal intrusion in the working lives of fishers and continues to put much effort into the  utilisation of remote sensing data to enable verification of compliance from a distance.  We have chosen to implement a derogation available to fishing vessels over 12 m for approximately 50% of the Irish 12 m to 15 m sector, exempting them from using electronic logbooks when their fishing patterns allow.  Recently, we made a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform proposing that we fund from our budget a pilot scheme to trial the use of small-scale, user-friendly data logging devices for use in smaller vessels.  They would facilitate demonstration of compliance with both fishery and environmental legislation.<\/p><p>  Within the context of the mandate of the sub-committee, and our competence in sea fisheries and food safety regulation, we can see some opportunities.  We see potential in harnessing the authority's vessel positioning to support particular marketing claims such as labelling fish as caught off the coast of west Cork.  We believe that the fish caught by the inshore sector have many unique selling points, particularly for the Irish consumer.  They range from its low food miles to its freshness due to short trip to its artisan attention to detail in primary handling to its direct contribution to coastal economies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367328300,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Mahony.

We believe the licence system should be reviewed and simplified.  It is critical that sufficient resources are made available to the appeals board to support its ongoing work programme.  We would also suggest a three-year development scheme for commercial aquaculture.  If that is done, we believe there are many opportunities in seaweed, mariculture, food and tourism development, especially cultural tourism.<\/p><p>  Traditionally, the coastal Gaeltacht communities have been dependent on the marine resource.  This resource has been integral to the overall economic, social and cultural development of the Gaeltacht.  It is imperative that every support and development opportunity is provided to these vulnerable marginal coastal communities to ensure their ongoing viability.  Such supports can be delivered in an integrated fashion through financial and development measures, which will create employment and local added value.  We believe &Uacute;dar&aacute;s possesses the required expertise and experience in local economic regeneration, enterprise development and the delivery of community-based and sectoral initiatives that support such communities.

They attended the joint sub-committee and spoke to us.  This is about the vulnerability of coastal communities, which has come to the fore in the context of the challenge of up-siding in other people's interests.  Deputy Pringle is from the constituency in question.  The fishermen's position is that the sea is full of fish, which they do not have the wherewithal to get at.  They do not have piers to go out to the deep sea, they are not allowed to fish salmon and they are ill-equipped to fish year-round for other species.<\/p><p>  We must consider this on a cross-agency basis.  It is a pity there are no representatives in attendance from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as one of the most significant deficiencies is the lack of infrastructure.  The chief executive of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta raised a fundamental point when he referred to licences but I raised an even more fundamental one in a previous incarnation, which was that, with the exception of Inishmore, there are few significant fishing licences in the islands.  That is for the simple reason that piers were not built on the various islands in time for them to acquire the licences in the first instance.  When I was Minister, we were trying to build a pier on Arranmore and got as far as the design stage.  I think the project has run into the sand.  Tory Island had no significant pier until approximately ten years ago.  Inishmaan had nothing that one could reasonably call a pier - it had a slipway.  Inisheer had a very poor pier at which boats could not be left during the winter.  Despite the fact that these islands are sitting in the middle of the Atlantic, many of their communities do not have the wherewithal to fish.  They lack either the necessary quotas or licences.<\/p><p>  As I have only five minutes, I will focus on a few issues.  What is the potential to increase the output of shellfish by semi-farming it?  I use the term \"semi-farming\" to refer, for example, to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and its ownership of the oysters in Kilkieran Bay where, since it took over from Gael Linn, there has been good co-operation with the local co-operative.  Mussel farming in Killary Harbour uses absolutely natural mussels which attach themselves to ropes and is not done in the traditional way.  What is the potential for inshore fishermen to increase their income through the various aquacultural processes, including V-notching, which do not rely purely on nature but are developed in a natural way using nature's own tendencies?<\/p><p>  Seaweed has been mentioned only in passing today.  What is the potential for inshore communities to develop low-volume, high-quality products from seaweed?  What do we need to do on seaweed rights?  There is a saying in Connemara about \"spite feamainne\" and neighbours who are having a dispute.  In the lore, an argument over seaweed rights is more bitter than any other argument.  Is there anything we can do through the Marine Institute to create further natural products, exploit different types of seaweed and move up the market chain?  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta knows my view that seaweed was a high-volume, low-value product for years, which I was anxious about.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is now seeking to move up the chain to a higher-value product.  Is there more we can do with seaweed?<\/p><p>  Given the constraints on fishing, is there more we can do on marine leisure?  Where does that fit into the picture?  Given that the sea is not privately owned, will coastal communities have a role in renewable energy?  If tidal or wave energy production develops, will it be the preserve of large multinationals while local communities have a purely employee role in the sector?  Is there significant potential to use the sea to create renewable energy?<\/p><p>  Can Mr. Whooley clarify something?  He referred to an upsizing of companies.  There are many small processors operating in small, isolated communities that employ people here and there.  Does he envisage a consolidation of the processing industry or is he talking about all of these small companies growing while a few large ones emerge in parallel?  I would be very surprised if someone were to suggest that we should get rid of highly successful niche companies which have established high-value, low-volume markets for their products.  It would fly in the face of what is happening in the land-based food industry, where we have Kerrygold and Glanbia operating alongside a hugely expanded artisan food industry.  Where does BIM see us going in that context?<\/p><p>  They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and a graph has been circulated which refers to 1,614 boats under ten metres in length.  We are here to discuss the owners of those boats today, not the owners of the large boats.  This whole issue is about the small boats.  How do we sustain those people and their communities?<\/p><p>  I have one question for the Marine Institute involving special areas of conservation.  From memory, I believe a bay must be surveyed before an aquaculture licence can be issued.  As a result, there are significant delays in issuing licences.  What is BIM's role in issuing licences and preparing bays, particularly bays which are special areas of conservation, for licensing?  There was a reference in another context to a competent authority.

I welcome the commencement of this engagement which if utilised properly can be hugely beneficial in terms of meeting all of our hopes and expectations.<\/p><p>  I come from a fishing community.  As such, I am conscious of the marked decline over the past number of decades in this sector, particularly in inshore fishing.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, for me, the 1,614 vessels are the most important given their connection with our respective communities.  The people involved come from, live in and spend their money in the communities.  One of the biggest disasters in this area of the fishing sector was the abolition of drift netting.  It has done huge damage, the knock-on effect of which has been felt by the crab, lobster, crayfish and gill netting sectors.  Pressure on these areas has increased as a result of that measure.<\/p><p>  I am acutely aware, having played a central role in it, of the oyster fishery in Tralee Bay.  Management of that fishery and sustainability of the crop has, despite all the pressures, continued to be a source of income to the 78 permit holders there.  It is down to management that it has survived.  Previously all involved in the sector, because we were fishing based on greed rather than quota and benefit, were exploiting it.  Despite this effort, I am concerned about pressure on the lobster and crayfish sectors in particular.  In this regard, I fully support the v-notch.  Some very close friends of mine are involved in the industry.  When fishing previously we fished approximately 100 to 150 round barrel pots, but currently these people are fishing 600 to 800 pots.  I understand people in other areas are fishing up to 1,000 pots.  They are doing this in order to make a living.  That is the reality.  The cost of diesel, insurance, boat maintenance and so on is high.  These fishermen are under extraordinary pressure.  While it is to their credit that they remain involved, it is a huge investment for a small return.  I know of people who have been hauling 600 pots a day for approximately &euro;50 or &euro;60.  <\/p><p>  My first question is to Mr. Whooley and is based on the current debate around aquaculture, salmon farming and so on.  Has consideration been given to on-shore facilities for aquaculture, in particular in relation to salmon?  I am told it is feasible.  I acknowledge there are differing scientific views on this issue and that it is often difficult to ensure the right decision is made when there are so many differing views to be taken into account.  For example, the IFI is totally opposed to what is proposed for Galway and is prepared to take the matter further if it goes ahead.  All of us have to make up our own minds.  We all want to see more people involved in the sector and the continued viability of coastal communities.  Currently, our coastal communities are not viable; they have been decimated.  The escape valve has been emigration.  A number of our inshore fisherman are dependent on non-Irish nationals for a crew.  The level of emigration is also causing a problem in this sector.<\/p><p>  On the restoration of the sea bass quota, I have received representations from various different groups, in particular the IFO, who believe the sea bass quota should be reinstated and could provide an income.  Has any consideration been given to this issue?  I would welcome the views of other delegates on that matter.  On aquaculture and other projects, those of us involved in putting together the presentation on natural resources consulted with many people.  Central to this process is local consultation.  The imposition of a particular measure on people without consultation can cause serious resentment and can be detrimental to the good will that may exist in that regard.<\/p><p>  Reference was made earlier to the labelling of inshore fishing.  That is a marketing issue.  Proper labelling and marketing of this fish could provide a great return for local communities.  It may also result in additional income for related industries within communities.  As far as I am concerned the elephant in the room is the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, the impact of which, in terms of quota, has been detrimental.  It has resulted in competition in Irish waters between Irish fishermen and fishermen from countries whose quota far exceeds ours, which, in turn, is having a knock-on effect for people in coastal communities.  We all know what happened in 1972-73.  This issue has never been properly addressed.  If we had an adequate quota we could develop an infrastructure and industry that would be of great benefit to Ireland as a whole and, in particular, to coastal communities.  <\/p><p>  On the SFPA, we have had our difficulties with it in the past.  I am taking the delegates at their word that matters have improved greatly.  It was stated that there is a great deal of consultation with the south-east, which I welcome.  As a public representative from a coastal community I am regularly contacted by people about the operations of the SFPA.  I am happy to take the delegates at their word that a lot has changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000008#G00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1367329500,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Members have posed questions to all delegates.

The example of how oyster fishing in Tralee Bay is managed, as mentioned by Deputy Ferris, is an excellent one.  The operation is professionally managed and there is a good working relationship among the individual fishermen.  It also has an onshore facility, from a hatchery perspective.  It is a good example of what can be done in terms of inshore fishermen moving from what is traditionally seen as wild fisheries to managed fisheries.  Similarly, the mussel farming operation in Roaring Water Bay mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is an excellent example of inshore fishermen, side by side with in-shore fishing, successfully growing mussels and supplementing their incomes.  There are other examples of this around the coast.  The difficulty for an inshore fisherman or small group of fishermen is our onerous, and rightly so in some respects, licensing system through which they must navigate in order to obtain a licence to farm.  I am sure Dr. Connolly will have more to say on the SACs, Natura 2000 and their implications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000008#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jason Whooley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367330100,"counter":26,"content":"<p>As Mr. Whooley has mentioned we have done a great deal of work of seaweed.  The most recent project funded by the Marine Institute under its research programme was administered by BIM on its behalf.  We have perfected the technique for hatching and growing seaweed so that one can seed lines, a bit like mussel lines, and put them out in the sea to produce special individual species of high value seaweed, such as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned.  There is considerable potential in this field.  As it is regarded as an aquaculture process it will require aquaculture licensing.  The first licences of this sort will be applied for shortly in west Cork.  We have done a great deal of work in the past with our colleagues in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta on using the existing seaweed resource and finding higher value niches in the nutraceutical area for it as an additive to various cosmetics.  Of course, some of the finest golf greens and some of the best racehorses run on seaweed by-products.  There is much work being done to try to maximise the value of the existing resource and to develop a new farmed resource.  The farming of seaweed is very big business around the world.  The Chinese farm millions of tonnes of seaweed every year and use it for a multiplicity of purposes, including shipping it to Japan, where it is used to wrap around sushi products.  It is an emerging technology.<\/p><p>  Finding sheltered areas on the Irish coastline may be a challenge but we have no doubt that it will be a significant industry in the future.  The important thing to note is that in the medium term - ten to 20 years time - there will be no single species fish farms.  We will be looking inevitably at multi-trophic aquaculture.  Ideally there will be a fed farm, which is a fin fish type farm, perhaps a salmon farm and a seaweed farm in the stream of that to make the best use of any enrichment coming from it and the seaweed will probably be used in turn to feed valuable shellfish or become an ingredient in animal feeds of one kind or another, including fin fish feeds.  There is no doubt that farming up and down through the trophic levels of the sea, starting with seaweed and then moving through shellfish and up to fin fish and integrating these into unified systems, will be the way forward for fish farming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Maguire"},{"type":"speech","time":1367330100,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Will Dr. Connolly comment on the competent authority?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000009#H00300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367330100,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I will respond to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's questions on the role of the Marine Institute and SACs.  The competent authority for Natura 2000 is the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  This is part of EU legislation, which Ireland as a member of the EU must comply with.<\/p><p>  The role of the Marine Institute is to work with our colleagues in different Departments and semi-State agencies and look at the risks associated with fishing activity in relation to special areas of conservation, SACs.  The best way of defining our role would be to give members an example.  The cockle fishery in Dundalk Bay is in a special area of conservation.  The Marine Institute surveys the cockles to determine the biomass of the cockles.  We define a management plan with the local stakeholders on the quantity of cockles to be taken out.  We must not just consider human consumption, but the food for the very important bird populations.  We need to define the quantity of the cockles to set aside, not alone for the fishermen but also for the birds that live there.<\/p><p>  In a sense we develop a management plan for the cockles in that SAC.  We want to ensure the sustainable exploitation of the cockles and that the birds have enough food to live on because they are intrinsic to the SAC.  We define a closed season and open sea and the best time to fish for these cockles.  Working with the different players, we come up with a management plan.  Our role would be to assess the resource, determine its size and work with the stakeholders to try to quantify how much we can sustainbly take out of the resource.  Between SACs and SPAs, there are 29 bays on which we are working at present.  To set up management plans and give the advice to the stakeholders requires a great deal of background data.  We must establish the benthos of the bay, the bird population and one needs all this information to develop management plans.<\/p><p>  I would now like to respond to the two questions from Deputy Ferris.  We cannot land seabass in Ireland.  It is a very frustrating part of daily life for fishermen when their colleagues from France and the United Kingdom can land bass and they cannot.  The bass population was in a serious state of decline and this triggered the stop on the exploitation of bass.  It was an Irish regulation.  The EU will establish quotas for bass across the EU, and the talk is that they will be introduced next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000009#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367330700,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Mr. Connolly mentioned the introduction of a bass quota.

My colleague, Dr. Connolly, has spoken about the Marine Institute's role in special areas of conservation whereas the role of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority is relatively circumscribed.  When the Marine Institute has issued a recommendation on what is an appropriate outtake, it is the authority's job to ensure fishers comply and take only what is allowed.  We can show that Ireland has a meaningful approach to special areas of conservation and the compliance of fishers within them.  There are logistical challenges in monitoring the outtake, including technological difficulties in transmitting information to a central authority in real time.  If Dundalk cockles, for example, is managed on a weekly outtake basis, to get the information collated on a Friday to be in a position to distribute quotas for the following week for individual vessels is logistically challenging.  We are looking at fit-for-purpose, small-footprint data loggers which might be appropriate for use in this area.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's question was really about who does what and where does it all stop.  I will walk the committee through the environmental obligations.  The two relevant EU directives - one on birds and the other on flora and fauna more generally - require member states to designate as special areas of conservation places with specific environmental characteristics which it is sought to protect.  That has been done by the competent authority for the purpose, which is currently the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, under Natura 2000.  There are various marine areas which have been designated, some of which are inshore and some of which are offshore.  Currently, the competent authority with responsibility for co-ordinating Ireland's overall approach in this area is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which co-ordinates the inputs of the Marine Institute, BIM and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority to produce a coherent approach to pre-designated special areas of conservation to allow activities including aquaculture.  In Deputy Ferris's part of the world, the Cromane Bay fishery was the first area to be opened under the process in 2009-10.  Dundalk cockles has been opened and Mr. Whooley mentioned Roaring Water Bay, which is another output of the process.<\/p><p>  I encourage Deputies to consider special areas of conservation from the widest possible perspective, which is what we try to encourage in our interface with the industry.  I will explain what I mean by that.  For example, an aquaculture producer whose production area had been designated as a special area of conservation saw that as a significant challenge and communicated that view evocatively to the authority.  He has turned that around, however, and now markets his shellfish across the EU as grown in pristine special area of conservation waters, designated as environmentally protected.  I will not say he commands a market premium, but he is certainly maximising the benefits of the designation.  Rather than to view designation as a challenge, it can be looked at as an opportunity.  Protecting a marine environment is a good thing.  The very fact that there is a lucrative, rich, traditional fishery in an area means it contains a unique ecosystem.  Protecting it is a good thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l O'Mahony"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367330700,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Mar fhreagra don Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, labhair s&eacute; faoi phobail beaga gan pobal gan teanga.

The main processor is a company we own outright, Arramara Teoranta, which harvests 25,000 tonnes per annum.  The problem is that while the Office of the Attorney General confirms that, as it sits below the high water mark, 98% of all seaweed belongs to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, it would be a brave Minister who would try to claim it.  It is a traditional issue.  To move to higher-value seaweed processing in the absence of establishing the claim requires substantial investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000010#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;amus Mac Eochaidh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367331300,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Thank you.

A number of points have been raised and I will deal with them in no particular order.<\/p><p>  Deputies Ferris and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned V-notching.  This is one of the few success stories we have and is to be commended.  Members will all be aware it is a co-operative arrangement whereby berried female lobsters are returned live to the sea and the State pays half the cost and the fishermen the other half.  There is a considerable monitoring input of this from fishermen.  This year, we will probably spend approximately &euro;80,000 on the arrangement.  This is not a plea for more money, but we are accommodating everybody who comes to us with regard to that programme.  With regard to our lobster stock, I echo a point made already in the context of seaweed as to whether we could get more from our lobster stock and other inshore fishery stocks.  I will defer to Dr. Connolly on this, but I think we all agree the chances are we could.  It is down to management.  <\/p><p>  Natura will provide a significant input into the management process.  Dundalk Bay was mentioned; the cockle harvesting in that bay is extremely well managed.  As Deputy Ferris said, management involves local input.  The surprising thing is that the fishery management plan under which Natura operates comes from the fishermen.  The State agency's role - certainly BIM's role - is to assist the fishermen in producing their plan.  That plan is then assessed by the Marine Institute to ensure it is compliant with the requirements of Natura.  The development of the plans has been a tortuously slow process.  We have looked at Roaring Water Bay and we are looking at Kilkieran Bay, Clew Bay, Lough Swilly and a number of other areas.  There is an ongoing process with the European Commission to clarify precisely how the whole programme will operate.  Other member states have laboured slightly and have lacked a deep understanding of the situation, but that is not necessarily our fault.  Some of the delay is due to the legislation itself.  It is a matter of interpretation.  Developing the plans has taken longer than it should have, but down the line they may prove successful.<\/p><p>  The question was raised as to whether we envisage enhanced income and benefit for local communities through more local ownership.  My personal view is that this offers an avenue for exploration.  A number of fisheries have traditionally been vested in local ownership.  Tralee oyster fishery and Kilkieran Bay have been mentioned.  Local ownership poses some problems.  It is like the old adage of the chicken and the egg.  The question is who will have first ownership and how will the process be managed.  It would be wrong to raise those intellectual barriers because that type of well-managed locally owned fishery can prove extremely beneficial to communities.<\/p><p>  Mention was made of the drift net ban.  There was never a drift net ban.  The ban was on weak stock fishing of salmon.  When and if those stocks return, fishermen will be able to use drift or draft nets.  It will not matter then if they catch them with harpoons.  The committee that looks at this problem year on year is the standing scientific committee, which was originally attached to the now abandoned national salmon commission.  The standing scientific committee carries out an assessment annually of the rivers, the conservation limit and where we stand in respect of the conservation limit.  I do not want to get into specific details, but I am aware that the committee had Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, before it previously in connection with Arranmore, and that the point would have been made that Arranmore seems to be at a crossroads, with fish passing by that are destined for a multiplicity of rivers, not just in Ireland but also on the continent.  A net put in the water there will not only take fish destined for a river that is in surplus but will also take fish destined for rivers that are, perhaps, not in surplus.<\/p><p>  There is an important point to be made.  In some of our rivers, where we are beginning to see strong numbers of returning salmon, it is vital that the new distribution is fully utilised.  Traditional wild-catch fishermen, along with their angling colleagues, must be able to enjoy the surplus.  We should not lose sight of this.  I do not wish to be unduly specific, but I will mention the Moy.  There are 26,000 surplus fish in the Moy this year.  This begs the question of who can access those fish.  We could have a valuable export market in wild salmon, which attract huge prices on the continent.  This is an issue we should look at.  Questions must be asked as to how the surplus can be managed and utilised.  We must ask whether there are new opportunities for traditional fishermen to devolve into managing an upstream trap with a smoking or processing ancillary business attached to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000011#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367331900,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I will make some general comments in response to questions put forward by the committee.  It is important that inshore fisheries are recognised as having special characteristics.  We have referred to their economic importance to coastal communities.  The environment on board an inshore fishing vessel is entirely different from that on a larger fishing vessel.  It is not the place to be weighing fishermen down with paperwork, electronic gadgets and the devil and all to monitor fishing.  We need to keep it simple, low cost and as practical as possible.  From that point of view we are looking at low-cost systems which we believe would be good for and well suited to inshore vessels.  Larger vessels have vessel position monitoring systems that operate using satellites.  We believe a low-cost equivalent could be achieved by using shore-based mobile phone networks, data loggers and so on.  This is far more practical and it is an easier option for fishermen.<\/p><p>  We need to emphasise the particular management of these vessels in terms of their fishing within special areas of conservation and Natura sites.  There is some work to be done in order that people understand that the fishing gear these inshore fishing boats use is not destructive.  Some people come to the argument with the view that the use of a small-scale dredge, a string of lobster pots or a small passive fishing net is destructive because they take a protectionist view of special areas of conservation.  It is important that the special characteristics of inshore fishing vessels are recognised.  It is an entirely different ball game to larger-scale fishing vessels using larger-scale heavyweight fishing gear.  There is something of a lack of understanding and it is important that this is dealt with as time goes by.<\/p><p>  Dr. Connolly from the Marine Institute commented on scientific assessments and management of out-takes.  There is also a need to manage the protection of identified marine organisms, whether a seaweed or a benthic species.  For this reason the SFPA is of the view that low-cost, appropriate monitoring systems are valuable because one can mark off a patch to protect a particular species while leaving the fishery active and exploitable.<\/p><p>  Another key point to emphasise is the role of marine spatial planning in the future protection of livelihoods of inshore fisheries.  We need to ensure that one marine activity does not impinge unnecessarily on another marine activity.  Inshore fisheries are particularly vulnerable in this regard.  They are also vulnerable to the misbehaviour of larger vessels operating in deep sea areas and we need to pay attention to that aspect of it as well.<\/p><p>  The issue of bass was raised, as was the challenge of getting a just quota for Ireland because of the catch-22 situation - no pun intended - and because we have a ban.  There may be some value in considering the recorded catches of recreational fishers that have been going on for years and have demonstrated the recovery of the stock.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has a long record of reporting catches from recreational fishermen and this may be something that could be extrapolated by scientists.  However, it is a tricky question to be worked through.<\/p><p>  There are some difficulties from the SFPA perspective in trying to work with the inshore sector.  Local consultation is fantastic and is the way forward, but we miss not having a representative body.  There are representative bodies for fin-fish aquaculture, shellfish aquaculture and various sectors involving larger fishing boats along the coast.  We can exchange messages and understand each other better by being able to talk to individuals.  However, we do not have that in the inshore fisheries sector and that is something we may seek to develop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Kinneen"},{"type":"speech","time":1367331900,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for their presentations.

How should policy be developed to assist and encourage inshore fishermen to diversify in these areas?  What must be done to ensure that we specifically target people who want to move out of inshore fishing?<\/p><p>  I have a general question on policy for coastal communities.  What policies should we be considering to assist and incentivise fishermen in communities to diversify?  It is important to ensure that people who wish to stay in fishing are assisted and that policy can be developed to ensure that can be done in a sustainable way.  Everybody referred to tourism in their presentations and that is important, but a vital part of the tourism product is seeing traditional fishermen at work in coastal communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000012#L00300","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367332500,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I welcome the different organisations and bodies that have made presentations here.  We are not talking about the fishing industry but only about the inshore sector, the islands, the coast and a specific issue concerning aquaculture.  The organisations have given some very useful information.  It gives an optimistic view of the potential that lies off our shores, which many living on the coast have known for decades.  Some may not recognise it, but managed well, it has the potential to create a lot of economic activity in areas which the IDA and Enterprise Ireland largely ignore.  That is why it is important that we get accurate information and that the projections are sustainable and will lead to achievable policies for those communities.<\/p><p>  Many of our inshore fisheries aim at non-TAC species, for which there is no quota.  Can Dr. Connolly see any way for his organisation, the Marine Institute, to support further an inshore sector that would not be affected by TACs?  He might also outline some of the issues that have arisen.  Where I come from I often hear that the science does not match the experience or the perception.  There is a lag.  I know the present Minister is serious in saying that where the science supports it he will look for an increase in quotas, but not where the science does not support it.  We are dealing then with the precautionary principle.  Will Dr. Connolly outline for us how long it takes, typically, from the point at which the Marine Institute identifies an issue for it to go to ISIS-Fish, or through the Commission, the Council and the whole EU structure, before coming back to the Irish legislature through an instrument that can be used on the ground?  Our perception is that the process takes up to four years.  That is a pinch point on which coastal communities need some clarification.  It is interesting that Dr. Connolly identified two of the most valuable stocks, and there are many, maybe 30 or 40.  Historically, mackerel sustained inshore communities, but now it is in the offshore sector.  Does Dr. Connolly see any potential, using the science he has studied, to allow the development of an inshore fishery that is not covered by TAC?<\/p><p>  I have some questions for Mr. Whooley of BIM.  Fisheries are quite limited.  By and large there is no great potential for increased quotas or stocks.  It will remain static.  The potential to increase our activity in these sectors is very limited but aquaculture has potential for coastal communities.  We are coming from a very low base.  The Norwegians and the Scots have been dealing with the same EU legislation as we have since 1973, the same issues with Natura sites and the same natural environment, the eastern Atlantic.  The same people are involved, they have come from the same base but they have done ten times more work.  They are years ahead of us.<\/p><p>  I reserve the right to raise this again if there is a second round of questions, but the big issue is licences.  Could we get some idea of the number of licences that have been applied for on Natura and other sites, if that data is available?  I am aware that there is a significant project off the Aran Islands, but we could spread this around.  It is becoming a serious issue around the coast.<\/p><p>  I was particularly interested in the presentation by the SFPA.  As the watchdog for the fisheries it has had a difficult job in creating a dialogue and mutual respect between the industry and the regulators.  I am particularly pleased that it has identified areas where the inshore fleet in particular would benefit from appropriate interpretation of directives or measures that the offshore fleet deals with every day.  I welcome an expansion of those programmes, particularly when one sees the number of vessels in the fleet.  There is no correlation between the number of vessels and the value of the landings.  Many have low overheads.  There is a living to be made, more or less, if they want to be left alone as long as they are licensed to do what they are doing and they are compliant and not having an impact on other people.  I welcome the SFPA's approach to this.  It might be useful to examine areas where this could be expanded to promote sustainable fishing.<\/p><p>  I am not as familiar as some members of the committee with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s and would like to know if it supports projects in onshore processing that would tie in with the inshore fisheries and add value to the work of the local guys who are landing there.  Would they have ownership or could they invest in their own processing facilities in those areas?  That would be very helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000013#M00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1367332500,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee.  Mr. O'Mahony talked about turning a potential disadvantage into an advantage.  A large proportion of Irish fishing vessels are under 10 metres.  We have 1,614.  Mr. O'Mahony said that there is generally a culture of compliance in the inshore fishing sector.  People land their fish, they go out for no more than 24 hours and they go after high-value stocks.  As a result the fish is fresh, unlike the fish frozen on factory ships.  Does that not present an opportunity to the State to market that in Ireland and internationally and to develop strategies to get those fish to international markets in Europe, where there is a demand for it?  What is BIM doing at the moment?  If anyone else wishes to provide answers I would welcome those too.

I refer to the general policy of displacement.  Could it be counterproductive?  Irish beef is marketed as a top-end product.  If we seek to market fish, in particular the types to which I referred, namely, from inshore fisheries, is that at odds with developing and marketing a mass produced product from large sea farms?

This is a fairly complex area.  To step back from the big picture, one of the guiding principles of the current CFP is that EU waters can be accessed by all EU fishers.  There are some exceptions.  Another guiding principle is that outtakes are defined per member state, regardless of from where they take them.  The CFP defines the outtake the member state can take from EU waters and, in general terms, allows access by all EU vessels to most EU waters.  The exception to which the Deputy referred is the protection of what would generally be regarded as the exclusive economic zone of the member state.  There are two sections measuring from the baseline, which is the high tide line.  There are divisions of six and 12 nautical miles.  In general terms, the CFP provides for a member state to protect everything up to its 12 nautical mile limit from, in our case, non-Irish fishers.  There is protection within the CFP for access.  Notwithstanding that access protection, the maximum TAC for member states remains.  It is just a matter of where it is caught.  <\/p><p>  We are getting into the complex area of Ireland's relationship with the UK, but I am happy to discuss them.  There are particular access rights for UK fishing vessels entering the six to 12 and the zero to six mile zones.  In general terms, they protect traditional fishery rights for people on the island of Ireland which they enjoyed prior to the inception of the State.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000014#N00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l O'Mahony"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367333100,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Reference was made by Deputy Harrington to the potential of inshore mackerel fisheries.  It should be noted that the outtakes of TAC species, whether taken inshore or offshore, all have to come from our national TAC.  BIM operates a select representative group of, I understand, approximately 100 vessels.  We take statistics from them and extrapolate them to model the outtakes of inshore fisheries, which we then model into the statistical returns given to the Commission and, in turn, to ICES.<\/p><p>  The good news is that a lot of the high value species are not TAC species, such as lobster and crayfish, and are not subject to such limitations.  There is great fishing effort limitation and the trend to use more fishing gear for fewer returns is a notable feature of what is currently happening.  It points to the need for good marine spatial planning.<\/p><p>  On the protection of velvet crab, the Deputy has caught me offside.  I am not in a position to answer his question but I will research it and revert to him.  I cannot quote him a minimum size for the species.

Deputy Thomas Pringle asked about inshore seafood products and differential labelling.  He also asked what needed to be put included in legislation to make this happen.  There are various reasons, but it is not for the want of legislation.  Deputy Noel Harrington referred to the fact that, in general, fishermen wanted to fish.  Inshore fishermen are not marketing experts; they just want to go out, catch the fish, sell them today and do the same tomorrow.  In general terms, that has resulted in it being a world market rather than a niche market.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Michael McNamara referred to the market for Irish beef.  Rather than legislation, we might instead need awareness and an appetite.<\/p><p>  It is fair to say local is the new organic with reference to produce.  There is an increasing consumer desire for low carbon mile figures.  The proximity of Ireland to the rich natural fishing resources and the lower volume of diesel used by Irish fishermen in the search for fish are marketing points that might have benefits.  We are in the middle of a recession, but the high-end food market seems to be relatively recession-proof and perhaps this should be considered.<\/p><p>  There is a need to improve the awareness of consumers.  For example, what does the term \"line-caught mackerel\" mean to the average consumer?  Are consumers aware of the benefits of it not being towed in a trawl?  Are they aware that larger fish, rather than the smaller fish, will bite the bigger hook?  This is an example to simplify a very complex issue.<\/p><p>  The question of freezing fish was raised.  The Common Fisheries Policy is extending the fishery control regulation to the retail sector.  The descriptive labelling of fish as not previously frozen will become obligatory at retail level.  This will give an advantage to this type of fish product.  I have observed marketing ploys in use in some member states for terrestrial food, whereby the food is labelled to indicate that 30% of the retail price is returned to the primary producer.  There are ways available that do not require legislation.  However, as a regulator, I have to express the view that we need the courts to take seriously any non-conformance with labelling regulations.  It must be taken on board.  I acknowledge that it is not the end of the world, but any non-conformance with regulations misleads the consumer and needs to be taken seriously.<\/p><p>  Will I deal with the other direct questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000015#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1367333700,"counter":52,"content":"<p>We will finish and then move to discuss BIM.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000015#O00300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367333700,"counter":53,"content":"<p>To reply further to the questions asked by Deputies Thomas Pringle and Noel Harrington about the benefits of inshore seafood and how it could be legislated for, the legislation at point of sale simply requires identification of fish from the north-east Atlantic, which means from Iceland down to Spain.

The legislation we regulate does not allow for inshore fisheries products to be labelled, nor does it provide for how it is labelled.

He asked about our role in the official control of exports of seafoods.  That is done at the processing plants located in Ireland.  This is a significant logistical challenge for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority as it involves visiting each processing plant to inspect each consignment.  We have a legal obligation to inspect and certify consignments.  We have to drive to each processing plant each time a plant has a consignment going to another country.<\/p><p>  Imports of food into the European Union is a matter attracting particular EU scrutiny because once food comes into one member state such as Ireland, it has entry into the entire European Union.  Rotterdam is the largest importing port in the Union.  We have two designated border inspection ports in Ireland - Dublin Port and Shannon Airport.  Ireland is a net exporter of food rather than a net importer, while the European Union is a net importer of food, being the largest importing block for seafood in the world.  In round terms, seafood makes up approximately one in five consignments of food arriving in Dublin Port.  I do not have exact figures, but I can forward them to the Deputy.  We do not work at the border inspection ports; we provide technical support for the staff of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who man the ports.  <\/p><p>  On the question of who inspects seafood imports such as shellfish into Ireland, live shellfish is not imported.  I note there is a representative present from the Irish health food association.  Ireland is a net exporter of shellfish, of which very little is consumed here.  Dead shellfish which have been processed such as Bangladeshi tiger prawns and Canadian frozen lobster are being imported.  These products are inspected at the border ports under a reciprocal relationship.

For example, we assist companies financially to introduce new machinery that would add to the shelf life of some of that raw material.

The figures are from a report of a standing scientific committee and are not BIM figures <i>per se<\/i>.  Unfortunately, there is no figure for the Shannon above Parteen.  It would not be a matter for me to discuss that with this committee, rather I would direct the Deputy towards the standing scientific committee who should make its full report available to him.  The point I was trying to extract is that there are a considerable number of wild salmon that are now available beyond the conservation limit, many of which are correctly exploited by the sea angling sector.  However, there remains an opportunity for the previous wild salmon catching sector, in particular those who did not avail of the buy-out, to access some of these fish.  That is an important point.  I recognise the specific difficulty that attaches to Arranmore because of its geographical location, but the wider point is more important, that there are scientifically assessed surplus fish.  We should be in a position to ensure, whether through diversification projects or otherwise, access to those fish for wild salmon fishermen.<\/p><p>  Moving on to the point about wider diversification opportunities in the context of training, the members of the committee will be aware that BIM maintains the National Fisheries College.  We have a campus in Greencastle and it has been established since the late 1960s.  We have a school in Castletownbere and we have two active mobile training units - we used to have three - which bring our training facilities right around the coast, in particular to those places that are far removed from Greencastle or Castletownbere.  Those dedicated professional staff have done a tremendous job over the years.  We do not simply provide training for fishermen.  We also provide it for aquaculturalists and work boat handlers.  We do passenger boat licensing for recreational fisherman.  The sea angling fraternity would do licences with us.  We are embarking on a new programme of extending that training deeper into the fishing industry at the deckhand level and on the day boat level.<\/p><p>  Specifically in terms of diversification, if the aquaculture sector develops, there is a need for more trained skilled persons to operate within that sector, whether it be to operate small boats, work on the farms and so on, and there is a range of training in which we would engage.  We look to colleagues to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to work with us, and they have done so successfully for many years.  We also have a programme with local schools at transition year level in Connemara.  It is a wonderful programme that we have run for many years.  We normally run a training course on Inishmaan each summer with the local transition year students.<\/p><p>  One of the analyses I did recently for a report for our parent Department involved examining the annual economic returns for the past three years.  These are provisional reports.  I sound a note of caution to the committee regarding the numbers.  It appears, as we might have expected, that during recent years we have seen a drift back towards the fishing sector on the part of people who previously may have had jobs in the construction sector.  Some 150,000 jobs were lost in that sector.  In excess of 500 people have come back into the fishing industry in the past two to three years.  That is an important and perhaps overlooked fact.  Those people need training.  We will never perhaps reach a point where we are entirely accident free in any industry.  If we have learned one thing from Iceland, it is that managing the stocks is not about bringing in rafts of new legislation.  We can bring in legislation that states &quot;thou shalt wear a life jacket and thou shalt do X, Y and Z&quot;.  Managing the stocks is more about education rather than simple enforcement.  We did not come here today with a plea for additional legislation.  We need to create a culture of compliance, which is a term the SFPA has used very successfully, to generate an ethos of training.  That is something in which we strongly believe.<\/p><p>  In regard to inshore mackerel, we have developed, as part of our inshore initiative over the years, a small but highly successful line of caught mackerel fishery, and we assisted the inshore fishermen with hand gurneys to catch fish by line.  We have become a victim of our own success.  Even a small boat might take 20 tonnes or 30 tonnes in a season but if we have 1,000 people doing that, that amounts to 30,000 tonnes, which is half the apparently huge quota of 60,000 tonnes.   At times one can become a victim of one's own success.  We should not limit this solely to mackerel; we have done it with pollock.<\/p><p>  In terms of the work of the committee, if we consider brown crab, shrimp, lobster, crayfish, whelk, razorfish and a myriad of these stocks that are not subject to total allowable catch and quota, I reiterate my earlier point that managing these stocks is not about bringing in rafts of new legislation.  Managing them into the future is about co-operation and creating consensus within the fishing community.  I believe, but I will defer to Dr. Connolly, that all those stocks, almost without exception, could produce a higher yield.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000016#P00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keatinge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367334300,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I will do my best to address the questions raised both by Deputies Harrington and McNamara about the potential for development within the aquaculture sector, the need to try to maintain the value of the products from it, and the question as to why the Scottish salmon industry, which has a volume of 160,000 tonnes, which started about the same time as ours, has been more successful in increasing its volume.<\/p><p>  On the question that if we are successful ultimately in building up one or more of these larger-scale offshore farms, are we in danger of somehow undervaluing the product from them, the answer to that is\"no\" because the intention is that these would be organic certified farms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000016#P01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Maguire","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367334900,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I welcome what Mr. Maguire has said.  The only currency in terms of getting the aquaculture industry to increase the outcomes from the industry is licensing.  It is the only game in town as far as I am concerned.  There is the willingness, the people are in place and the expertise is becoming available.  The international comparisons are frustrating, and Mr. Maguire explained the historical issues that have built up in that regard, but we still have a problem.  The baseline data are being compiled.  Roaring Water Bay, Castlemaine, Dundalk and other such areas are getting their baseline data in place but an issue remains.  For example, someone making an application for a licence in a bay that has already been dealt with such as Roaring Water Bay, and I do not know if licences apply there, will have to get somebody to interpret the environmental impact statement with respect to that baseline data, and that is not happening.  It is taking too long to get over that hump.  Mr. Maguire might give me some idea of the issue that arises in that regard.<\/p><p>  Another issue is that in some areas there are not any Natura sites.  The process on a site in western Scotland, from concept to harvest, takes two years.  In a non-Natura site here I am aware of applications that have been in since 2007.  That is very frustrating for those willing to make the investment, those looking for employment here and those who have concerns about the environment.  It is even frustrating for the opposition groups that are looking at this process for six years.  The perception is that one might engage with a process in the second year, even if one is objecting to it, and five years down the road it still has not been decided.  Many operators here just want to know if it is a \"Yes\" or a \"No\" in terms of the application.  I do not know how many licences it leads on to.  Mr. Maguire might indicate how long it takes to evaluate an environment impact statement, EIS, as part of a new licence.  How many licences are in the system that require that evaluation to take place?  That will give us some idea of how far we have moved on.

To avoid that the State has had to get involved in a long series of negotiations with the Directorate-General for the Environment bringing colleagues from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and other agencies, along with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to seek their agreement on the way forward.  That has resulted in this complex plan to try to bring the system back into compliance with the directives.<\/p><p>  Another problem that arose along with the difficulty with appropriate assessment was that our system did not have a formal way of declaring whether an individual project, apart from a salmon farming project, needed an EIS.

Deputy Pringle asked about seabass and whether the stopping of landings was a good idea.  At the time in question, the seabass stock was in a state of decline and people were worried about its vulnerability but that did not stop the trawlers out on the Celtic Sea from catching seabass.  One wonders, therefore, about the measure's effectiveness.<\/p><p>  This matter represents the classic dilemma associated with how one should maximise a resource.  Does one want to use the seabass resource exclusively for angling, with tourists coming to coastal areas exclusively for the fishing of seabass, with a view to protecting the stock?  On the other side of the argument, one must remember there are fishing vessels in the Celtic Sea fishing for whiting and haddock that catch seabass.  There will be a discard ban and this will force the issue as to how one wants to treat the resource of seabass and maximise its impact for coastal communities.<\/p><p>  Deputy Harrington asked about the perception about science.  There were two parts to his question, one on the scheduling of science and the other on the effectiveness of the science.  I will first talk about the schedule, making reference to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, and the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  The council deals with the provision of scientific advice to the European Union for the TAC species.  All the scientific analysis has been done for next year's quotas.  All the information has been gathered and we are carrying out the assessments of the stocks.  The advice will be issued in July for stocks such as cod, whiting and haddock and the remainder of the advice, on fish such as mackerel, will emerge in September.  The advice emerging in July and September gives the industry, which will be affected by it, a chance to examine it, determine its flaws and decide whether it agrees with it.  Ultimately, the European Union sets out its proposals for the next year in terms of quotas and TACs.  There is plenty of time for discussion.  The decisions are made at a meeting of the Council.  That is the position on the schedule.<\/p><p>  The Deputy commented on perception and asked whether the science is lagging behind.  A way to deal with the question is to give an example of what happened last year.  We work very closely with the industry.  In days gone by, science was viewed as coming down from the mountain with the tablets.  However, those days are gone because we work very closely with the industry.  If I had to show an example from last year, it would concern the prawn fishery in area VII, which includes the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea and the sea off the west coast of Ireland.  It is worth &euro;33 million and is our most important fishery.  We envisaged problems with the way in which the European Union was going to cut the TAC.  We said the stock was not in bad shape and that there was no justification for the cut.  With the industry, we received funding to carry out additional surveys.  The surveys were carried out last June and July in co-operation with the industry; in fact, the industry funded some of them.  We did the science but there were no guarantees with it.  We said we would give credible, timely and relevant science.  We were able to use the scientific data obtained in July at the TAC negotiations in December and this resulted in an increase in the TACs for Ireland.  Therefore, the perception that science is lagging behind and not relevant is no longer pertinent.  That we are working closely with the industry forces science to be relevant, to see the problems within the industry and address them.<\/p><p>  Deputy Harrington's third question was on aquaculture, research and the sea lice issue.  The Marine Institute publishes scientific information on various aspects of sea lice interactions.  It publishes in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  The IFI does so also.  There has been a lot of what I would call \"my science and your science\" trying to justify certain cases.  However, I would be very reluctant to comment further on that because, at present, the Marine Institute is reviewing the EIS for Galway Bay aquaculture.  Since it involves a statutory process I would prefer not to comment further on that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000018#R00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Connolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1367335500,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Perhaps the answer to the second question was the answer to the third.

We have sat down with the individuals at numerous meetings on this specific application at our offices in Galway.  We embarked on a comprehensive scoping exercise before we conducted an environmental impact statement.  The purpose of that exercise, and of the meetings we held with the inshore fishermen before we conducted the environmental impact statement, was to identify the issues they felt should be considered in the environmental impact assessment that was to accompany our subsequent application.  Having discussed with the scientific experts in the Marine Institute the issues raised by the fishermen, including issues relating to the spawning grounds for shrimp, herring and whiting in the vicinity, we are comfortable that this farm will not have a significant impact on inshore fishing activities.  In fact, the custom and practice is that very little of the grounds of inshore fishermen is taken up by other fish farms around the coast.  They can shoot their pots right up to the anchors of these cages.  That can be seen around the coast, for example, in the case of the salmon cages on Clare Island.  We are very comfortable that there will not be any displacement.<\/p><p>  It is important to understand that a project of this nature and scale is not without impact.  We are comfortable that we have done everything possible to try to minimise the impact on inshore fishermen.  If we are lucky and successful in our application, we will continue to work with them to ensure any minimal impact that might occur is alleviated by other measures.  We have discussed those measures and the potential mitigating factors with them.  We will seek to implement them as part of the model we envisage as we move forward with this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AG32013043000019#S03600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jason Whooley"},{"type":"speech","time":1367336100,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Is any other country proposing to embark on a similar project of this scale at the moment?

The environment action programmes have guided the development of EU environmental policy since 1971.  They provided a systematic approach in terms of tackling environmental issues.  They identified priorities, set targets and highlighted the need to integrate environmental policies with other policies.  <\/p><p>  The 6th Environmental Action Programme, which ended in 2012, worked towards establishing a framework for environmental policy within which a wide range of environmental legislation was consolidated and completed.  That covered a wide number of areas with the exception of one important issue, namely, soil.<\/p><p>  The question remains as to how committed are individual member states in terms of implementing the provisions of the environmental action programmes.  That is an area that must be addressed in the context of the 7th Environmental Action Programme being considered.<\/p><p>  I have been advised that the 7th Environmental Action Programme is more strategic in nature than the sixth.  I have been advised also that it sets out different priority objectives to be attained.  It is a very welcome development and I am interested in hearing today the way the Minister and the Department intend to meet those challenges and attain the priority objectives set within it.  It is also an interesting time given that we hold the Presidency for the first six months of this year.  It would be a nice legacy, in terms of Ireland's footprint on future European environmental policy, to have that issue dealt with constructively and, hopefully, before the Presidency concludes.

As members will recall from previous discussions with this committee, the Irish Presidency has an ambitious environment agenda in terms of strategic policy, a very heavy international agenda, and a significant number of challenging legislative dossiers.  With just over eight weeks to go before the curtain falls on the seventh Irish Presidency, intensive efforts are being made to achieve the targets set for it.<\/p><p>  Thus far, good progress has been made across the range of priority dossiers identified in the Irish Presidency programme and we are still on course to achieve First Reading Agreement on our key priorities.  Already, First Reading Agreement has been achieved on two dossiers - the amendment to the emissions trading scheme in so far as aviation is concerned and the priority substances in water file - while work is continuing on securing agreement on other dossiers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013043000003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Macken","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367328600,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Mr. Macken says the proposal is strategic in nature while also referring to operational issues.

To get a sense of where people fit into this, I have been looking at some of the practical things that have been done elsewhere.  The Haringey carbon commission report was a positive initiative which involved a whole community.

As a result of a commitment in that programme, a new waste framework directive on recycling policies and so on was introduced, which drilled down to member state level through directives and policies.  Member states also took their own initiatives.  The action across Europe must be broad in nature.  As I said in my opening statement, the Europe 2020 strategy sets the broad canvass, as does the European sustainable development strategy.  We published our sustainable development strategy last year.  The aim is to set a narrative that will appeal across all sectors.  As such, the programme is broad in scope and contains nine separate priority objectives.  It tries to draw together all of these strands in a way that will be meaningful to Governments and civil society.  The Commission set out to do it in that particular way and it has worked quite well.  We are trying to maintain a narrative that will mobilise and drive action.<\/p><p>  In our experience, one of the problems with the previous environment action programme was that it became too prescriptive in terms of the inclusion of many different actions, some of which went nowhere in the end.  It became something of a Christmas tree and took a long time to negotiate.  We believe the Commission, guided by political debate at European Council level, did a good job in coming up with a coherent framework that would drive and focus action up to 2020.  It sets the broad policy strategy.  It also, as the Deputy stated, identifies priority areas in which there is currently a lack of progress.  This is based partly on an analysis of the previous environment action programme, in which gaps not properly addressed were identified.  For example, in terms of consumption and production, we still consume too many natural resources.  The aim is to break the link between economic growth and the consumption of natural resources through, for example, the green public procurement action plan, which is a practical measure we introduced and which features again in the current programme.  It is a strategy that seeks to bring together all of the different strands to integrate environmental principles across all areas, be they financial or economic areas.  It is seen as a type of platform for driving the environmental side up to 2020 and to ensure that environmental action is taken and integrated in areas such as the European semester.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013043000005#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Macken"},{"type":"speech","time":1367329200,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Macken for his presentation.  Having read the background information to the action programme and listened to Mr. Macken's presentation, I have a couple of questions for him.  Perhaps Mr. Macken would give a brief explanation of the dossier on cars and vans.  We are currently experiencing problems with cars and vans, although they are regulatory rather than environmental problems.  It is an area that requires monitoring, particularly in terms of small businesses and what may be planned in that area.<\/p><p>  The main issue on which I wish to focus is that of climate change.  Mr. Macken's presentation states on page 3, \"As a flagship initiative on resource efficiency under Europe 2020, it sets out a path for advancing the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and resource-efficient future\".  Obviously, climate change legislation will have a huge impact in this regard.  Further down that page it states: \"The priorities listed in the Irish submission focused on areas such a greater integration of environmental principles\".  While there are only eight weeks remaining of our Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I would like to see a greater emphasis on climate change and the enactment here of the relevant legislation in this regard, which would make a statement to other European countries.  I believe we should use the remaining eight weeks of our Presidency of the European Council to try to accelerate that process.  I would welcome a comment from Mr. Macken on that matter.<\/p><p>  Climate change is front and centre of the nine priorities listed by Mr. Macken, particularly priorities Nos. 2 and 9.  On farming, forestry and our carbon footprint, it has been stated that up to one third of carbon emissions comes from the agriculture sector.  However, a mitigating factor in this regard is that feedstuff is not being hauled long distances, although that may not be true now owing to the fodder crisis.  Another mitigating factor is that farming takes place on open grassland and we have an extensive hedgerow system.  In terms of the action programme, how much work is being done by the Department in trying to assess this?  It is important we have an accurate picture in this regard.  I would welcome the enactment here of climate change legislation and for Ireland to be seen to be leading the way on this issue.  However, it is important we have an accurate and true assessment of where we are at in terms of carbon emissions and agriculture, taking into account the mitigating factors that may benefit the agri-food sector.  We do not want to have a negative impact on that sector if there is no need.  I would welcome a comment from Mr. Macken on that matter.<\/p><p>  What struck me about the priorities - Mr. Macken's response may be that what I am concerned about is already provided for in the detail of the priorities - is that there is no reference to the need to improve the efficiency of buildings, particularly homes.  Most people will be aware that many of the buildings and homes constructed here during the past 15 to 20 years do not contain wall insulation.  People are now having to have their homes insulated because developers and builders who made a fortune during that time did not put even cheap insulation in the cavities.  As such, we are playing catch-up in this area.  Also, our energy bill is huge and we are using an enormous amount of fossil fuel, much of which is imported, and this is affecting our economy, environment, household budgets and so on.  I believe this issue should be highlighted and included as a priority at European level.  We should also do our bit in terms of catching up in this area.  While I do not have detailed data on this, in my view, other European countries are way ahead of us.  As a northern European country, we have an obligation to catch up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013043000005#E00300","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367329800,"counter":157,"content":"<p>The idea of resource efficiency is integral to the whole process.  It is a question of embedding it in all policy areas.  The resource-efficiency benefits are substantial in terms of achieving greening of the economy.  There is much potential for jobs.  It is not just the environment sector that is saying this.  The OECD has produced a lot of work on this subject.  It has a publication called Towards Green Growth which states that, on a global basis and certainly on a European basis, it will not be possible to achieve previous levels of growth until we successfully address this issue.  We must take into account the environmental impact of whatever we do as part of the economic equation.  The cost must be factored in.  It is only when one does so that one can make real progress.  This is at the heart of the matter.<\/p><p>  Energy efficiency in housing is part of the equation.  We have done a lot in Ireland through the building regulations to improve energy efficiency.  There are grants and supports available for people who want to carry out energy-efficiency projects in their homes and buildings.  Buildings have been identified as comprising an area in which we can make significant progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner.  This has been central to policy for some time.<\/p><p>  We are not trying to put actions into the EAP.  This is an EU policy.  It spreads out and brings together all the various strands under which the detailed initiatives will be brought forward, be it through legislating on climate change, energy efficiency, eco-labelling or the Common Agricultural Policy.  These are matters for detailed discussion.  The mechanism does not in itself set targets; it seeks to identify broad areas and some specific areas in which we need to make progress.  Under member states' separate corpora of legislation, it will be a matter of making progress in these areas.  There are responsibilities placed on the European Union but there are also responsibilities placed on member states.  Housing, for example, is not a competence of the European Union, nor is spatial planning.  It is by working together and individually that member states can achieve progress.<\/p><p>  With regard to the climate change Bill, the outline heads and final climate policy report by the NESC secretariat are to be considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and various stakeholders.  The Oireachtas will facilitate the debate on national policy and legislation in response to the outline heads of the Bill.  The Oireachtas committee has requested submissions from interested individuals and groups.  The closing date is 30 April.  The committee will be forwarding a report to the Minister by mid-2013.  The joint committee's report on the policy analysis by the NESC secretariat will be the key input for consideration by the Government in adopting a national policy position on the transition to a low-carbon future and finalising the introduction of climate legislation in the second half of 2013.  It is a matter of moving away from what is called the brown economy, which is based on fossil fuels, to a greener economy that has a lower impact on natural resources.  That is what we are trying to do under the new EAP and under Europe 2020 itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013043000006#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Macken"},{"type":"speech","time":1367329800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I accept what Mr. Macken is saying about there being a broad brush.

Mr. Macken referred to a brown economy.  Ours is purple; that is the fact of the matter.  While some progress has been made through Sustainable Energy Ireland and while there have been some improvements in energy efficiency, there are very many households and buildings, including public buildings, that are anything but energy-efficient.  Some of the county councils are trying to catch up but, unfortunately, we did not try to build energy-efficient homes during the building boom.  A considerable number of buildings are totally inefficient and we must now try to retrofit them.  As a State, we should do this.  In the medium term we could save money, and the project could pay for itself.

If there is to be a programme to 2020 and there is no action in it on soils, it becomes an inaction plan rather than an action plan.  A substantial number of countries have blocked legislation that the Commission introduced in 2006.  A blocking minority is made up of some very large countries, including the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom and France.  These are some of the key countries.  The Commission is still very much committed to the legislation, so there are two irreconcilable positions.

We are trying to tackle this and come up with a language that we believe might work.  We cannot say with confidence yet how it will work.

There was a chapter on contaminated land.  The European Commission was proposing that the very systematic assessment of contaminated land would be such that the land would be checked bearing in mind its former use and chemical analysis would be done to determine the level of contamination.  Afterwards, one would put in place a remediation programme for all sites.  A number of member states felt this would be very expensive and difficult and that it was not a case of good prioritisation.  Many of the major member states felt it was a question of going to the sites that they knew presented serious risks and which would pose a danger to the population if they were used for schools, for example.  They are very much against checking everything more or less in the same way and they question the expense of remediation at the sites.  That is the main reason for the blockage.  The member states are seeking a more risk-based approach such that they would assess the risk associated with the activities that took place on the sites and then determine what needs to be done based on the proposed new use.  This is the main difficulty.

We had a discussion on the issue of resource efficiency in terms of how to have greater engagement with the public and ensure greater trust in labelling, including eco-labelling.  We facilitated a discussion by a senior OECD person and it turned out to be an interesting debate in terms of how we could secure a buy-in.  It is all very well to say we want to promote a greener economy, the allocation of more resources and lower carbon emissions, but how do we mobilise public support in that regard?  There was a general discussion on that issue, which is indicative of the priority being given to it.  Citizen engagement is a live issue in the context of this proposal as it is being implemented.

The general public needs to be informed that globally - never mind here - we have moved away from the use of fossil fuels.  How will we have an energy source to enable us to turn on the switch that we are so used to turning on, be it for cooking or heating?  There needs to be a big discussion in order that people will engage.  One can read specialised periodicals and watch the odd television programme, but at Government level there is a need for a programme of citizen engagement, starting at primary school level.

It is interesting when we are in negotiations to listen to the problems other member states have.  Some of the eastern European states that recently acceded to the European Union have very high landfill rates, similar to what we had 20 years ago, and it is a question of them trying to come up to what is required.  It was a long road for us in that we had to put the necessary infrastructure in place and we had to have awareness campaigns, but one cannot have such campaigns unless there is progress on the ground.  Through the environment fund, landfill levies and the plastic bag levy, we were able to provide recycling centres around the country which enable the producers of responsibility schemes such as Repak to have very high recycling rates.  We have high recycling rates for packaging, about 70%, and level of WEEE recycling is more than twice the EU target.  With good awareness levels allied to institutional changes, infrastructure provision and development, one can move along and also create many jobs in the process.  There will be an opportunity for accession countries to create jobs in this area also.  Often low-skilled jobs in labour-intensive sectors such as recycling can be beneficial.<\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to moving to the next level.  We established a market development programme because we were reaching very high recycling levels.  It was aimed at trying to achieve added value for recovered waste resources and ensuring it would not all be shipped to the Far East and that processing would be undertaken here.  One of the products on which we concentrated was compost, for which we set a national standard in order that it would do what it said on the tin.

The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation brought out a document, Developing our Green Potential, but in compiling it it consulted other Departments, as we normally do.  We met many of the non-governmental organisations involved and asked them how we might create jobs.  People are actively engaged on the ground on the issue of how to create opportunities locally, whether it be in the area of biodiversity or natural habitats, to talk about our own sectors - I am sure the same applies to others - through engagement.  The local authorities' reform structures are meant to facilitate and pull all of this together.  Some interesting things were in done in Fingal, for example.  Interesting work was also done in Roscommon.  We see it as people being able to make a contribution.

I have a few questions for him.  At the time of the Heads of Government and State agreement last June a statement was made on Ireland's legacy investment - or legacy debt in the first instance - in our pillar  banks.  What is Professor Honohan's understanding of that decision?  Much of the talk since then has indicated that until a final agreement has been reached on banking union, Ireland will not be in a position to get an investment from the ESM in return for the investment that was made at that time.  What is Professor Honohan's view on that?<\/p><p>  On the bank recovery and resolution directive, obviously in the case of Cyprus depositors found themselves being bailed in.  Professor Honohan said that a European supervisor of banks with responsibility for the resolution of bank failures remaining at the national level may not be a equilibrium in political and economic terms.  How could the Irish State make direct guarantees, as it has done, that a bail-in situation for depositors would never be countenanced in Ireland if, as Professor Honohan has said, no agreement has been reached on banking resolution under the banking union programme that is under way?  Could we still find ourselves at the end of this process agreeing to a set of measures on a banking resolution that would countenance depositors bailing-in in the event of a catastrophic failure of a financial institution in this State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013043000003#B00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1367326800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>The next questioner is Phil Prendergast, MEP, and the following two speakers will be Senators Reilly and Leyden as they have to be in the Seanad for 2.30 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013043000003#B00400","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367327400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and welcome the delegates to the committee.

In regard to the mortgage directive, how will it benefit Irish consumers who have unsustainable mortgages?  By allowing greater competition in the mortgage market is the EU repeating the mistakes of the past by encouraging reckless lending as the only way of gaining competitive edge?  Following on from what has been said earlier in terms of the European Council meetings and the need to break the link between the banks and the sovereign, many of the ratings agencies have said that while mortgage arrears continue to rise there is a risk that bank losses will exceed the PCAR assumptions and hinder the recovery of the banking sector.  The chief economist at Davy Stockbrokers said he expects the main Irish banks' mortgage losses to exceed the &euro;9 billion envisaged in the 2011 stress tests.<\/p><p>  Last week, as part of the discussion on EMU and strengthening our economic integration, Dr. Alan Ahearne and Professor John McHale appeared before the committee.  Dr. Ahearne mentioned breaking the link between the banks and the sovereign.  When I asked how we could go about doing this he mentioned the single banking resolution and said the stress test should happen sooner rather than later to show if the banks are under-capitalised as investors are worried about the uncertainly around the banks as opposed to the fiscal situation in Ireland.  When I asked from where more capital would come, he mentioned that, perhaps, some European fund could be linked to the single resolution mechanism.  In terms of bailing-in he said it was not clear if policymakers would choose such action in the absence of a general lender of last resort to the banking system.  Perhaps I could have an opinion on the bailing-in, the lender of last resort, from where potential funding to capitalise banks would come, and the stress test.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013043000004#C00900","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1367327400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for allowing us in before the Order of Business and our colleagues for agreeing.  I welcome Professor Patrick Honohan and his team from the Central Bank of Ireland.  Today is an important day as the Central Bank returns profits of &euro;1.4 billion to the State.  That is a successful outcome.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank is discussing the deposit guarantee fund at present.  Like Deputy Dooley I was taken aback that Professor Honohan in his position at the Central Bank, as a member of the European Central Bank, and, indeed, the Government would encourage, contemplate or support the Cypriot Government in taking a 10% cut or more from depositors.  That is something the Central Bank and the late Brian Lenihan protected here in the very critical period.  Were it not for that there would have been a flight of capital from this country and there would have been an enormous collapse of the banking system.  I compliment the Central Bank and the late Brian Lenihan on a very wise decision.  From a historical point of view as far as Cyprus is concerned, it has caused concern throughout the whole European Union.  That is the reason the deposit guarantee fund and a guarantee for deposits is vital.  There should be no doubt in the future that any of the 17 members of the European monetary union would be affected.<\/p><p>  The funding provided to the pillar banks and its release to small enterprises is a cause of grave concern.  What level of monitoring is being conducted by the Central Bank on AIB and Bank of Ireland?  I have experience of them doing extremely good work in releasing funds to small new start-up businesses.

Let us start with the whole question of breaking the link between the sovereign and the banks.  When we were discussing and negotiating with the troika in November-December 2010 that was precisely the problem, namely, the international markets felt they did not know how bad the Irish banking situation would get.  That is what it thought three years ago.  It did not know the scale of the losses.  The Irish authorities were trying to pin it down but nobody could be sure.  That was the tail risk.  We thought we might be at a certain level.  That was the picture.<\/p><p>  We constantly said to the troika that this was the problem and asked if we could find a mechanism whereby the tail risk would be absorbed by some larger entity that had the capacity to absorb it.  We were prepared to pay for that but these were risks which were difficult for us to absorb.  The answer was \"No, forget about it.\"  The troika said they were simple people and would only give loans.  There was no mechanism whereby it could take a direct capital stake in the banks or provide some insurance mechanism.  We did argue and take it up at all levels but all we got was \"Forget about it, this is not part of the portfolio.\"<\/p><p>  That was the reason we were pleased to hear last summer that the Heads of State landed on the recognition that European funds could be used in that way, not just to lend a block of money to, for example, Spain to allow the Spanish Government to inject capital into its banks but to provide the money directly into Spanish banks as an investment.  They get their money back, perhaps, at a higher return but it reduced the indebtedness and the leverage in Spain.  The Spanish Government did not decide to follow that route.  It did not ask for that.  It borrowed money directly as the Spanish Government and used it to recapitalise its banks.  It did not go our route because its problem was that, relative to the size of the economy, it was smaller.  It could say it did not need to do that and, in any event, there was still an uphill struggle to negotiate that.  It was an agreement in principle with the Heads of State that this could be envisaged.<\/p><p>  If one wanted the money fast, presumably one would have had to go down the old route.  That has not really been activated yet.  I admit that in public statements from different parts of Europe there has been push back from other important policymakers who say there is no need to do this in practice.  I regret that.  It has meant that the Irish Government has, as we are all aware, put a very large sum of money into banks.  Some of that is lost forever but some of it is there just to keep the capital of the banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013043000004#C01300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367328000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Does Professor Honohan have an assessment of when the capital assessment review will be completed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013043000005#D00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367328000,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Our current plan it to have it ready by September or October.  We are actually talking about that right now while the troika is here.  We are considering whether to stick to that, adjust it a little or align it with what is being done elsewhere.  One of the things that has been in our minds all along in the European context is whether we need to align our capital assessment exercise with that of the European Banking Authority.  It is kind of messy to do them at different times.  One ends up using different assumptions and slightly different presentations.  There can be confusion.  Another factor, in addition to the European Banking Authority, has arisen since we announced our intention to do a PCAR.  The single supervisory mechanism will also do a stress test in two phases - an asset quality review and the stress test itself.  I can go into the details if the committee wants them.  It will be a two-phase thing.  It should be completed before the single supervisory mechanism is actually operational.  Therefore, it should be completed by the summer of 2014.  The European Banking Authority will line up with that in terms of timing and methodology.  For good order, it would be great to align them all together.  However, that would leave it a bit long.  People are interested in the Irish banks.  The market is interested.  The lenders are interested.  Maybe we cannot really leave it that long.  We are going to land on that pretty soon.  At the moment, plan A is to stick to September or October.<\/p><p>  I think that covers the first group of questions, which related to bank capital.  I was also asked a number of questions about Cyprus.  It is a bit delicate to talk about what has happened in respect of another country.  I do not want to go into chapter and verse.  Nobody is very pleased with the whole way the Cyprus situation has been worked out.  Some elements of it are good and move in the right direction.  Some elements were very bad.  Some elements were just medium bad.  On the whole, I do not think it was the best day's work.  I was also asked what it means for us.  I do not think it means an awful lot for us, to be perfectly honest.  There are many different contextual issues for us.  We have done the job, basically, for our banks.  One might ask &quot;what about the PCAR?&quot;.  Basically, <i>grosso modo<\/i>, we have done the job.  As Senator Leyden said, it protected everybody.  It protected everybody except the taxpayer.  It protected bank depositors and creditors here and in Europe.  We have had many discussions about whether it could have been done more cheaply.  It probably could have, on the night.  They were protected.  It is not on, politically, to be thinking in terms of a Cyprus solution.  First of all, there is no Cyprus problem.  It is not on, politically or domestically.  It is not needed.  It is not desirable.

The two-pack legislation is coming down the line, but we still do not have the capacity to access any kind of shock absorption fund to help countries in financial difficulty.

When we were at school, if a teacher failed too many students, there would be a mark-up.  Surely there is a role in this instance for the authorities and the Central Bank to examine how the marking system is working and if it is clear too many businesses are failing to receive credit compared to the position in other European banks, perhaps we need to do something about it.  From speaking to business people in my county of Meath, including a businessman from Ashbourne who is trying to obtain funding for a business expansion scheme, they find it very difficult to gain access to credit, which they find strange bearing in mind all of the money that has been put into the banks and having heard all politicians talk about how much the money there is available for banks to lend.

I will start with the Chairman's question because we were dealing with that point.  It is not an easy one with which to deal.  He gave the analogy of a teacher and a headmaster or headmistress who would say a teacher was being too hard on the students and ask the teacher to lift their scores and to score them on a curve.  Our role is not exactly like that because in the Central Bank we do not claim to be super duper bankers.  We are trying to ensure the banks are run properly, that they are not moving towards a situation where they will cause losses for everybody and that they deal fairly with their customers.  We have all of the consumer protection mechanisms in place.  However, if a bank does not have the capacity to make good lending decisions, it will fall back in its profit performance and lose out on other customers, which would not be good for it either.  We do not pretend to check everything they do, but we do monitor how they go about their business.  Their big business in SME financing is to work with the customers who are exposed through over-indebtedness.  Members may ask what about new people, but the customers who are over-indebted are also the potential phoenixes and many of them have a variety of businesses.  One or two or perhaps a core business could move forward but it is being dragged down by a property development on the side and the borrower as a whole is not creditworthy.  What the bank has to do and wants to do in such a case - it takes many resources and a long time to do it - is to get a picture of the borrower's situation as a whole and decide that it cannot pay that amount.  It could have a good business in terms of the rest of it and sort it out in that way.<\/p><p>  Deputy Joe O'Reilly spoke about write-downs and write-offs, but more broadly what is required is a restructuring of relationships.  Borrowers may be able to pay off the debt over a longer period of time, but it needs to be structured in such a way that the viable elements can move forward.  We are so long into the crisis that one would think the banks would have done this by now.  They are getting on top of it and some banks are better than others.  However, some are very behind to this issue, while some are motoring ahead, but it is complex.  That is the area about which probably many of the complaints may have been heard.  People said they were not getting money from the banks.  The reason was they were deeply under water and their situations were complicated to work out.  We have been monitoring and pressing the banks to improve the position and get their hands around this aspect.  Very often it involves indebtedness to different banks or lenders, which is also true of the household sector.  There is unsecured and secured lending.  As members will know, in such cases we have been facilitating dialogue between the secured and unsecured parties to get them to agree to deal with the matter in a way that they will not be blocked and to avoid them saying they will not do anything until the other party does something first.  We have been getting them together.  We are working on the matter, but it is not a question of saying to the banks they have to ratchet up their approvals ratio.  If we do this, they will say the Central Bank told them to lend and then when things go bad, they will say the bank told them to do it and that it should bail them out.  They have to make the credit decisions.  That is not a great answer, but it is the best I can do.  <\/p><p>  I note Senator Terry Leyden has left.  The establishment of the Credit Review Office was an innovation introduced by the late Brian Lenihan.  It was innovative.  Some inspirations from operations in other countries fed into it, but it was a home grown idea.  It is a small office, but Mr. Trethowan has done a great job to sensitise the banks that the nation will be dissatisfied if they keep on turning down viable credit customers.  When an applicant refers what he or she considers to be a proposal that was turned down by the banks to the Credit Review Office, Mr. Trethowan will examine it and say it was not such a good proposal and that the applicant should go away or, in many cases, he will say it is a good proposal and that he will contact the banks and often they will say they will have another look at it.  It involves a surprisingly small number of cases.  SME lending forms a small part of the business of the banks, as they were into property and other things.  I do not know if I can say much more on the issue.<\/p><p>   Deputy Joe O'Reilly asked about European funds being used to augment measures.  The European Investment Bank is assisting.  There were blockages up until now because suddenly the ratings of Ireland and other countries were lower and started to block some of the programmes of the European Investment Bank because these programmes required a co-guarantee from the national government.  Some of these blockages have been removed and that lending is going ahead.  That is a wider initiative.  I do not expect banking union <i>per se<\/i> to lead to turning on a flow of resources in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013043000008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1367330400,"counter":212,"content":"<p>The difference between Microsoft and a bank, in particular a large one, is the issue of systemic importance to an economy.

One of the questions he asked was about exiting from the programme.  One year ago a couple of seemingly well informed people from abroad came to me and said we would not get out of this programme at the end of 2013 and that it was a joke.  I said to wait and see.  Now the mood is completely different.  Why does mood matter?  It matters because it is about the NTMA and Mr. John Corrigan and his colleagues selling Irish Government bonds to people who know they will be repaid.  That is what has been happening because the Government has chosen a programme - one might not like it - to which it is sticking.  That is what is giving credibility.  At this point, it seems that exit on schedule is perfectly feasible; therefore, let us hope no great disturbances hit us from outer space.  That is plan A.  Of course, we can see how things go.  There are more gradual ways of doing it, but for now that is the plan and it looks feasible.<\/p><p>  The point Deputy Eric Byrne made about Cyprus is not coming to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013043000009#H00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1367331000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>What about the ratio of 123% of GDP?  Does Professor Honohan have an opinion on whether we can exit the programme with a debt ratio that high?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013043000010#J00100","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1367331000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I do not hold a strong view one way or the other.  There is no doubt that 123% is a high debt ratio but some countries have higher figures.  We got it down remarkably quickly before in the 1980s, if the Deputy can remember what happened then.  It reached a peak in 1987 or early 1988 and within 20 years we were down to a figure of 27% or thereabouts.  It will not be as easy the second time, but we can get away from 123%.  By the way, this figure includes a large cash balance which has built up and we are in a comfortable position to move forward and fund ourselves on the basis of our own credibility.<\/p><p>  With regard to the question of whether the Europeans help us, we are always talking about them helping us, but that is a little like the b&eacute;al bocht.  One must be sparing and careful in dealing with this matter.  When we entered into the programme, things were not as we would have liked.  I have already talked about insurance against tail risk, but we did not like the interest rate because to us it seemed very high.  We knew that it was what was available but that it could be negotiated downwards.  A lot has been negotiated and the term has been pushed out - Deputy Joe O'Reilly talked about intergenerational mortgages - both for the explicit loans and the promissory notes.  This represents a very considerable easing.  The lowering of the interest rate means that our worries about interest rate levels on the European loans have gone away and we are in a much better position than we were.  Should we be looking for more?  I am sure that it is the Government's business to look for as much as it can in as shrewd a way as possible.  Disciplined behaviour is the key in order that the other parties do not think that these are people who will never stop asking them.  <\/p><p>  One of the issues raised was whether should there be a fund or a way to mutualise debt in Europe.  This is forward looking rather than backward looking.  It is much harder to negotiate about bygones.  Part of the vision of the European Union, the fiscal dimension, is that there be a greater degree of common decision-making and, therefore, common responsibility and perhaps common mutualisation of indebtedness in the long run.  That is where this is bringing us, but at what speed I do not know.  It requires not just a greater move towards fiscal union but also the democratic legitimacy that goes with it, as otherwise it will not happen.  Borrowers and lenders must be satisfied about its democratic legitimacy.  This is one of the things, as I attend a European affairs committee, that concerns me most - that and what I used to experience in meetings 20 or 30 years ago.  The crisis has eroded trust in the European Union.  Those of us involved in European affairs, like members of the committee, feel this.  Therefore, we need to rebuild it, particularly along the fault line of borrowing and lending.  It can be done.  It is a challenging political process and presents a challenge to institutional design in order that not only do people trust each other as good people with whom to deal, but also that they deal within a system of rules and understandings that works fairly for both sides.  That is a big challenge.  The decision-making structures in Europe must also be improved because so many decisions have had to be taken in a rush late at night.<\/p><p>  One of the questions was related to a deposit guarantee scheme.  Let us take a look at the situation in Cyprus.  A lot of damage was done by the first decision to be taken.  The attitude was whatever about a deposit guarantee scheme, money could be taken from deposits.  On consideration, nobody thought it was a good idea.  People looked around and asked from where had the idea come.  I think it came from an inadequate process and the decision-making process was under pressure in unsuitable circumstances.  It will take time to restore confidence.  I do not know whether it has had that much of an impact, but people are talking about the matter.  I have often spoken to people about the components of banking union, supervision, resolution and deposit guarantee.  They chose to leave the deposit guarantee and did not view the matter as being urgent.  Now, because of what happened in Cyprus, there is no way the issue of a deposit guarantee can be taken off the table.  Of course, when it is at European level, people stop worrying about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013043000010#J00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1367331000,"counter":221,"content":"<p>On behalf of the joint committee, I thank Professor Honohan and his colleagues for attending and answering our questions.

Ours is a small, open economy and our assumptions can be turned askew by events elsewhere.  However, the forecasting record of the Department in the past couple of years has been better than that of the private-sector forecasters.  We do adjust and we are making a slight downward adjustment now because of new information released since I introduced the budget.  One can speculate pessimistically or optimistically but we are standing by our forecasts.  We predict a growth rate of approximately 1.3% this year and 2.4% next year.  I understand the consensus table on forecasting was issued today.  It makes exactly the same assumptions as the Department.  It identifies a growth rate of 1.3% for 2013 and 2.4% for next year.

I will move on to the next major challenge for the Minister, which will be the preparation of the budget for 2014.  I realise he will not deal with that today, but my question is about the framework within which the budget will be prepared.  Under the assumptions that have been made, if the Minister goes ahead with the &euro;5.1 billion adjustment over the next two years, we will reach a deficit of 2.2% by the end of 2015.  That is considerably better than the limit of 3%.  Under the ECOFIN recommendations the deficit limit next year was to be 5.1%, but the Minister is now projecting that it will be 4.3%.  Must the Minister achieve the figure of 5.1% or is he stuck with the nominal adjustment that is specified in the MOU of &euro;3.1 billion for next year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013043000006#E00400","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1367340900,"counter":242,"content":"<p>That is a matter that must be discussed with the troika.  For the purposes of this exercise, somewhat in excess of &euro;1 billion annual savings arising from the promissory notes new arrangement is inputted here as if all of it will be dedicated to reducing the deficit.  On that basis one gets the 2.2% figure.  Obviously, however, if there are additional savings or if there are costs elsewhere as the year goes by it would be a matter for Government decision.  We have not decided yet.  There are no savings this year because the cost of the liquidation cancels the savings, but there are savings of approximately &euro;1 billion each year from 2014.<\/p><p>  There is, however, something very simple to which the Deputy and colleagues might not have averted.  Let us suppose I were to use all of those savings on social welfare or tax, for example, by cutting income tax by &euro;1 billion.  I would need the &euro;1 billion savings the following year to sustain the tax at the new level to which I had cut it.  On the other hand, if I were to use it for capital spending, I can keep spending it every year.  If I use the &euro;1 billion to build schools, health centres or whatever else one regards as necessary social and economic infrastructure, after the first building project is completed and the children are out of the prefabs and in the school, I can spend the following year's savings again in that area.  It is much smarter to use this, if we are going to use it, on capital rather than current expenditure.<\/p><p> There are some things in current expenditure which would also have a jobs and growth impact.  An example is something we discussed in the committee recently and in which Deputy Boyd Barrett had a strong interest, eco-friendly homes, the insulation of homes and so forth.  Any type of grant aid for that comes from current expenditure.  If one did something about repairing country roads, which probably need extra money now, that also comes from current expenditure.  It would not have to be all capital expenditure.  However, I am sure colleagues in the Government will be looking for a slice of it.  I am not sure whether next year is the year for that or whether we should press on with the adjustment next year and perhaps do something later.  It will depend on how the year develops and how we can use it best to restore and grow the economy.  Those are the considerations with which I will work as the year passes and we get more information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013043000006#E00500","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1367340900,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I assume the projections in the SPU assume no deal with the ESM on bank recapitalisation and legacy issues with the pillar banks.

Before I came here this evening I looked at the spreads.  I do not have them with me.  The ten year bond is down to the level where the five year bond was a couple of months ago.  It is down to approximately 3.5% this evening, while the five year bond is approximately 2.3%.  We are moving towards historically low rates of interest.  On the present trajectory, it appears it would be possible to fund all our requirements on the open market if we wish to do that.  However, there are other considerations.  We are looking at a deficit of approximately &euro;1 billion per month, and we need &euro;12 billion to make our expenditure match our tax take.  That is the gap.  There are also bonds maturing and we must roll those over.  The raw figure for what we need this year is approximately &euro;17 billion.  We still have &euro;7 billion to draw down from the European funds and the IMF.  There would not be a big advantage in drawing down those funds in terms of the interest rate applying, but the maturities on the European funds are approximately 20 years.  In terms of maturities, there is a significant advantage in accessing the European money rather than market money, even though there is not a lot in the interest rate.  I rely a great deal on the NTMA to make the calls on this.  We will see how it progresses as the year goes by.  However, we are in a good position at present, and there are cash reserves above &euro;25 billion in the NTMA .  That is prudence.  We saw what happened in Cyprus and the resulting shock wave.

I know that, linked with the European semester, business groups and others have long since been asking that the budget be brought forward from Christmas and it is welcome that is to happen.  Our fiscal targets were debated last summer following the fiscal stability treaty referendum.  How do the figures the Minister has produced today impact on these targets?<\/p><p> On debt reduction, the target for which we have overshot, I note that the forecast for this year is a reduction of only 0.2%, while for next year it will be 3%.  I am aware that the Minister has said projections and forecasts are not always accurate, but is there potential for a similar overshoot next year?  Why is the target reduction only 0.2% for 2013.  <\/p><p>  On the debt rule, I understand the target is that three years after we exit our programme, we will commence with a reduction of one-twentieth per annum of the excess over 60% of the debt-to-GDP ratio.  The figures show an increase.  Last year the ceiling was expected to be 119% of GDP, yet the figures now show a rate of 121% of GDP.  Therefore, there is a 2% increase.  How will this impact on our ability to achieve the 5% reduction year on year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013043000010#J00200","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1367343300,"counter":304,"content":"<p>On the information Deputy Dara Murphy is seeking, the answer is complicated.  If the Deputy looks at page 21 of the document, he will see the bar graphs and if he looks at the footnotes, they explain them.  Effectively, our position was so good this year because once-off events contributed largely to our getting from the target of 8.6% imposed by the troika to 7.6%.  These events will not be repeated in 2013.  The interest rate issue also comes into play.  Whether we will be at the figure of 7.5% this year will depend on whether expenditure will be below profile and taxes above profile.  However, it is too early in the year to say.  We are within the targets of our overall programme.  It is a surprise to see that such little progress is being projected on the deficit figure for 2013.  Our position is good this year because of once-off events last year, some on the savings side and some on the expenditure side.  There is a full explanation in the document.  The heading is 3.3 which deals with the transition from the deficit figure for 2012 to the deficit figure for 2013.

While it is &euro;300 million this year, over the three-year cycle it is &euro;1 billion, which is a significant base change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013043000011#K00800","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1367343900,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I believe he is right to save that in order to look at the possibilities for capital programmes and capital expenditures.  As they are non-recurring, it is easier to keep the tiller steady on the current account.<\/p><p>  On the debt levels and debt maturities, the financial press talks about skyscraper roll-overs and that sort of thing.  The fact we got an extra seven years on the maturities of the programme debt plus the rolling out over 40 years of the promissory note profile takes away some of the dangers on the skyscraper re-financing that will be occurring in two or three years' time.  I ask the Minister to extend rather than pull the punches with people at the ECB and EU over the necessity to get some retrospective creditor financing for the banks so the banks can actually be further capitalised.  My estimates are that they need a good deal more financing capital to absorb the losses that Ms Fiona Muldoon, for example, has flagged in SMEs on top of the mortgage losses, which need to be surgically dealt with.<\/p><p>  I would love to hear from the Minister what is his definition of \"exiting the programme\".  People throw out that phrase and, to my mind, exiting a programme is when all the available facilities have been used up, they are disbursed and one has then to keep in line with the conditionality of the ongoing commitments under the loan agreements.  Is that what the Minister understands by it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013043000011#K01100","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1367343900,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I suppose the simple way of saying what \"exiting the programme\" means is funding ourselves on the markets rather than through the funds from the European authorities and the IMF.

The other way is that the troika has gone home and is not coming in every three months to review what we are doing, and the conditionality of the programme has been completed.
