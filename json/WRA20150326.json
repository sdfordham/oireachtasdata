Access to markets.<\/p><p>By driving implementation of the actions in the new National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement we will double the jobs impact of start-ups in Ireland over the next five years, from 93,000 currently. <\/p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs details a number of the immediate key actions to support the Government's ambition and confirms the commitment to continue to identify new approaches which will enhance and strengthen Ireland's entrepreneurial ecosystem and ultimately create jobs e.g. the Start Up Refunds for Entrepreneurs (SURE) scheme will add further support to start-ups to grow and develop their business.  Actions are set out to expand reform measures to boost entrepreneurship across all areas of the economy and society.<\/p><p>The specific objectives for 2015 are to:<\/p><p>- Progress the actions from the National Entrepreneurship Policy;<\/p><p>- Utilise the New Frontiers Programme optimally to support emerging entrepreneurs;<\/p><p>- Continue to promote LEOs as one stop shops for small business; and<\/p><p>- Develop an action programme of support for pre-investment HPSUs.<\/p><p>I am personally driving and chairing the Implementation Group, comprised of senior officials from the key departments and agencies, charged with oversight and delivery of the actions set out in the National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs continue to provide a comprehensive suite of supports to start-ups and established entrepreneurs.  In the last few years Enterprise Ireland has supported approximately 500 new and early stage start-ups.  These are ambitious companies, with innovative products and business development strategies that will enable them to carve out a place in global markets.  The focus in the coming years is to continue to increase both the number of quality start-ups and to identify those start-ups with the ability to scale at an earlier stage.  Taking these trends together, and acknowledging the intensive focus that will be placed on scale and gaining commercial traction, an ambitious target of 550 new and early start-ups supported by 2016 has been set.  With 183 new and early stage start-ups supported last year, Enterprise Ireland is on track to achieve this ambitious target. <\/p><p>In addition the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have been established and are now up and running as the First-Stop-Shop<b><\/b>service supporting start-ups, business growth and jobs in the micro-enterprise sector.  Some specific initiatives in driving entrepreneurship under the LEOS banner include the <i>National Enterprise Awards, the Student Enterprise Awards, Women in Business Networks and the Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur competition (IBYE). <\/i><\/p><p>The first IBYE competition was launched in May 2014, with over 1,000 applications received by the 31 LEOs from entrepreneurs aged under 30.  The nationwide competition formed part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 with an overall investment fund of &euro;2 million awarded between County, Regional and National winners.  It is intended to run a second iteration of the IBYE.<\/p><p>Further information on LEO supports for business ideas can be found on the LEO website at .<\/p><p>The LEOs have continued to use Microfinance Ireland loan facilities to provide credit in this sector.  By end 2014 over &euro;6m in loans were distributed by MFI with 851 jobs supported in 413 businesses.  In addition to this activity the Government budgets have had a specific entrepreneurial focus.  Measures were introduced to aid cash flow, reduce the administrative burden of tax compliance and incentive job creation to name but a few.  While many of the measures were small in scale their cumulative effect has been to improve the environment for business to grow and develop and create jobs.  The work in each of these areas continues as does work on upgrading the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme and the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme on which I hope to introduce legislation to the House in the near future. <\/p><p>No one policy intervention will generate substantial impact on the entrepreneurship ecosystem, but various actions if taken together will combine to create greater synergies.  The overarching National Entrepreneurship Statement serves to co-ordinate all areas of Government policy in the area of entrepreneurship to drive these synergies and will deliver on the targets I referred to above.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":34,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA03200"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[12087\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA03300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the reason the State, in October 2014, communicated to the European Commission its support for the inclusion of an investor state dispute settlement mechanism in the transatlantic trade and investment partnership negotiations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1197","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":36,"content":"<p>Ireland was one of 14 EU member states that co-signed a letter addressed to the EU Commissioner for Trade, Cecelia Malmstr&ouml;m, concerning the public consultation on investment protection in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) that the EU Commission had undertaken earlier in 2014.

The themes in this year's Action Plan for Jobs build on the reforms of previous years in the areas of competitiveness, innovation and entrepreneurship.  The objectives and actions set out in the Plan are designed to achieve specific impacts such as in terms of jobs, exports and startups, market penetration and innovation, efficiency of public interaction with business, finance and access to talent.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing entrepreneurial activity is a Disruptive Reform in the Action Plan for Jobs for 2015.  Our key priority is driving implementation of the actions in the National Entrepreneurship Statement, which was published in October last year and to achieve the ambitions targets set out for a 25% increase in the number of start-ups and in the scaling and sustainability of new enterprises.  The Action Plan for Jobs sets out a range of actions that will positively impact on entrepreneurship namely.  These include measures to promote entrepreneurship in the areas of education and research, business environment and supports, innovation and access to finance, networks and mentoring; and, access to markets.  These actions are being delivered by an inter-departmental\/agency Group.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically in 2015 the LEOs will have ambitious and robust county strategies and targets for startups, enterprise engagements and supports.  We will build on the success of Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur competition in 2014 with a new 2015 Programme.  We will launch an Entrepreneur Partnering Programme.  The Startup Gathering 2015 will also be held in October, with events over five days in five cities.  We will support 130 new entrepreneurs via the New Frontiers Programme, support 185 Competitive and High Potential Startups. <\/p>  <p>  As reflected in the Action Plan for Jobs, a range of actions are also underway following Budget 2015 to support the self-employed and entrepreneurs.  These include supporting SMEs through changes to the Seed Capital and Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) Schemes.  The EII is being amended to raise company limits, increase the holding period by 1 year and include medium-sized companies in non-assisted areas and internationally traded financial services.  The Seed Capital Scheme is being revised and made easier to access, with eligibility extended to individuals who have been unemployed up to 2 years.  The new Scheme will be called &ldquo;Start Up Refunds for Entrepreneurs&rdquo; (SURE) and full details will be announced shortly.  We have also strengthened measures to encourage exports through improvements to the Foreign Earnings Deduction (FED).  The FED is being extended for a further 3 years until the end of 2017 and qualifying countries are being extended to include Chile, Mexico and certain countries in the Middle East and Asia.  The number of qualifying days abroad is being reduced from 60 to 40, the minimum stay in a country is reduced to 3 days and travelling time is being included as time spent abroad.<\/p>  <p>  A range of agricultural related measures are being implemented including steps to maximise available agricultural land with measures to encourage long term leasing.  We are also continuing to supporting the tourism sector with retention of 9% VAT rate. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly improvements in personal taxation will benefit the self-employed and entrepreneurs and support growth in demand across the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Low Pay","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA03800"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[12085\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA03900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on the Nevin Institute's Quarterly Economic Observer (Spring 2015); his further views on the finding related to earnings distribution and low pay, in particular the number of workers earning less than the living wage threshold; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>The Nevin Institute's (NERI) Spring 2015 Quarterly Economic Observer outlines the Institute's latest expectations for the economic outlook in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and provides a profile of the earnings distribution and low pay in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  NERI concludes that the economic outlook differs for both parts of the island of Ireland.  According to the report, an overdue recovery is gaining strength with ongoing improvements in the labour market, exports, domestic demand and earnings. <\/p>  <p>  NERI projections for the Republic of Ireland include strong GDP growth of 3.4% in 2015, declining marginally to 3.1% in 2016; consumption to continue its recovery driven by rising real disposable incomes; improving household balance sheets and a strengthening labour market and strong growth in investment.  NERI also forecast improvements in the economy impacting positively on Exchequer finances with the General Government Deficit falling to 2.7% in 2015 and 1.9% in 2016.  NERI project a steady decrease in unemployment out to 2016, with the 2015 figure reaching 10% and 2016 figure reaching 9.1%.  Also further employment growth of 2.1% in 2015 and 1.9% in 2016 is projected.<\/p>  <p>  The ESRI forecasts released this week are for both GNP and GDP to grow by approximately 4 per cent in 2015 and by at least 3.5 per cent in 2016.  Unemployment is forecast to fall to 9.7 per cent in 2015 and 8.4 per cent in 2016.  The strong expected performance in 2015 comes after the Irish economy grew by over 5 per cent in 2014.  The ESRI envisage continued strong contributions from investment, in particular, and consumption into 2015.  In this scenario, the ESRI indicate that the Budget deficit should decline to 2.3 per cent of GDP this year, with a further reduction to 0.3 per cent in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  NERI estimated an update of the Eurostat low pay threshold by looking at those employees in NACE sectors B to S excluding sector O and who are in firms of 10 or more employees.  Thus the 2013 median hourly wage rate estimate ranges between &euro;17.14 and &euro;17.25 per hour and low pay threshold estimate between &euro;11.43 and &euro;11.50 per hour.<\/p>  <p>  This government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to the well being of lower paid workers.  It restored the National Minimum Wage from &euro;7.65 to &euro;8.65 on taking office.  Having returned the economy to sustainable growth through transformational policies implemented through the twin tracks of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work, this Government is determined to ensure that the benefits of this recovery are felt by all in our society, both nationally and regionally. <\/p>  <p>  Almost 90,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012.  This increase has been in full-time jobs rather than casual or temporary jobs, with full time jobs accounting for 86% of the jobs growth.  Every job created is a life changed, a family improved, a community enhanced.  It is by increasing job creation that we can grow tax revenues and ultimately improve people's lives through better services and further tax reductions.  That is why we have placed job-creation at the very heart of the Government's agenda.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has established the Low Pay Commission, which will, on an annual basis, examine and make recommendations to the Minister on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time.  The Commission will have regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  Legislation to restore the Registered Employment Agreement structure has completed Pre-Legislative Scrutiny and I expect to publish the resulting Bill shortly.  Legislation has been passed and Orders made to re-establish Joint Labour Committees. <\/p>  <p>  The second element of Government's strategy is to reduce taxation on low and middle-incomes.  In this context, 410,000 low paid workers have been removed from the USC charge over successive budgets.  The Government is committed to continuing this policy of targeted tax reductions for workers in the next budget.  <\/p>  <p>  The third element of the Government's strategy is to introduce targeted welfare supports for people returning to work, and particularly for the low-paid. From April, the Government will pay &euro;30 a week to mothers or fathers returning to work from long-term unemployment for each child for the first year, and &euro;15 per week per child for the second year. <\/p>  <p>  For those trapped on rent supplement that cannot go back to work because they will lose their housing support, a new Housing Assistance Payment is being rolled out.  The assistance from the State will be based on how much you earn and not by your employment status.<\/p>  <p>  As a package, the Government expects these measures to have a transformative effect on incentives to work and on the wellbeing of those at work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1067"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA04100"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[12083\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA04200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on whether the adoption of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership treaty will require a referendum here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a Free Trade Agreement being negotiated between the European Union and its Member States and the US.

The report seeks to build on the success of the Low Pay Commission in a wider context of building an economy with fewer low skill, low paid jobs and more high skill, high paid jobs. <\/p>  <p>  The position in Ireland is quite different to the UK in that, in addition to the National Minimum Wage and the new Low Pay Commission, the Government has also legislated for Joint Labour Committees and has also brought forward comprehensive legislation to replace the Registered Employment Agreement system.  Both of these initiatives provide for rates of pay above or significantly above the National Minimum Wage that can be given statutory backing on a sectional basis.  Thus the Report's views of a wider remit for the UK LPC do not necessarily translate to a very different Irish position.<\/p>  <p>  Making work pay continues to be a cornerstone of this Government's agenda and the setting up of a Low Pay Commission is one of the key commitments in the Statement of Government Priorities agreed in July last.  <\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Bill was approved by Government in January.  The General Scheme, together with a Regulatory Impact Assessment, has been published on my Department's website and forwarded to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p>  <p>  The principal function of the Low Pay Commission will be, on an annual basis, to examine and make recommendations to the Minister of the day on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels. <\/p>  <p>  Alongside examining the National Minimum Wage, the Low Pay Commission will also be tasked with examining matters related generally to the functions of the Commission under the Act.  This work programme will be agreed by Government and presented to the Commission in February of each year.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the need to balance a basic statutory minimum pay rate that is fair, with one that is sustainable and which allows employers to continue to create quality jobs.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, a particular function of the Commission will be to ensure that any advice or recommendations it makes to Government is evidence-based; utilising agreed data, carrying out research and consultations with employers, workers and their representatives and taking written and oral evidence from a wide range of organisations.  This is to ensure that any suggested changes to the National Minimum Wage have minimum adverse impact on employment and competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  This approach proposed draws on that adopted in the UK where, since 1997, the recommendations of the UK Low Pay Commission have brought about a progressive increase of the minimum wage that has little detrimental effect on the functioning of the economy or labour market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1067"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA05600"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[12086\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA05700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on au pairs and domestic workers being paid the minimum wage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1197","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>Ireland's strong commitment to protecting the rights of domestic workers was highlighted last July when we ratified the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) Convention No. 189 on Domestic Workers.  Ireland is among the small group of seventeen ILO member countries that have ratified this Convention to date.  To mark the occasion of Ireland's ratification of the Convention and to help promote greater awareness of domestic workers' rights, Minister Bruton welcomed members of the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland's Domestic Workers Action Group, along with IBEC and ICTU, to the Department on 9 July 2014 for the launch of a on the employment rights of domestic workers in Ireland.  Ireland's strong track record in the area of protecting people involved in domestic work is evidenced by the fact that we were in a position to ratify the Domestic Workers Convention without having to amend our existing suite of employment rights legislation.<\/p><p>The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has undertaken a programme of inspections involving domestic workers, and continues to respond to any complaints received from domestic workers.  In addition, the Labour Relations Commission, in conjunction with the social partners, produced a Code of Practice for Protecting Persons Employed in Other People's Homes which recognises the unique circumstances that occur in the domestic work employment relationship. <\/p><p>There is no legal definition of the term &ldquo;au pair&rdquo; in Irish legislation.  However Ireland's body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees.  For example, the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 requires that any persons working under a contract of employment to be paid the statutory National Minimum Wage.

Since 2012, the Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) has put in place a comprehensive set of measures agreed by Government to promote job opportunities and employment growth in all parts of the country.  Almost 90,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Plan in 2012.  This increase has been in full-time jobs rather than casual or temporary jobs, with full time jobs accounting for 86% of the jobs growth.  While the proportion of Irish workers who are on temporary contracts rose slightly during the recession, reaching 10.5% in 2011, it has since fallen back to the pre-recession level of 9.5% and remains significantly below the EU average of 14.4%.  The CSO data for February 2015 indicates that the share of casual and part-time workers on the Live Register was down over 11% on February 2014, equivalent to 9,049 workers.  The cumulative decrease is 17,625 workers since February 2013.  The CSO data further indicates that the rate of unemployment has declined from a peak of 15.1% at the start of 2012 to 10.1% at end February 2015.  The latest Quarterly National Household Survey figures show that, for the year to end Q4 2014, the numbers of people in employment increased by 29,100, which was represented by an increase in full-time employment of 39,600 and a decrease in part-time employment of 10,500.<\/p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs process is working and the Government is determined that this progress continues so that full employment can be achieved by 2018.  In 2014, client companies of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland created 8,476 and 7,131 net new jobs respectively; this represents the highest levels of net new job creation by agency client companies in over a decade and most of this employment growth was in full-time employment.<\/p><p>The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs, which was launched on January 29<sup>th<\/sup>, contains a suite of 382 actions to ensure we deliver the promised 100,000 additional jobs by 2016, with the target to create 40,000 jobs this year.  Specifically, in 2015, Enterprise Ireland will target the creation of 13,000 gross new full-time jobs in indigenous firms.  IDA Ireland will target the creation of 14,000 gross new jobs in multinationals.  It is estimated that every direct job created in agency assisted firms indirectly supports another job in the wider economy thereby making a strong contribution to the overall target of achieving full employment in 2018.<\/p><p>While it is very encouraging that the majority of jobs being created are full-time, in accordance with the Statement of Government priorities, I have commissioned the University of Limerick to conduct a study into the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts and the impact of such contracts on employees.  The key objectives of the study are:<\/p><p>-  To fill the gap in knowledge that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and the manner of their use.<\/p><p>-  To assess the impact of zero hour and low hour contract on employees.<\/p><p>-  To enable me as Minister to make any evidence-based policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.<\/p><p>All sectors of the economy, both public and private, will come within the scope of the study, and a <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">wide range of stakeholders will be canvassed to contribute to it.

As the Deputy is aware Ireland continues to perform well in the attraction of new investment and particularly so in recent years as FDI inflows to Europe have slowed considerably.<\/p>  <p>  Total employment at IDA client companies now stands at 174,488 people, the highest level in the history of IDA Ireland.  The job performance took place against a particularly challenging European economic environment and changing corporate taxation landscape.  There were 197 investments in 2014, equating to a 20% increase on 2013.  There was a notable rise in new-name investment, with 88 new name investors in 2014. <\/p>  <p>  This highlights both the draw of large wealthy markets for FDI, particularly when the focus activities are sales and marketing, but also investor options across Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe and Western Europe for manufacturing, R&amp;D and business support services.  The range of countries competing for FDI in Europe demonstrates the intensity of the marketplace to secure investments for Ireland.  In Ireland's case, cost competitiveness, the availability of a dynamic talent pool and targeted sectoral focus, was underpinned by the strong economic management and certainty on the 12.5% corporate tax rate.  <\/p>  <p>  The US continues to be the largest single investor in Europe accounting for about 25% of all inward investment projects and job creation.  While Ireland is a very significant recipient of US FDI for contestable investments, competition with the UK, Germany and France, the major overall beneficiaries of US investment into Europe, is intense.  The proposed TTIP currently under negotiation could be transformational in this area.  There are potentially many benefits for Ireland from a successful deal but we must also be aware that such trade deals can impact FDI flows. <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland constantly monitors competitor locations and the value propositions they offer potential mobile investment.  Competitor locations differ depending on the sector of the mobile investment.  In this respect, IDA Ireland is continuously working to ensure that Ireland is the most competitive, innovative and relevant to the investment being targeted.<\/p>  <p>  Multinational companies account for almost 10% of the Irish workforce and are of crucial strategic importance for the economy due to the quality of the jobs involved, their export focus and the massive knock-on impact they have on the wider economy. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's relative cost competitiveness, corporate tax regime and available direct firm level financial supports remain critically important - but in reality they are no longer aspects that will substantially differentiate Ireland's offering for FDI over the longer term.  So in addition to maintaining a competitive offering in these areas we must at the same time redouble efforts to develop and reinforce the aspects that truly differentiate Ireland's offering in a context of intensified global competition for mobile investment.  With this objective in view, I recently launched IDA Ireland's new corporate strategy for the years 2015 to 2020 which aims to create 80,000 new jobs in the economy over the next five years.   <\/p>  <p>  We are determined to ensure that every region will benefit from the recovery.  I recently announced along with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, the details of a comprehensive new strategy to support enterprise growth and job creation at regional level.  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative seeks to build on the success of the annual Action Plan for Jobs process by developing locally driven plans that can build on the strengths and opportunities identified in each region.  <\/p>  <p>  The strategy will provide up to &euro;250 million over five years in additional funding to support regional enterprise development.  This includes the roll out of a five year, &euro;150 million property investment programme by the IDA to attract foreign direct investment into the regions.  This programme will build on the recent investment by the IDA in a number of advance manufacturing facilities in regional locations.  A further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be available to Enterprise Ireland to support enterprises in the regions to start-up, grow and export, thereby creating more jobs in regional locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Retail Sector","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA07700"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[12098\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA07800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans to act on the recommendations of the recent Retail Excellence Ireland and Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association report on building the all-island retail industry, North and South.

places ring-fenced on Community Employment (CE).  As of December 2014, there are 936 referred clients (292 female, 644 male) on drug rehabilitation schemes and 220 support workers (117 female, 103 male).  <\/p><p>There has been no change to the CE Budget for Drug Rehabilitation places in 2015 over 2014 which remains at &euro;14.5m.  This is based on the average cost of a CE place of &euro;13,000 which includes a budget for participant allowances (&euro;12.5m), supervisory costs (&euro;1.5m), material costs (&euro;250,000) and training costs (&euro;250,000).  The combined weekly wage cost for referred clients and support workers is approximately &euro;254,400.  The conditions relating to participation on CE are contained in the CE Operations Manual.  All CE participants receive a payment of &euro;208 per week while participating on CE and the hours are 19.5 hours per week or 39 hours per fortnight. <\/p><p>There are no key workers posts on CE Drug Rehabilitation Schemes.  The structure of a CE Drug Rehabilitation scheme is 1 Supervisor to 7 referred participants (a ratio of 1:7).  In addition, 2 support workers may support the delivery of the CE Scheme.  Support workers  who are job-seekers and over 1 year unemployed, comply with normal CE eligibility conditions and are referred from Intreo Offices.  Participants on the ring-fenced places must be referred by a recognised addiction practitioner. <\/p><p>The quality of a supervisor can be the single most important factor in the success of a CE drug rehabilitation scheme, together with the support of an active Sponsoring Committee.  All supervisors must be competent to provide coaching and mentoring to participants and ensure that relevant training or work experience opportunities are provided for participants in their path to rehabilitation and progression. <\/p><p>The role of CE schemes is to help recovering drug users to develop their personal and employment skills and to find a pathway back to work. Part of this engagement involves working closely with existing services to progress an interagency focus on education, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and training &ndash; five key pillars of the National Drugs Strategy (2009-2016) - for the advancement of the participant.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for ensuring that each person is appropriately supported through the rehabilitation system.  The supports are clearly outlined in the National Drugs Rehabilitation Framework Document (2010) and include provision for a key worker -  &ldquo;<i>the key worker is the named person who is assigned to work closely with the service user and provide a range of psycho-social interventions\/advocacy<\/i>&rdquo; (2010:11) and falls within the services and supports provided by the HSE.<\/p><p>A key feature of the Department's response in supporting CE rehabilitation schemes was the establishment of a key Drugs Stakeholders Group in 2013 which now assists the Department to identify and implement enhancements to the scheme.  In addition, training workshops have been held with the scheme supervisors and departmental staff to ensure that the schemes continue to meet the needs of participants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600026#WRA09400","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600027#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":99,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[12376\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600027#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if an increase in rent supplement will be facilitated in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":100,"content":"<p>The Department has not been informed of any change of circumstance for the client concerned.

Should the Deputy have specific instances in mind, I would be very happy to have them investigated.<\/p>  <p>  Intreo is the new integrated income support, employment and support service which is now provided by the Department.  Intreo, which was launched in 2012, has delivered significant office accommodation improvements with the conversion of 'Social Welfare Local Offices' into 'Intreo Centres'. There are currently 47 fully functional Intreo centres across the country with three further offices nearing completion.  Work is proceeding on the remaining 15 offices.<\/p>  <p>  The Intreo Centre is a one-stop shop for all income and employment support services where customers can access job-seeking advice, information on vacancies and income support services all in the one place.<\/p>  <p>  Long queues outside offices were unfortunately a feature when the live register was at its height but customer service has generally improved with the development of Intreo, and the streamlining of claims-taking processes with quicker payment times but also direct referral of jobseekers to a range of activation supports.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the response to the Department's Intreo project has been very positive as evidenced by an October 2014 report from the INOU which highlighted the steps being taken by the Department's Intreo process to reduce both queueing within offices and overall claims processing times.<\/p>  <p>  During 2014, the Intreo\/local office network processed some 500,000 claims, hosted over 186,000 at group information sessions (an increase of 50% on the previous year) and conducted more than 330,000 one-to-one interviews.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel with office accommodation improvements, the Department has also embarked on a significant system modernisation programme and has been rolling out improved systems to Intreo Centres which maximise the use of technology for greater efficiency and improved customer service.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to signing, the most important business improvement has been a switch to 'electronic signing'.  This system functionality now provides offices with the capacity to capture a signature on an electronic signature pad as part of the certification process for fully unemployed clients.  This improvement has eliminated a paper-based system and has introduced greater flexibility to the signing process.  In effect it means that jobseekers can now sign at multiple customer service points in the Intreo Centre with consequential reduction in waiting times and long queues.<\/p>  <p>  Intreo Centres now have the facility to respond immediately to emerging queues by opening and closing counters, as required, to deal with peaks which might arise at any particular time rather than being limited to having a set fixed number of counter points open.  This enables offices to reduce queuing times and provide a higher quality of customer service.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, it would be normal for Intreo Centres to stagger the signing times for jobseekers so as to spread out the numbers attending in an office at any particular time but also to reduce queues and waiting times. Where customers adhere to their allotted 'signing time', queueing is further reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600027#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Applications","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600027#WRB01450"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[12579\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600027#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if domiciliary care allowance is payable in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>The person concerned was notified on the 25th March 2015 that her domiciliary care allowance application was successful and that the allowance has been awarded from 1st January 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600027#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600027#WRB01650"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[12580\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600027#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if carer&rsquo;s allowance is payable in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 15; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer's allowance (CA) from the person in question on the 23rd December 2014.

The 'expenditure benchmark' as it is generally known was also referenced in the Fiscal Compact.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2016 will be the first budget that Ireland will produce whilst subject to the revised preventive arm of the Stability &amp;amp; Growth Pact.\u00a0 The rule under the preventive arm requires Ireland to be on an appropriate adjustment path to the Medium Term Budgetary Obligation (MTO) and compliance with this rule is assessed in two ways.  The first assessment requires a minimum improvement in the structural balance of more than 0.5% of GDP per annum until a Member State reaches its (MTO), which in Ireland's case is a balanced budget in structural terms.\u00a0 Importantly, in an Irish context, this is dependent on the estimation of the output gap, something which has proven volatile for small economies, particularly with open labour markets.<\/p>  <p>  The second assessment is the expenditure benchmark which links growth in expenditure to the potential growth rate of the economy.\u00a0 Additional expenditure above the benchmark has to be paid for through the introduction of new discretionary revenue measures.\u00a0 The benchmark also contains a feature than is designed to assist with achieving the minimum structural improvement.<\/p>  <p>  Exchanges between my officials and the Commission has led to the proposal of more sensible population projections which will support estimates of potential output over the medium-term.  This change is expected to assist with compliance with both of the above rules.  Following the usual course of action for amending aspects of the harmonised methodology for estimating potential output, the relevant committee - the Output Gap Working Group - is considering a solution to the issue of population projections and the estimation of the level of structural unemployment to address concerns faced by Ireland and a number of other Member States.<\/p>  <p>  At the moment, the reference rate used in the calculation of the expenditure benchmark is based on a ten year average of potential growth which was calculated in 2013 when both the outturn and outlook for our economy's growth potential was considerably weaker.\u00a0 What I raised at the recent Eurogroup meeting was the use of outdated estimates of potential growth in the calculation of this metric which could lead to sub-optimal fiscal decisions being made.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My officials are in ongoing technical discussions with the European Commission and other Member States to both improve estimates of potential output and to establish a more appropriate calculation of the reference rate.\u00a0 This work will take place through the appropriate working groups and official channels and as I do not want to prejudice these discussions, I will not be elaborating any further details at this time.<\/p>  <p>  As far as I am aware, no Member States have been provided concessions in the application of the preventive arm of the SGP.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would emphasise that I support the revised fiscal rules.\u00a0 What I will be seeking from the Commission and colleagues from other Member States is a more sensible application of the rules which will enhance the credibility of fiscal policy decision making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600032#WRG00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600032#WRG00700"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[13110\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600032#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a list, in tabular form, of all contracts and tenders awarded by his Department to a company (details supplied) since 1 January, 2004, including any such awarded singularly or as a joint bid or consortium including said company; if he will indicate which Department, agency or semi-State company was the contacting party in each case; the value in each case; the purpose of each contract; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>My Department and the agencies under its aegis have not awarded any contracts or tenders to a company (details supplied) since 1 January 2004.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600032#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600032#WRG01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Coastal Erosion","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600032#WRG01000"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[12542\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600032#WRG01100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the significant levels of coastal erosion which are occurring at a coastal location (details supplied) in County Donegal; if he acknowledges the suffering and anxiety which this situation is causing the local coastal community; his plans to address this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>Local flooding and coastal erosion issues are matters for Local Authorities to investigate and address in the first instance and Donegal County Council (DCC) may carry out flood mitigation and coastal protection works using its own resources. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Government and I are cognisant that coastal erosion may in some instances give rise to a significant threat to infrastructure, properties and\/or public safety, which can cause hardship and concern to those affected.

The Strategy for Science, Technology &amp;amp; Innovation (2006 to 2013) was a broad based strategy which covered funding for research and innovation across all disciplines and across the full continuum of research from basic to applied as well as commercialisation of research.<\/p>  <p>  Economic and fiscal conditions in the intervening period informed the Government's decision to implement a range of policies directed at accelerating the economic and societal return on our STI investment. Research Prioritisation was one such key policy initiative and saw a concentration of the majority of competitive funding on areas which were deemed most likely to secure greater economic and societal impact, particularly in the form of jobs. The priority areas were identified, following rigorous analysis and intensive engagement with all key stakeholders by the Research Prioritisation Steering Group (a broad based group comprising membership from industry and academia) on the basis of existing strengths of the public research system, existing strengths of the enterprise base, opportunities that exist in terms of the global marketplace and those which are most likely to deliver economic and societal impact and employment.<\/p>  <p>  While Research Prioritisation saw a greater emphasis on the economic and societal impact of research it did not represent a move away from funding basic research.

While the mandate of Science Foundation Ireland was expanded in 2013 to include applied as well as basic oriented research, SFI is still mandated to fund earlier stage research. However, all research supported by SFI must be in strategic areas of opportunity for the State in line with our research prioritisation agenda and it must have impact - this approach will continue to underpin policy into the future and will be a central pillar of the Government's Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Excellence in scientific research has been and will continue to be a cornerstone in the development of our science base in Ireland. In the context of our vision for the future, we must have a strong and excellent research base particularly in areas where our strengths can match opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Equally important is the translation of research and commercialisation of ideas. Ireland is ranked third in the EU, according to the European Commission's \"Indicator of Innovation Output&rdquo;, which measures the extent to which ideas from innovative sectors are able to reach the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. All of the national indicators show that our focus on commercialisation of research is having an impact. The number of technologies licensed to industry, which is one of the most relevant indicators of commercialisation performance in the research system, rose significantly from 12 in 2005 to 87 in 2012 and invention disclosures and spin outs also increased substantially during that period. We established Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI) in 2013 to make it even easier for companies to access and use ideas developed through publicly-funded research to develop new products and services and ultimately create jobs and exports.<\/p>  <p>  A consultation process designed to inform the development of a broad based Strategy, which will be a successor to the Strategy for Science Technology &amp;amp; Innovation, is underway. Submissions received from various stakeholders will be considered in detail by my Department and the Interdepartmental Committee which has been tasked with developing proposals for the new Strategy.

As a result significant steps have been made in establishing a strong and excellent public research base particularly in areas where our strengths can match opportunities.<\/p><p>Building on this success, this Government introduced a number of policy initiatives targeted at accelerating the economic and societal return on our investment in this area. In reaching its conclusions on foot of rigorous analysis and intensive engagement with all key stakeholders, the Research Prioritisation Steering Group &ndash; a broad based group comprising membership from industry and academia - identified 14 priority areas around which the majority of competitive funding should be targeted. The areas were identified on the basis of existing strengths of the public research system, existing strengths of the enterprise base, opportunities that exist in terms of the global marketplace and those which are most likely to deliver economic and societal impact and employment.<\/p><p>Evidence, from both the EU and internationally, shows that this strategy is paying off.

Policy has been and will continue to be to support research across the full continuum from basic to applied, through to commercialisation of research.

Impact is measured broadly across a range of areas including the economy and society, health and well-being, capacity and skills, natural capital and the built environment. This has manifested itself in the establishment of 12 large scale research centres in areas of relevance to the economy and society.<\/p><p>In the context of our ongoing fiscal constraints and the many competing demands for investment of public funds, the Government will continue to support excellent and impactful research across the continuum from basic to applied in strategic areas of opportunity for the State.

The Legal Services Regulation Bill is, therefore, a key component of the Government's strategy to bring greater transparency to legal costs and to reduce their burden on consumers and enterprise - including by reference to the competitiveness indicators raised by the Deputy which would appear to be those also cited by the National Competitiveness Council in its &quot;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2014&quot; report. <\/p><p>While the fees of the discrete group of 18 solicitors firms covered by the annual CSO survey (it does not cover barristers' services) concerned had remained relatively constant during the recent recession compared to those of accountants, they had demonstrated a reduction late in 2013.  I understand that subsequent updates of this CSO survey to the third quarter of 2014 have confirmed the reduction in solicitors' fees among this group as an ongoing competitive trend.  In relation to the longer time and higher cost involved in enforcing a business contract in Ireland as highlighted by the World Bank, I would anticipate that this will be ameliorated by the more transparent legal costs regime being introduced under the Legal Services Regulation Bill in tandem with the use of more efficient and timely enforcement and alternative dispute resolution approaches.  <\/p><p>As a targeted structural reform, the Legal Services Regulation Bill is given continued validation by the concern also expressed in National Competitiveness Council's report that  &quot;looking to the future, further structural or policy induced changes are necessary to ensure that prices do not escalate and erode competitiveness as the Irish economy returns to stronger rates of growth&quot;.  The Bill makes extensive provision, in Part 10, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged by legal practitioners, along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients.  Legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients.  This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions.  Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in section 117 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not reasonably practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated.  A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client.  When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question.  In addition, the Bill sets out that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business and that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.<\/p><p>An aggrieved client also has the option of applying for the taxation of disputed legal costs by the Office of the Taxing-Master.  Under the Legal Services Regulation Bill the current functions of the Taxing-Master will be taken over by the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator.  The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles.  These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account in the adjudication of disputed legal costs.  The Bill also provides for the establishment of a public Register of Determinations which will disclose the outcomes and reasons for decisions made by the Legal Costs Adjudicator.  The Bill seeks to achieve greater flexibility in the legal-services market, more competition and improved access to justice and will pave the way for the introduction of new business structures for legal practitioners including in partnership with non-legal service providers.  These combined measures will enable those availing of legal services, be they private consumers or enterprise, to identify costs more clearly, including in competition with other possible legal service providers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600038#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Firearms and Ammunition Security","counter":437,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600038#WRN01675"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[12658\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600038#WRN01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of stolen licensed guns that were recovered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na following serious crime in the past 12 months;

Health care providers should ensure that all patients with an acute systemic febrile illness, particularly\u00a0children, can be reassessed without delay if their condition deteriorates.<\/p><p>-  Doctors should be encouraged to review the situation within 4-6 hours if early meningococcal disease cannot be ruled out at the first assessment (safety net approach).

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.<\/p><p>My Department undertook an initial media campaign when the NPPR Charge was first introduced in 2009. Nationwide advertising has also taken place in each year since the introduction of the Charge under the auspices of the local authorities to ensure general awareness of the Charge and the liability dates. In addition, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally. The NPPR Project Board, in conjunction with individual local authorities, undertook a media campaign in 2014 aimed at reminding non-compliant owners that additional late payment penalties applied after 31 August 2014. The extensive radio and print media campaign reminded non-compliant owners of their obligations to come forward to regularise their affairs and to take advantage of this once-off grace period. While it is a necessary principle of law that all citizens are required to be aware of relevant legal obligations and duties in respect of such charges, as is the case in other jurisdictions, it remains my view that reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that property owners have been aware of the Charge and liability dates.<\/p><p>Local authorities have responsibility under section 9 of the 2009 Act to operate and collect the Charge. Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014, my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted. The guidelines, which are available at encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner. It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners. In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment. The Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority. All non-compliant owners should log on to or, alternatively, contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make their outstanding payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600045#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600045#WRU01100"},{"type":"question","counter":628,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[12365\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600045#WRU01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he is aware that his Department set aside an allocation of &euro;1 million in additional funding for Sligo County Council in 2014, conditional on a realistic financial plan being agreed between his Department and the council by the end of 2014; that the Department decided to provide only &euro;250,000 of the &euro;1 million to the council, and that in the absence of a detailed plan being agreed before the end of 2014, no further payment was made to the council; if there are ongoing negotiations between his Department and the council in respect of the remaining &euro;750,000; if the decision not to pay the &euro;750,000 to the council is final or if will his Department will reconsider the matter, if a realistic financial plan is submitted to it; if consideration will be given to adding the &euro;750,000 to the extra &euro;1 million allocation set aside for 2015, if a realistic and achievable financial plan is agreed to; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":629,"content":"<p>Sligo County Council's financial position is of serious concern to me.

Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a 'Part 4' tenancy.  Landlords and tenants may not contract out of any of the provisions of Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act and no lease, tenancy agreement, contract or other agreement may operate to vary or modify the provisions of Part 4 of the Act.  <\/p><p>Where a Part 4 tenancy lasts for four years without a notice of termination being served by the landlord or the tenant, a further Part 4 tenancy comes into being and this will continue on at the expiration of each further four year period unless the tenancy is validly terminated by either the landlord or the tenant on one of the grounds under the Act.  A landlord may not serve a notice of termination except in very clearly defined circumstances such as a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations in relation to the tenancy.<\/p><p>The main cause of rising rents is a lack of supply in the market and the implementation of the range of actions under the Government's <i>Construction 2020<\/i>Strategy will support increased housing supply.

In order to achieve the objective of moving towards allocating resources according to this model, my Department has in recent years worked to ensure that funding is protected for those areas which the RAM shows have greatest needs. This principle was used in deciding on funding allocations for SICAP and I am satisfied that the funding allocated to Dublin Inner City under SICAP is a fair allocation of resources for the area concerned. <\/p><p>The funding reduction referred to has to be seen in the context of a number of specific factors which applied to the Dublin Inner City funding arrangements under the current Programme. In particular, the Community Development Programme funding model was not based on population and deprivation levels, as is proposed for SICAP;  instead providing funding for two staff, on average, and overheads in each project.

I intend to complete and publish the outcome of the review in the coming months.<table><tr><th>Bridge Funding Provided &ndash; 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015<\/th><th>-<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Arthritis Ireland<\/td><td>53,882<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Asperger Syndrome Association of Ireland Ltd <\/td><td>41,448 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Asthma Society of Ireland <\/td><td>41,448 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Breaking Through Limited <\/td><td>58,028 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Chronic Pain Ireland Limited <\/td><td>37,304 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dyslexia Association of Ireland <\/td><td>62,172 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Genetic and Inherited Disorders Organisation Ltd <\/td><td>16,580 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GROW in Ireland <\/td><td>16,580 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland Limited <\/td><td>19,066 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Deaf Society The National Association of the Deaf Limited <\/td><td>62,172 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Heart Foundation <\/td><td>41,448 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Mountain Rescue Association <\/td><td>58,028 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish National Council of Attention Deficit Disorder Support (INCADDS) <\/td><td>33,158 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Stammering Association <\/td><td>24,868 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Migraine Association of Ireland Ltd <\/td><td>29,014 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Motor Neuron disease Association <\/td><td>24,868 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MOVE Ireland <\/td><td>41,448 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Muintir na T&iacute;re <\/td><td>70,462 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Muscular Dystrophy Ireland <\/td><td>37,304 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Ireland Limited <\/td><td>37,304 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Association for Youth Drama Ltd <\/td><td>29,014 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>New Communities Partnership (NCP) Ltd <\/td><td>74,606 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Peter Bradley Foundation Limited <\/td><td>41,448 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Post Polio Support Group Limited <\/td><td>24,868 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Safe Ireland <\/td><td>74,606 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Show Racism The Red Card Limited <\/td><td>29,014 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Suas Educational Development <\/td><td>37,304 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland <\/td><td>62,172 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Carers Association Limited <\/td><td>62,172 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland <\/td><td>49,738 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland <\/td><td>49,738 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Union of Voluntary Organisations of People with Disabilities <\/td><td>45,592 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600047#WRW00500","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leader Programmes Funding","counter":684,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600047#WRW00550"},{"type":"question","counter":685,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[12561\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600047#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of Leader programme funding awarded by county in each of the past seven years and in 2015 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":686,"content":"<p>LEADER funding for the 2007-2013 programming period was not allocated based on county boundaries but to individual Local Action Groups on completion of the Local Development Strategy process.

Cyber security experts in my Department participate in regular national, EU and international emergency response exercises, as well as providing expert advise to Government Departments and industry stakeholders on individual cyber attacks.

While I am concerned with increasing motor insurance costs, the setting of prices in that area is a matter for the industry and I have no role in the regulation of insurers. <\/p><p>Affordable motor insurance is an important element in the delivery of road safety in Ireland and I would be concerned that increasing insurance costs could lead to an increase in uninsured driving to the detriment of all road users.<\/p><p>Motor Car Insurance<table><tr><th>YEAR <\/th><th>JAN <\/th><th>FEB <\/th><th>MAR <\/th><th>APR <\/th><th>MAY <\/th><th>JUN <\/th><th>JUL <\/th><th>AUG <\/th><th>SEP <\/th><th>OCT <\/th><th>NOV <\/th><th>DEC <\/th><th>ANNUAL <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2001 <\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>- <\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>100 <\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2002 <\/td><td>99.7 <\/td><td>99.6 <\/td><td>103 <\/td><td>109 <\/td><td>108 <\/td><td>106 <\/td><td>105 <\/td><td>106 <\/td><td>106 <\/td><td>107 <\/td><td>106 <\/td><td>106 <\/td><td>105.1 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2003 <\/td><td>106 <\/td><td>107 <\/td><td>108 <\/td><td>108 <\/td><td>108 <\/td><td>108 <\/td><td>107 <\/td><td>106 <\/td><td>103 <\/td><td>97.9 <\/td><td>94.9 <\/td><td>94.5 <\/td><td>104 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2004 <\/td><td>94.1 <\/td><td>94.2 <\/td><td>93.6 <\/td><td>93.6 <\/td><td>93.5 <\/td><td>92 <\/td><td>92.7 <\/td><td>92.8 <\/td><td>87.2 <\/td><td>87.3 <\/td><td>87.1 <\/td><td>86.4 <\/td><td>91.2 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2005 <\/td><td>86.2 <\/td><td>85.7 <\/td><td>84.2 <\/td><td>82.4 <\/td><td>82.4 <\/td><td>82.5 <\/td><td>81.5 <\/td><td>81.5 <\/td><td>81.5 <\/td><td>81.8 <\/td><td>79.8 <\/td><td>79.8 <\/td><td>82.4 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2006 <\/td><td>78.2 <\/td><td>78.3 <\/td><td>78.5 <\/td><td>78.5 <\/td><td>78.3 <\/td><td>78.3 <\/td><td>77.2 <\/td><td>77.2 <\/td><td>74 <\/td><td>74 <\/td><td>74 <\/td><td>71.2 <\/td><td>76.5 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007 <\/td><td>70.9 <\/td><td>70.5 <\/td><td>70.3 <\/td><td>66.1 <\/td><td>66.1 <\/td><td>66.3 <\/td><td>66.7 <\/td><td>66.3 <\/td><td>66.7 <\/td><td>65.8 <\/td><td>65.8 <\/td><td>64.4 <\/td><td>67.2 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008 <\/td><td>64 <\/td><td>64.1 <\/td><td>64.2 <\/td><td>64.2 <\/td><td>64.6 <\/td><td>64.6 <\/td><td>65 <\/td><td>65.1 <\/td><td>65.1 <\/td><td>65 <\/td><td>65.5 <\/td><td>66 <\/td><td>64.8 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009 <\/td><td>68.3 <\/td><td>69.4 <\/td><td>71.2 <\/td><td>72.5 <\/td><td>72.6 <\/td><td>73.3 <\/td><td>73.8 <\/td><td>74.6 <\/td><td>74.7 <\/td><td>74.4 <\/td><td>74.1 <\/td><td>72.7 <\/td><td>72.6 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010 <\/td><td>73.3 <\/td><td>74.6 <\/td><td>71.8 <\/td><td>72.4 <\/td><td>72.4 <\/td><td>72.8 <\/td><td>73.4 <\/td><td>74.2 <\/td><td>74 <\/td><td>74.9 <\/td><td>75.6 <\/td><td>77.3 <\/td><td>73.9 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011 <\/td><td>75.5 <\/td><td>76.3 <\/td><td>76.3 <\/td><td>77.3 <\/td><td>77.9 <\/td><td>78.8 <\/td><td>79 <\/td><td>78.2 <\/td><td>78 <\/td><td>78 <\/td><td>77.9 <\/td><td>77.9 <\/td><td>77.6 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012 <\/td><td>79.7 <\/td><td>80.1 <\/td><td>79.4 <\/td><td>79.3 <\/td><td>79.5 <\/td><td>80 <\/td><td>80.3 <\/td><td>80.5 <\/td><td>80.5 <\/td><td>81.8 <\/td><td>81.8 <\/td><td>81.8 <\/td><td>80.4 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013 <\/td><td>74.1 <\/td><td>73.8 <\/td><td>74.3 <\/td><td>75.2 <\/td><td>73.4 <\/td><td>73.2 <\/td><td>74 <\/td><td>74 <\/td><td>74.1 <\/td><td>73.8 <\/td><td>73.8 <\/td><td>74.2 <\/td><td>74 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014 <\/td><td>74.2 <\/td><td>75.5 <\/td><td>77.7 <\/td><td>77.9 <\/td><td>78 <\/td><td>78.2 <\/td><td>78.3 <\/td><td>78.4 <\/td><td>79 <\/td><td>81.7 <\/td><td>82.3 <\/td><td>83 <\/td><td>78.7 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015 <\/td><td>85.3 <\/td><td>87.4 <\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600048#WRX01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Promotion","counter":722,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600048#WRX01500"},{"type":"question","counter":723,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[12366\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015032600048#WRX01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide a commitment that an adequate F&aacute;ilte Ireland office will be provided in the Adare Heritage Centre, Adare in County Limerick in view of the fact that Adare is a large tourist town and there is a need for an adequate tourist information function in the centre to assist the many tourists who come in to Adare daily.
