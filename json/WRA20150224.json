It is considered that the 38 week model of delivery in one school year is the optimal model in terms of ensuring a high-quality early years experience for preschool children.  The S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks, which are central to quality preschool provision, were developed to support this objective.  The current model of delivery also helps to ensure that children and parents become accustomed to the weekly discipline of school attendance with the number of days and hours on which the programme is delivered being approximate to the primary school requirement of 5 days over 38.6 weeks.

There is a great deal of oversight and effort put into creating a homely and safe residential setting, something which has been missing in the lives of these vulnerable children.  The use of residential accommodation is a relatively small part of the overall care provision, with residential placements accounting for 5% of children in care.  Most children in care, 93% at October 2014, are in family based foster placements, with the remaining 2% being cared for in other placements.  Unfortunately some children have deep and challenging issues that make it unsuitable to place them in foster care and require the use of a residential place.  The interventions for children in residential care aim to support them in coming to terms with the impact of the hurt they have suffered through neglect or abuse.<\/p>  <p>  The children entering residential care are as open to the types of risks that would be encountered by any child in their age cohort.  Services around the individual child  in care will address needs identified as part of their care plan, which can include interventions on alcohol, drugs and challenging behaviour.  That being said, it is not the case that a child's negative actions would be condoned nor would the child be shielded from the consequences of their actions.  <\/p>  <p>  Registration, inspection and monitoring ensure that residential services are operating according to the national standards and regulations.  The Health Information and Quality Authority has responsibility for inspecting centres operated by the Agency.  Generally the reports in 2014 indicated that management and staff were found to be knowledgeable, experienced and committed to the care of the children.  However, the complex interaction of the children's needs meant that a placement that was appropriate on admission may not be suitable over time and may require the updating of plans and behaviour supports.  Separately the Agency registers, inspects and monitors the private and voluntary children residential centres.  The Agency has completed 100% of its programme of inspections and monitoring for 2014.  Inspections identify compliance with standards, inform service delivery and give an oversight of significant events that have been notified in line with standards for residential care.  <\/p>  <p>  The number of 16 and 17 year olds admitted into care, 14% in 2013, is not the largest age group entering care but is significant. This age cohort has different needs compared to younger age groups and need different responses. The experiences common to teenagers in any community are compounded for children in care by their complex needs, which may result from effects of abuse, neglect, substance misuse and domestic violence. Strategies and processes are in place for managing care services for older children, resulting in plans that address these age appropriate issues. It is the case that targeted interventions need time, patience and understanding for their effect to take hold and develop, and can only be effective when the child is ready and able to participate in the process.  It is useful to note that the majority of 16 and 17 year olds entering care are in foster placements, similar to other age groups, and that progress is achieved by building up relationships for the child, both with professionals and the wider community in which they live.  My Department will continue to engage with the Agency on how best to meet the needs of this older population of children in care and how the Agency can incorporate learning from inspection and monitoring that takes into account the ever changing profile of young people in society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400055#WRA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Completion Programme","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400055#WRA03650"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[7759\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400055#WRA03700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans for funding the school completion programme 2015.

Children and young people should be:<br\/><br\/>-  Active and healthy with physical and mental wellbeing,<br\/><br\/>-  Achieving full potential in all areas of learning and development,<br\/><br\/>-  Safe and protected from harm<br\/><br\/>-  Enjoying economic security and opportunity, and<br\/><br\/>-  Connected, respected and contributing to their world.<br\/><br\/>Obviously my Department alone could not achieve all of these outcomes.  Therefore primary responsibility for the outcome areas belong to the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, my Department, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government respectively.  <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures <\/i>details 163 key policy commitments for children and young people.  These cover a wide variety of policy areas, and are being progressed by the relevant departments.<br\/><br\/>The Child and Family Agency (Tusla) under the remit of my Department, represents the most comprehensive reform of child protection, early intervention and family support services ever undertaken in Ireland.  It is an ambitious move which brings together some 4,000 staff and an operational budget of approximately &euro;600m.<br\/><br\/>The Agency is charged with:<br\/><br\/>- supporting and promoting the development, welfare and protection of children, and the effective functioning of families;<br\/><br\/>- offering care and protection for children in circumstances where their parents have not been able to, or are unlikely to, provide the care that a child needs;<br\/><br\/>- responsibility for ensuring that every child in the State attends school or otherwise receives an education, and for providing education welfare services to support and monitor children&rsquo;s attendance, participation and retention in education;<br\/><br\/>- ensuring that the best interests of the child guides all decisions affecting individual children;<br\/><br\/>- consulting children and families so that they help to shape the agency&rsquo;s policies and services;<br\/><br\/>- strengthening interagency co-operation to ensure seamless services responsive to needs;<br\/><br\/>- undertaking research relating to its functions, and providing information and advice to the Minister regarding those functions; and<br\/><br\/>- commissioning services relating to the provision of child and family services<br\/><br\/>One of the main challenges in the area of physical well-being is childhood obesity.  In the latter part of 2013, in my role then as the Minister of Health, I jointly launched with my predecessor, Minister Fitzgerald, a three year media and social media campaign aimed at giving practical tips to parents on managing their children&rsquo;s weight.<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> <\/font><br\/><br\/>As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have responsibility for Play and Recreation Policy which have been set out in the policy documents, &lsquo;<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">READY, STEADY, PLAY! A National Play Policy&rsquo; and  the &lsquo;Teenspace, National Recreation Policy for Young People&rsquo;. <\/font><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Initiatives being developed at local community level are designed to encourage awareness of the importance of play and recreation throughout the whole of life from early childhood to adulthood and through to later life. <\/font><br\/><br\/>Additionally, my Department administers funding schemes and programmes to support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people which involves approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  I am pleased that Budget 2015 has confirmed that funding of &euro;49.78m will again be provided to my Department in 2015 to support the provision of youth services.  Many of the youth services operate with young people&rsquo;s physical and mental well-being as the central pillar of their services and programmes.  The Youth Work Sector has particular expertise in working with young people and provides non-formal and informal learning opportunities to support their well-being. <br\/><br\/>I can inform the Deputy that the direct provision system is under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Department of Justice and Equality has primary responsibility in the area of asylum and immigration.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Justice and Equality has established a working group to review a range of issues pertaining to asylum seekers and direct provision.  The first meeting of the Working Group on the Protection Process was held on the 10th November 2014, chaired by Judge McMahon.  The Working Group consists of children's rights advocates, organisations engaged with asylum groups and representatives from a range of relevant Government Departments, including a representative from my own Department.  I look forward to learning of the findings and recommendations of the working group in the Spring of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400055#WRA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Staff","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400055#WRA04250"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[7694\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400055#WRA04300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide details of the high turnover of social workers employed by T&uacute;sla, the Child and Family Agency, in view of the fact that these workers are more than twice as likely to resign their positions, when compared to other employees in the health and social services generally; his plans to ensure that this does not occur; his plans to ensure that any child at risk, and not currently under the care of a social worker, will be catered for; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Accordingly, workforce development is an important element of TUSLA&rsquo;s strategic approach to HR, which will include consideration of issues around recruitment, retention and turnover of key staff.  <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has already commenced a number of workforce reviews to assist with an evaluation of appropriate staff skill mix with a view to service enhancement.  This involves reviewing the roles of family support workers, social care workers in the community and administrative structures to support the delivery of more efficient and more cost-effective services.  Part of this evaluation includes looking at enhanced job roles, increasing multidisciplinary team working to help alleviate pressures and increasing collaborative approaches, redesigning tasks and promoting overall greater efficiency in working.  The workforce development plan will also take account of further developing supports through structured professional and career development.<\/p>  <p>  During this process, Tusla continues to actively recruit social workers as vacancies arise and 164 social workers took up positions during 2014.  A further 219 social workers are under active recruitment.  As in any employment situation, turnover of staff does occur and 112 social workers left the Agency during 2014.  While Tusla is experiencing some recruitment and retention issues, the turnover of social workers in the Agency's first year of operation was 7.3%.  This turnover rate includes those who have retired or left for other reasons.  There is limited published international research on job turnover and retention in child protection and welfare.  However, it is recognised that recruitment and retention in this area is a key issue internationally.  While not minimising the impact of the turnover rate in Tusla, a turnover rate of 10% or below is considered a low turnover rate that is achieved by very few organisations in the field of child welfare and protection.<\/p>  <p>  The impact of vacancies on service provision is risk-assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure that social work team members are never allowed to fall below what is considered necessary to provide a safe service.  Such risk-assessments take account of issues such as caseloads and referral numbers.  Where necessary, temporary staff are brought in immediately to cover vacancies until such vacancies are filled on a permanent basis.  This assessment takes account of all absences, including those on maternity related leave.  There were 124 such temporary staff in place across the four regions covering vacancies at the end of December 2014.<\/p>  <p>  I am currently considering the Tusla Business Plan for 2015 which was recently submitted to me and I will be monitoring the ongoing review, assessment and management of the cases awaiting assignment to social workers throughout 2015. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400055#WRA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Costs","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400056#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[7743\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400056#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his views on the findings of the Think-tank for Action on Social Change report, which sees Ireland second in the European Union, when it comes to child care costs (details supplied).","asker":"1195","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>I am aware of the difficulties that parents are experiencing in meeting current childcare costs.

This investment ensures that more than 100,000 children have access to quality childcare.  This high level of support has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years. <br\/><br\/>I wish to point out to the Deputy that, while the annual spend on childcare related programmes has been in the region of 0.2 per cent of GDP in recent years, this does <i>not<\/i>include expenditure under other programmes or by other Departments.

The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years.  The Agency has advised me that a number of areas of action have been prioritised and work has commenced on the development of dedicated aftercare services, on the standardisation of a range of financial packages, on the introduction of Aftercare Steering Committees at local level, and on the further development of the provision of information on aftercare services in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  The Agency has further advised that at December, 2014, excluding staff costs, approximately &euro;14.3 million was spent on the provision of statutory aftercare services.  <\/p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18.

The Act outlines the procedures and the conditions under which a Court may grant a care order, including the relevant period for review by the Court.  While the Child and Family Agency has a duty to receive a child who requires care or protection into its care under the Child Care Act 1991, it does not have the power to impose a care order.  A care order, in the case of emergency, interim or full care orders, can only be issued by a member of the judiciary sitting in the District Court, which may be part of a special sitting as the Children Court, as indicated in the Act.  In the case of special care orders, an application must be made to the High Court.  Decisions on the variation or discharge of a care order are also a matter for the relevant Court and lie outside the powers of the Agency.  If a person is unhappy with a care order itself then an appeal can be lodged with the Courts, which, normally, in the case of an order from the District Court is to be lodged within 14 days of the order being made.

The principles of the Children Act 2001 include that detention should be imposed as a last resort and may only be imposed if it is the only suitable way of dealing with the child, and that the various areas in the youth justice system apply a series of 'filters' or tests in each case.  In examining each case, it is important to note that it is not a simple question of choice between the Diversion Programme, community sanctions and detention.  <\/p>  <p>  The first main filter is the Garda Diversion Programme, which at different stages and depending on the seriousness of the offence, may involve the informal caution (without supervision) and the formal (supervised by a Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer) caution, including possible involvement with a Garda Youth Diversion Project. The second main filter is provided by the non-custodial sanctions available to the Courts, including dismissal under the Probation Act and unsupervised sanctions (e.g. fines, disqualification, peace bond, curfew etc.). The next stage involves the Probation Service's supervised sanctions (i.e. community service and other community sanctions). Finally, as a last resort, detention may be used.<\/p>  <p>  I have on-going policy cooperation with the Minister for Justice and Equality regarding our shared goal to minimise the rate of juvenile offending under the Youth Justice Action Plan 2014 &ndash; 2018.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has overall responsibility in the area of crime and anti-social behaviour and her Department funds a range of community based responses to youth crime, in particular the Garda Diversion Programme and the Young Person Probation Community Projects.  These programmes are specifically targeted at young offenders and those at serious risk of offending.

Indeed, in recent years, with the introduction of the free pre-school year in 2010, early years practitioners have had to become increasingly qualified.    Prior to 2010, there was no education qualification requirement for staff working with children in the early years sector.     This changed with the introduction of the free pre-school year under the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, whereby pre-school leaders are required to have a minimum of a Major Award at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (or equivalent) to qualify for the standard capitation rate and a Level 7 Major Award (or equivalent) to qualify for the higher capitation rate.<\/p>  <p>The introduction of the Learner Fund in 2014 has also served to improve qualification levels within the sector and there is considerable evidence that the early years sector is becoming increasingly upskilled.

As of 1st January 2014, the Child and Family Agency is  responsible for the former Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and also for the functions of Child and Family services previously provided by the HSE.   The Agency's functions  include maintaining and developing services in order to support and promote the development, welfare  and protection of children and to support effective functioning of families. In so doing  the Agency will promote enhanced interagency cooperation  to ensure that services  are coordinated on the principle of the best interest of all children and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through an integrated model of service committed to the principle of &ldquo;One Child, One Team, One Plan&rdquo;.

The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be completed before the beginning of the 2015\/16 academic year. <\/p>  <p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to help to identify the extent to which children have caring responsibilities.    The Census of Population 2011 found that 6,449 children, or 5.6 per 1,000 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problems or disability.  Rates ranged from 4.3 per 1,000 in Co. Louth to 8.2 per 1000 in Co. Leitrim.  Under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives (2011-2016) analysis of those figures in the 2011 Census will help to inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles. This analysis will be published in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  A National Youth Strategy is also being developed by my Department.  It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support. The consultation process in the development of this strategy has included a number of major stakeholder consultation events and I am pleased that representatives of the Carers Association participated in these consultations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400056#WRB04600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Expenditure","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400056#WRB04700"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[7691\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400056#WRB04800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will address the funding crisis affecting domestic abuse services, including the County Laois domestic abuse service.","asker":"1102","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>In 2014, &euro;17m in funding was provided by the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) by way of grant aid to 62 specialist Domestic Violence &amp;amp; Sexual Violence services.

One of the recommendations contained in that report was that &ldquo;&hellip; section 11(1) (e) should be amended to clarify that the exclusion regarding the administration of law in the area of asylum, immigration, naturalisation or citizenship relates solely to decisions taken by the relevant authorities in accordance with statutory procedures for determining whether a person is entitled to a particular status.&rdquo;   My Department engaged with the Department of Justice and Equality on this recommendation, among others. The then Minister for Justice and Equality considered that no legislative change was required and this position has been reaffirmed by that Department. <\/p>  <p>In a reply to a question by Deputy Brendan Griffin  (Reference No. 31092\/14 on 15th July 2014), the Minister for Justice and Equality addressed, among other issues, the question of the Ombudsman for Children being given jurisdiction in the direct provision system and for the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA) to be allowed inspect direct provision hostels. In replying, the Minister made reference to provisions in both the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 and Ombudsman Act 1980 which excludes either Ombudsman from investigating any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of law relating to, inter alia, asylum. If I may quote from Minister Fitzgerald's response, she said \"Whilst there are no plans to change those legislative provisions, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) including RIA, has administrative arrangements in place with both Offices to assist and provide information on matters brought to its attention by them  \".<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has established a working group to review a range of issues pertaining to asylum seekers and direct provision. The first meeting of the Working Group on the Protection Process was held on the 10th November 2014, chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon. The Working Group consists of children's rights advocates, organisations engaged with asylum groups and representatives from a range of relevant government departments, including a representative from my own Department. I look forward to learning of the findings and recommendations of the working group in the Spring of 2015. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400056#WRB05200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Poverty","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400057#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[7744\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400057#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the measures taken to tackle the rise of child poverty as outlined in the report of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) (details supplied).","asker":"1195","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":120,"content":"<p><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 - 2020 (BOBF),<\/i>which was published and launched by Government in 2014, provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services for children and young people. As provided for in the Framework, the Department of Social Protection is the lead department on child poverty and has lead responsibility for the commitment to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.

The ABC Programme is being co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.

A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes.  We know from experience of other countries that investment in quality early childhood care and education is important in breaking the inter-generational cycle of poverty. <br\/><br\/>I have established an Inter-departmental Group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children.  The Group&rsquo;s work involves, inter alia, identifying policy objectives to guide investment in contributing towards improvements in social inclusion and poverty reduction.

At December 2014, there are 936 referred clients on drug rehabilitation places, compared to 824 in 2012. In addition, there are 220 support workers giving a total of 1,156 places dedicated to drugs rehabilitation on CE. This number is very close to full capacity. <\/p>  <p>  A key first step in securing this improvement was the establishment of a stakeholder group which now assists the Department to identify and implement enhancements to the scheme. In addition, workshops have been held with the scheme supervisors and departmental staff to ensure that the schemes meet the needs of participants. To complement these changes, an improved vacancy notification system and referral process was introduced by this Department. <\/p>  <p>  During any given year, participants may exit for many reasons, including illness\/relapse, gaining employment, maternity leave, retirement, emigration, transfer to another scheme, exit to a training programme or completion of CE.  Therefore, there is a cycle of places becoming vacant and being filled on an ongoing basis on schemes.  All referrals to the drug rehabilitation places come directly from treatment centres or other designated personnel engaged in the rehabilitation process.<\/p>  <p>  The CE Drug Rehabilitation Scheme plays an important role in helping recovering drug users to develop their personal and employment skills.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. This is particularly important given the challenge that increased longevity is posing for the future sustainability of the State pension.  Therefore, when assessing whether an individual is entitled to a State pension, and to ensure that they can maximise such entitlement, all contributions (paid or credited) from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account. <\/p>  <p>  The State already assists those with caring roles to qualify for a State pension (contributory). The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  Given the valuable nature of the State pension (contributory), those who qualify under the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements for that scheme, and have at least 520 paid contributions over the course of their working lives. <\/p>  <p>  However, for those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  If someone has been a carer for nearly all of their adult life and has paid little or no PRSI, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just under 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory). <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) from 2020, although that date is subject to change.  Issues such as equality of outcomes for women and men, including those who spend some years outside the labour market on caring duties, will be considered carefully in the context of that reform. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400057#WRC04400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Grant Payments","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400058#WRD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[7821\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400058#WRD00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if consideration will be given to increasing the respite care grant; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>The respite care grant (RCG) is an annual non means-tested payment made to all carers who provide full time care and attention to others and the grant forms part of a range of income supports for carers provided by the Department.

There are currently approximately 70,700 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015. <br\/><br\/>Rent supplement is subject to a means test which is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. <br\/><br\/>Under social welfare legislation payment received under the domiciliary care allowance scheme is classed as non-assessable means for the purposes of calculating rent supplement and is excluded from the assessment of means.<br\/><br\/>The reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for younger persons encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Where a person is in receipt of a reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance and he or she participates in a course of education or training a higher rate of &euro;160 applies. <br\/><br\/>The aim of the Youth Guarantee is to provide young people under the age of 25 with a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a short time of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs, through earlier and enhanced engagement processes.  In addition, additional places on a number of programmes and youth-oriented variants of existing schemes have been rolled out. Young people who are assessed as having a low to medium probability of securing employment in the absence of any support, will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months of an initial one-to-one interview. <br\/><br\/>The Department is actively engaging with Tusla and non-Government organisations in providing the necessary support to vulnerable young people leaving care who are experiencing homelessness or in insecure situations. These cases are managed on a case by case basis and the payment of deposits and rent in advance is considered. This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who are at risk of, or who are homeless, or who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs. <br\/><br\/>In 2014, the Department made a total of some 3,000 payments of rent deposits\/rent in advance at a cost of &euro;1.48 million throughout the country, of which some 850 payments at a cost of over &euro;360,000 were made to persons&rsquo; aged under 25 years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400059#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme Eligibility","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400059#WRE00450"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[8010\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400059#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason the free travel companion pass for visually impaired children is not widened to include children with other physical or intellectual disabilities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1194","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":219,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[8011\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400059#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on the current situation where parents of certain children with disabilities may qualify for free travel if they are in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance and qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance, but the child for whom the allowance is granted is not eligible for free travel; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The 2015 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;3.01 billion.    <\/p>  <p>  In the case of persons aged under 25 years of age, the means test for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance takes account of the value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed by a claimant as a result of residing with a parent or step-parent.  The calculation of such value is based on the level of parental net income.  Parental income is calculated as gross income less tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge, superannuation and union dues.  Rent or mortgage repayments are disregarded, where appropriate and a parental allowance of &euro;600 per week per couple plus &euro;50 per week in respect of other dependent children applies.  The balance is assessed at 34% and this constitutes the weekly value of benefit and privilege.  Once the person concerned reaches 25 years of age, the value of any benefit and privilege will no longer be regarded as means.<\/p>  <p>  Reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009.  Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to recipients under 26 years of age.  This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.  It aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme he or she will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160. <\/p>  <p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed from a young age.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.  Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding, with an increase of over 80,000 in employment over the last two years. <\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall.  For example the youth unemployment rate in Ireland as estimated by Eurostat was 21.6% in December 2014 as compared to 30.8% in December 2011.  However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400059#WRE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Applications","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400059#WRE01650"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[8122\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400059#WRE01700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the full extent of entitlement to a disability allowance-invalidity pension in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The person with the disability must occupy the property as his or her sole or main residence after the adaptation is completed.  Under the Disability Act 2005 disability means &quot;a substantial restriction in the capacity of an individual to carry on a profession, business or occupation in the State or to participate in social or cultural life in the State by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Section 10B of the LPT Act provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT may apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Injuries Board (formerly known as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board) or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals.  In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption only applies where the cost of the adaptation work exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it was adapted.<br\/><br\/>Entitlement to the exemption provided for in section 10B will depend on whether the extent of a person's disability is such that they are permanently and totally incapacitated from being able to maintain themselves.  &quot;Maintain&quot; in this context means a person's ability to support themselves by earning an income from working.  Total incapacity in this context means that the individual is not capable of earning a living from any kind of work.\u00a0 The incapacity must also be permanent, that is, there must be no prospect of the individual recovering, or of the condition improving, to the extent that they become capable of maintaining themselves.

In view of this, the Chairman has advised me that Revenue will apply the exemption and the tax relief in line with the proposed revised legislation.\u00a0 The Commissioners have published detailed guidelines which describe how a residential property qualifies for the reduction in market value or the exemption under the new arrangements, and how liable persons should make their application to Revenue.

Petrol stretching involves the illegal addition of a low tax commodity to petrol, and the motive of the criminals who engage in this activity is to profit from the sale of the adulterated petrol, thereby defrauding motorists and the State.  Revenue has received 135 complaints to date, the majority of which originated in Revenue's Border Midland West Region.  The numbers of complaints relating to counties Longford and Westmeath are 3 and 7 respectively.<\/p>  <p>  Every filling station about which a complaint was made has been visited by Revenue enforcement officers and fuel samples taken from them have been sent for analysis by the State Laboratory. Over 300 samples of petrol from filling stations and other sources have been referred to the State Laboratory.<\/p>  <p>  The scientific analysis required is complex and time-consuming and the State Laboratory has conducted an extensive series of tests and re-tests on the samples.  Despite this extensive testing, evidence of the presence of prohibited stretching agents has been found in only two samples, both from one location.  The conclusive results received from those tests have resulted in the seizure of the product, and files are being prepared with a view to prosecution.<\/p>  <p>  Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results were received which indicate the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations.  This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time.  There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to mix normal road diesel with petrol.  If the problems that have come to light were caused by unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed with petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved.  However, the Revenue Commissioners are investigating vigorously the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems.  In any instances where the analysis of samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against\u00a0 alleged offenders where possible.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue will also continue to work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and share information and intelligence with them on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that they undertake, on an ongoing basis, an extensive programme of compliance and enforcement actions to ensure adherence to the legal requirements governing the supply and sale of mineral oil and to allow action to be taken against fraud.  This involves, among other things, carrying out analysis of the monthly oil movement returns that oil traders are required to make, and of other supply chain data.  In addition, Revenue officers conduct control or compliance visits to mineral oil traders, during which they examine transport and movement documents and take samples of fuel for analysis.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are taking all possible action to identify the problem and challenge any instances of identified fuel fraud, including, where possible, pursuing prosecutions against offenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400060#WRF04400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400060#WRF04500"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[7887\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400060#WRF04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to assist those who invested their pension fund with a company (details supplied) and whose fund was misappropriated, leaving them without any retirement income, in view of the fact, that as a result of legislative change, neither the regulator nor any of the directors have been held accountable to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":301,"content":"<p>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the case of Custom House Capital (CHC) which is now in liquidation.<br\/><br\/>The Central Bank's investigation into CHC and persons concerned in\u00a0its management has been on-going since the publication of the Final Report to the High Court by Court Appointed Inspectors dated 19 October 2011.\u00a0 Upon presentation of the Final Inspectors' Report to the High Court in October 2011, Mr. Justice Hogan ordered that CHC be wound up immediately.\u00a0 It should be noted that copies of the Final Report have been provided to other relevant state authorities for their consideration i.e. the Minister for Justice and Equality, to the Director of Public Prosecutions, to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, to the Revenue Commissioners and to the Garda Commissioner.<br\/><br\/>Following consultation with An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, the Central Bank's investigation has been deferred pending completion of investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>In order to enhance the\u00a0investor protection legislative framework, the Central Bank has been provided with extensive new powers since the onset of the financial crises\u00a0to prevent the loss of client assets as occurred in the case of CHC.

This Act significantly enhances the capacity of the Central Bank to supervise regulated financial services providers and enforce financial services legislation.  The fitness and probity provisions are reinforced by the whistleblower protections.  The Act also provides for the Central Bank to commission, as part of the proper and effective regulation of financial service providers, an independent expert report at the cost of the financial service provider.  It strengthens the authorised officer regime, enables the Central Bank to secure\u00a0assurances from auditors of regulated financial service providers. \u00a0It also strengthens the enforcement powers of the Central Bank and provides for a substantial increase in monetary penalties. The Central Bank\u00a0also has the power to suspend or revoke a regulated entity's authorisation following an Inquiry.<br\/><br\/><b>Client Assets Regulations for investment firms<\/b><br\/><br\/>An independent review of the Regulatory Regime for the Safekeeping of Client Assets was published by the Central Bank in 2012 and is available on the Central Bank website.

This\u00a0is recognised by TASC in their report.  This reflects, inter alia, the effectiveness of the Irish tax and social welfare system in reducing inequality of market incomes.

The Revenue Commissioners advise me that, while there is no reliable estimate of the extent of illegal activity in the fuel sector, they recognise that fuel fraud, including the laundering of markers from rebated fuel, is a significant threat to Exchequer revenues.  Action against this illegal activity is, therefore, a priority for Revenue, which is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem.  Key elements of this strategy include the following:<\/p>  <p> - The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of fuel criminals to place laundered fuel on the market.<\/p>  <p> - A new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering.<\/p>  <p> - New requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure that data would be available to support supply chain analysis.<\/p>  <p> - Following a significant investment in the required IT systems, new supply chain controls were introduced from January 2013.  These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns of their fuel transactions to Revenue.  These data are being used to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary.<\/p>  <p> - Close co-operation, in the framework of the Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, with other enforcement authorities in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland in combating the all-island problem of fuel fraud.  This has proven effective in supporting the identification and targeting of the organised crime groups, many with links to paramilitaries and former paramilitaries, which are responsible for the bulk of fuel fraud.<\/p>  <p> - Following a joint process, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs have identified a new and more effective product to mark rebated fuels.  The new marker will be produced by Dow Chemical Company and will be introduced in the State and in the UK from the end of March 2015, providing a significant boost in the fight against illegal fuel laundering in both jurisdictions.  In addition, I have introduced a range of legislative measures in recent years to support Revenue's work in fighting fuel fraud, including reckless trading provisions that ensure a mineral oil trader is liable for the mineral oil tax evaded where that trader knew, or was reckless as to whether or not, in making a supply or delivery, he or she was participating in a transaction or series of transactions connected to the evasion of mineral oil tax.  In the Finance Act 2014, I introduced measures to further strengthen Revenue's ability to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence where the trader does not comply with excise law, does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records, or provides false or misleading information.  Revenue's strategy has yielded significant results.  Since mid-2011, 134 filling stations were closed for breaches of licensing conditions, over 3 million litres of oil have been seized and 31 oil laundries were detected and closed down.  Industry sources indicate a much-reduced incidence of laundered fuel on the market, and road diesel consumption and tax revenues have risen significantly compared with a couple of years ago.  Obviously, other economic factors have contributed to this growth but reduced fraud is also an important factor.  There were four convictions between 2010 and 2014 for offences related to the illegal laundering of markers from fuel.  In addition, there were twelve convictions in that period for offences related to the sale or distribution of laundered fuel, in respect of which the penalties imposed by the Courts included fines amounting to &euro;37,000.  The Revenue Commissioners are not responsible for the collection of fines imposed by the Courts and would not have details about their payment.  The Revenue Commissioners work to ensure also that the tax affairs on any persons found to be involved in the illegal laundering of fuel are subjected to full and rigorous examination, and that monies owed, including interest and penalties where applicable, are recovered.  In relation to the resources allocated to investigate this form of fuel fraud, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are a fully integrated tax and customs administration and that it is not possible to disaggregate resources deployed exclusively at any given time on action against fuel laundering.  Revenue currently has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance.  These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.  The Revenue Commissioners were subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions imposed since 2009.  Revenue's overall staffing levels have reduced from a total of 6,581 full-time equivalents at the end of 2008 to the current level of 5,661.  Notwithstanding this reduction, Revenue staff resources assigned to compliance activities have been maintained at around 2,000.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are committed to ensuring that, despite the staffing reductions, enforcement work generally, and action against fuel fraud specifically, will continue to be resourced to the maximum extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400061#WRG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Rebate Scheme","counter":329,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400061#WRG01750"},{"type":"question","counter":330,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[8100\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400061#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a matter (details suppled) regarding a fuel rebate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":331,"content":"<p>I introduced this scheme in the Finance Act 2013 in order to provide for a repayment to qualifying road haulage and bus operators of a part of the mineral oil tax paid on their purchases of auto-diesel for use in the course of business.  In order to address the risk of widespread abuse of the scheme, provision was made for certain restrictions on the means by which the auto-diesel concerned may be purchased.  Purchases in bulk must be made from a licensed mineral oil trader, and delivered, in a quantity exceeding 2,000 litres, to a premises or place that is under the control of that qualifying road transport operator. <\/p>  <p>  Bulk purchases from licensed mineral oil traders can be verified by reference to the monthly electronic returns that the oil traders are required to make to Revenue.  These returns form part of the supply chain controls introduced by Revenue to tackle the problem of illicit fuel, prior to the introduction of the diesel rebate scheme.  The return provides an electronic record of the purchases, stock movements and sales of mineral oil each month by licensed mineral oil traders, by oil product type, including bulk sales to customers exceeding 2000 litres.  This information can be used to verify electronically claims for bulk purchases under the diesel rebate scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Purchases by means of a fuel card, approved by Revenue for the purpose of the scheme, also qualify for repayment and there is no minimum requirement on purchases made in this way.  A fuel card will be approved where Revenue is satisfied that the fuel card provider will supply it with the information required about purchases of auto-diesel by means of that card.  Fuel cards are widely available and are usable across the road network and there are a number of fuel card providers who can supply suitable fuel cards to road transport operators and fuel retailers.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined, the scheme is not solely confined to the minimum purchase requirement of 2,000 litres.  Purchases by a qualifying coach operator by means of a fuel card approved by Revenue are not subject to a minimum purchase requirement and allow the coach operator concerned to avoid fuel storage while claiming under the scheme, thereby alleviating the security risks identified. <\/p>  <p>  The current purchasing arrangements under the scheme are necessary to enable Revenue to manage repayments to qualifying transport operators while controlling the risk of fraud.  I am satisfied that the purchasing arrangements achieve the right balance between making the scheme available to compliant transport operators and allowing Revenue to manage effectively the risk of fraud and I do not plan to change these arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400061#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Policy","counter":332,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400061#WRG01950"},{"type":"question","counter":333,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[8137\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400061#WRG02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has had discussions with the European Commission regarding the expenditure benchmark, and its application to Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In the case of pregnancy-related or assisted pregnancy-related illness, the requirement for hospitalisation of two consecutive weeks will be reduced to two or more consecutive days of in-patient hospital \/ clinic care<\/p>  <p>  The HR Manager will then decide, following consideration of the advice of the occupational health physican,\u00a0whether to grant extended paid sick leave\u00a0under the critical illness provisions.\u00a0 It should also be noted\u00a0that where\u00a0there are\u00a0- in objective terms - exceptional circumstances relating to an illness or injury that warrant the application of the critical illness provisions\u00a0where the strict medical criteria do not apply, the HR Manager may grant access to extended paid sick leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400062#WRH01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400062#WRH01850"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[8074\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400062#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No.241 of 17 February 2015, if, and the way, Ireland's treaty obligation to ensure progressive realisation of economic, social and cultural rights to the maximum of available resources is taken into account in the comprehensive review of expenditure process; if the various Departments are instructed to undertake an analysis in meeting these obligations in preparation of their departmental submission papers; and if his Department takes account of these obligations in preparation of its own Department-by-Department analysis papers, drawn up in response to the departmental submissions.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":382,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[8076\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400062#WRH02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will itemise the specific measures by which the Government's treaty obligation to ensure progressive realisation of economic, social and cultural rights to the maximum of available resources is reflected in the expenditure measures in budget 2015.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":383,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 263 and 265 together.<\/p>  <p> The Government's priorities in\u00a0returning stability to the public finances, have been to meet fiscal targets\u00a0while also ensuring that economic recovery\u00a0is supported and the most vulnerable in society are protected.\u00a0 This approach\u00a0to economic and fiscal policy, through maintaining an acceptable social safety net and returning the unemployed to work, has been\u00a0consistent with the ideals set out under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure in critical economic and social sectors\u00a0has been protected to the greatest extent possible:\u00a0in 2015 some four-fifths of gross voted current expenditure\u00a0is allocated to the Social Protection, Health and Education sectors.\u00a0 Our continued prioritisation of these sectors has meant that primary social welfare rates\u00a0have been\u00a0maintained since this Government took office.\u00a0 Our commitment to protecting our society's most vulnerable is\u00a0also found in recent data published by Eurostat showing that Ireland's system of social transfers, the redistribution of wealth and income to those most in need, is among the most effective in Europe at reducing the at risk of poverty rate.<\/p>  <p>  Aside from social transfers, the fundamental reforms to labour market activation undertaken by this Government represent a significant modernisation\u00a0of Ireland's approach to tackling unemployment through a two-pronged approach: Pathways to Work ensures that the unemployed are given a chance to up-skill and re-join the workforce; while the Action Plan for Jobs has directed its efforts towards boosting labour demand through key reforms.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, our investment in the Health sector has ensured that key frontline services have been maintained and will be enhanced further through initiatives such as extending free GP care to children under 6 years of age. In the area of Education we have sought to protect DEIS expenditure which prioritises the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged areas. Furthermore, this prioritisation of expenditure has been pursued against the backdrop of increasing demands on public services due to cyclical economic conditions and demographic factors.<\/p>  <p>  Last year's Comprehensive Review of Expenditure informed the expenditure measures in Budget 2015.\u00a0The Review\u00a0was informed by Government priorities and took into account economic and societal demands. The main objectives of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure process were to provide Government with the necessary evidence and analysis to re-align spending with the priorities set out in the Programme for Government; meet overall fiscal objectives; and explore new and innovative ways of delivering Government policy in a reformed public sector.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, Ministers and their Departments had primary responsibility for delivering a detailed expenditure report based on evaluation of each budgetary programme under their remit, including programmes delivered by Government Agencies. The analysis carried out by Departments drew on a wide-ranging base of evidence developed since the last Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, including previous expenditure evaluations and policy analysis. Naturally, as part of the overall approach to undertaking this analysis Departments considered any relevant obligations leading to expenditure commitments, as deemed appropriate by each Department. <\/p>  <p>  Overall the Government's approach to implementing the difficult but necessary fiscal adjustment over recent years has ensured that vital public services were protected during challenging economic times. On the back of these efforts, the economic and fiscal position in which Ireland now finds itself is vastly improved, and Budget 2015 provided an opportunity to alleviate pressures and enhance certain key services. The Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015   2017 and the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2015 protects and provides for expenditure allocations in fundamental policy areas: anticipated Live Register savings from falling unemployment in 2015 have been reinvested to ensure that Ireland's effective system of social transfers is adequately funded in the face of rising demographic pressures; the\u00a0allocation provided to the Health sector will deliver\u00a01.7 million Medical Cards and a further 0.4 million GP Visit Cards; capital investment of &euro;2.2bn (public and private) on the multi-annual housing programme will lead to an additional 10,000 social housing units by 2018; increased investment in education will allow for an additional 920 mainstream teachers, an additional 480 resource teachers for children\u00a0with special education needs and 365 Special Needs Assistants; funding is provided for the establishment of the Low Pay Commission.  The overall 2015 expenditure allocations will\u00a0support the ongoing work of Government in\u00a0furthering\u00a0the economic, social and cultural rights of all Irish citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400062#WRH02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":385,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[8075\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400062#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 241 of 17 February 2015, if he will report on his Department's contribution to the interdepartmental progress consultation on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights currently under way.

My objective is that six Regional Action Plans, including one for the Border region, will be launched by July, with two remaining Plans in development at that stage. <\/p>  <p>  In launching the Action Plan for Jobs: Regional initiative, I announced that new funding of up to &euro;250 million will be made available over the next five years to support job creation through enterprise growth in the regions.  This sum includes &euro;150 million for an IDA property investment programme to attract foreign direct investment into the regions, and &euro;100 million to Enterprise Ireland to support indigenous enterprises to start up, grow and export. <\/p>  <p>  As part of IDA&rsquo;s capital investment programme, a total of nine locations were identified in the recent announcement as headline investments to occur in the period 2015-2017; these investments include facilities at Sligo and Dundalk within the Border Region. <\/p>  <p>  IDA regularly assesses property requirements in Regions and has identified locations where quality building and site solutions would enhance the winning of FDI for a region, commencing with identified locations over the next 3-5 year period.

Significant resources will be invested in utility intensive strategic sites which have a track record of attracting FDI as well as a substantial upgrade of large sections of the existing Business Park network to ensure an attractive suite of investment location options are available to potential investors.<\/p>  <p>  Consultation with local stakeholders will be an essential part of the process of developing the Regional Action Plans for Jobs.  In this context, officials from my Department and the Enterprise Development Agencies will consult with all relevant bodies who can assist in the development of these Regional Action Plans, including the local Chambers of Commerce. The local Chambers can also play an important role in promoting and delivering actions to support enterprise development and job creation in each region.

I also established a Trade Team within the Department in order to ensure a strategic , coordinated and proactive approach to identification of export targets and markets and pursuit of market access. I hosted numerous inward visits so that I could demonstrate first hand to our target markets the quality and sustainability of Irish agrifood production. I also appointed agricultural attach&eacute;s to Beijing and Moscow reflecting the importance of the Chinese and Russian markets in our export strategy.  <br\/><br\/>The list below illustrates the main tangible outcomes to date of these efforts. Of course, it does not include the many agreements on greater cooperation and information exchange which have been concluded on a government to government and business to business basis, which are too numerous to list here but which are a major significance in the development of new markets.

The basis for these inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers and types of inspections that must be conducted each year. Details of these inspections and the regulations involved are published in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes which are sent to every applicant annually.  These inspections are a necessary requirement in order to draw down approximately &euro;1.5 billion of EU funds annually and to avoid EU disallowances. The inspections are subject to repeated audits by the European Commission, the European Court of Auditors and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office and this ensures an independent verification that inspections are conducted in full compliance with the legal requirements. In abiding with the findings of these audits my Department ensures that these inspections are conducted in a fair and equitable manner and in full accordance with the legislative provisions. Furthermore inspecting officers are very experienced and are regularly trained to ensure that they carry out inspections in a professional manner, with a process of continuous oversight by supervisors and random verification of inspections to ensure a fair and consistent approach. Also when conducting inspections standardised inspection report forms and guidance documentation are provided to the inspecting officers, with the inspection outcome being recorded on the relevant schemes&rsquo; IT system. This approach ensures that both the quality and consistency of inspections are maintained at extremely high levels.<\/p>  <p>  A comprehensive appeal mechanism is in place in order to protect the interests of farmers who have difficulties with the inspection findings or who consider that the inspection has not been conducted in accordance with legislative requirements.

Where the farmer remains dissatisfied, the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office and ultimately to the Office of the Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400065#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400065#WRL00600"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":304,"qnumall":"[8169\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400065#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason some of the agri-environment options scheme 2 payments for 2014, in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Mayo, were kept back; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":503,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the 2011 Agri Environment Options Scheme (AEOS 2) with effect from the 1<sup>st<\/sup>September 2011.

Accordingly, the detailed information sought by the Deputy for the years 2007 to 2009 is not available.  I am, however, advised by INIS that in 2009, an estimated 368 entry visas were granted for the purpose of joining Irish spouses or partners.  For the reason outlined above, a further breakdown of these figures is not possible, including the number of refusals.  In 2010, 539 Irish entry visas were granted for the purpose of joining Irish spouses or partners and 76 were refused.<\/p>  <p>  The total number of refusals of Irish entry visa applications for the period 2011 to 2014, made for the purpose of joining Irish spouses or partners, was 495.  A breakdown of the number of applications granted and refused in each of these years was provided to the Deputy in reply to her question of 20 January, 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Applications for visas for family reunification are refused for a range of reasons such as insufficient documentation furnished by the applicant or in some cases suspected fraudulent documents.  In addition, visas are refused because of the financial capacity of the Irish national sponsor. Indeed in many cases there can be a combination of these and other reasons for refusal.  Accordingly, it is not possible to provide the breakdown sought by the Deputy without the examination of the file of each individual application which would require the expenditure of an inordinate amount of staff time and resources being diverted away from processing of applications which could not be justified.<\/p>  <p>  The Department's Policy Document on Non-EEA Family Reunification, referred to by the Deputy, was published in December 2013 and came into force on 1st January 2014.  In that year, a total of 760 entry visas were granted for the purpose of joining an Irish spouse or partner. The policy document specifically recognises ministerial discretion indicating that such discretion applies to most of the decision making in the area of family reunification as covered by the policy document.  It is more a question of the policy document providing greater detail on how that discretion is intended to be applied.  Accordingly, the visa deciding officer considers the full circumstances of each case which are fully taken into account in deciding each application.  In addition, appeals of decisions are considered by a different officer of my Department who is generally at a more senior level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400065#WRL04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Certificates","counter":541,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400066#WRM00150"},{"type":"question","counter":542,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[7779\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400066#WRM00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will reduce the application fee or the fee for a certificate of naturalisation to enable greater access to citizenship to those unable to afford these fees; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":543,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[7780\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400066#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views that the fees related to naturalisation are preventing migrants in the State from becoming citizens; her further views that this has a negative impact on the ability of migrant communities to engage in political events, such as referenda, presidential elections and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann elections; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1195","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":544,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 319 and 320 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Regulations 2011 set out the prescribed fees to be paid by an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation.  An application fee of &euro;175 is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a fee is payable by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  The certification fees were last changed in 2008.<\/p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.

It is notable that the volume of applications for -a certificate of naturalisation increased by over 50% in 2011, and increased further in 2012. The Deputy will be aware that following the grant of citizenship it is no longer necessary for the person concerned to register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau which requires the payment of a fee of &euro;300 per registration. I do not accept that the fees related to naturalisation are a barrier to migrants in the State becoming Irish citizens. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.

Just last December, I met with the Garda Commissioner , other senior Garda officers and senior officials from my Department and relevant agencies to further develop responses to particular concerns regarding drug dealing and anti-social behaviour manifesting in the Dublin city centre area. <br\/><br\/>In addition, drug law enforcement remains a key priority area for the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This is clearly reflected in the Programme for Government commitments and  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Policing Plan for 2015 which highlights a strong focus in combating serious crime in all its forms. <br\/><br\/>The Deputy will appreciate that drugs related issues feature prominently across the criminal justice policy areas for which I have responsibility whether it is in the context of crime policy, penal policy, prison and probation initiatives, youth diversion initiatives  etc. <br\/><br\/>Given the extent to which this issue permeates the work of my Department detailing the resources including staff resources associated with that work is not without its difficulty.  Having said that, details of drug related expenditure incurred by national authorities is collated for EU data collection purposes on an annual basis. Within that framework, expenditure by this Department in 2014 was estimated to be &euro;18.5m. This included funding in areas such as the community based addiction projects supported by the Probation Service, Garda Youth Diversion Projects and the criminal justice related costs associated with the Drug Treatment Court and the National Drug Related Deaths Index. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400066#WRM01750","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reserve","counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400066#WRM01775"},{"type":"question","counter":563,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[7873\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400066#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the date extra powers in the area of public order will be granted to attested members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Reserve; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":564,"content":"<p>I fully support the important role of the Garda Reserve in the delivery of the policing service.

As of 1st January 2014, the Child and Family Agency is  responsible for the former Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and also for the functions of Child and Family services previously provided by the HSE.   The Agency's functions  include maintaining and developing services in order to support and promote the development, welfare  and protection of children and to support effective functioning of families. In so doing  the Agency will promote enhanced interagency cooperation  to ensure that services  are coordinated on the principle of the best interest of all children and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency is in the process of refining and implementing a new strategic approach to service delivery through an integrated model of service committed to the principle of &ldquo;One Child, One Team, One Plan&rdquo;. The EWS of the Child and Family Agency is developing national guidelines as a practical support for schools in the preparation of School Attendance Strategies as outlined in Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. The guidelines will assist schools to implement effective measures to support children at risk of poor attendance and participation, including those with caring responsibilities. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be completed before the beginning of the 2015\/16 academic year. <\/p>  <p>  In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to help to identify the extent to which children have caring responsibilities.    The Census of Population 2011 found that 6,449 children, or 5.6 per 1,000 children provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problems or disability.  Rates ranged from 4.3 per 1,000 in Co. Louth to 8.2 per 1000 in Co. Leitrim.  Under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children&rsquo;s Lives (2011-2016) analysis of those figures in the 2011 Census will help to inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles. This analysis will be published in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  A National Youth Strategy is also being developed by my Department.  It will be a universal strategy for all young people aged 10 to 24 years. It will have a particular focus on those who are most disadvantaged or at risk and who have the poorest outcomes and therefore in most need of support.

This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.<\/p>  <p>  Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides that the Child and Family Agency may assist a child leaving its care if it is satisfied that the person has a &ldquo;need for assistance&rdquo;. The provisions have been interpreted and applied on the basis that young people who have had a care history with the Agency are entitled to an assessment of need, from which an aftercare plan may be prepared and an aftercare service may be offered (based on the assessed needs).<\/p>  <p>  Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support.  Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.<\/p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18.  According to the Child and Family Agency, at the end of September, 2014 there were 1,698 young people aged 18 to 23 years (inclusive) in receipt of an aftercare service.  Of those, 946 (56 %) were in full time education.  <\/p>  <p>  A significant number of these young people are supported financially to remain living with their foster carers, in addition to having access to an aftercare worker.  The most vulnerable group of children are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements.  Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that help them achieve good outcomes.  <\/p>  <p>  Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published in the early part of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400068#WRO02100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inter-Country Adoptions","counter":661,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400068#WRO02150"},{"type":"question","counter":662,"qnumday":363,"qnumall":"[7933\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400068#WRO02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding negotiations between the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the Russian authorities in respect of the bilateral agreement on inter-country adoptions; when the authority will finalise the wording of the agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":663,"content":"<p>Efforts are ongoing in my Department in relation to a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation.

In exceptional cases where an allocated social worker is not in place, the case is monitored at principal social worker level and managed by the duty social work team.  It is important to note that urgent cases where a child is at imminent risk are acted upon immediately.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to children for whom particular needs have been identified, it is important to state that children in care attend the same schools and services as other children in the community.  This means that if a child in care needs a psychology assessment it would be accessed through the National Educational Psychology Service (NEPS) or through the community  psychology service in primary care in the first instance depending on the particular need.  These needs would be set out in the child's written care plan.  Some residential care service have access to dedicated professionals.  For example, children in special care attend school on-site and therapeutic services provided by the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS).  <\/p>  <p>  The Agency has a budget of &euro;643 million for 2015, an increase of &euro;34 million on 2014.  I am satisfied that the work of the Agency is being well monitored by my Department and that the Agency has prepared a comprehensive business plan that aims to ensure that all children in care receive the supports and service they require.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400069#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Poverty","counter":692,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400069#WRP00750"},{"type":"question","counter":693,"qnumday":373,"qnumall":"[8291\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015022400069#WRP00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which the issue of child poverty continues to be monitored by his Department, with particular reference to the need to identify the most vulnerable families, with a view to provision of support; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":694,"content":"<p>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014 - 2020 (BOBF), which was published and launched by Government in 2014, provides the overarching framework for the development and implementation of policy and services for children and young people.
