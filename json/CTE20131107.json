At least five weeks ago we had the Accounting Officer for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before the committee.  He was asked to provide answers to simple questions that he did not have on the day.  Most of these answers could have been provided in 24 hours.  There is no reason all the information requested could not be supplied within seven days.  Five weeks have now passed and there have been several further requests.  I am proposing that if we have not received the information requested by next week, we ask the Accounting Officer to present himself for ten minutes at the beginning of the following week&rsquo;s meeting to explain why he has not supplied the information.  It is not about him giving the answers but to explain why an Accounting Officer for a Department with which this committee liaises has not responded to requests for information.  While people may think this is extreme, often committee members ask questions, are told they will receive a reply but do not obtain one.  As a matter of form, from now on if an Accounting Officer does not supply information requested after four weeks, he or she should be automatically brought back for ten minutes to explain why he or she has done so.  It would probably be the best way of ensuring we receive the answers and information requested.  Perhaps the secretariat will go through all of the meetings held since the summer and find out what information we have not received from Departments.  Secretaries General should be put on notice that if we do not receive it within the next week, they are to come before the committee to explain why they have not responded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013110700003#B00700","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1383818400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Is any other member offering?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013110700003#B00800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1383818400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Can we agree to write to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to explain that we need the information requested?

It is timely to look at this again considering the publication of the Local Government Bill.  I would take the Chairman's advice and guidance on this but we raised the following issue with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform by way of a letter and with the Secretary General of the Department when he was here on a number of occasions and the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The issue was the fact that members collectively are not satisfied that there is adequate scrutiny when money goes to local authorities.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform gave us an answer from memory that he was open to looking at this committee having a greater role in tracking that money.  I think that is desirable but if it is not going to happen that way, we need to know what is going to happen instead.  In my county alone, I could list a litany of complete and utter waste.  We do not have the same level of opportunity to scrutinise that.  There are vast sums of money on deposit and on loan and development levies not paid.  Again, I am open to suggestions from the Chairman and the committee but I think we should pursue it with the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Public Expenditure and Reform at this stage in the context of the Local Government Bill by reiterating our desire for some greater level of transparency in terms of local government funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013110700004#C01700","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1383819000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Would it be possible to facilitate that and bring in the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and possibly the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and have a discussion with them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013110700004#C01800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1383819000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I know they were both in but the Bill has been published since they appeared before us and I have yet to see in the Bill what greater scrutiny there will be from when money leaves central government to go to local government so I would very much welcome that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013110700004#C01900","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1383819600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Deputy Simon Harris is correct in regard to the need to follow local government expenditure, but I thought we had already addressed this issue.

We have raised the issue at this committee on three or four occasions in the past year.  It is another important element when it comes to local government.  Taking up what Deputy Simon Harris said about what the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, had offered with regard to the committee investigating this area, there is an acceptance of the arguments we have been making on commercial rates.  The Ministers and Secretaries General to whom I spoke in the past couple of days appeared to accept the amendments we would be tabling to the Local Government Bill 2013.  We need to take an holistic view of commercial rates when it comes to the two Departments mentioned.  The Departments of Finance and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation could also play a role.  There has been a lack of joined-up thinking between Departments on commercial rates and their potential effect on businesses in putting them to the wall.  Based on what we have done at this committee, the Departments have reached the point where they recognise that these sentiments deserve attention.

It licenses and regulates greyhound racing.  Its primary sources of income are income generated from its Tote operations and the greyhound racing tracks it owns and State funding received from the horse and greyhound fund.  The board's racing track activities are operated through 11 subsidiary companies, nine of which are wholly owned.  The financial statements are group accounts consolidating the results of the subsidiaries.<\/p><p>  The economic downturn has significantly impacted on Bord na gCon, with net Tote betting income down from &euro;8.9 million in 2008 to &euro;5.2 million in 2011.  Its annual allocation from the horse and greyhound fund fell from &euro;15.3 million to &euro;11.4 million in the same period.  While the board has also reduced expenditure, its annual surplus has fallen from &euro;4.7 million in 2008 to &euro;500,000 in 2011.  Bord na gCon's gross borrowings increased from &euro;11.6 million at the end of 2008 to &euro;23 million at the end of 2011.  This is just below its sanctioned borrowing limit of &euro;25 million.  The increase in borrowing related mainly to the cost of construction of a new stadium and headquarters offices in Limerick which were completed in 2010.  The bank borrowings are on an interest-only basis until December 2016.<\/p><p>  In the light of the reduced profitability and the level of outstanding debt, I drew attention in my audit report to note 24 of Bord na gCon's financial statements which explained why the board was satisfied that it was appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.  This included the assumption of continued State funding and, significantly, that there would be future increases in turnover from greyhound racing, including Tote-related activities.  The costs associated with the capital development in Limerick and its impact on Bord na gCon's trading position were examined during the audit.  Media reports on the project raised a number of concerns.  As the issues raised did not materially affect the 2011 financial statements, I was able to conclude the audit.  However, I requested a further examination during the 2012 audit of the project and its impact on the board's activities.  We await Bord na gCon's responses to a number of queries in that regard.  When we have a final response, I will consider whether a special report should be prepared on that matter.<\/p><p>  My audit report for 2011 included references to two areas where control weaknesses were identified.  The audit tested a sample of high value procurements by Bord na gCon in 2011 and found that competitive procurement processes had not been used for a substantial proportion of the spend examined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013110700006#E01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383820800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>The Irish Greyhound Board welcomes the opportunity to meet the committee, not just to deal with the 2011 accounts but also to outline its plans to optimise the opportunities that now present to monetise its racing product on a worldwide basis and which have been documented in the board's strategic plan 2013-17.  Particularly for those members who may not be familiar with the greyhound industry, a few points may be helpful.  It is a &euro;500 million industry.  According to the last economic review of the industry in 2011, it supports approximately 10,300 full-time and part-time jobs in the economy.  The gross wage bill is of the order of &euro;207 million, with the tax contribution being &euro;21 million.<\/p><p>  When I came into office, I made it an important part of my role to travel around the country to meet all stakeholders.  The industry, traditionally, has been fragmented, but there is no doubt in my mind that the vast majority of greyhound people are on the same page; they know their industry; they realise its potential and understand that it will achieve its promise on the back of decisions clearly laid out in the strategic plan.  Enormous work is being undertaken by people involved in the greyhound industry at all levels.  This work is, however, being undermined by continuous attacks by a small, unrepresentative group within the industry.  They paint a picture that is completely at odds with the reality and I hope this engagement with the committee will give members a better understanding of the scope, importance and ambition of our work.  The industry has a high reputation internationally.  This is reflected in the level of interest in the Irish greyhound racing product and operating model from the world's largest bookmaking organisations and countries where the industry is new and in its early stages.<\/p><p>  The industry has an acknowledged pre-eminence for greyhound breeding and the quality and regulation of its racing.  That reputation creates many opportunities which have significant economic benefit.  These range from the internationalisation of the Irish racing product to increased dog exports and collaborative trading  arrangements with greyhound industries in other countries.  Greyhound racing has been particularly exposed to the consequences of the recession and the severe reduction in disposable income in recent years.  It is clear that the current climate has impacted very negatively on racing attendances and, more importantly, customer spends levels at stadia.  Since 2007 the board's turnover from racing activities has reduced by approximately 50%.  That is a reflection of falling attendances, a decline in greyhound breeding and dog numbers, a consequent reduction in the number of races and, as a result, income, a reduction in the horse and greyhound fund of 28% between 2008 and  2013 and significantly lower disposable spend from its customer base.<\/p><p>  The board has sought to address the impacts of these new realities and create more operational efficiencies which, by any objective yardstick, it has succeeded in doing.  It has reduced its operating costs by 46% and generated operating surpluses, before depreciation, of &euro;23.64 million in the period 2007 to 2012.  Our overall staff costs have been reduced by 32% since 2007 and the board is operating within tight cost control parameters.  We have shown ourselves to be resilient and flexible against the backdrop of a challenging economic climate and we will continue to strive for greater efficiencies and reduction of costs.<\/p><p>  The five year strategic plan was drafted after comprehensive dialogue with and the participation of industry stakeholders.  We had contributions from 1,200 owners, trainers and staff, making the scale of consultation noteworthy.  Bord na gCon's plan outlines new potential growth areas which will further strengthen the industry's racing and breeding reputation internationally and aims to significantly improve its financial position, notwithstanding the current economic difficulties.  In essence, our five year strategy is focused on the protection and maintenance of the Irish greyhound as a world leader and the development of new income streams from off-stadium betting nationally and the globalisation of the Irish racing product which has started to generate dividends.<\/p><p>  A more aggressive commercial direction will include the generation of greater income from sponsorship of higher profile meetings and the development of the classic race meetings into major entertainment events.  We also have to look at new ways to use our assets to achieve a greater financial return and capitalise on the opportunities that present.  Delivering on this objective requires a new organisational structure, the implementation of which is well under way.  We note the debate about the development and licensing of casinos in Ireland and given the quality of our stadia, Bord na gCon is an interested observer in how this debate will unfold.  The ultimate aim of our strategic plan is to grow the industry.  Ireland's greyhound industry is in a strong position to take advantage of a number of new opportunities as a result of successful sustained investment in the industry in recent years.  We look forward to bringing these recommendations to reality over the term of the strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013110700007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Meaney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383820800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>The mandate of the Irish Greyhound Board is multi-faceted, encompassing as it does a commercial remit, with 17 individual stadia, a regulatory function and a greyhound welfare dimension.  Historically, the greyhound industry has always been a challenging one to manage.  There are many interests within it with priorities which have never been easily reconcilable.  It is, perhaps, inevitable that a public narrative often emerges that reflects those sectional interests rather than the state of the industry as a whole.  The board's duty is not just to manage the industry but to chart a course for it that secures the future for the 10,000 people employed in it.<\/p><p>  My chairman has referred to the much more challenging economic environment for businesses like ours which depend on discretionary consumer choices for attendances and Tote income.  We compete in a crowded entertainment space.  It is important that the committee understand that if the industry is to survive, it must appeal to a younger demographic and a broader audience than is represented by greyhound followers.  The sport needs to be further promoted and expanded as popular entertainment and requires the development of additional income streams.<\/p><p>  The IGB strategy for the future recognises these commercial truths.  Notwithstanding the changed economic landscape compared to the period when significant capital expenditure was undertaken, there is no doubt in the mind of the board that the investment in stadia was necessary and overdue.  Greyhound racing must take place in facilities that are modern and comfortable, hence the investment in stadia that meets these criteria.  It is also correct to suggest the new facilities created have averted what might have been a terminal decline in the industry.  The investment has avoided the type and scale of difficulties apparent in other markets.  I believe the organisation of which I am chief executive officer has created the conditions for strong recovery when consumer confidence returns.<\/p><p>  It is also important to understand these new facilities unlock opportunities to sell the Irish greyhound racing product internationally.  By the end of 2014, the Irish Greyhound Board will have benefited to the extent of &euro;950,000 from sales, equating to approximately &euro;825,000 in net profit from contracts bringing Irish greyhound racing to a new global online gambling audience.  By the end of 2017 the board's strategic plan forecasts that this figure, conservatively drawn, will be &euro;1.5 million in net profits per annum from international Tote sales.  We will announce details of significant contracts, already signed, later this month.  These contracts reflect a considerable focus on online wagering income through what is termed \"co-mingling\" arrangements which show live Irish greyhound racing in other jurisdictions, allow online access to the Tote and stream live races to betting companies.  This new income stream has the potential to grow exponentially and can be transformational for the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013110700007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Neilan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383821400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Neilan.

Everybody appreciates the importance of such industries to the Irish economy and communities.  We are asking the question to protect the taxpayers' interests and the industry.  We do not want a \"don't hit me with the baby in my hands\" sort of attitude.<\/p><p>  I will begin with the Limerick track and stadium before moving to other issues.  I accept that the witnesses are not responsible for the Meelick site and neither the chairman nor the chief executive were in office at that stage.  I will take it as read that it was a disaster that should not have happened, and it has been dealt with at previous meetings.  With regard to the Greenpark site, we know that as far back as 2003 there was a major issue of fill, although this relates to a different part of the site.  We know the valuer indicated that should the extent and cost of the fill run to &euro;1.5 million or more, warning bells would begin to sound.  We will take that as read.  We know that what with the messing around with Meelick and the ensuing disaster, in 2008 the board returned to the Greenpark site and bought a smaller portion of the land.  This is where we get to the gentleman's agreement.  I listened to the exchange with Deputy Nolan.  These are questions rather than assertions, so the witnesses may correct me if I am wrong.  I have been told that on 22 November 2007, the engineers, Atkins, indicated in writing with regard to the filling commitment that the purchase included both the existing site and what lies within and beneath the site.  However, it also included works upon the site and through the site to be undertaken in advance of its taking position.  It was noted that it was important that those works be properly specified in the contract, with a mechanism for certification and acceptance prior to handover.

There seems to have been a number of instances where goods and services had not been tendered for and for which quotations had not been sought from a number of suppliers.  I know, from reading the annual report, that there were cases where, in the board's view, due to the nature of the industry, some suppliers had a unique knowledge.

It documented significant issues around catering from 2001.  Bord na gCon has moved on quite a bit from that.  Furthermore, and more importantly, we have reduced our operating expenses by 46%, our administration costs have come down by 40% and our employee costs have come down by 32%.

More importantly, we recognise that we must generate more returns from our assets.  We have a vibrant greyhound industry in Ireland.  Across the world, the total for horseracing tote betting is approximately &euro;100 billion.  Governments all over the world are looking for new ways of raising taxes to balance their current accounts.  One way of doing that is to regularise gaming.  Many Irish-based companies are seeking licences in other jurisdictions and on the back of securing licences, they will require content.  Looking at any of the high street bookmakers, greyhound racing accounts for approximately 16% of turnover.  We are in the fantastic position of having the best breeding, stadiums, tote infrastructure and IT investment in the world in our product to allow those betting companies to earn a margin.<\/p><p>  We have already demonstrated that we have delivered over &euro;800,000 in net profits already, just from selling our product abroad.  We will announce a big deal at the end of this month, which will bring our product in front of 4 million customers.  If we assume that 10% of those - 400,000 - will place a bet of &euro;10, that is &euro;4 million.  We will earn from 6% to 7% net on that margin.  Therefore, we are talking about &euro;320,000 on one &euro;10 bet by 400,000 people.  If that is repeated by seven or eight bets, the return to the greyhound industry will be significant.<\/p><p>  To be fair, the badge that comes with being an Irish Government body is a significant badge.  People are happy to deal with us because of our reputation and standing.  We believe, based on the reaction we are getting at shows we participate in, that people want a partner such as the Irish greyhound industry in the future.  This will develop product sales for us.  It will also develop marketing sales, because as we beam our pictures on the Internet, our wall space and back space become more valuable.  People will want to put up advertising on our wall.  Therefore, as our pools become more liquid, this will allow people who are typically fixed odds betters bet directly with us on our tote book.

That is fine.<\/p><p>  The last issue I wish to raise is about the board's net pension liability.  According to the board's accounts, the pension fund is based on a number of assumptions, of which I will list three.  There is a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme, but the accounts assume on page 30 that the rate of increase in salary is 3% per annum.  I do not think that has been justified in the last couple of years, nor in the next couple of years.  I do not know where that assumption has come from at this stage.  There has also been a rate of increase in pension payment of 2%, as built into the figures.  I do not think that is real.  It is not happening out there.  Then there is an assumed rate of increase in the State retirement pensions of 2%, which affects the balance the board has to pay to its pensioners.  There has not been a 2% increase in the State pension for a number of years.  I know some of those figures balance out each other, but they are all weird assumptions.  None of those assumptions is valid in this day and age.<\/p><p>  I see in the note we received that the board's pension liability at the end of 2010, based on those weird assumptions, was &euro;3.1 million.  At the end of 2011, it was &euro;3.79 million, which is an increase of &euro;690,000.  I see that has gone up to &euro;7.22 million by the end of 2012 - I know those figures have not been audited yet - which is an increase of &euro;3.43 million.  That is a massive increase in pension liability.

The report goes on to state that the financial results in the 2011 annual report did not change from the unaudited accounts as submitted in 2012.  If that is the case, why did it take over a full year to carry out the audit?  That is the implication of what I am getting here, given that the accounts the Comptroller and Auditor General was presented with were the final accounts, according to this document.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013110700017#Q02500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383826800,"counter":322,"content":"<p>The values in the financial statements did not change, but the disclosures would have changed.

However, everyone on the Committee of Public Accounts has received correspondence from a greyhound owners and breeders association criticising the board and stating a vote of no-confidence was passed unanimously with regard to the Irish Greyhound Board chairman, Phil Meaney, and the chief executive, Adrian Neilan.  I am simply giving the comment, I am not saying whether it was right or wrong.<\/p><p>  Then, there were further submissions to the committee.  If I am not mistaken, there is a North East Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association and there seems to be another greyhound breeders association in Limerick.  They have expressed criticism and concern around the industry.  They are concerned about their own industry.  They are concerned about whether the Irish Greyhound Board has a handle on what exactly is happening.  They have expressed concern about individuals on the board but also about the debt and indebtedness of the greyhound industry.<\/p><p>  It would seem the predictions the board made in 2007 to the Minister have not been fulfilled and that the board has fallen short.

We as a committee are not happy with some of the details we have been given this morning - I will not say we are unhappy with the accuracy, but the detail of statements given - and are unconvinced by certain answers we have received.  As such, we will have to go back into this matter again.  I am simply pointing out to Mr. Neilan that on 28 June 2007, the board minute states very clearly that Mr. McMahon would fill the site.  It does not say this would be done if it was possible, if he had the fill or if something else happened; it says very clearly that he would fill the site.  Mr. McMahon also indicated his wish to project manage a stadium development up to planning stage.  Here we have a situation where, as part of that deal, this person would fill the site.<\/p><p>  Based on that information - the proposition of one individual seconded by another - the board unanimously agreed to proceed with the purchase of the site.  In other words, it agreed to purchase the site based on the information given by the individual in question.  If I was told that this individual would fill the site and I was proposing that the site be purchased on that basis, I would expect the site to be filled.  Mr. Neilan had an exchange with Deputies Simon Harris and Derek Nolan in regard to the contract, but here we have the minute suggesting something rather different.  I have not had time to go through Mr. Neilan's document this morning, but there certainly are issues that need to be addressed.  If the members of the board were told that Mr. McMahon would fill the site, I presume the Minister would have signed off on something on 28 June to the effect that this would happen.  Immediately following that sentence in the minute is the proposition by Mr. McKenna and Mr. Reilly, unanimously supported, to purchase the site.  I would have to question the board members as to what they thought was being said to them here.  What is conveyed in the minutes seems to answer the question that was posed to Mr. Neilan by the two Deputies completely differently from what Mr. Neilan said in response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013110700021#U02500","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383829800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and I apologise for my late arrival.

In the past number of years, this has declined quite dramatically.  We have resized our business to cater for that decline.  Revenue has dropped by almost 50% and we have cut our costs by an appropriate amount in order to generate a level of surplus.  What we find is that once some element of vibrancy returns and because we have very large stadia that are very well set up, we can offer people fantastic value in terms of meals.  Last year alone, some 202,000 people partook of meals at our venues.  This year, 26,000 people will have their Christmas parties at our venues.  I have already alluded to the fact that Limerick has the second highest level of Christmas party bookings to date after Shelbourne Park.  We are putting on an extra night's racing at Limerick in order to cater for this.  We know people are very attracted to the product of greyhound racing and we are confident that the industry in Ireland will be sustainable into the future.  However, a huge opportunity to generate real returns that can be reinvested in the industry here will come through the sale of coverage of our meetings to international broadcasters.  UK bookmakers made &euro;243 million in gross gambling yield from greyhound racing.  Some 80% of the dogs involved in racing in the UK come from Ireland.

In doing that we are conscience that our association has made constructive submissions on local government reform in the past 20 years in particular under its current name and its former name, the General Council of County Councils, to this Government and previous Governments.  Looking around the room I am aware that we are fortunate to have the ear of past eminent members of our association who have served the public in that role.<\/p><p>  We welcome that at least some measure of reform will result from the Local Government Bill 2013 that is before us.  A central theme of the association's submissions over time has been the centrality of the county councils and city councils to the functioning of local government.  The county councils are the only component of our local government system that serve all of the people.  Whether it is the town centre dweller or the rural farmer, county level local government serves citizens in all environments - urban, suburban and rural.<\/p><p>  Even in the case of town councils the county council's responsibility did not stop at the town boundary.  Many services ranging from main roads to libraries and fire brigades were and still are provided by the county council.  We see the reform proposed in the Local Government Bill 2013 as the logical conclusion to that reality on the ground.  The town councils will now be integrated with the operation of the county councils providing a unified local government service to the public.  We welcome this step forward as we have long believed that a unitary local government system, which is proven throughout Europe, would provide our citizens with best value while fully respecting the requirements of subsidiarity.  We also welcome section 14 (<i>a<\/i>)(3) of the current Bill, which reiterates that the county and city councils are the primary units of local government and, as members are aware, they are enshrined in the 2001 Local Government Act.<\/p><p>  We have certain concerns about Part 3 of the Bill, which relates to the establishment of municipal districts as a component of the county councils.  While we accept that it is a step towards the unified delivery of local government we question whether the concept of municipal districts is a viable and practical one in the Irish situation.  The concept of a municipal district acting in a kind of proxy capacity for the county council continues to dilute the aspiration for a streamlined and unified local government service.  We are not trying to reinvent the wheel. The type of service we are talking about as outlined in the Bill is widespread throughout Europe in countries that practise a unitary local authority system.  However, assuming the municipal districts go ahead, we must reiterate that the collection of household charges and commercial rates must be conducted by the county council.  If such a function was to be given to the municipal districts it would, in effect, transform them into a town council by another name.  We support the Minister's position that there will be only one budget-making authority in the new configuration.<\/p><p>  A trend over the past 30 years or so has been the advent of organisations that spend large amounts of public money on development projects at arm's length from the democratically elected county councils.  This leads to two streams of public money being spent in the same county without any co-ordination between the two.  We acknowledge the efforts expressed in Part 6 of the Bill in regard to drawing the development companies into an alignment with the statutory local authorities.  However, there are a number of alarming features which in our view will compromise any meaningful alignment between the local authority and the local development sectors in each county. <\/p><p>  We are also concerned about the method of selection of the members of the local and community development board.  Section 35(2) inserts a section 128D(3)(<i>a<\/i>), which states that the chief officer of the local community development committee shall &quot;seek and select nominees&quot; to the committee.  In other words, the selection of members of the committee is being left to an official, and it gets worse.  The proposed section 128D(3)(<i>b<\/i>) states: &quot;The nominees shall be appointed to the committee, without omission or addition, by resolution of the local authority.  In other words, the local authority - the democratically elected forum of the people - is required to rubber stamp names put together by an officer or an official.  We urge members to examine this undemocratic arrangement again when they resume scrutiny of the Bill.<\/p><p>  Section 51 requires the Minister to meet an association at least once a year.  We welcome that but we believe it falls short of the level of consultation required.  A major complaint of our members is the volume of domestic and EU regulation which arrives at local government level without any consultation with the people who are expected to implement the new codes and regulations.  Local authority members must be involved at the earliest stage possible in the development of such regulation.  We note that the County and City Managers Association has a major involvement in the Custom House as regards developing policy for local government.  We believe that wherever the managers are the councillors should be there also.  That principle would provide that necessary system of checks and balances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Councillor Michael O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383818100,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the general council for making their views known to the committee.  The Bill is on Committee Stage and my party is in the process of preparing amendments with a view to getting answers to many of the questions Councillor O'Brien has raised, such as the role of local development companies.  We recognise the aspiration behind that move but we question the manner in which it is being implemented.  We hope that amalgamations take place through negotiation rather than imposition and that the implications for staff, etc., are recognised.  Those who represent staff will, I am sure, raise these issues.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government informed the D&aacute;il last week that progress is being made in that regard.  Questions also arise in regard to appointments to the boards and accountability.  We will make a list of our proposed amendments available to the association at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p>  We do not agree with the thrust of the Bill.  We recognise the need for reform but it must be meaningful reform.  Town councils have played a leading role throughout the country.

We believe our amendments will reflect the opinions and aspirations of local authority members and we will be liaising with them in seeking to represent their views and ensuring we do not lose local democracy.  There is nervousness on the part of many people throughout the country that the disconnect is larger than envisaged by virtue of these proposals.

Councillors are left to answer to the public regarding the strangest of EU directives which impact on people's lives locally but, as anyone with knowledge of European legislation will attest, it takes approximately two years for an idea to become a directive and, in some cases, a further two years to transpose it into Irish law.

Over a long period of time we have seen an incremental erosion of the role and status of the local elected member.  To a large extent this was brought about by the European Union from the period when we were net beneficiaries and a variety of groups were established to operate in parallel with the local government system.  It will not be easy to change a mindset and, as Deputy Cowen pointed out, there are implications for staff and career expectations in the reform of any aspect of the delivery of public services, particularly in regard to the development companies.  There are currently 51 of these companies but there will be 31 local authorities.  It does not necessarily make sense.  Heretofore we had 88 planning authorities in a small country and it is sensible that the number is being reduced to 31.  We will have 31 local government units in a country with a population of 4.5 million, which brings us roughly into line with other countries.  Northern Ireland has a population of 1.8 million and it has 11 councils.  Scotland, with a population of 5.2 million, has 32 local governments.

There will be only one source of resources for a county, although retaining the county system might not have been the best strategy.  We should have done what they did in Northern Ireland and Scotland, for instance, and forget about towns and counties.  However, the decision was made to retain the counties and the five cities, to make up a total of 31, and the members of each unit will decide on the fair and equal distribution of whatever funds are available in that particular county.<\/p><p>  The main difficulty is that we have inherited a system in which nobody can tell how the local government fund is actually distributed.

Where distortions have arisen in the past, they have arisen when the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has been able to lever a little more funding for a particular county.

We do not have an issue with the new structure in so far as it proposes the establishment of municipal entities.  Each municipal district will require a chairman, which role would carry certain recognition at various events.  We see a role for that person on a localised basis.

Our organisation is a representative body for 80 town councils which have serious concerns about the Bill as proposed.  It will result in the loss of 80 town councils and a reduction of 678 councillors.  Like so much else that passes for reform these days, it is a populist endeavour.  Our organisation does not oppose reform; on the contrary: we have been asking for it for years.  However, once we scrutinised the Bill, our confidence that the legislation would deliver real reform evaporated.  While it contains some positive measures, it does not go far enough.  We are not confident that, as proposed, it will not deliver real reform.<\/p><p>  In the past ten months we have been working with all stakeholders to develop a consistent reform agenda for local government.  Two and a half years ago we published our own policy on reform.  In April this year we outlined our vision for the powers and functions of the new municipal district councils.  My fellow councillors and I believe in the spirit of the Government&rsquo;s reform agenda.  However, reform needs to happen at all levels of our democracy to ensure the people are served by a political system that is accountable, functional, democratic and local.  As an association representing elected representatives at local level, we see at first-hand the need for reform at the lowest level of the political system.  Local communities and their democratically elected representatives are best placed to decide what works best in their areas and what services are required.  In many European countries councils are involved with the government in decisions that affect their local areas.  They have diverse powers in areas such as early learning and education, social welfare and health care services and policing.  These are the areas in which reform is needed to allow councillors to have an input on behalf of their communities.  The end result of the current reform process, if not amended, will be one of the most centralised states in the European Union.  <\/p><p>  The Bill contains no fresh initiatives such as tax increment financing or an overhauled commercial rates system that would provide a badly needed shot in the arm for local economies.  We believe local government should involve the retention of town councils and the creation of new town councils in towns which do not have such councils.  The AMAI calls on Deputies and Senators to amend this legislation to ensure it will deliver on the promise of real reform.  The establishment of the new municipal district councils at the expense of town councils is not a panacea for the current inadequacies of local government; nevertheless, it is what we are presented with in the Local Government Bill 2013.  For the past two years the Minister has been quoted as saying he is not abolishing town councils but rather that he will enhance them.  How can a body be enhanced when its financial powers are taken away? <\/p><p>  We are presenting to the committee a number of amendments to the Bill which we believe would redress this situation somewhat.  I urge members to support them.  They call for greater transparency and a more decentralised democratic system.  They are designed to enhance the Bill in order to best serve the people and reduce the democratic deficit.  <\/p><p>  I draw the attention of members to the extent to which the detail of implementation is not contained in the Bill but will be subject to further regulations and guidelines, to be enacted at a later date.  That is somewhat disingenuous.  Our members, just like the committee, are being asked to support the Bill in the absence of the clarity needed to allow us to make an informed decision.  In the interests of transparency, it is imperative to have greater clarity.  The financial mechanisms which will apply to the new municipal district councils are but one example of this deficit.<\/p><p>  Two issues, in particular, are core principles for the AMAI.  The first is the amendment which relates to the financial autonomy of the proposed municipal district councils.  The Bill, as proposed, envisages that municipal district councils will be unable to determine the main financial income, commercial rates and property tax, but as elected representatives, we will have to answer to our electors for how these funds are being spent.  Money matters because whoever controls it determines what services are put in place and the manner in which they are delivered.  In areas across Ireland the ability to use the moneys for their own betterment is critical to their lifeblood and vibrancy.  In my own town of Naas there is no doubt that the direct reinvestment of local charges and taxes has been of significant benefit in attracting investment and employment.  The abolition of town councils ends that financial autonomy.  Any reform of local government must safeguard these principles.<\/p><p>  The second core principle relates to the issue of subsidiarity.  This principle is recognised in all EU member states and strongly protected by the EU governing institutions.  Our European partners are concerned that this principle should be sufficiently protected under the legislation and many in Europe share the AMAI&rsquo;s view that subsidiarity is not being upheld under the legislation, as proposed. <\/p><p>  Last week I led a deputation to Strasbourg to meet members of the Council of Europe to address our concerns about this legislation.  Ireland is a signatory to the Council&rsquo;s European Charter of Local Self-Government.  The charter places fundamental importance on the preservation of subsidiarity.  The Council has confirmed our view that subsidiarity has been weakened under the Bill, as proposed.  The EU Congress of Local and Regional Authorities accepted the report of its own monitoring committee on local government in Ireland.  One of its recommendations in its report urges the Government to &ldquo;strengthen their legislation in order to ensure that the Subsidiarity Principle is better enshrined and protected in the law&rdquo;.  It is vital that this principle is upheld.  It has been suggested by colleagues that we follow the example of what has happened in Northern Ireland and Scotland, but that is not the view of our organisation.  We have seen the results of that policy in England.  The English local government system has not worked and is in the process of being changed.  <\/p><p>  On the question of having a town mayor and Cathaoirleach, the Minister does not seem to have a problem with larger towns and municipal districts keeping their office of mayor.  This is important because many towns are in twinning arrangements with towns all over Europe and the office of mayor is held in greater respect than that of Cathaoirleach.  Many people from other countries cannot pronounce the word \"Cathaoirleach\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Councillor Willie Callaghan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383820500,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.

Another proposed amendment relates to section 29 of the Bill.  We propose that on page 36, between lines 3 and 4, the following should be inserted: &quot;That each municipal district may, in respect of that district, vary the commercial rate and local property tax within that district from the amount applicable to the county council or the city and county council concerned.&quot;.<\/p><p>  This amendment would allow each municipal district council to have the power to vary the commercial or local property tax within the municipal district area in order to carry out specific projects agreed by the members of the municipal area as part of its budget.  When Putting People First was published in October 2012, section 6.7.8, relating to financial arrangements, had a proposal for a:<blockquote><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">provision for members at district level to levy an amount in the district (or a town within the district) additional to the general commercial rate level (possibly by means of an arrangement similar to the &ldquo;town charges&rdquo; system for former town commissioners and subject to any appropriate requirements), with a &ldquo;supplement&rdquo; to the general rate being adopted as part of the budget process, collected at central county level, and the additional amount for a district being allocated accordingly;<\/font><\/blockquote><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">That provision has not been transferred to the Bill, despite the fact it would give more autonomy to local municipal districts.  If they had specific projects that they wanted to carry out, they would have the power to levy an additional rate if deemed appropriate and perhaps with the agreement of the business people within the area.  For example, this could relate to a town enhancement scheme.  A full county agreement would not be required and agreement could be reached on a district level and applied accordingly.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  In section 29 and also on page 36, our next amendment would be to insert the following between lines 3 and 4: &quot;Each municipal district may, in respect of that district, set an additional commercial rate for premises occupied by large commercial entities which exceed such thresholds such as turnover or other economic activity and as may be prescribed.&quot;  Each municipal district should be able to levy additional rates on certain types of businesses, particularly larger businesses such as multiples, which can afford to pay extra levies.  The income that is generated should be ring-fenced within specific areas and used for projects to enhance town centres affected by out of town developments.  We believe the Minister has opened the door to this possibility by introducing the base year adjustment as part of the Bill.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Everybody knows the &quot;Tesco tax&quot; that has been adopted in Northern Ireland and we believe in the base year adjustment.  In all this local government reform, everything has been changed except the current rating system applying in this country.  Small and medium local businesses are finding the current economic climate extremely difficult.  The same rating system is applied to the independent retailer as to the large multiples.  It is now time for the rating system to be examined in this country and a provision like this would give a badly needed shot in the arm to small local and independent businesses that could benefit from a measure like this and relieve pressure.  I appeal to members to take that on board.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  I appreciate that many of these proposed amendments relate to the financial measures.  The next one would to delete lines 4 to 6 of section 29(2) on page 36 and substitute: &quot;The base year adjustment shall be determined in accordance with subsection (3) and (4) by a rating authority with agreement of the members of a municipal district area where the base year adjustment will apply in respect of each year of the adjustment period for each of the specified areas of the rating authority.&quot;  This relates to the harmonisation of the rating system across town and county councils.  Generally, across the country town councils' annual rateable valuations would be lower than the county rate and there is a provision in the Bill for these to be harmonised over a period by way of a base year adjustment.  The provisions would have this done in a three to ten-year period but we argue the members of the municipal districts should decide the period.  In my county of Tipperary, there is variance in commercial rates and the annual rateable valuation between some town councils and the county of between 2% and 11%.  My own area of Nenagh is 2% behind so we could achieve relatively short-term harmonisation but in south Tipperary, including Carrick-on-Suir, they are 11% behind the county rate and so might require a little more time to harmonise the rate.  This should not just be a blanket harmonisation period across a county and each district could decide what best suits.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The next proposed amendment would delete line 22 on page 37.  This relates to the proposed introduction and standardisation of 50% refundable rates on vacant commercial buildings on a national basis.  The amendment would leave section 14 of the Local Government Act 1946 as it stands.  If the 50% refund is to be introduced, it should happen on a phased basis of up to ten years, similar to the base year adjustment.  This provision in the Bill took everybody by surprise, as the Minister intends to standardise 50% refundable rates on vacant buildings across the country.  Currently, 100% of refundable rates are applicable on vacant buildings, barring the cities of Cork, Limerick and Dublin, but the Minister is intending to standardise the practice that only 50% of refundable rates would be refundable on vacant commercial buildings.  This is an anti-business measure and in the current economic climate it is hard enough for rate payers who may have a vacant building because a business has been closed.  They would be penalised by having to pay 50% of rates on a vacant building.  This could lead to many buildings being devalued for rateable purposes and a change of planning being brought about for a building in order to avoid the clause.  That could make it more difficult for new businesses taking over such properties.  If the provision remains - we are seeking its deletion - it should come about on a ten-year phased basis like the base year adjustment.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Councillor Tommy Moylan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383820500,"counter":578,"content":"<p>The next proposed amendment would on line 40 of page 51 insert \"or municipal district\".  We are seeking that each municipal district be allowed to choose its own titles such as \"cathaoirleach\" or \"mayor\", and that there should be no distinction between local authorities.  A town with a population of 20,000 should not have a status above another town with a population of 15,000 or 10,000.  Heretofore in local government there have been different tiers of authority, responsibility and recognition, going from town commissioners to the large cities.  This reform seeks to equalise, except in the case of cities or towns with charters.  That would be a unique distinction and in every other area we are supposed to be equal.  There is a form of discrimination in the Bill, as it gives status to some towns above others, which is unfair.  The title of \"mayor\" is a municipal title.  Whatever title a district decides to use, there should be equality that is unrelated to the size of a town.

I extend a welcome to the witnesses and thank them for their thought provoking presentation.  Having served with many of them - particularly the director, Mr. Tom Ryan - I know that he is very good at provoking discussion and he is even better at responding to provocation.  There is a strong Tipperary presence and I am particularly interested in the proceedings from that point of view.  We are getting the full whack of the effect of local government reform as Tipperary is being amalgamated and six districts are being eliminated.  I welcome the comments of the president, Councillor Willie Callaghan, that there are some positives in the Bill but it does not go far enough.  He believes in the spirit of the reform.  He said that many financial powers were being removed from local authorities.  Could he elaborate on that point?  I would have thought the Bill proposed to enhance local government by giving it a genuine base for funding which determines the level of services and, accordingly, the power of a local authority.<\/p><p>  On the first amendment proposed to section 29 on page 36, could Councillor Moylan elaborate a little more on the point?  We already have such a system.  Having served on a local authority that shared the lowest rate in the country, I remember there was always a battle between one of the local authorities in Donegal and Templemore in that regard.  We had it for many years in Tipperary.  It always created a problem locally in that there was antagonism among towns in Tipperary about rates.  Is there not a danger of creating difficulty by saying that the rate should not go below the county rate?  Could Councillor Moylan expand on the proposal to increase the municipal rate to 10%?<\/p><p>  I do not wish to dwell too much on the point made by Councillor McCarthy on section 36 and different tiers of government, starting with town commissions.  In Tipperary, one of the largest towns, namely, Roscrea, had no municipal authority of any description - neither a town commission, a town council or anything else.  That was the fault of the previous local government regime in that some towns had a town council or town commission and many others did not have.  Some counties did not have any tiers of local government at all.  Could Ms McCarthy elaborate a little on the matter?<\/p><p>  Deputy Stanley quoted extensively at the previous meeting from the submission by the Association of Municipal Authorities in Ireland, AMAI.  It is a good sign that he is reading and learning from it.  He referred to Northern Ireland.  In some instances he referred to the good things about Northern Ireland, but he condemned what the Bill contains about Northern Ireland.  Some people speak out of both sides of their mouth.  He did not refer to the fact that a significant local property tax has been imposed in the North of Ireland but Sinn F&eacute;in is absolutely opposed to it in this country.  What are the views of witnesses on the local property tax?  Does it not allow local authorities to finance local government?

Most people in this room will know that the AMAI is my nominating body for the Seanad.  I am delighted to say that I was successful in winning a seat on behalf of the association and have worked very closely with it since becoming a Senator.<\/p><p>  We have reached the point where the legislation has been published and my personal views on it are on the record of the Seanad.  I believe that town councils should be retained but the Minister and the Cabinet have made their decision on that.  We now have a Bill in front of us and that is what we are debating.  We must move forward with that Bill.  The AMAI has come here today with a very positive presentation on how it sees the reform of local government playing out.  <\/p><p>  How does Mr. Callaghan see this legislation affecting local communities?  At the outset of this process, the Minister sought lists of powers that could be devolved from each individual Department but to the best of my knowledge, only one Department responded to his request regarding the devolution of powers to local government.  What powers do the delegates think we can still seek to have devolved to local government?  The issue of local government autonomy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>rates and the local property tax at municipal district council level was raised.  I ask the delegates to expand further on that issue.  <\/p><p>  I will not go through the individual amendments now because we are pressed for time but wish to only deal with them in a broad sense.  In amendment No. 2 it is requested that municipal district councils be permitted to vary the commercial rates but we already have a system in the country called the business improvement district scheme, which does something similar.  The Government should be open to considering this amendment because we already have practice and precedent in this regard.  The request from the association for powers to vary rates is a reasonable one and the AMAI has asked that we amend section 29 of the Bill to do this.  The proposals on rates rebates will have an enormous impact in rural Ireland.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that if that is introduced, the State will never see a lot of that money.  Effectively, the State is telling people who have vacant buildings that they will have to pay full rates on those buildings and will not get anything back.  Generally speaking, in small towns in rural Ireland, people who have closed up their businesses have no money so they will not be able to pay the rates anyway.  A more practical approach to this issue would be very welcome.  <\/p><p>  The issue of calling municipal districts 'councils' was referred to earlier and it stands to reason that this should be the case.  There should be no full stop after municipal districts and the word council should be added at the end.  I strongly support that suggestion.  The case for mayors has been well made by Councillor Mc Carthy.  Many people refer to the situation in Europe and the fact that we must be seen to row in with our European neighbours.  Municipalities and mayoralties go hand in hand and I support the delegates in that regard.  <\/p><p>  My final point concerns the recognition of elected members on the Local Enterprise Offices, LEOs and the Corporate Policy Groups, CPGs.  We must have autonomy and I support Deputy Stanley's arguments in that regard.  Autonomy does not mean that powers are devolved to the officials of councils but to the elected representatives. That is what we want to see.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700010#J00200","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1383821700,"counter":587,"content":"<p>We have less than ten minutes and three more Members wish to contribute so I ask the delegates to be as brief as possible with their answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700010#J00300","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383821700,"counter":588,"content":"<p>Deputy Coonan referred to the local property tax as a way of getting extra funding for local government but that is a myth.

If a specific project was in place, the municipal authority members should be allowed to come to an agreement on a small variation of the rate which could return to the county rate if it was not used properly.  This was provided for in Putting People First, but it was not included in the legislation.  For example, Nenagh town businesses were given an option of having a 3% reduction in rates or a parking incentive in the town centre, with free parking at weekends.  The parking incentive was chosen with the agreement of local traders as we pointed out they would get more value out of it than a reduction in their rates.  The other two town councils in north Tipperary saw a reduction in rates.  Our incentive provided a boost for local traders in Nenagh at the weekend.  That is local democracy and power working at local level.  Next year we will not have that option.  All municipal areas, whether it be Nenagh, Templemore or Thurles, will not have that choice next year as the matter will be decided at county level.<\/p><p>  The Bill provides for local property taxes to be brought back to county level.  This will have an awful effect on the local government fund which will be reduced drastically.  The kernel of the issue is that this tax is to be collected centrally at county level and redistributed back to district level by way of a general municipal allocation.  As Mr. Callaghan stated in his opening statement, without the guidelines and regulations being published, we do not know how this will be redistributed back to municipal authorities.  This will affect our credibility as public representatives.  If someone in Nenagh asks me what he or she gets for his or her &euro;500 in local property tax, he or she will not want to hear me tell her or her that the money paid for a footpath in Clonmel, with all due respect to my colleagues in south Tipperary.  He or she will want to hear how much was spent in his or her local district.  The priority must be the direct correlation between municipal allocations and what was raised by the local property tax.

Associated with this restructuring there is a substantive local government workforce planning piece being developed.<\/p><p>  The County and City Managers Association, CCMA, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, established a project management office headed up by Mr. David O&rsquo;Connor.

The sector achieved efficiency savings of &euro;259 million between 2008 and 2012, as compared to the original local government efficiency review target of &euro;220 million.  Savings of &euro;109 million were made in procurement, with a national procurement office, headed by Kerry County Council, established.

It is a new word for another description which I will not repeat here.<\/p><p>  Regarding the transition in the county and city managers' historical role in water services to the new role that is expected and the configuration of Irish Water, I am worried that there could be a loss to the economy by virtue of the potential for sale.  The witnesses mentioned they are part of a body that is involved in the transition process.  I am sure that deals with employment issues as well as everything else.  I have asked the Minister and Irish Water to place on the table an audit of the existing network throughout the country to put a roadmap in place as to the reinstatement and rectification works required to make that fit for purpose.  Then one could be confident of the public paying for that service.  That has not been forthcoming yet.  Are the witnesses involved in that process?  Can we expect at the end of such a process that this information will be in the public domain well in advance of any billing to the public for a service that, as we have seen in recent weeks and months, is not necessarily fit for purpose as it stands?<\/p><p>  There will be political accusations about what was done in the past.  Over the last number of years there has been huge investment in the infrastructure and networks.  That was evident in my county and many others and I can go through it if people want to challenge me.  However, that has come to a standstill with the emphasis on the creation of Irish Water and its corporate identity, with no apparent emphasis on the service that the public expects and would appreciate considering it is being asked to pay for that facility.  Can the witnesses throw any light on an issue about which I have failed to get any response, an overhaul and programme of works in the offing?  If the witnesses did nothing else this morning but enlighten me about that I would be more than happy with their performance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700012#L00200","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1383822900,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I welcome the CCMA delegation.  I have questions and concerns about Irish Water.  For now, the local authorities will have the service level agreements, SLAs.  Have they a concern?  As a former town and county councillor, I have a concern about this service.  While the talk is about providing an integrated network, that would require cross-county connections in places such as Dublin.  Some would argue they will not be required, but they will.  In the rest of the State that is a debatable point.  Are the witnesses concerned that the SLAs may move away from them?  Once the meters are installed outside every house they will be under a company called Bord G&aacute;is.  Much of that is in the current Government's NewERA document.  That poses a significant concern for people.  The councillors and county and city managers will be like subcontractors.<\/p><p>  We are led to believe, in the Bill and elsewhere, that the property tax will go to councils.  In a previous discussion here this morning it was mentioned that there is no new money.  If councils raise money through property tax they will receive that much less from central Government in local government funding.  Have the managers concerns about the fact that we have started badly this year and next year because the councils will not receive it?  Some &euro;240 million has been put into a different bag straight away.<\/p><p>  I have a question on the reserve and executive functions.  I do not raise this in a combative way.  I know there is always a healthy tension in councils.  In the council on which I served we had a good relationship with the county manager, Mr. Peter Carey.  He was inclined to give councillors as much rope as he could and we gave him a good bit of rope also, not to hang each other but to give as much slack as possible to perform our powers, functions and duties.

It has been a difficult period for local authorities and the huge effort that has gone in around the country has not gone unnoticed.  I hope the CCMA delegates will pass that on to their members.<\/p><p>  I have a slightly different view on Irish Water than my colleagues.  Previously, local authorities depended on funding from central Government for various water projects but there are new investment opportunities now for the Irish water system.  The county managers will still have a very important role in delivering water services and maintenance through their SLAs.  Could they explain further how that works and how they see it working in the future?  Councils are working with their hands tied behind their backs regarding budgets for managing water services and assets.

There are concerns within local authorities in regard to staffing, in particular, who will be employed by Irish Water and who by the local authorities.  The witnesses might comment.  I know of people in both of the counties I represent who have worked in the water divisions of local authorities for many years.  They are concerned as to where their future lies after 2015, and whether it will be with Irish Water or the local authorities or whether there will be a job for them at all.  That is the first point.<\/p><p>  Second, Mr. McLoughlin mentioned the new CEO positions.  Personally, I welcome this change because it will be more businesslike having CEOs as opposed to county managers.  It will be more or less a board of directors and a CEO.  What is the current position?  Is it a seven year contract for the first phase as county manager and then a rolling contract for the second phase?<\/p><p>  Another major issue for the public representatives and officials in all counties is that of rates.  I see this in counties Sligo and Leitrim, where there are huge concerns and there is conflict between the county councils and the Valuation Office in regard to rates.  It is a major issue that will have to be resolved in some way.  In their capacity as county managers, is there anything that can be done to try to resolve this under the new Bill?

To play devil's advocate, which is a role I never like filling, there is a perception that this reform at local government level is mainly at the expense of the elected representative - in other words, the councillor - and of the front-line services - in other words, the people who are delivering services for the county councils such as road workers and front-line staff - while management has escaped.  It is a bit of an Irish solution to an Irish problem and, in my own case, a Tipperary solution to a Tipperary problem.  This is because, despite the amalgamation of the two county councils in north and south Tipperary, there will be no real difference because half of the services will be delivered from Clonmel and half from Nenagh, and the management stays the same, although the councillors and the outdoor staff will be reduced in numbers.

I am aware of the argument in regard to democratic representation.  The group that was before the committee prior to us was in a better position to answer that.  In regard to management escaping, I would point out that, as part of the local government efficiency review report, a commitment was made to reduce senior positions and a workforce planning report was prepared by the CCMA for the sector some 18 months ago.  Directors of services, who are the second tier, have been reduced from 240 to 190 as part of that process, which is a very significant reduction.  There has also been a reduction of 15% in grades immediately below that, such as senior engineers and senior executive officers.  County managers are being reduced in regard to the amalgamations and, at a later point, Mr. Conn Murray might like to comment on amalgamations generally.<\/p><p>  I will move on to the question of the appointment of managers and the related provision in the new Bill.  The CCMA's concern is as follows.  As it stands, the process is that the Public Appointments Service recruits for senior positions throughout the public service across the Garda, the health service, local authorities, county managers and so on, and has been doing so for decades.  The integrity of that process is understood and accepted by everyone.  However, the provision in the Bill allows a council through its inaction - it does not have to do anything - to undermine that process, effectively, in that if it does not make a determination within three months, the person does not get appointed.  The Bill makes no provision as to why that might be.  We feel this puts the local elected members in a very vulnerable position, although that is simply our view on the matter.<\/p><p>  I will let Mr. Connor talk about Irish Water and will then go back to Mr. Maguire in regard to property tax and related issues and to Mr. Murray in regard to members and additional functions, if that is okay with the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700013#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daniel McLoughlin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383823500,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I will address the Irish Water issue.  The first thing the county and city managers did at the very beginning, when the Irish Water initiative was published, was to establish an office to represent us all collectively.  The creation of this new national utility is a huge undertaking of itself, so the collation of information, and the representation of all of the councils together in one place, was a vital piece.  I am currently looking after all of that work and the constant negotiations.<\/p><p>  Both Deputy Cowen and Deputy Stanley mentioned the service-level agreement.  Basically, what will happen is that for a 12-year period the service-level agreement will be put in place whereby the local authorities will provide a huge proportion of the services they currently provide.  In regard to Deputy McLoughlin's point, there is no danger of people within the existing system being moved out of it for the 12-year period because that was negotiated at high level with Government.  That remains a fundamental part of the draft service-level agreement that is on its way through.  There are many other associated issues concerning, for example, the funding of how we will run our water services during the period when we are, effectively, the agents of Irish Water.  That is currently undergoing detailed negotiation and is extremely complicated, to say the least.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Cowen's questions, I would love to be in a position to help him.  At present, there are at least four meetings going on around the country on a daily basis, every day, gathering the kind of information the Deputy is seeking in order to make a determination as to what are the overall priorities.  The Deputy is correct there has been some very significant investment in water infrastructure but the demands for it are extraordinarily high.  The Deputy has heard the kind of figures that are being talked about for Dublin and the cost of perhaps bringing water from the Shannon and all of those kinds of large projects.  Those are inescapable facts and many of them are associated with environmental performance and oversight from Europe as to the way we perform in this regard.<\/p> <p> Another element we must bear in mind is that Irish Water, even for its own purpose, may not have the ultimate say on priorities.  That is due to the structure of the current system, which dictates that the energy regulator will become the regulator for water and will determine the price of water.<\/p><p> As members will know, the purpose of Irish Water is to establish an entity that has the capacity to raise money to feed a much-needed investment in water services.  All of our water bills will be determined by the energy regulator.  One imagines that the regulator will examine value for money and will determine the level of investment and prioritisation of investment around the country.  Not even Irish Water can do that for its own purpose, although it might produce its priorities.<\/p><p> I imagine that environmental compliance is a high priority because we are in danger of being fined if we do not comply.  Apart from that, discretion will move to the regulator.  We are anxious that the regulator will have an awareness of local issues, regional issues and economic development.  We have worked to ensure that happens.  Those are the important issues that keep the show on the road.  Local authorities have kept the show on the road for a long time by always being able to respond where individual initiatives arise - for example, bringing an industry to an area or developing an area in order to ensure an appropriate level of services.  That connectivity of decisions needs to be sustained into the future, but that is a highly complex area.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to enlighten the committee much further.  All I can say is that as it becomes apparent, we will all get to know the priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700013#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383824100,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor.

It will be the main vehicle of governance and public service at local level [...] Separate structures of public service will not therefore be established...<\/blockquote>That is an important statement to begin with because now we can commence talking about what functions are relevant at local level and, therefore, what functions should fall under the remit of the council.  As we will take a far stronger role in both economic and, primarily, community development, these functions, in my view, should be clearly within the remit of elected members.  Let me give the small clear example of the transfer of rural transport to the local authority system and how that affects operations in terms of routes and so on.<\/p><p>  Another aspect is the linking of local government reform with the education system.  At present, we perform a function for the Department of Education and Skills by identifying sites for schools.  Proper local planning and thinking ahead should be a council function and not a matter for the Department.  <\/p><p>  Members are probably well aware of another aspect.  The national positive aging strategy recommended that councils for older people be established in each authority.  At present 16 forums for older people have been established under the Age Friendly Town and Age Friendly County programmes, which directly link the community to elected members.  In my view that is a strong area because it embraces education from youth to older people.  We are starting to talk about welfare in that context and it should be considered at local level.<\/p><p>  I was asked to comment on two more issues, the first of which was the refund of rates.  My authority is one of the authorities that have split.  Limerick City Council had one view and Limerick County Council had another view.  There will be a very significant loss of revenue if the 50% refund is implemented.  It is incumbent on the individuals on the ground to ensure that businesses are occupied.  I am not saying that such an objective is easy, but it is part and parcel of the property tax.  The initiative has worked well in the cities in which I have worked.  <\/p><p>  I would consider the idea of devolution, but members should make the decision on how to implement this.  Once they have seen the impact on individuals and how it affects a council's finances and capacity to provide resources then perhaps a more realistic decision can be reached.  <\/p><p>  Earlier mergers were mentioned.  Limerick is one place in which the authorities are in the process of merging.  We have brought the two Limerick authorities together and also brought the regeneration agency under our remit.  There has been a 25% reduction in the number of senior regeneration staff, and there will be a 50% reduction at senior level in terms of directorates within the next couple of years as a direct consequence of the merger.  We are still working through the merger, so there has not been a similar effect on the operational side.  To be honest, our focus is on providing better services, discovering the cost involved and finding the necessary resources, not whether there are more or fewer people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700014#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conn Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1383824100,"counter":614,"content":"<p>Thank you.

There have been many reports in recent decades on the funding of local government, how it has evolved and the issues it poses.  Currently we are funded through the local government fund.  It is the intention that the property tax will replace that fund.  In fact, there are no additional moneys.  The property tax is a replacement of the current fund, which is composed of motor tax receipts and a sum of money from the Exchequer.  The amount from the Exchequer was replaced in previous years by funding taken from the household charge.  The intention is to replace the Exchequer funding with the local property tax.  It is the intention in the reform document to have an element of that decided upon at local level.  That will be introduced in the future.  We welcome it, as it will provide more accountability and there will be more connection in the public mind between local funding and the services that are provided locally.  That is something that was missed in recent decades.  When funding comes from a central source there is a detachment among the local community.  It is helpful for people to be able to say that the money is collected locally, we are paying it locally and it is providing our services locally.  At the moment it is true that there will be no additional funding.  When we arrive at a stage at which the amount collected locally from the property tax will be kept locally, there will always have to be a level of equalisation within that model, particularly for the rural counties.

This is a new situation for councillors.  We will now have fewer councillors, with the number reducing from over 1,600 to 949.

In normal employment, if somebody voluntarily leaves employment where there is a gratuity or redundancy package, there is no age limit for receiving that.

They must do it all themselves.  The other two bodies had such support.  Those who provided such support did not contribute, but they were present.  The two bodies each have an office and backup support, whereas the Local Authority Members Association does not have any of this.  Stating councillors should bear the brunt of all the cuts is demeaning.  To function well, councillors need backup services, including social services.  One cannot expect one voluntary body to do this on its own.

If one does not receive training in good planning, one will not be a good councillor and who better to provide such training?<\/p><p>  A positive aspect on which LAMA lobbied is the second legal opinion.

That is not to state that men are not great, because they are, but in order that we might strike a balance, perhaps LAMA and other representative bodies might examine - in a serious way - what might be done in respect of this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700018#R00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1383826500,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I also welcome the delegation from LAMA.

Have our guests given any consideration to where their organisation and its members fit not only into the reform of local government but also into the overall reform of the democratic system?  A very interesting debate took place during the campaign for the referendum on the proposed abolition of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, and one of the issues that arose regularly was how the Upper House could be considered in isolation from the overall reform of the democratic system.

If one were to ask a person which representative was most available to him or her and followed up on the relevant issues, I am of the view that councillors would come out ahead of Oireachtas Members.  This is simply because they operate at the coalface and are obliged to deal with such issues on a daily basis.  We should continue to engage with the Government on the question of overall reform, which involves the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and local government.<\/p><p>  The only public debate that has taken place in respect of reform was that which occurred during the Seanad referendum campaign.  One of the arguments put forward in support of the abolition of the Seanad involved a reference to countries that have only one house of parliament.  It eventually emerged that such countries have numerous local authorities which have very extensive powers, even in respect of finance.  From where will the model come in respect of the new reform we are discussing?  I am of the view that LAMA and other representative bodies should engage with the Government on where they fit into the overall picture.<\/p><p>  On conditions and remuneration, it is unfortunate that on some occasions certain sections of the media dictate the tone of debate.  If it suits those who operate in those sections of the media to refer to local authorities and their members in a somewhat jocose manner, then this becomes the centre of the debate, which is totally wrong.  I suggest that the Government should engage a professional person to assess what precisely local councillors are engaged in doing.  If one considers the hours they work, the number of meetings they attend, the expertise they bring to the table, etc., then one will reach the conclusion that they should be remunerated at a much higher level.  An answer in respect of this matter will not be forthcoming via letters to or headlines in the newspapers; it will only be obtained if a professional examination is carried out.  Local councillors deserve to be the subject of such an examination.<\/p><p>  The first matter about which I am concerned, therefore, is whether our guests have considered where they fit in the context of the reform of the overall system and not just of local government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700018#R00500","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383827100,"counter":669,"content":"<p>We dealt with some of these issues before the Deputy came into the meeting.

This needs to be considered in the context of local authority boundaries and the areas we will have to cover.  Tipperary is no different from any other county or city.  Demands will be greater and supports will have to be put in place for councillors to make their lives a bit easier, particularly in respect of young people coming into the system.

The problem, resulting in the gap, was that they did not specifically have sustainable development as their remit, nor did they have environmental pillar representatives.

I do not doubt reform is needed.<\/p><p>  The Dublin and mid-east regional authorities had a positive influence on setting regional planning guidelines and I would favour an expansion of this role.  How members are nominated will be seriously problematic as the process will not provide the diversity required.  We need all voices on it.  I saw how the regional authority changed the culture with regard to development plans in the local authority on which I served as we had the national spatial strategy, regional guidelines and local guidelines.  It made people consider matters more strategically.  I am concerned the nominating process will reduced diversity rather than increasing it.  I am interested to hear what the witnesses have to say on this.  We can see the relationship between land use and transportation strategies but there is quite a fragmented approach to some of the issues with regard to municipal district councils as opposed to county councils.<\/p><p>  Another issue is how people participate.  Having been a member of a county council and a town council, for approximately 20 years in both cases, I felt there were far more opportunities to involve people at town level than at county level.  There seems to be a mismatch, to which the witnesses referred, with regard to local community development committees, LCDCs, as there is only one per county unless the Minister allows more, but local development happens at a lower level than this.  I do not see where flexibility in this engagement will happen, and I state this from a citizen's perspective rather than a public representative's perspective.

Where it will be resolved or not is at local community level because this is where the problem is.  We are with the local community on this; if it does not work socially and economically for the local community it will not work for the environment, even if the other two structures support it.  We are very anxious to have groups in the LCDCs which are effective and whose voice is heard so there is a better flow of information from the ground up.

Waterford County Council is doing considerable work in this area.  Roscommon County Council has done much work in recent years of its own volition, rather than at my behest.  It has been particularly active on the issue of energy, for example, on heating.  While thinking at local government level is evolving and developing, it has a long way to go.  To be honest, if I were to give an average mark for local authorities' record on environmental issues, it would be three out of ten.  Much learning remains to be done, although the picture is not even.   Dublin City Council, for example, has done much work on sustainability and has its own thinking process in the Natural Step programme which covers the carbon footprint and so on.  The picture is varied between and within local authorities.  The problem is probably that, other than in certain circumstances, corporate learning is not taking place and local authorities are not picking up and running with it.  Individual leaders in particular local authorities are doing very good work, but the overall picture is not as good as it could be.<\/p><p>  With regard to Food Harvest 2020 and feeding the world, there is a clear understanding the planet faces serious problems in the areas of food distribution and the ability of people to grow their own food.  One of the major issues with Food Harvest 2020 is that it was not considered with great care before being brought into being.  It was not subject to a proper environmental analysis and the strategy did not consider its possible effects on climate change and so on.  The document is a mixed bag as it holds out great potential in some areas and has the potential to do harm in others.  This has not been properly examined, although an analysis is being carried out.  We are engaging with this analysis to ascertain if Food Harvest 2020 will impact on the environment and if we can make changes in areas where it will impact on the environment.  We hope the Minister will roll back some of the damaging parts of the strategy. <\/p><p>  On ash dieback, this is a policy issue about which Mr. Lohan is probably better informed than I am.  The issue is that we were importing diseased stock, which should never have happened.  For a long time, the environmental pillar has pointed out that the nursery sector offers great employment potential.  We continue to import large quantities of nursery stock from the Netherlands and other countries for use in infrastructural projects such as roads.  The tendering process for such contracts is arranged in such a way that it is impossible for native nursery owners to engage with it.  They would have to invest large sums on spec and in advance because obviously one must grow trees long in advance, yet they may not secure the contract.  Nurseries elsewhere in Europe are able to do this because they are much larger.  The issue of ash dieback raises many questions, including in respect of the importation of nursery stock in the horticulture and forestry sectors. <\/p><p>  Given that farms occupy some 60% of the land surface of the country, farmers must be custodians of the environment.  As Deputy Noel Coonan noted, some farmers are cowboys, while others are good.  Some of the moves made in recent years are positive.  We would like farmers to be encouraged and enabled to engage with local development organisations in the area of anaerobic digestion.  The potential of anaerobic digestion in energy production is significant, yet the Government's handling of the issue has been very poor.  As a result, very little has been done in this area.  I will hand over to Ms &Oacute; Siochr&uacute; as she has a particular interest in anaerobic digestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700023#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Ewing"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383829500,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I am dying to inform the committee that I am a beef farmer in north Tipperary.

Ireland is one of the best places to produce beef and dairy products in the world.  With the right kind of grassland practices and using carbon sequestration in the soil, beef farming can be carbon negative, particularly when new practices are used.<\/p><p>  Under Food Harvest 2020, it is proposed to increase dairy production by 50% and beef production by 20%.  These objectives can be achieved, provided the right technologies are used.  We have to produce food because the number of people on the planet will increase.  Ireland is a good food producer and food production generates many jobs and protects the environment.  Moreover, the country produces food in an environmentally sensitive manner.

It is very hard to measure performance when the definition is quite loose, but we know that within certain sectors such as the 500 designated Natura 2000 sites which cut across the farming community throughout the country, that for each &euro;1 billion invested, one could create 29,000 jobs on Natura 2000 sites.  In contrast, an investment of &euro;1 billion under the Common Agricultural Policy could creates between 3,000 and 6,000 jobs.  There are opportunities to create employment locally that is sustainable in the long term.  The word \"green\" has a different connotation in a national context than it does across the rest of Europe.  The Deputy referred to us as the \"green pillar\" which may have political implications, but we are not affiliated to a political party.  The concepts are sustainability and long-term viability testing.  Food Harvest 2020 was rolled out as policy in 2010 without any testing of its impact in the long term.  I do not think one can put responsibility on the farming community for taking advantage of policies, programmes and subsidies if the consequence of their activities is environmental degradation and the loss of healthy soil and biodiversity on farmlands.  I do not think they can take 100% responsibility if the impact of Government policy has not been tested.  It seems ludicrous to pursue a policy that has not been tested to see whether it is sustainable over a long period of time.  Following a complaint to the Commission, this analysis of Food Harvest 2020 has now been done and, as my colleague, Mr.  Ewing, alluded to, we are responding to it through the public consultation process and engaging actively with the Department on it.  I do not want to be too distracted by Food Harvest 2020 which will effectively be out of date in another two years once the milk quotas change.  Much has changed since 2010 when that policy was first rolled out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700024#X00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cillian Lohan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383830100,"counter":696,"content":"<p>First, I will put on my Oxfam hat when commenting on the issue of food security.  It is important to emphasise that Irish agricultural production and exports are not connected to the issue of food security or insecurity in developing countries.  They are supplying a different market.  In the countries in which there is a serious food insecurity problem, in India and Africa, the people who suffer from food insecurity are not in the market for Irish beef, butter or dairy products.  The food exports are feeding a middle class demand, but they are not connected to the food insecurity of local people whose diet comprises grains, pulses and vegetables, local agricultural conditions and local markets.  The connection with developed countries lies in their demand for grains, in particular, which is driven by the demand for biofuels and animal fodder.  These demands from developed countries have an impact on food security in developing countries.<\/p><p>  Wearing my \"green pillar\" hat, we argue that agricultural policy in Ireland needs to be re-examined in the context of its impact on climate change and also in the context of the impact climate change is having and will have on agricultural production.  A researcher from Maynooth has recently put together the evidence which is that the changes in terms of a wetter West and a drier East will have implications for the economic advantages in terms of what should be grown and the associated risks.  We would like to see that research integrated into the Food Harvest 2020 analysis.<\/p><p>  I wish to make a point on water, as I understand some of the Deputies are concerned about Irish Water.  Our great concern is that Irish Water is being set up and not taking the water framework directive into account.  We have legal obligations at European level to introduce quite significant governance changes in order to meet the obligations under the water framework directive to ensure good water quality by 2015 and later in some places.  A great deal of work must be done in order to achieve this.  The structures were set up in order to produce the plans, but they have not been maintained.  There is no sign of their being incorporated into the new Irish Water structures.  We have obligations, but we will end up in trouble with the Commission and the European Court of Justice if we do not meet these obligations.  We are charging ahead with major reforms and not taking these environmental responsibilities into account.<\/p><p>  The diversity in performance of local authorities and local community development structures in an environmental sense is positive as it means that there are positive as well as negative examples from which we can learn.  Similarly, Deputy Catherine Murphy's point on the nominating process and diversity of input is key.  What we need is diversity to have voices come into the discussion, as that would help us to move forward more effectively.  As drafted, the nominating process seems to be almost entirely in the gift of one person per county, which we do not consider appropriate.  The nominating process must be participative, transparent and inclusive.  We hope committee members will find some way to bring forward amendments in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700024#X00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1383830100,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700024#X00600","speaker":"996"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBEC","time":1383830700,"counter":699,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700025#Z00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1383830700,"counter":700,"content":"<p>Leanfaimid ar aghaidh leis an bpl&eacute; a bh&iacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn ar athch&oacute;iri&uacute; an rialtais &aacute;iti&uacute;il.

IBEC's focus is on the recently introduced Local Government Bill and the wider issue of local government reform.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Bill, it is important to emphasise that it is not all about rates.  From IBEC's point of view, as an organisation and on behalf of its member companies, business is all about costs, competitiveness and the potential to expand employment and generate profits.  Commercial rates are a very significant cost for many companies; hence we focus on them.  There is a headline figure of &euro;1.6 billion paid by the business sector to local government, which figure comprises commercial rates and water charges.<\/p><p>  IBEC welcomes the Bill's provisions which are well intended.  We believe the reforms included are quite significant and will have an impact, particularly the audit functions.  The Bill will create a more regionally based audit function and allow stakeholders to participate in the process, including businesses.  We are, however, a little concerned about another proposal.  I know representatives of the municipalities attended this morning, but we welcome the proposal to eliminate town councils, thus generating significant savings.  On the other side, the town council network will be replaced by a network of municipal districts.  We understand there will be three or four municipal districts per constituency.  That means that the number of municipal districts will exceed the current number of town councils.  Our difficulty is with the unknown quantity of the measure.  We simply do not know what is the level of costs.  We know that there is a saving associated with the elimination of town councils, but we do not know the level of costs or additional charges associated with municipal districts.  Therefore, we seek more information on what the Minister intends to achieve.  Of course, he will say the intention is to reduce costs, but the devil is in the detail.  As funders of the system, we have not seen the details and are quite anxious to do so.<\/p><p>  I will outline another point made in IBEC's submission.  The standardisation of commercial rates between town and county councils will, in many cases, lead to an upward adjustment.  My colleague, Ms Caulfield, will talk about this matter.  The increase will be significant; it will be between 15% and 20%.  Typically, a retailer in a place such as Dungarvan will find over a period and for no particular reason that his or her baseline rates bill has increased by between 15% and 20%.  That increase will be connected to jurisdiction, as opposed to a drawdown of services. <\/p><p>  The Government has talked about reducing the cost of local government, efficiencies and so forth, but there is another measure in the Bill that will increase business costs.  I refer to the proposal to standardise the refund of rates levied on vacant buildings.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of vacant commercial buildings around the country for all the wrong reasons.  Standardisation, therefore, is a significant issue.  As the Chairman will know, the current rebate on rates on vacant buildings is 100% for county councils which, in my view, is generous, and 50% for city councils, but that is for historic reasons.  Of course, the Minister has proposed to standardise a 50% rebate for companies which will result in a very significant increase in costs without a commensurate increase in the level of service provided by local government.<\/p><p>  As I do not want to take up too much time, I will summarise.  IBEC welcomes many of the provisions included in the Bill.  It is a reforming Bill that will have an impact.  We welcome, in particular, the elimination of town councils and the new provisions in respect of a local government audit, transparency and accountability.  We are, however, concerned about who will foot the bill for many of the proposed changes to the structure of local government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700025#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Reg McCabe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383830700,"counter":704,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to speak.  I attend in two capacities.  I am president of the south-east region of IBEC; therefore, I represent four or five counties.  I am also a business person and retailer.  We have eight separate sites in the south-east regions which stretches as far as Bandon, County Cork and to Malahide, County Dublin.  As we see a very broad picture in terms of rates, I will speak about that issue first.  <\/p><p>  There is a certain level of frustration experienced by my business and also by others which are members of IBEC about the level of rates, the optics on how rates are spent and where the money goes.  All of us involved in business pay water charges and do not have a problem with doing so, but such charges will increase.  There are also waste management charges and so on.  It is difficult to see where rates are being spent, how they are being spent and what benefits they give to individual businesses.<\/p><p>  Mr. McCabe touched on a couple of matters.  I will commence with the standardisation of rates.  We operate in locations that are included in county and city areas.  When rates are standardised, additional costs will be generated for our business and others around us.  That is a source of very serious concern for us because businesses are already under pressure, particularly retail businesses, while consumer sentiment is low.  There was a flicker of recovery, but it is still very fragile and many retailers are under serious pressure.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the refund of rates being reduced from 100% to 50%, we have experienced the adjustment in owning some properties.  The reduction will have a serious impact on business.  <\/p><p>  The last matter about which I wish to talk is the revaluation process.  We have gone through it in Waterford where we have experienced an increase in rates.  Many businesses in Waterford city have experienced a negative impact.  Some experienced a significant increase of between 10% and 40%, but it depended on the type of business involved.  I am aware of one business that experienced a rates increase in excess of 40%.  In order for it to pay the increase, it would have had to increase its turnover by in excess of 5%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700025#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie Caulfield"},{"type":"speech","time":1383830700,"counter":705,"content":"<p>Is that business located in a city area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700025#Z00800","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383830700,"counter":706,"content":"<p>Yes.

I have highlighted the other areas we would like to be considered such as the standardisation of rates, the rates refund mechanism, how rates are spent and how they benefit businesses.

It is part of what we had sought to bring to the table prior to Committee Stage of the legislation to allow us as broad a range of amendments as possible through input from various sectors.  I wish to make a few comments on the content.  I am surprised that the witnesses welcomed the elimination of town councils.  I disagree with them on that point.  As I have said to others, I recognise that there was some duplication and there was room for streamlining, but not to the extent proposed by the document and, now, the legislation to support that document.  In respect of the fact that there will now be three municipal districts where there was previously one, I do not think there is much autonomy attached to the municipal district.  They have more of a consultative role with regard to the full council than anything else.  There is nothing within the legislation, so far as I can see, that would tell me otherwise.  There are at present, throughout the local authority system, local area committees made up of members from a certain district and they can make recommendations to local authorities themselves for onward decision.  There is nothing within the legislation to suggest that this will change greatly.  The ceremonial attachment to an area will continue with the mayor and so forth, but other than that I do not see any change.<\/p><p>  The question in respect of rates is very pertinent to the situation on the ground.  I am totally supportive of and committed to a system that would overhaul the present system as we know it.  We think there has to be more alignment in commercial rents.  Consideration will have to be given to turnover and ability to pay.  Some previous speakers this morning mentioned that the existing system is archaic.  We are in agreement with that, and something has to be done, if for no other reason than to address the imbalance in many towns throughout the country where town centres have lost their sheen compared to outside developments on the edges of towns.  There must be a means and a mechanism by which that is addressed.  For our part, we are putting a Bill before the House to address that issue in the coming weeks, for which we hope to attract cross-party support.  In the lead-up to Committee Stage of this Bill, we hope to have realistic amendments to effect change in that regard.<\/p><p>  The rebate on rates has been raised by all contributors today.  Obviously, it is a very real issue on the ground.  This is tied into the last comment I made in respect of rates.  There must be a recognition of the present commercial realities before any decision such as that is rammed through the House.  We will be cognisant of that.  I reiterate my appreciation of the delegates' contributions.  I may not agree with everything they said, but it was interesting to hear what they had to say at the same time.  We would hope to reflect some of their considerations when we set about amending the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700026#AA00300","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1383831300,"counter":710,"content":"<p>I shall follow up on one of the points I raised on Second Stage.

It might have been possible to sustain it in a city environment but I do not think one size fits all in that case.  I certainly agree with the witness on that issue.<\/p><p>  In respect of the elimination of town councils, I am surprised that a group such as IBEC did not seek a change in the county council system, as opposed to the town council system.  Please do not get me wrong; I would not argue for the retention of all town councils.  However, having served on both a town council and a county council, I could see the return from the town council was evident and useful.  In the event of complaints, it was far more likely that they would have been directed at the county council.  For example, if there were to be three large regional authorities, many changes could be made from the point of view of procurement opportunities and combining some of the services while still maintaining a district council model, which is the way I think we should proceed, but that is not what is proposed in the legislation.  In some cases, the town councils will be missed. <\/p><p>  Some of the high-profile town councils around the country, such as Westport Town Council, which has been in contact with us, made a substantial impact, as did Tralee Town Council.  They are very important given the impact they make by being focused on the local economy, and they deliver a return.  For example, the town council of which I was a member was a former town commissioners, and almost all of its funding came from Intel.  None of that funding will go back to the Exchequer, but will go straight back to Intel in the form of profit.  I question whether there will be the savings that have been mentioned.  As that was a town charge, it would have been over and above the rates, but it would have been a relatively small charge.  Even where the traders paid that town charge, most of the money would have been spent on town improvements, which would have had a direct return.  That is very different from the arguments made by the witnesses in respect of where our money is going.   One would have seen the return on it.  <\/p><p>  A point that has been a bone of contention is that some of the chambers of commerce and the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation argued for a property tax.  The difficulty now is that they will ask where the money is spent, while every householder will ask the same question.  They will do that at the same time as the general purpose grant is being radically reduced, and there is no additional money.  I do not think that will lead to a harmonious relationship or a better arrangement in terms of how the costs will be distributed.  I am surprised that the delegates are welcoming some of the things they welcome.  Essentially, the property tax will take money out of people's pockets.  It will not necessarily deliver a return in terms of additional services or lighten the load on the business sector.  It is another observation rather than anything else.  I would be interested to hear their response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700026#AA00600","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1383831300,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for appearing before the committee this afternoon.

However, this system will not cost more because in the Dublin area there were always area committees and there will be no need for special offices.  Some areas already have offices, for example, Lucan, but there is none in Rathfarnham.  There will be no extra area offices until such time as the council sees a need for such an office.  In areas where there are no town councils there have always been area committees, but these committees had no power.  Now there will be a statutory devolution of functions from the council to these areas which will be called districts.  IBEC is looking at the number of areas and stating there will be extra requirements because the area committees were not counted.  However, area committees were already in place.  The town I am from originally, Clifden, never had a town council, but it had a county area committee.  Therefore, this is not creating extra requirements but is streamlining what we have in place.  As Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy said, there will be fewer councillors overall.  Granted, because of the population of Dublin, there will be more in that county.<\/p><p>  The issue of rates seems to be a main focus for IBEC.  The streamlining of the enterprise boards in local enterprise offices, LEOs, will focus on having more input from local authority and community members to bring businesses to each county, rather than leaving it to Enterprise Ireland or enterprise boards where the focus is not on local areas.

We would like to see considerable rationalisation in the local government structure.<\/p><p>  There are significant variations in the head counts in local authorities, between the authorities in Dublin which cover a substantial population and those at the other end of the scale that are so small one wonders whether they are viable, particularly in counties such as Leitrim and Longford.  I have nothing against these places, but in the interests of reducing costs and increasing effectiveness, IBEC as a business organisation would support substantial reform and restructuring in the local government sector.  That would be a longer term aspiration.  I point, for example, to what is happening in Northern Ireland where the number of local authorities has been reduced to 12 or so.  The legislation providing for this reduction will be implemented from next year.  It will be interesting to see how it is implemented in places such as Belfast and its impact. <\/p><p>  I am reluctant to get into a political debate on town councils, but as the matter has arisen in a number of contributions, I will make a comment.  There are 80 town councils which cover 15% of the population.  It is said this level of local government is important, but I wonder how effective it is considering that it is focused on such a small percentage of the population.  This is a debate that can be continued.  I am not convinced the municipal districts will be highly effective, but at least the new structure will be implemented in all local authority areas.  It will be more universal, whereas the town council structure is patchy in terms of its impact.<\/p><p>  That is all I have to say, but perhaps Ms Caulfield might like to add to what I have said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700027#BB01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Reg McCabe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383831900,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I wish to respond to one or two questions regarding rates.  Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned vacant properties in rural areas, small towns and some town centres.  I am in business as a landlord also and it makes no sense to me that where a property is vacant, I pay rates on it.  If it is vacant, I am making no income from it.  Such a property is a charge on my business and, therefore, has a knock-on impact on business.  It does not seem reasonable to have to pay rates in that instance.<\/p><p>  Retail businesses are the biggest employer in the country, with approximately 250,000 employees in the sector.  If businesses wish to let properties to new businesses or people who want to set up a business, they will be asked two questions by prospective clients - about the rent and the rates payable.  We have control over one of these areas, the rent payable but not rates.  However, the rates payable are often the linchpin which determine whether somebody will proceed with setting up in a premises, particularly in smaller towns and locations where there are significant numbers of vacant properties.  For a small business, with one or two jobs, these issues all count.<\/p><p>  With regard to the provision providing for a reduction in rates by up to 15%, this would be welcome.  However, as Senator C&aacute;it Keane said, this is where a local authority can afford it.  The question must also be asked whether the business can afford the rates charged or not to receive a reduction.  We have all cut our cloth and gone through painful processes to reduce costs while paying all of the additional charges required to be paid.  Therefore, it is not unreasonable for us to expect to see a reduction in rates for businesses.  <\/p><p>  The idea that additional moneys can be collected to facilitate the provision of free parking and so on which all add to footfall and help to generate business is positive in theory, but few businesses can afford to pay additional charges.  The principle is a good one, but whether it is practical for many businesses is the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700027#BB01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Marie Caulfield"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383831900,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I wish to make a final point on the structure of the commercial rates system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700027#BB01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Reg McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383832500,"counter":730,"content":"<p>The witnesses mentioned what had been done in Northern Ireland.

I would contend that the vast majority of the services delivered by local authorities are consumed by householders and that is where the main focus should be.  The system has developed over the decades on the basis of the householders getting a free ride and the impact was that all of the costs were levied on businesses.

The motor taxation receipts started dropping in 2008.  They fell from &euro;999 million in 2007-08 to just over &euro;600 million in the general purposes grant.  As the household charge came in, the general purposes grant dropped.  As the property tax is coming in, it is dropping further.  It is a replacement tax.  It will not provide what Mr. McCabe is talking about.  In fact, it is likely to take more money out of the pockets of the customers who will be shopping in the shops of which he spoke and it will not produce a fund large enough to make any kind of a different.  There is less money to spend in the overall sense.  It will not make the difference that will produce an option to reduce rates that might reduce costs where the consumer gets a benefit on the other side of it.

It is a great pleasure to be here.  I do not propose to read through the submission we supplied yesterday.  I hope we can take it as read.  I will focus on a few key topics contained in the submission.<\/p><p>  Chambers Ireland fully supports the ongoing reform of local government.  We compliment those who work in the area on the efforts they have made to change and restructure local government in recent years.  There are others would could learn from what has been done in this regard.  However, much remains to be done, and all too often we end up relying on businesses - as taxpayers - to cover excessive costs.  We see ourselves as being particularly well placed to comment on local government issues as a result of the fact that we have a chamber of commerce in virtually every town throughout the country.  This means that we receive almost constant feedback with regard to what is happening on the ground.  Local chambers are typically heavily involved with their local authorities in the context of engaging in dialogue and, in most cases, trying to resolve issues.<\/p><p>  We are of the view that more needs to be done at local authority level to achieve greater efficiency and to support the business community.  At a structural level, mergers and the eradication of duplication of services must continue to be implemented and delivered.  The savings achieved in this regard must result in a reduction in costs for the business community.  We all know that in order to aid Ireland's recovery, all business costs must be reduced.  Business has gone a long way towards reducing its own costs, but local authority charges on businesses tend to take the form of a fixed cost, regardless of their profitability or otherwise.  They fall into the category of costs which need to continue to be restructured and reduced in order that Ireland can become more competitive and that we can create more jobs.  We must seek to do this, of course, without any reduction in the quality of front-line services, through mechanisms such as back office consolidation, the flattening of hierarchies, the application of shared services best practice and, where appropriate, business process outsourcing.<\/p><p>  It is clear that there are many issues which affect town centres.  The retail sector is obviously very significant to the job creation market and has been extremely hard hit.  The impact of rents and rates as business costs is significant, as is the effect of parking charges.  The abolition of town councils and the creation of municipalities is creating concerns across our network.  We need to be sure that costs will not be increased in a number of ways, not least as we integrate municipal districts into the wider county areas.  There is also concern about perverse incentives, under the funding formula built into the legislation, that could lead to an increase in car parking charges.  Our members would generally like to see the provision of some free car parking in town centres in order to encourage people to return to those centres.<\/p><p>  On business supports, the local enterprise offices, LEOs, are in the process of being established.  These are vital, and we continue to recommend that business representatives and chamber members should be involved in the governance of LEOs.  These offices should be exclusively focused on their core remit of supporting start-ups and SMEs with up to ten staff and ensure that there is no replication of services already provided by the private sector.  In addition, LEOs should be visible, accessible and functional.  Anecdotal evidence to the effect that some of these expectations are not being met is beginning to emerge.  LEOs are supposed to be very visible in county council offices but we are hearing stories to the effect that they are going to be hidden at the back of the second floor and will not be an accessible resource.  It is early days in the context of the establishment of the LEOs, but there is a need to get on with it and deliver.  The evidence to which I refer is anecdotal in nature because the LEOs are at such an early stage of their development.<\/p><p>  Chambers Ireland advocated the introduction of a local property tax for many years.  We see this tax as providing an opportunity to ensure the effective funding of local authorities in the wake of the steady reduction in the general purpose grant.  However, the tax must be spent at local level in order to reduce pressure on businesses.  In recent days a debate has been taking place in Cork City Council in respect of an increase in the rates for businesses.  We do not think this is the right time to introduce such an increase and it would not be helpful.  Such increases become a threat to competitiveness and jobs.<\/p><p>  Another issue about which our members are concerned is the treatment of vacant premises for rates purposes.  The Local Government Bill contains a provision to standardise the rates rebate to 50% on vacant premises.  This could be harmful to business which are trying to downsize, lease out some of their properties or just survive.  At present, there is much more flexibility in the system.  A possible solution would be the introduction of a stepped process whereby a rebate of 90% would be paid in the first period for which a property is vacant.  This rebate would then be paid on a decreasing basis over time in order to give owners the opportunity to re-let their premises or whatever.<\/p><p>  Procurement is a vital area and one of great concern to small businesses in particular.  Tendering for contracts from local authorities is really important for such businesses throughout the country.  The State and local authorities must be responsible buyers.  We fully accept the need to drive cost savings for the State from procurement, etc., but we must ensure that we also actively support local economies through procurement policies while remaining aware that the cheapest option will not necessarily be the appropriate, value-for-money option that will supply the best outcome.  It is extremely important that local authorities use procurement professionals who will provide feedback in respect of the tendering process both pre- and post-decision.  Local authorities must also adopt appropriate qualification criteria.  In other words, the qualification criteria relating to a tender must relevant to what is being purchased.  A three-year trading history and profits running into the multi-millions are not necessarily relevant when it comes to purchasing a few glasses to go on a table.<\/p><p>  The final issue which arises - it arose again in recent days for a number of our members - is that of revaluation.  I refer here to the underlying valuation of a premises and not the annual rate that is struck.  There are huge concerns in this regard.  In light of the problems with the Valuation Act 2001, the Valuation (Amendment) Bill 2012 was introduced.  However, the latter stalled very early in the legislative process and we have not really had an opportunity to influence the debate on it.  Many businesses are just as concerned about the underlying rateable valuation as they are about the annual rate that is struck.  We are also of the view that there is a necessity for some key amendments in respect of the definition relating to a material change of circumstances.  We are of the view that this definition should include economic viability because at present it tends to be based on, for example, the impact of a wall being built near one's premises.  The latter is a material change of circumstances but we would like some economic criteria taken into account in this regard.  Another matter in respect of which amendment will be required is that relating to tenants only being responsible for the payment of rates from the date of occupation.  In addition, a hardship clause might be introduced.<\/p><p>  The SME sector is extremely important to the regeneration of growth and jobs in the economy.  SMEs and local authorities form a vital combination when they work together.  It is very important for our members that local government will be set up in the correct way for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700029#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot"},{"type":"speech","time":1383833100,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Talbot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700029#DD00300","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1383833100,"counter":749,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Talbot and his organisation for their submission.

It can be very efficient to get a private sector organisation to do that work.  However, one has to get from where one is to where one needs to be before one starts to outsource.  If one tries to outsource a process that is not clearly defined, understood and working, it will go wrong.  The process we would like to see in place is one that has been clearly defined.  Some of these things are working.  For example, we learned last year that the Revenue Commissioners are using Abtran in Cork for much of their work around the collection of the local property tax.  Apart from one minor glitch it has worked extremely well.  That shows it can work.  It was a brand new process.  It was not redoing something that has already been done.  Something we look at frequently is aspects of passport issuing and whether the State needs to carry out all the components of passport issuance.  While that is not directly relevant to local authorities, I cite it as an example.  Equally, there are plenty of examples in local authorities, such as motor taxation, where there is a much better system in place than a few years ago.  Earlier in the week, Dublin City Council closed its motor tax office for a week as it could not cope with the volume of activity.  That is not a good indicator that the process is working well.  If a private sector organisation had to do that, great surprise would be expressed.<\/p><p>  The key is to identify processes and tasks that could potentially be outsourced without any risk to the State.  Sorting out those processes effectively, perhaps through a shared service culture, is crucial.  I am aware that in local authorities many processes are being delivered through shared services.  This leads on to the Deputy's second comment on the work that Kerry County Council is doing in the area of procurement.  Once a process has been clearly defined and is working reasonably well, greater efficiencies can be achieved by taking certain aspects of it and outsourcing it completely to a third-party independent provider who will organise delivery hours and everything else.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question about business process outsourcing and where we see it.  Wholesale outsourcing is not our view of life; it is very much a steady and balanced process towards a better model.  Jumping from where we are now to outsourcing will go wrong.  In the past we have seen outsourcing opportunities go horribly wrong, as in the PPARS fiasco, because the proper process had not been followed.  In retrospect it is clear.<\/p><p>  On the procurement side, there is a centralisation of local authority purchasing into Kerry County Council for the past year or 18 months.  A meeting has been scheduled with the organisation the Deputy asked about.  We meet regularly with the CCMA and many county councils and our local chambers.  Only a relatively small percentage of activity at State and local authority levels is going to central contracts, while a great deal is still being purchased locally.  Individuals are being appointed as procurement managers but they need to have the right training, education, background and so on to coach them on how to actually manage a tender process properly.  Our sense is that there are many good processes but the process is more important than the actual purpose, which is to buy something effectively.  Much work is being put into it, and as a result it becomes far too cumbersome.  I refer to the analogy I raised earlier - if one is going out to buy only a few staplers that are needed urgently, does one need a ten-page tender document?  It is about an appropriate set of criteria and an appropriate process for purchasing.  It is a worry.  I am sure the County and City Managers' Association is concerned about what percentage of purchasing activity will ultimately have to be done through the central system in Kerry County Council versus local discretion.  If 20% of purchasing was through the central office and 80% through the local office, that would be a tremendous support to, for example, SMEs in an area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700030#EE00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383834300,"counter":756,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Talbot for his presentation.  Many of the same issues were raised in the previous one.  <\/p><p>  In his submission Mr. Talbot referred to the motor tax office and spoke about what a private company would have done.  In defence of staff in the motor tax office, private companies can usually move staff around.  If someone has a base in Lucan, he can switch the staff to the city centre by making a telephone call.  This does not happen as much in the public sector, although it might be useful if it did.  Private companies might receive more notice of an issue also.  Staff in the office in Dublin city were not expecting the queue that materialised because the vehicles in question had been off the road.  How were they to know it would be an issue?  I would not always defend those in public offices but circumstances change.  I agree, however, that flexibility is an issue that must be considered if we are to make progress.  When I was involved with the local authority, I used to say that when a diktat came down from on high to the local office, the wherewithal should have come down with it.<\/p><p>  I have noted what Mr. Talbot said about vacant premises, standardisation and having a step-down approach rather than a blanket 50% charge.  It sounds like some people could bear more than others.  He also mentioned tendering and that three companies could now put forward a combined tender.  That is a change.<\/p><p>  I am sure all businesses were affected recently by the water shortage and are concerned by the expense of treated water.  I often mention the fact that only 1% of treated water is used for human consumption.  There is an onus on businesses and everybody else to conserve water.  Water harvesting would save businesses a fortune, particularly following the introduction of water rates.  It would also provide a saving for local authorities and those who treat water because treating water is such an expensive business.  If there was more co-operation in harvesting water, this would reduce the consumption of treated water and costs for both businesses and local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700031#FF00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383834300,"counter":757,"content":"<p>I prefaced my comments on the motor tax office by saying the process was very good and had significantly improved on what it was ten years ago.  However, seeing it shut down is a concern.  The change that provoked the queues was something the local government efficiency review group of which I was a member and which reported in June 2010 recommended.  It has taken the best part of four years for it to move from being a recommendation to being given effect; therefore, there was plenty of time to consider whether there would be an issue.  Perhaps not everybody expected an extra 15,000 tractors to be registered.  We accept that these things happen.  The flexibility a private sector contract brings to the table means that we can demand more of that contract and in such cases it becomes an issue for the third party to deal with a particular situation.  I accept, however, the point made by the Senator.<\/p><p>  On the issue of water, Chambers Ireland has long been an advocate of the need for the user to pay for the services provided.  In Ireland we have a funny attitude; we fully expect to pay for gas which is a natural resource but which has to be mined, piped and delivered to homes in a safe and secure manner.  We are perfectly happy to pay a standing charge and user fees for it, but we do not seem to want to pay for water which falls as rain and must be harvested, treated and delivered to our houses in a secure manner.  That seems different to us because it rains all the time.  <\/p><p>  In this morning's <i>Irish Independent<\/i> a former Member of the Oireachtas, Ivan Yates, spoke about his experience in Wales where people pay for water consumption and water to be taken away from their houses.  The assumption is that water will be returned to the system to be dealt with.  We believe, from a business and individual perspective, that users should pay for services.  This would lead to these services being treated with more respect and it should improve consumption levels.  From the business perspective, there needs to be a balance established between the cost of treatment and the cost of harvesting and investment in infrastructure.  We support the establishment of Irish Water in order that we will have a central body to co-ordinate delivery of the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700031#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383834300,"counter":758,"content":"<p>On water harvesting, water still needs treatment.

We submitted a document and I am aware the committee is taking that as read.<\/p><p>  There are three areas on which I will focus in my brief few words.  First, the Dublin chamber, on behalf of its 1,300 member companies with 300,000 employees in the greater Dublin area, is supportive of the work that continues to be done in the area of local government efficiency.  I sat on the committee that looked specifically at local government efficiency in the Dublin area.  Our major concern in this area is the cost of services to business.  When we look at the funding that has been provided by businesses to local authorities over recent years, we see that, as a percentage of local authority funding, businesses are paying 46% of the total funds of local authorities in the Dublin area, whereas in 2008, they were paying 38% of them.  There has been a significant increase in the proportion of moneys going into local authority funding from businesses.  We would be concerned about that escalation, particularly given that it has happened over the five years of the worst recession in many decades in this country.<\/p><p>  We fully support local government efficiency.  We want to see local government become more effective and more efficient.  We want to see more consolidation of services and less duplication.  We are also interested in seeing local authorities really embrace outsourcing as a means of gaining that efficiency because not only does it help them to be more efficient but it also provides an opportunity for the private sector.<\/p><p>  The second area I wanted to mention is the local property tax.  This is something for which the Dublin chamber has campaigned for many years.  We are glad to see it introduced  We believe that it brings a balance to the taxation for local services, between the domestic householder and the businesses.  To date, businesses have been paying - and householders have not been paying - a direct local tax.  The property tax addresses that.<\/p><p>  However, we have always campaigned for a local property tax to be put in place on the basis that taxes collected locally are spent locally and we have a major concern, particularly following a parliamentary question asked by Deputy Barry Cowen in recent times, that the Minister has stepped back from an earlier commitment that 80% of the taxes raised locally would be held within that local authority and spent on services for the citizens and businesses within that local area.  The Minister intends to defer that particular condition of the collection of taxes.  Instead, as I understand it, taxes will go into one central pot.  We are looking for clarification from the Minister's office to see whether that is simply a one-year deferral or a more permanent development where taxes collected locally will not be spent locally, which we see as a retrograde step.  It is particularly important that we get clarification of this as we head into a new calendar year in which there will be local elections.  We all are in favour of tightening the link between local representatives and the citizens who vote them into office.<\/p><p>  The committee will not be surprised that the third area I want to raise is one close to the Dublin chamber's heart, that is, the issue of an elected mayor for Dublin.  When I joined the chamber in 2001, the chamber was already campaigning for an elected executive mayor for the Dublin area.  We do this for good reason.  The global position is that city regions are driving national economies.  There is strong evidence to support our belief that Dublin is a significant driver of the national economy.  We believe that Dublin, therefore, needs to be run in the most efficient and effective way.  Around the world, in cities such as London, New York and Chicago, executive mayors are key to driving the economies in those city regions and the benefits that those city regions accrue for the rest of the economy around them.<\/p><p>  We are looking for an elected mayor who can be a strong voice for the Dublin region, who can promote the Dublin region internationally and who can ensure that local services across the four local authority areas in Dublin are delivered efficiently and effectively, that there is strong co-operation and shared objectives and that those local authorities are held accountable.  We have debated this issue over many years with the member businesses of the chamber.  We are clear that we will only support an elected mayor if it is a mayor who has executive powers.  We are not interested in another layer of bureaucracy.  We are not interested in a mere figurehead.  We must have executive powers with that office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700032#GG00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Gina Quin"},{"type":"speech","time":1383834900,"counter":765,"content":"<p>I call on the only Dublin member present, Senator Keane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700032#GG00300","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1383834900,"counter":766,"content":"<p>I will start where Ms Quin finished, on the elected mayor.

It would only be another office and another bureaucratic facility.<\/p><p>  The theory was that 80% of the local property tax raised would be spent locally.  In anything, there is a bedding in period.  It is not easy to change a system, from black to white, in one fell swoop.  I can see that there are reasons for deferral.  It is a question we will keep on the agenda because that is the theory behind the local property tax.  The deferral is until 2015.  That is what has been stated so far.  It is not an ongoing and rolling deferral.  That is my understanding of it but we will question it further.<\/p><p>  I do not know whether Ms Quin raised something else, but we have her submission and the other ones that were presented by the other two organisations earlier.<\/p><p>  On commercial rates, as I stated to IBEC earlier, there is now more leeway to help businesses at local authority level because heretofore local members did not have a facility to reduce or increase the rates by 15%.  That provision now exists.  If there is the wherewithal in counties, it is a power of the local authority.<\/p><p>  Co-ordination is an issue between businesses and local authorities.  With the chamber, the local development companies and the enterprise board being more integrated, the process will be more transparent.  It will drive businesses in each county that the responsibility is with the county as well rather than having the enterprise boards responsible to Enterprise Ireland and one having to spend X amount of money, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700032#GG00400","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383835500,"counter":768,"content":"<p>I am interested in our guests' position on money raised locally being spent locally.

We rely very heavily on money from more highly populated areas.  What is our guests' position on equalisation?  I am curious to discover their view on the measure in this regard, particularly in the context of money remaining in the areas in which it is raised.  Not everybody can live in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or Galway.  There are other counties with smaller populations.

It has been a difficult ten or 12 days for the members of Dublin Chamber of Commerce and residents across the city.  That is, however, an issue for another day, particularly in the context of the means and methods that will be used to resolve it in the long term.  I hope a mechanism will be put in place to address it in the short term.  We will be raising the matter with the powers that be at other fora.<\/p><p>  Ms Quin has stated Dublin Chamber of Commerce, in conjunction with the local authority, played an active part in seeking cost efficiencies and so forth in recent years.  I am aware that the process in this regard was difficult for both local authorities and the recipients of the services they provide.  During the initial two or three year period cost savings of 20% to 25% were made by my local authority in the area of manpower.  This meant that my local authority and others like it were obliged to seek to provide the same level of service with fewer personnel and less funding.  I commend everyone concerned for achieving the necessary efficiencies.  These efficiencies continue to be achieved by means of changes to procurement processes, etc.<\/p><p>  What Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy said reflects the methodology and reasoning behind the parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister about this matter.  I understand he previously gave a commitment to the effect that what was raised locally would be retained locally.  The money raised in Dublin by means of the local property tax would amount to in the region of &euro;50 million over and above the amount available under the existing equalisation measure.  It is in the latter context that I asked the Minister to make a firm statement on what was the long-term objective in this area, irrespective of what might be the position in order for people to address the ensuing situation in the wake of the original statement on his part.  I hope clarification from him will be forthcoming.  I have my doubts about his remarks to the effect that the deferral will only apply next year.  I expect that in 2014 he will continue to state the deferral will remain in place for a longer period.  I agree that clarity and finality are required in this issue.<\/p><p>  I fully support our guests' views on a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  In the context of the Local Government Bill, my party produced a document which detailed our support for directly elected mayors who would have effective executive powers, not only in Dublin but also in the other major cities throughout the country.  While I welcome the plebiscite, I do not believe it is necessary to hold one.  The matter could have been dealt with in the legislation.<\/p><p>  There is a need for a complete overhaul of rates.  I am aware that a revaluation was carried out in Dublin, but I do not believe this addressed all of the issues our guests' members would have raised.  We will be tabling amendments that would lead to the creation of a system which, at its core, would be cognisant of the position on commercial rents.  There has been a reduction in such rents in recent years, but there has been no corresponding fall in commercial rates.  This matter must be addressed.  We are of the view that some weight must be attached to turnover and the ability of business owners to pay.<\/p><p>  I request that our guests furnish the committee with amendments they believe might reflect their requirements or address the deficiencies they see in the legislation.  We are all realists and expect that the Government will exercise its majority in the passage of the Bill through both Houses.  However, I hope there will be consensus on a wide range of issues and that we will be in a position to seek agreement on particular amendments.  To that end, I ask our guests to make available to the members of the committee suggestions they may wish to bring forward.  I hope we will be able to work further with them on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700033#HH00300","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383835500,"counter":770,"content":"<p>I will deal, first, with the issue raised by Senator C&aacute;it Keane in respect of the 80% deferral.  Our concern is that the Minister was not clear in his answer to Deputy Barry Cowen's parliamentary question on the period for which this deferral would be in place.  It is couched within the context of the establishment of Irish Water.  We agree that water is an absolutely essential resource and that during the past eight or ten days Dublin has experienced water shortages.  In such circumstances, there is an urgent need for this matter to be addressed.  In the context of investing in water infrastructure, the decision to be made must reflect the long-term reality.  We are concerned that there will not be a clear cut-off point at the end of 2015 in respect of the reinstatement of 80:20 rule relating to local authority funding.  We will be seeking further clarification from the Minister on whether the 80% to which he committed will come into place in 2015.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy's question on equalisation, we recognise that there are very significant differences between various areas of the country in the context of population base, the commercial rates base, etc.  We must also recognise the scale and scope of Dublin.  The greater Dublin area accounts for 40% of the population on the island.  The individuals who live within that area must be provided with adequate services.  The other factor which is very real for local authorities in the context of planning is that the Central Statistics Offices estimates that the population of the greater Dublin area, currently 1.3 million, will rise to over 2 million by 2020.  That is a significant increase and we must seek to run slightly ahead of the estimates in providing services and putting in place the necessary infrastructure such as schools, adequate water supplies, roads, public transport, housing - a major consideration - and so on.  Many of these are supported and supplied by local authorities.<\/p><p>  While I appreciate that there are challenges throughout the country, I am strongly of the view that the principle of 80% of local taxes being retained in the areas in which they are raised should be implemented.  Dublin will, of course, continue to contribute very significantly in terms of the income tax spend.  Over 50% of the national income tax yield, 62% of the national VAT yield and 59% of the national corporation tax yield emanate from the Dublin area.  It is still making a major contribution to Exchequer funding and revenues and, as a result, we want the principle to which I refer to be implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700033#HH00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Gina Quin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383836100,"counter":772,"content":"<p>The aforementioned survey and consultation are being carried out by all four local authorities and I understand the decision will be based on their combined weighted percentage votes.<\/p><p>  The local property tax is relevant to the equalisation fund to which Deputy Corcoran Kennedy referred.  In 1976 approximately 62% of local government funding was locally sourced from rates.  The figure changed drastically after the abolition of rates.  By 1982 the proportion had reversed, with 67% of funding coming from the national level.  We are reverting to the position of 1976.  It is not new that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  Local authorities regularly ask to be given more powers but if they need power they also need to be able to raise their own money.  However, as not every county has a sufficient business base, the equalisation fund will have to change that.  Some counties will perform better than others and a central fund will always be needed for smaller counties.  There is no way that Longford will be able to produce similar amounts to Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013110700034#JJ00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383836100,"counter":773,"content":"<p>To clarify, I have a draft of the legislation in front of me.

I propose with his agreement to broadly cover the questions raised in the clerk's letter relating to the local property tax and to leave the detail for further discussion.<\/p><p>  It is important to recap that this is a new tax, with new concepts and new language for many of Revenue's customers.  It is also a new tax for us in Revenue and the largest extension of the self-assessment system in the history of the State.  In approaching the design of the administrative system for local property tax we were very conscious of concerns which had been outlined by taxpayers about payment of the household charge and decided to offer the widest range of payment options we could for customers.  We also sent earlier this year to all property owners an individual copy of a booklet explaining the tax and the payment methods.  <\/p><p>  When I last appeared before the joint committee in May in the context of an attempted credit card fraud, I was able to advise it that our approach was proving to be very successful.  It resulted in a compliance rate of 89% by late July, which has now risen to 91%, in other words, returns for 1.6 million properties, plus local authority and social housing.<\/p><p>  Property owners can choose from seven payment options.  It is important to point out that all of these payment options were successfully used in the first filing period this year.  Data showing the range of options chosen by taxpayers were circulated in advance to committee members.  For example, over 10% of the tax paid was paid by phased payment by monthly direct debit.  Less than 1% was paid by phased payment by deduction at source from salary, pension or certain Government payments.  A total of 24% was paid by single debit authority, a mandate to Revenue to debit one's bank account once.  Just under 15% was paid by credit card.  A total of 36.7% was paid by debit card which is quite different in nature from a credit card.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013110700003#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383837300,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I again thank Ms Feehily for the promptness with which she appeared before the committee and I appreciate the postponement of the deadline for people to file their returns.

As I outlined in my opening statement, one of our responsibilities in Revenue is to take steps to secure the revenues in a way that reduces the opportunity for non-payment.  The difference between the two methods, from Revenue's point of view, is a single debit authority, which is filed on time, gives us the authority to go to a person's bank account once only.  We can then make a concession on the time because we have the person's authority to dip their account without returning to them for permission.  We have operated this system for many years in the context of self-assessment.  It works very securely, safely and cheaply.  There are no transaction charges.

I understand there is no impediment to the Revenue getting a property owner's credit card details and processing payment at a later date.  The advice I have received through the secretariat from two card payment processors taken at random from the Irish Payment Services Organisation, IPSO, website is that there are three very developed types of processes.  First, for bookings such as hotels or pick-up tickets for a bus or a concert they allow for a zero charge validation to ensure the bona fides of the card holder.  They guarantee that the person booking is the card holder and if that person decides to cancel, there is no charge to them.<\/p><p>  The second type is for variable charges such as utility bills, phone services and motorway tolls.  Many people use the M50.  The old toll gate was a serious problem.  It now uses a credit card system.  The third type is for monthly or quarterly charges such as subscription charges or charitable donations.  This would allow somebody with a debit or credit card to not only have the lump sum payment taken out once in the year the tax is due but have it staged to remove the tax on a monthly basis.

I cannot go that far, as the plastic card system has different characteristics, particularly as regards giving us authority to debit.

As I said earlier, I do not believe it was possible to draw any conclusions based on the half-year payment.  Once this campaign is out of the way, we will have a better pattern.  Already, the numbers indicate a drift away from debit card payment to the single debit authority and phased payments.  As the amount due has doubled, the pattern this time will be different.  That is the first part of the answer.<\/p><p>  Second, Revenue has no authority to debit a card a second time.  This comes back to the point about retention of card information, which I regard as high risk.  Revenue has no authority to debit a card a second time and as such could not simply have rolled over payments as we did in the case of direct debits, which operate within a particular framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013110700010#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1383840900,"counter":958,"content":"<p>If I was undertaking an analysis and 800,000 customers had paid the first time via debit or credit card, I would do everything I could to facilitate them paying in the same manner the second time.  To me, it should have been obvious to Revenue that asking people who previously paid by debit or credit card in May to pay the second tax in November would have annoyed them.  If, as a person who paid the tax in May and who has every intention of paying the tax for 2014 in 2014, I received a demand for early payment of the tax in November, I would not feel I was getting good customer service.

The Deputy asked if Revenue had undertaken any risk analysis.  I come back to the point I made earlier that in April, May and June this year large numbers of people paid via debit or credit card even though the payment was not due until July in respect of which Revenue received virtually no complaints.  It is difficult to anticipate something that did not happen before.  The online and paper systems being used now are the same as those used previously.  On the last occasion, the final date for online filing was 27 or 28 May.  I recall I was in Leinster House on that day.  People used their debit or credit cards in advance.  That dimension of it was not something that was evident from the analysis we did from the first half year.  It is clearly evident this time.<\/p><p>  To be fair to Revenue, we felt we were meeting our customer service responsibilities by giving people so many different options to pay.  There were times last year when I was tempted to say we would not accept payment by debit or credit card.  Revenue only commenced accepting payments in this way in 2012.  It is a new thing for Revenue.  It is almost as if the additional piece of service has become the problem.  I am being flippant.  I have no intention of stopping Revenue accepting debit or credit card payments.  If people wish to pay in that way, it is Revenue's job to facilitate them in every way it can.  The fact that the tax spans the year has made this one particularly difficult.  It is not tax that is due in 2014 rather it is tax payable on or before 1 January 2014.  The reason for that date - Deputy Stanley referred earlier to my remarks in this regard on the last occasion I was before the committee - is so that we can set up the phased payments.  It is all part of trying to give the optimum service.  We cannot give the optimum service on every eventuality.  For all of the people who are unhappy about one method of payment I have requests to add seven, eight, nine or ten other payments methods.  All of these have to be evaluated in the context of service and cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013110700010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1383840900,"counter":960,"content":"<p>If Revenue had undertaken an analysis of its customer base, it would have expected this level of resistance and annoyance.

Ms Feehily has stated today that this is a new tax and that \"our job in Revenue is to collect taxes and duties for the Exchequer in accordance with the law\".  She has also stated that paying any tax is \"unlikely\" to generate happiness.  I say \"Amen\" to that, and it is particularly the case when the new tax is loaded onto the people by the Government to pay the debts of speculating bondholders and bankers who profiteered wildly in the Irish property budget and had bad private debts laid at the feet of our people.<\/p><p>  I will speak very bluntly, although not for very long.  Ms Feehily has been brought here for one reason, as she is unwillingly and unwittingly providing an alibi for the parties in Government and helping them evade responsibility for a draconian new tax they have introduced.  She is distracting attention from the culpability of both Ministers and backbenchers for this hated new burden.  Ms Feehily has stated her job is to collect taxes in accordance with the law.  Listening to Ministers and backbenchers over the past week, I have asked myself where the hell the law came from.  Am I right in thinking that in December 2012, the Fine Gael and Labour Government, including backbenchers, designed and manufactured what I call a crude weapon of austerity, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act?  They loaded the weapon with draconian powers to intimidate, frighten and coerce decent taxpayers into paying for this unfair new weapon.  The Revenue Commissioners, in doing the Government's dirty work, is pulling the trigger, leading to Ministers and backbenchers screaming blue murder.  Necks of flint have been on display today and in the course of the past week on behalf of Government representatives.<\/p><p>  Next year a new water tax will be inflicted on decent householders and taxpayers.  When people rightly begin to scream about this new burden and learn about it in greater detail, I fully expect the contractors digging up pavements to install water meters to be dragged in here to explain their audacity in facilitating this new tax.  That is about as much credibility as the Government Deputies have shown in requiring representatives of the Revenue Commissioners to come here today.  Ordinary taxpayers are very angry about the property tax, and they are right.  The elderly, unemployed and poor people who have been saddled with this austerity bondholder tax are quite distressed.  It is a new hardship, and therefore the Revenue Commissioners should be very conscious in how they deal with ordinary people and the distress and fear that is disgracefully being brought about by Government policy.<\/p><p>  I have a question.  When Ms Feehily heard in the past week the deputy Prime Minister of the country and Government Deputies screaming objections to the letter demanding that people should pay the home tax which they had introduced, did she say to herself how pathetic that was and ask who they thought they were fooling?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013110700011#K01500","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383841500,"counter":1010,"content":"<p>I most certainly did not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013110700011#K01600","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily"},{"type":"speech","time":1383841500,"counter":1011,"content":"<p>That is a question for you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013110700011#K01700","speaker":"1014"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383841500,"counter":1012,"content":"<p>I would never use those phrases or sentiments with regard to the Government of the day and it would be completely outside my role.

I asked that the date be moved to 31 March.  Will the witness comment on the fact that we are dealing with compliance and confidence in the collection system?  People who have been compliant are really annoyed and we - I use that term because the legislation is flawed in some respects - have damaged public confidence in the collection system, which is unfortunate.<\/p><p>  There is also a more significant observation.  The witnesses have indicated that the Revenue Commissioners have offered seven options for payment, indicating the legislation stipulates it is due on or before 1 January.  For the 35% of taxpayers who have availed of options declaring name, address and telephone details of banks along with account numbers, they will not pay on or before 1 January.  The Revenue Commissioners have all the details they need so these people will not pay before 1 January.  It might be assumed that others had the audacity not to give those banking details, and the Revenue Commissioners are insisting on payment before 1 January.  These people include those paying by credit or debit card, cheque or postal order.

In regard to the Deputy's other comment, I need to clarify something.  It is not because people have given us their bank account numbers and their telephone numbers that we can be comfortable allowing those people to pay us in March; it is because they have given us permission once, and once only, to debit their bank account.

It is as easy for me to cancel a credit card as it is to cancel a single direct debit authority.  It is also as easy for me to pick up the telephone and cancel a cheque as it is for me to cancel a single direct debit authority.

While there has been some confusion over the last week, when anyone has come to my office, that confusion has been dealt with relatively easily.  It is our duty to help.  It is the duty of Government Deputies to help instead of just attacking others.  It is a pretty disgraceful way to treat public servants in the one institution that has come out fairly well in recent years in this country.  We do not always agree with the Revenue Commissioners and tax collectors have never been in exalted positions in society.

This is the third time that Ms Feehily has been before this committee, as far as I can recall.  On one previous occasion she was before us regarding a letter sent to people in receipt of an old age pension about a potential tax liability.  One of the issues that came across very clearly during that exchange was the fact that there was a communications problem <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> the Revenue Commissioners and the public.  I fully take on board what Ms Feehily said in her statement about the LPT being a new tax.  It is indeed a new tax and not one that anyone here would have liked to introduce.  However, there are benefits to extending the tax take across as broad an area as possible.  I am very concerned that, according to the statistics Ms Feehily has given us, over 50% of people are paying by debit or credit card.  Has the Revenue Commissioners examined why people chose those particular payment methods?  If one were to match the payment method chosen with the income profile of the payee, I suspect one will probably find that many of those paying by debit card in particular, are those who have a cash-only card and do not have access to the wide range of financial accounts that better-off people would have.  One of my concerns about the current debacle over the payment date is that a lot of those people who will be impacted by the payment being taken before December are in the lower income profile.  Has Revenue done any research to establish the who, why, where and when regarding those people who are paying by debit card, given that the logical choice would be to select the one single debit authority payment option?<\/p><p>  My second question-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013110700013#M01200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1383842700,"counter":1055,"content":"<p>I will ask Ms Feehily to respond to that before-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013110700013#M01300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1383842700,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>I would like to ask all three questions and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013110700013#M01400","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1383842700,"counter":1057,"content":"<p>It does not work like that.

The Chairman explored with Ms Feehily the possibility of that agreement constituting an individual's permission to the commissioners to debit his or her credit or debit card at some future date.  Her response, if I remember correctly, was that this was a route that she did not wish to follow.  In other words, the Revenue Commissioners do not want to hold card details, as opposed to not being entitled to do so.  She suggested that it was something that was possible but not something the commissioners wanted to pursue.  My understanding is that there are no data protection issues involved here and that there is no impediment to Revenue taking account details and processing the payments at a later date.

I definitely indicated that Revenue, at this point, is not comfortable with retaining credit and debit card details.  This refers back to Deputy Farrell's question, which I did not answer earlier.  The security issue I was referring to was the security of the information.  It is quite a serious issue and would require us to move into a whole different line of business if we started to hold on to debit and credit card details.  It presents risks of data loss way beyond any of the risks we have to cope with at present.  It presents risks that cardholders could find attempted fraud on their credit or debit card accounts and we already experienced that - although it did not succeed - last May.  That is the kind of security risk I am talking about.  We are not set up for it.

The Senator said she has a recurring relationship with eToll or some other company.  She gets a chance to look at her statement every month or whenever she gets it.  She can see very quickly if there has been an irregular payment.  We do not have a recurring relationship with PAYE taxpayers unless something happens in their lives and they want to claim a credit.  The relationship is managed through their salary and their employer.  We have a recurring relationship with self-assessed taxpayers, for whom we have been operating these kinds of payment systems without any issues for a long time.  I refer in particular to the single debit authority system.  We do not have a recurring relationship with the vast majority of people in employment in this country.  That is at the heart of part of the security risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013110700013#M02700","nonspeaker":"Ms Josephine Feehily","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383843300,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>We have been in contact with officials in the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  Before I read into the record what they had to say, I would like to come back to the point that was made about the 1.49% rate that customers are paying.  Further information has become available to me in that regard.  It has been suggested to me that more secure systems, such as 3-D Secure prompts, could be used.  These systems require the card holder to give a password or card number to verify his or her identity.  In addition to fulfilling data protection requirements, these systems also seem to lower the commission rate.  The industry commission rate seems to be approximately 1%.  The major retail companies in Ireland that have significant volumes of card transactions seem to charge this 1% rate.  As I said earlier, people give a code or an iTunes account number when they are using Amazon or iTunes.  The biggest companies in the world - we are not talking about the Revenue Commissioners - operate a system that merely requires one to provide a password in order for one's account to be debited.<\/p><p>  I would like to follow up on what Senator Hayden was saying by quoting from the feedback we have received from the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner:<blockquote>We are aware of recent media reports which appear to reference statements from the Revenue Commissioners outlining data protection issues with the retention of credit card data.  We can advise that any organisation, including Revenue, is responsible under data protection law for keeping personal data it holds safe and secure and it is also obliged to only collect personal data when it is required and then retain it only for as long as is necessary.  Revenue, being an organisation which is very aware of its data protection responsibilities, appears to have considered these data protection principles and applied them accordingly in relation to the collection and storage of credit card data for a particular transaction.  There are separate industry payment card standards which providers of payment card services have to adhere to and which may also be relevant to Revenue's approach in this matter but those requirements would not be matters for this Office.<\/blockquote>This brings us back to the point that Senator Hayden was making.  I made the same point at the start of the meeting.  It has been made by other people as well.  Certain systems or processes could be examined to ascertain whether they could be used in the future.  I recognise that Revenue has done a great job in providing as many options as possible to the public.  Some red herrings have been thrown out there this afternoon.<\/p><p>  I will reiterate the core issue that is being debated this evening.  Of the seven options, the highest rate of compliance relates to the credit and debit card option.  They are the only customers who are being asked to pay the tax in the year before it is due.  I can assure Ms Feehily, in response to a point she made earlier, that I understand how the tax is being created and the operational systems are being rolled out.  Perhaps it is just my opinion, but I do not think those who were complaining back in May or June were complaining about having to pay the 2013 tax in 2013.  The concern at the moment is that people are being asked to pay a 2014 tax in 2013.  That is at the nub of this issue.  I recognise what Ms Feehily has said this evening.  I appreciate her assurance that Revenue will agree to examine the matter.  I would be interested to know if there are hindrances with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, or if there are difficulties with Revenue's merchant agreement with the people who handle its credit card transactions.  All the information in front of me would indicate that this is a workable problem.  A solution can be found for it.  Maybe the difficulty was that none of us saw this coming down the tracks.  Now we can engineer a solution towards it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013110700014#N00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1383843300,"counter":1072,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Feehily for her attendance.

The Revenue Commissioners are to be commended in that context.<\/p><p>  I would like to refer to the 91% compliance rate.

A lovely gentleman contacted me yesterday afternoon to complain about having to pay the property tax.  He had received his letter.  He pointed out that the half-year charge was &euro;142, whereas the full-year change is &euro;285 rather than &euro;284.

Revenue can allow that concession.  We have done it with self-assessed taxpayers for many years.  If they send in their tax returns early, they fill in a single debit authority, either online or on paper and we do not execute it until the date on the authority.  That is why we can allow the concession.  This was our way of offering something to get people past the Christmas holiday season.  I do not think January is necessarily any easier than December.  That is why we offered this option.  It is interesting to note that approximately half the returns processed have chosen that option.  If I did not answer, that is what I meant.<\/p><p>  Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell asked me to make it clear what people can do who do not want to pay before 1 January.  They can pick a service provider on either the paper return or online and they can go to their service provider and pay, either in phased payments or in one lump sum, after 1 January.  There are three service providers.  Some will take debit cards, while most will not take credit cards.  People can pay in cash or by debit card at some of the service providers.<\/p><p>  I keep coming back to the question of why anybody would want to have to engage twice with this paperwork.  They can engage with this paperwork once if they pick the single debit authority.  It is a simple pay and file transaction, whether on paper or online.  They have to engage with the paperwork, to use that metaphor, only once.  They pick the payment option of \"single debit authority\", give us their bank account details, which, as somebody said earlier, is far fewer characters than debit and credit card and CCV numbers, and tell us the date up to 21 March on which they would like us to take it.

I thank Ms Feehily and her officers for coming before the committee at such short notice and for the spirit in which they engaged with us.  The Revenue Commissioners are not accountable to Government.  They are independent.  The structure of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform is also separate from Government.

I accommodated one earlier this afternoon in regard to the insurance industry.

If we create that precedent, future invitations will become very politicised.

Is it possible for Revenue to include or classify as entering into an arrangement the position whereby a property owner elects to pay the tax in one lump sum by way of credit card or debit card that is processed by 15 January?

I am accompanied today by colleagues from the Department of Finance.  As the Chairman outlined, the proposal is for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms in the framework of a single resolution mechanism and a single bank resolution fund and amending EU Regulation 1093\/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council.<\/p><p>  The first step in creating a banking union for Europe was taken with the recent adoption by the Council and the European Parliament of the single supervisory mechanism, SSM, which was negotiated under the Irish Presidency.  Under the SSM, responsibility for the direct supervision of the most significant credit institutions will transfer to the European Central Bank, acting jointly with national supervisors.  The ECB will issue instructions, regulations and guidelines to national supervisors for tasks performed by them as part of the SSM.  The ECB will take over its full tasks under the SSM in November 2014.  The banking union will apply to all members of the euro area and any non-euro area member states which choose to opt in. <\/p><p>  A complete banking union requires common supervision, deposit insurance and a common resolution framework, with an appropriate fiscal backstop.  Following the adoption of the single supervisory mechanism, the European Council called for the creation of a single resolution mechanism for banks covered by the SSM.  This is consistent with the principle underpinning the banking union that where supervision is centralised, resolution should also be exercised at the same level of authority.  If supervision were exercised at the central level but resolution remained national, tensions could emerge between the EU-level supervisor and the national resolution authority over how to deal with an ailing bank.  <\/p><p>  The single resolution mechanism consists of a single resolution board and a single resolution fund.  The fund will be financed by contributions from the banking sector.  The board will generally make the initial decision about whether a bank needs to be put into resolution and will draw up the necessary plans and make a determination as to whether funding from the single resolution fund is necessary.  However, without a treaty change, it is not possible for an EU institution to delegate policy-making powers to a subsidiary body such as the SRB.  Therefore, the European Commission will take the final decision to trigger resolution and use the fund. <\/p><p>  The basis for implementing resolution under the SRM will be the toolkit set out in the bank recovery and resolution directive, BRRD, agreed on by member states at the ECOFIN meeting that took place on 26 June under the Irish Presidency.  This common toolkit for resolution will help ensure a reasonably level playing field across the EU between participating member states in the SSM-SRM, and those which decide to remain outside of it.  Although the BRRD has yet to be finalised, trilogue negotiations are ongoing with the European Parliament and it is hoped agreement can be reached by the end of the year.<\/p><p>  Before proceeding to outline the main elements of the proposal, I will briefly explain why a single resolution mechanism is considered necessary in addition to the bank resolution scheme already agreed by the ECOFIN Ministers.  The purpose of the BRRD is to provide national authorities with common powers and instruments to pre-empt bank crises and resolve any financial institution in an orderly manner in the event of failure, while preserving essential bank operations and minimising taxpayers' exposure to losses.  These powers represent a minimum harmonisation of the rules to be used in resolution.  There remains, therefore, the potential for variations in how member states handle resolution. <\/p><p>  In a banking union context, however, stakeholders generally agree that in a situation where the supervision of banks has transferred to the centre, resolution should take place at the same level.  Without such symmetry, market expectations about member states' inability to deal with bank failures nationally could continue, reinforcing feedback loops between sovereigns and banks and fragmentation and competitive distortions across the Internal Market.  Furthermore, the Commission is of the view that a strong single resolution mechanism is critical to ensure timely and least-cost resolution of banks.  Its position is that the goal should be a centralised authority with power to trigger resolution and make decisions on burden sharing. <\/p><p>  Ireland has welcomed the single resolution mechanism as the next essential step in creating a banking union.  The SSM is now in place and the ECB will take over direct supervision in November of next year.  Progress is being made in discussions with the European Parliament on concluding the EU deposit guarantee directive.  The creation of the SRM with centralised decision making by a single resolution board and equipped with the resources of a single resolution fund, financed by contributions from the financial sector, represents a significant step in achieving the core objective of breaking the link between the sovereign and the banking sector.<\/p><p>  I will now set out the main elements of the proposal as published by the Commission.  In regard to the legal basis for the proposal, the SRM will be based on the Single Market treaty Article 114, which provides for the harmonisation of laws in member states in the pursuit of smooth functioning of the Single Market.  The Commission's legal services have indicated that, in accordance with that article, the legal basis to proceed is sound.  Treaty change would be required to make the single resolution board independent in its role and while there is a view that this might be preferable, the time required for such a treaty change did not fit into the timetable demanded by leaders and Heads of State - and, for that matter, by the financial markets - for the completion of the banking union.  The Commission is of the view that the proposed governance structure, whereby it would retain the ultimate decision-making authority, is consistent with the Meroni principle, which requires that there should be no delegation of discretionary powers with a wide margin of discretion that would have the effect of transferring policy-making powers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013110700020#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Carrigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383847200,"counter":1260,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carrigan for his very detailed briefing.

First, the contributions will be calculated in line with the draft bank recovery and resolution directive on the basis of criteria taking into account the amount of liabilities, minus own funds, and covered deposits of each bank and adjust it then to their risk profile.  This means that banks which were financed almost exclusively by deposits would in practice have very low contributions.  Second, contributions would be risk based, reflecting different risk inherent in different types of banking activity.

There is another stage of level two legislation, delegated legislation, whereby the Commission will set out the exact criteria to be applied and it is only then that it will be clear what the range will be.

My background is in adult palliative medicine but as part of my post, 12 years ago I was asked to set up the first children's palliative care service, which I did in Crumlin.  That was in response to the National Advisory Committee report recommendations that children were not like adults and needed to be addressed separately.<\/p><p>  It is fair to say the death of a child is probably one of the greatest tragedies that can befall any family and consequences on parents, remaining siblings and the extended family can be profound.  For families living with a child with a life-limiting illness, there are significant challenges on a daily basis; these are not just physical but they are emotional, psychological, financial and spiritual.  At its core, children's palliative care relieves suffering for a child and improves quality of life for the child, whatever length of time he or she has.  It is a focus on living rather than dying.  As part of what we do we try to support families with the challenges they face daily, facilitating them in helping to make decisions, which can be difficult throughout a child's illness.  We insist on co-ordination between services, hospitals and the community.  End of life care for these children is just a part, albeit an important part, of what we do.<\/p><p>  Language is important as we are talking about children with life-limiting illness.  By this we mean children born with or who acquire an illness where they are unlikely to live beyond childhood or into early adulthood.  Hundreds of those illnesses have been identified, ranging from incurable cancers to severe brain injury.  They have in common the need for palliative care, and such care needs will fluctuate throughout an illness.  Many children will be fine for much of the time and would be managed with generous palliative care by GPs and public health nurses.  At times they will become unwell and need level 2 palliative care, which comes from paediatricians or local hospitals.  Some of these children would need specialist palliative care services, and it is estimated that approximately one in five children with a life-limiting illness at any one time would benefit from specialist palliative care if it were available.  We would like a comprehensive responsive service, which should have a broad range and depth of skills available to children to meet their needs.<\/p><p>  It is important to understand that children are not mini-adults.  In the past few weeks the committee has heard about adult palliative care and that is not directly applicable to all children.  For a start there are fewer deaths, at approximately 370 life-limited deaths per year, and children often have very rare conditions, which makes care challenging for the people looking after them on the ground.  Importantly, these children can live for many years, unlike adult counterparts, and they often experience episodes of deterioration.  Some would say these children die several times before they reach end-of-life care, and services need to be able to respond to that intensity of need when it happens.  Another big difference is that children are continuously developing physically, emotionally and cognitively, so a child who develops an illness at two would have very different needs from the same child when he or she comes to die at eight or nine.  The services must be able to meet those needs.<\/p><p>  Much work has been done and a policy outlines what we should be doing and how it should be done, along with the timeframe.  That should be the blueprint for the development of services.  In a nutshell, we must recognise that when we are planning our services, we cannot look at the number of deaths, as that does not reflect need.  We must consider the number of children living with life-limiting illnesses, and we now know that previous estimates are a significant underestimate, with at least three times that number living with life-limiting illnesses.  We need a database, which is not currently in place, although it is being worked on.  Without knowing the numbers of children and where they are, it is very difficult to plan services, and we must consider how they overlap with disability services.<\/p><p>  Human resources are key and one cannot have a specialist service without people trained to deliver care.  The current outreach nurse posts and consultant - one paediatrician working full time in the country - are being 85% funded by the Irish Hospice Foundation over a five-year period.  That is not sustainable in the long term and the positions must be State-funded.  The service must also be expanded, as the recommendation in the report of one consultant and eight outreach nurses is only a start rather than the defining number.  In the UK the recommendation is for one paediatrician in the area for every four adult physicians.  We have 34 adult physicians and only one paediatrician, so we are already under-resourced in that regard.  We see the need on a daily basis, with children from other children's hospitals being referred that we cannot reach.  We need more consultants and outreach nurses, and must also further develop the team at Crumlin.  This does not have to require much money, as staff already looking after these children can be upskilled in order to bring expertise to a desired level.<\/p><p>  Children with life-limiting illnesses by and large wish to be cared for at home, although it is not always possible or desirable.  It is what most families want but there is still inequity in the services delivered to children.  Children with cancer have a more easily accessible service than that available to children with non-cancer diagnoses.  We need to be able to ramp up support to those families with non-cancer diagnoses in order to help them care for the child through to end of life.  We must give the families real choices, as for some of our families, home is not the desired option, and that is no fault of their own.  They need a real choice of either hospital or hospice if available and if that is where they want a child's end of life care to happen.  We must acknowledge that we are still heavily dependent on the voluntary sector to deliver care and we must work in collaboration to deliver a seamless service.  We are working in that regard but the effort is ongoing.<\/p><p>  Nelson Mandela stated that there can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.  We have done much and a lot has been achieved but there is much left to do.  If we focus on the Department of Health policy and stick to the guidelines and recommendations in it, we will improve the position for all our young patients and families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700003#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maeve O'Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1383816600,"counter":1480,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for her contribution and the excellent written submission.

We are here to talk about specific cases involving end-of-life care and the care we have provided for families.  The Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children&rsquo;s Foundation is a unique model that has been running for 16 years.  We provide end-of-life care for children and families in the home.  The model embraces the whole family.<\/p><p>  I will refer to statistics we have compiled.  We have kept information on families since 2010, including the number of referrals we have received, what percentage of the children died and where they died.  Since 2010 we have received more than 510 referrals.  Of those, 133 children have died, some of them at home.  Sixty-one were specifically referred to us for end-of-life care or palliative care.  A total of 47 of the 61 children have passed away and eight are still currently receiving palliative care.  A total of 14 children died in the first week of life, six within the first month of life, 22 within the first year of life and five after reaching one year of age.  Six of the children were taken off our books because their conditions improved and they no longer required palliative care.  The remaining 72 of the 133 children, as indicated by Ms Ling and Dr. O&rsquo;Reilly, were referred initially to the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children&rsquo;s Foundation for respite at home but due to the fragile nature of their health their conditions worsened and they made the transition to end-of-life care at home.<\/p><p>  I ask committee members to remember that 60% of the children we looked after died at home, compared to the national average of 11%.  People want their children to die at home.  That is stated in the national policy from 2009.  However, there must also be a choice involving hospice care, as home care does not always work for parents.<\/p><p>  Patients with more than 100 different diagnoses have been referred to the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Foundation.  The research was carried out with Trinity College in the past two years.  Some of the conditions include trisomy 18, which is Edwards syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy type 1, and inclusion-cell disease.<\/p><p>  What is unique about the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children&rsquo;s Foundation is that we do not have a waiting list.  If a family makes a decision today to take their child home to die, we will have a nurse in the home within 24 hours.  A total of 11 liaison nurses cover the Twenty-six Counties.  We provide in-home nursing care ourselves.  We do the hands-on work, including in the evenings and at weekends when no other services are available.  We are one of the only out-of-hours paediatric nurse service providing hands-on care in the home.<\/p><p>  We facilitate the allocation of funding from the Irish Hospice Foundation and the HSE for extra nursing care in the home.  That sometimes happens because the Irish Cancer Society does not have qualified paediatric nurses to carry out hands-on care.  Sometimes it can take time for the HSE to come on board with a home care package, and these children might die in the meantime.  The funding is given to us to ensure that the same nurses are looking after children.<\/p><p>  We provide an on-call service as necessary.  Some of our nurses have gone out at 12 midnight and 2 a.m. when families are in distress when their children are at the end-of-life stage.  We listen and help co-ordinate parents&rsquo; wishes.  We also liaise with expert counsellors and when issues arise relating to end of life we can link families to them and they can talk to them and receive advice about their children or their own situations.<\/p><p>  We visit families for up to a year post-bereavement and we also organise a bereavement information day for families every 18 months.  We do a sibling group also.  In the past year we have found that we have been asked to link back in with children who are over four years of age and to provide hands-on care in the home because the families have got to know staff since the children were six months old and they now have reached the end of life.  It is of benefit to see a familiar face and a person whom they have known all along.<\/p><p>  As nurses we spend a lot of time on the telephone seeking medical cards, HSE funding and home care packages for families in order to grant their wish to have their children at home.  We are members of the national development committee on palliative care, which is the blueprint for the policy.  I am a committee member.  We have one of the best-qualified paediatric teams.  Currently, four of us are undertaking a master&rsquo;s degree in complex needs in palliative care for children and young people in Coventry.  We would prefer to do it in Ireland but such a course does not exist at the moment.  One of our nurses is qualified in bereavement care.  Our recommendation is that medical cards be sanctioned for children going home for end-of- life care.  Many issues arise with regard to the sanctioning of PPS numbers before medical cards can be provided in order to get equipment to send children home to die.<\/p><p>  Clarification is required on the long-term illness card and what is covered for children with long-term illness.  Funding must be provided to ensure 24-hour care can be provided in the home at the end of life or the terminal phase, because that is what parents want.  The adult home care teams are wonderful and they have such experience.  I would love if they could provide 24-hour care because there are two home care teams that, unfortunately, do not cover weekends.  Funding should be provided to enable them to provide such care and advice for nurses and families in the home.<\/p><p>  It is important that paediatric nurses are employed in the community, as they are the experts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700004#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sinead Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383817800,"counter":1486,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Moran, Ms Thomas and their crew for all their great work.

We have heard about the palliative care of children who are dying, but when we think of bereaved children, we are thinking of children who are actually suffering loss from the moment of prognosis in the family.  We cannot think of them outside the family context.  We think of children as the forgotten mourners.  Very often, we see them in cemeteries, but we do not actually think about them.  We might give them a look of pity, but we do not actually follow on to see what happens to them.  A child who is bereaved in childhood is bereaved for life.  Every milestone of his or her life, including the transitions of First Holy Community, Confirmation, changing school, going to college, getting a job, getting married and having children, will have the shadow of the loss of childhood hanging over it.<\/p><p>  From figures from the CSO, with which we had discussions in the past week, we have discovered that, according to widowed parents, 20,886 children under 19 years have been bereaved of a mother or a father.  That is a very low estimate because it does not regard many of the children's siblings who are dying in palliative care or other children who have been bereaved.<\/p><p>  The network was established only in the past 12 months.  It was launched by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in July last year.  With funding from the Irish Hospice Foundation and the Family Support Agency, we appointed a co-ordinator in March.  There has been phenomenal work done since.  The vision of the network is the sharing and developing of good practice, including training and resources.  By doing so, the care of bereaved children and their parents will be improved across the country.  The network has a principle of equity, a belief that all children will receive support they require, depending on the nature of the death.  It is not specific to palliative care.<\/p><p>  The network represents all professionals working with bereaved children across Ireland.  In considering children's grief, we must take on board Dr.O'Reilly's point that children are not mini versions of adults.  As professionals, we know that when adults are grieving, it is a case of their getting into the river of grief until they come out on the other side.  For children, it is like splashing in puddles.  Their grief is intermittent and intense, often caused by triggers that can feature for many years.  Professionals believe exclusion and silence are the two most unhelpful phenomena for bereaved children.  I refer to exclusion from funeral rituals because it is considered the children are too young to understand.  We know from experience that even the youngest of children have stated, \"I was there.\"  They may be under four years but presence at the funeral is very significant in their development in the longer term.  We need to educate parents in the light of this.<\/p><p>  The second phenomenon, silence in the family home, is really detrimental.  If there is an attitude of not addressing the subject in the house, children suffer silently.  It can actually cause a lot of unfinished business for the children in regard to the loss of the deceased.  We know children need acknowledgement and inclusion.  The work done for up to 30 years by professionals around the country has been preventative; that was practised wisdom.  With this approach, where can the bereaved children look for support?  Research tells us that 60% of families can actually work through grief if they have information and a good natural support network.  What happens if a child is nine years old and his or her mum and dad are all-consumed with his or her sibling's illness and there is nobody there for him or her?  He or she is farmed out to the neighbours or left to fend for himself or herself.  What happens if a child's dad takes ill with a brain haemorrhage or heart attack at work and dies within hours outside any palliative care setting?  Who will look after the child then?  Who will support him or her?  From 20 years of practice, I know that 99% of the children I meet say to me that, until speaking to me, they had spoken to no one about their loss.  That is a huge number.<\/p><p>  Our school systems have a huge influence on children.  Professionals believe schools can support the grieving child and notice the difficulties that arise in the classroom.  School authorities can bring in parents and talk to them about the matter and can actually make referrals to obtain the extra support both the children and parents require in order to come through.  We find that if we put that support in place, we actually enable parents to grieve and support their children simultaneously.<\/p><p>  An audit of childhood bereavement services conducted in 2010 showed that services across the country were absolutely fragmented.  The study compares with a UK study from 2003.  In Ireland we have no standards for bereavement support services for adults or children.  Therefore, we recommend the establishment of an agreed network for community, public, volunteer and professional education with respect to childhood bereavement.  We recommend an agreed research agenda because we do not yet have enough evidence of the consequences or the services actually provided.  We recommend continued support of the networks established and the European networks with which we are working.  We recommend the development of existing services and frameworks for child bereavement services.<\/p><p>  We use the analogy of the three-legged stool.  The child is the seat and the support legs are the family, schools and services.  Should any of the three legs not function, the child will collapse, with detrimental effects in the future.  The Government, the Department of Health, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection can work with us to realise our vision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700005#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Br&iacute;d Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1383817800,"counter":1488,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Carroll.

What kind of relationship do palliative care professionals have with general practitioners and public health nurses?   I ask the witnesses to elaborate on the issue of overlapping services because ideally, resources in this area should be pooled.

She said that there are no waiting lists for palliative care and that someone will be in the home within 24 hours.  That is a fantastic service which provides enormous relief for families.  I ask her to elaborate further on the services provided.  Reference was made to hands-on care, on-call services, night-time care and so forth.  However, Ms Moran said that she also spends a lot of time on the phone, looking for medical cards and so forth, which I found distressing.

The death of a child must be the greatest catastrophe to be visited on any family.  The evidence given this morning was rather distressing, to be honest.  To choose the particular career path that the witnesses have chosen requires a very special kind of dedication and I mean that in the best possible sense.  Sometimes we come across a tangled knot of bureaucracy, especially when dealing with the HSE, and the witnesses do not need to be told about that.  I have had first-hand experience of that myself, as a former psychiatric nurse.  There are so many different competing demands on the HSE and on this committee.  Dr. O'Reilly quoted Nelson Mandela earlier who said that a nation can be judged by how it treats its children.  Instead of simply praising the fine words of a statesman, we should try to give expression to those words.  In the context of paediatric palliative care, everyone should do his or utmost to lay aside or cut through any bureaucracy involved and prioritise the children.<\/p><p>  On the question of the upskilling of nurses, do the witnesses believe that the system of postgraduate degree courses for nurses present a financial disincentive for them to engage in additional education and training and further their careers?  I believe that is a grave anomaly in the system.  <\/p><p>  I compliment all of the witnesses on the work they are doing<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700006#G00300","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1383818400,"counter":1493,"content":"<p>Like other committee members, I am very humbled in the company of the witnesses.

They are here because they need to move palliative care on.  Why are there not enough staff when the universities are bursting with nurses?  Where is the gap in that context?  The universities are training brilliant young women who are then going off to England and elsewhere because they cannot get work here.  How do we fill that gap or address that?  The staff needed for palliative care are here, being trained and educated but why are they not in the system?  Following on from that, why are there not enough paediatric nurses and palliative paediatric nurses?<\/p><p>  Dr. O'Reilly's paper was excellent.

How can that be set up?  How do we convince a university or college to do that?  <\/p><p>  Ms Carroll's paper was extraordinary.  With the indulgence of the Chair, I wish to tell a short story.  I was doing a piece on embalming in Ireland and met an embalmer, a young girl from Australia.  She was a freelance embalmer.  When she was very young her father died of meningitis.  She was only nine years old, was his only daughter and adored him.  She was not allowed to view the body, to grieve or to talk about it.  That was one of the reasons she became an embalmer.  Ms Carroll spoke very well about silence and exclusion.  She also said that there are no standards for bereavement supports in Ireland.  What does she mean by that?  I am sure it is not a generalisation or sweeping statement and I ask if she has evidence to support that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700006#G00400","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1383818400,"counter":1494,"content":"<p>Thank you ladies.

Palliative care is delivered across several levels.  First, there is the generalist-GP-public health nurse level.  It is also delivered in hospitals among paediatricians which is often adequate for many children.  One in five life-limited children should have access to a specialist service.<\/p><p>  We have one paediatrician appointed in May 2011 and her funding, provided by the Irish Hospice Foundation, is for five years.  There is no guarantee this will be taken over by the State after it expires.  Simply, the State must take it over because this arrangement cannot go on indefinitely.  The Irish Hospice Foundation has pump-primed many of our posts, including some of our Crumlin posts which were eventually taken over by the HSE.  Funding for this area must be ring-fenced.<\/p><p>  One consultant is not enough.  We get referrals from Temple Street which has a large cohort of life-limited children.  With its neurosurgical unit, it would have many children with brain tumours.  For those children who are very ill and not receiving chemotherapy, there are no palliative care sessions for them there.  We try to work around this to see them on a grace-and-favour basis but that is not good enough.  There should be at least a second full-time paediatrician in Dublin.  We do not have the numbers nationally to have paediatricians everywhere.  That is not practical or realistic but there are ways around it.<\/p><p>  For example, a community paediatrician would see many life-limited children as part of their practice and do palliative care daily.  We could employ a paediatrician with four sessions in palliative medicine who could work around the country.  It would be a hub and spoke model with Dublin as the hub, where the bulk of children come through, and then the spoke, specialist services around the country.<\/p><p>  Consultants play a key role in setting up and supporting the service, as well as providing clinical leadership, research and education and other multiple roles.  An outreach nurse is usually based locally because the children in question want to be at home.  There is one based in each of the eight regions now.  Again, five of the eight are funded by the Irish Hospice Foundation, three by the HSE.  They have been coming in on a phased basis.  The last were appointed just several weeks ago.  These nurses make a difference on the ground for parents.  I have no doubt that children are able to stay at home because of these nurses.  They are providing emotional support, practical assistance, symptom control and so forth for families at home.  Very importantly, they are acting as a key worker helping families to navigate the system as Jack and Jill does.  For example, many of the children we would have referred would have severe brain injuries.  They would need input from neurology, dietetics, ophthalmology and neonatology.  The nurse would help the parents of a child in such circumstances, say in Kerry, to contact the specialist units in Crumlin.  This makes a real difference on the ground.<\/p><p>  It was never intended just to have eight nurses.  That figure was meant to be a start but it is not sustainable in the long term to have one nurse serving such a large area.  It can be an emotionally draining experience as it can be very isolated.  Accordingly, it is structured in such a way that their governance structure is within the local paediatric unit and a paediatrician in each region acts as their champion and support to them.<\/p><p>  We need more consultants and outreach nurses.  The Department of Health policy report stated that because the only team in the country is in Crumlin, it must be expanded and enhanced.  It is multidisciplinary teamwork.  At the moment we have one and a half specialist nurses working with us, funded by the HSE.  There are two specialists, myself and Dr. Marie Twomey, but we are adult-trained so we are not ideal.  The full-time paediatrician is Dr. Mary Devins.<\/p><p>  When someone goes on leave, we are not allowed to replace them.  We have a nurse going on maternity leave now, so we will be down a post for the guts of nine months.  That will impact on the service we deliver on the ground.  If we want to upskill staff, they have to be released.  However, we cannot release nurses from the wards because there is no one to take over from them.  Even though we are offering opportunities for upskilling, it is not really there unless they can do it in their own time.<\/p><p>  We need to have a commitment from the HSE that it will fund the existing consultant post and quickly appoint a second to help support this service.  We also believe in innovative models such as having a special-interest consultant around the country to reach children more locally.  That can happen in time, however, because we need to get Dublin sorted first where the bulk of the children in question pass through.  Our own team at Crumlin needs to be expanded and that is where we need to focus our resources at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700007#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maeve O'Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383819000,"counter":1497,"content":"<p>I was delighted to be asked a question about respite because I have just finished a PhD on it.  Speaking to the parents about their respite needs, I noted parents want to care for their child at home.  They do not want to send them to an institution.  If they do, then they want to go with them which means their other children are at home with no one to care for them.  The parents are usually sleep-deprived.  It is the mothers providing the majority of this care.  Parents want care provided by people they can trust and who can demonstrate they have the skills to provide the same level of care the parents themselves provide.  If the HSE were to provide that care, it then goes back to the whole point about having the right nurses, training them and upskilling them.<\/p><p>  On the question as to where our nurses are going, they are leaving because there is an embargo on recruitment and they cannot get jobs here.  Now we have a shortage of children nurses.  Existing staff cannot be released to do study leave.  There are about 4,000 children with a life-limiting condition which is a much higher figure than was contained in our initial needs assessment report.  Accordingly, there are very few people with a significant amount of skills.  We need to work together with nurses from LauraLynn working with nurses from Jack and Jill.  We need to have a seamless service while developing all our skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700007#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Julie Ling","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383819600,"counter":1499,"content":"<p>Accessing home-care packages is a significant issue for families going home.  It is becoming more of an issue because the funding is not there.  Unfortunately, it is not down to the people in the HSE because if they could they would give the money tomorrow.  We have serious issues with medical cards, especially for children, specifically for end-of-life care going home.  If the parents of a child with Edwards' syndrome wish to take the child home, they must go and register the child's birth in the registration office, one parent if they are married and both if they are not married, to access a PPS number before the child receives a medical card to access whatever medication the child needs at home.  That must change specifically for those children because sometimes they are only around for 24 to 36 hours and to ask the parent to leave that child and go and do that is unheard of and unfair.<\/p><p>  Regarding 24-hour care we are lucky because we get referrals from Crumlin or Temple Street hospitals.  From Crumlin it would be from the palliative care team but it is often from the outreach nurses who are in place, and there are eight of them locally.  A referral will come to Jack and Jill about a child whom they wish to send home and who requires nursing care.  Recently Ms Thomas and I received a call for a little girl on a Thursday whom the parents wished to take home that day.  The outreach nurse, Ms Thomas and I met the parents with the palliative care team in the hospital that day and planned what we would do about getting the family home.  They went home that evening at 7 p.m.  The following morning they wanted a nurse in the home and there was a nurse in the home the following morning.<\/p><p>  It is about co-ordinating all that between us.  The outreach nurse would have linked with the public health nurse, GPs and all those services.  She co-ordinates all of us to come together to get these children home.  We all met in the house on the Friday morning to plan what would happen for the weekend.  This is the issue.  We had a nurse organised for the weekend but by the weekend nobody was around.  I was on-call for the weekend.  The home care team in that area does not cover weekends.  Unfortunately, the outreach nurses do not cover weekends.  The GP had an on-call service.  I did one weekend and Ms Thomas did the following weekend.<\/p><p>  It is for those parents to have that expert at the end of the phone.  It is about giving funding back to these home-care teams because they are the experts in the area, giving advice to parents on symptom management, etc.  If an issue arose over the weekend I would ring the GP to guide and advise.  We all work together.  We meet the outreach nurses regularly, approximately once a month, to discuss the children we have, the cases and how things are going.  For active palliative care for children going home we meet regularly and work out who is doing what.  People do not want five or six people coming in on one day.  One might go on a Monday, I might go on a Tuesday.  It is about what parents need.  We decide between us how it works.<\/p><p>  One of our people recently cared for a palliative baby in Wexford and she spent much of her time in the home doing hands-on, out of hours care because, unfortunately, they did not get a nurse for that night and that child got into crisis that evening at 10:30 p.m.  She stayed in the house until 6 a.m. the following day until the child died peacefully at home.  That is the sort of work we do on top of everything else.  I have been called out at 12.30 a.m. and that is not ideal.  We cannot continue that.  There are only 11 of us so we must examine getting qualified paediatric nurses in the home on top of palliative care consultants and outreach nurses.  They have made such a difference to our lives over the years.<\/p><p>  I have phoned Dr. O'Reilly from a family's home seeking help and advice and it is wonderful to have those experts, because they are the experts.  It is also about training ourselves up to that expert level and having the opportunity for other nurses to avail of that and be educated and trained in palliative care and end of life.  Many people still do not understand that word and are afraid of it.  They think palliative care must mean the child is going to die now.  A child was referred to us and they said she might live eight or nine days but she survived for three years and died on Christmas Day.  The trajectories of these conditions are very diverse.<\/p><p>  We all very much work together as a team.  We meet with LauraLynn every six months.  We discuss our cases and the services we both provide to try and see how we can all work together to best meet the parents' needs.  We and the outreach nurses go around all the disability services, St. Michael's House, the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, Enable Ireland and St. John of God, and we sit together with the social workers and nurses and discuss the cases and figure it out between us.  We are all very much working together as a team to meet the families' needs as best we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700008#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sinead Moran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383819600,"counter":1500,"content":"<p>I reiterate that we are a charity and are the only providers of hands-on paediatric nursing care in Ireland.

Crumlin hospital and Jack and Jill provided the equipment to feed that child through a nasogastric tube.  The public health nurse could do nothing because she cannot apply for the equipment until she has a medical card number.  Our service is for children under the age of four.<\/p><p>  That comes back to the education issue, as Ms Ling and Dr. O'Reilly said.  The GP who was linked in and whom I spoke to when I was on call asked me why I was feeding the child.  That is the child's most basic need.  The last thing one would do would be to stop feeding a child.  People are not exposed to these cases and they do not understand.<\/p><p>  I recently had a case in Malahide of little boy who went home with a life-limiting condition and had Jack and Jill respite for a month.

Dr. Twomey and I provide the service.  We have 1.5 whole-time equivalents in Crumlin awe lost half a post when our last nurse went and was not replaced.  She is due to go on maternity leave next February and as of the last meeting there will not be a replacement for her.  This certainly influences what happens, not only in the case of palliative care.  It happens everywhere.<\/p><p>  I am conscious that I did not answer some of the questions put at the beginning about the upskilling of staff because it is the way to go.  The people concerned already have generic skills and just need to be upskilled.  It would be a more cost-effective way of doing it.  To be fair to the HSE which we have been bashing a little, we have had positive developments.  An education programme was started in Crumlin in response to the needs assessment of 2005.  It was also pump primed by the Irish Hospice Foundation, but my understanding is that the HSE is now funding it.  We provide education at two levels.  We organise study days throughout the country which are attended by GPs and public health nurses when we deliver talks on general palliative care and symptom control.  These are well attended and well evaluated.  We also provide level two training in Crumlin.  It is one thing to provide education, but one must be able to release staff to attend, which is another critical issue.  We are very lucky that the three nurses who work with us in Crumlin are highly trained and have masters degrees.  They are superb nurses but getting funding for them to undertake a masters degree course is like negotiating the Good Friday Agreement and takes forever.  We are lucky to receive donations from the public and families and try to ring-fence this money.  It goes into the general pot, but we try to keep it to one side in order that we can educate our staff.  Much is done in the staff's own time; it is not done within working hours.  These are constraints.  We have been speaking about upskilling and considering getting some of the LauraLynn staff who are excellent in providing respite care but who perhaps do not have much experience in providing end-of-life care to work in adult hospices for a short period or to come to us in Crumlin.  The goodwill is there and it is not a problem; it is just a question of practicalities in getting staff released.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700009#K01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maeve O'Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383820200,"counter":1512,"content":"<p>Upskilling is something we take very seriously at LauraLynn.

Sometimes parents just need to sleep for the night and their child may be stable with some needs.  It would be possible for a health care assistant to provide such care.  We are examining a model of having health care assistants and staff nurses whose work would be dictated by the child's needs rather than who was available.

This is an important matter and GLEN welcomes the committee's consideration of it.  Throughout my presentation I will use the acronym LGBT to refer to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.  I hope to highlight how LGBT people's needs can be fully incorporated into end-of-life policy and service delivery in Ireland.<\/p><p>  End-of-life issues affect LGBT people of all ages, as well as their partners, families and friends.  However, older LGBT people are the group most affected by and concerned about end-of-life issues.  For this reason I will focus on older LGBT people today, but the recommendations I make are applicable to services to LGBT people of all ages.<\/p><p>  A recent Irish study called Visible Lives: Identifying the Experiences and Needs of Older LGBT People was the first study of its kind in Ireland.  It was commissioned by GLEN, funded by Age and Opportunity and the HSE and published in 2011.  Professor Agnes Higgins from Trinity College Dublin was the principal investigator in this study and is present in the gallery.  On behalf of GLEN, I take this opportunity to thank her and her research team for producing this excellent research report.  I understand a copy of the report has been made available for members.<\/p><p>  The study surveyed 144 LGBT people aged between 55 and 80 from across the Republic of Ireland, and 36 people were interviewed in depth.  The study found that 46% were living alone, 43% were single and 31% were feeling lonelier as they aged.  One in four are either just about getting by or are struggling financially.  Only 11% said they had written a living will and just one in four had given someone power of attorney.  Some 48% said they had discussed their final wishes with someone and 62% had written a last will and testament.  By far the most preferred option was to live their final years and die in their own homes, as is the case for the general population.  The least preferred option is to be in a nursing home.  This is because of fears of being placed in a nursing home.  Some said they would prefer to live in an exclusively LGBT retirement community or an older-age facility that is fully respectful of LGBT people because of these fears.  A major concern for participants in the study is that the staff in older-age and end-of-life services will not recognise or respect their LGBT identity or their relationships and that they would have in effect to return to the closet and conceal their LGBT identity in order to feel safe when using end-of-life services.  This is an incredibly difficult scenario for somebody at an end-of-life stage.  Almost one in four said they had received poor quality health care and 40% considered this to be related to being LGBT.  Just one in three believed that health care professionals had sufficient knowledge about LGBT issues and only 40% felt respected as an LGBT person by their health care provider.  It is clear from this study that older LGBT people in Ireland fear being discriminated against when using end-of-life services, including nursing homes, and this results in their being cautious about being open about their sexual orientation or gender identity and reluctant to engage with health and support services.  However, given the increased incidence of being single, living alone and not having traditional family structures and supports, as evidenced in the Visible Lives study, older LGBT people are most likely to need and indeed benefit from such services at end of life.<\/p><p>  Transgender people have concerns that services will not respond to their needs or respect their gender identity, particularly as they age.  There is good evidence from Irish research that health care practitioners can have serious gaps in their understanding of the health care needs of transgender people and how to provide appropriate supports to them.  LGBT people may have reasons for not disclosing they are in a loving, close same-sex relationship, and not being \"out\" can have significant implications for gay and lesbian couples when one partner is seriously ill or dies.  This can lead to exclusion of the surviving partner from end-of-life decision-making or funeral planning.  Difficult experiences such as these can be further compounded when the grief of the surviving partner is unrecognised or unacknowledged.  This is referred to as disenfranchised grief and has been evidenced in Irish research on bereaved gay and lesbian people.<\/p><p>  I will now focus on some of the solutions.  The findings of Visible Lives, coupled with the difficult experiences older LGBT people had in the past, can lead to a particular set of challenges for LGBT people at end of life and for those providing services to them.  This point is echoed in an excellent resource developed by the National Health Service in the UK called The Route to Success in End of Life Care: Achieving Quality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People.  The authors of this report identify that end-of-life services need to actively encourage LGBT people to be confident in being open about their relationships and needs.  They say this can be achieved in a number of ways and set out four suggestions: that it should be recognised that sexual orientation and gender identity is about who a person is and with whom he or she falls in love and has loving committed relationships, as opposed to with whom he or she has sex; that appropriate and inclusive language should be used to facilitate understanding and identification of who is important to the LGBT person; that LGBT people and their families and carers need a comfortable and safe environment to feel able to be open; and that there should be an LGBT-friendly culture based on an inclusive practice model.<\/p> <p>With regard to an inclusive practice model, the Psychological Society of Ireland produced a policy document on inclusive practice in health services.  It described inclusive practice as follows: expecting diversity among service users and respecting that diversity; understanding the issues facing diverse groups such as LGBT people and being able to respond to their specific needs; and providing an accessible and appropriate service within one's area of competence.<\/p><p> In summary, GLEN advocates the following to ensure that the needs of LGBT people are met at the end of life.  An end-of-life policy should be based on principles such as equality, diversity and respect for individual autonomy, and LGBT people should be named as a population group with specific needs; and end-of-life services should be based on a model of inclusive practice that recognises and responds to the needs of different groups, such as LGBT people, and fully respects LGBT people&rsquo;s identities, relationships and families.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak and I am happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700011#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Odhr&aacute;n Allen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383822000,"counter":1531,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Allen for his presentation and for the immense work done by GLEN.

Members will have received copies of my oral presentation and a written submission.  I shall go through my oral presentation but perhaps not word for word, just the main points.<\/p><p>  There are a number of issues relating to Travellers and how they might die well in Ireland.  First, Travellers are a minority group in Ireland.  There are about 36,000 Travellers - that is, less than 1% of the population - which creates issues such as how to maintain staff awareness, through training and education, in order for staff to deal with people they encounter infrequently.  One of the pieces of information that I have drawn on is the All Ireland Traveller Health Study, Our Geels, published in 2010.  The study covered North and South and examined Traveller health issues.  The findings were as follows: 75% of Travellers in the Republic of Ireland lived in family units of five or less, which is not our traditional idea of them; 73% lived in a house, most of which were local authority; and 18% lived in a trailer, mobile home or caravan; in the previous year of the study 78% of families had not travelled; 28% of families reported difficultly reading or filling out forms.  When it came to coping with life, 98% of the Travellers surveyed were Catholic and most said that their religion was very important to them; 40% of Travellers, a percentage recognised by Mr. Allen, felt they had been discriminated against; and Travellers sometimes hid their identity, called \"passing off\", when they felt they were going to be discriminated against when receiving services or accessing social activities.<\/p><p>  Traveller societies can be considered collectivist rather than individualist.  In Traveller society the wishes of the community are sometimes as important, if not more important, than the wishes of the individual.  In collectivist societies large crowds tend to gather at times of family crisis.  That means that for family gatherings such as weddings and funerals, large crowds may attend, sometimes in the hundreds, which causes disruption and unease among the settled community.  At times of serious illness large crowds can gather and it is not unusual to find over a hundred people wishing to visit a person who is dying.<\/p><p>  Travellers have poorer health than the general population.  The health study showed that Travellers have a higher rate of doctor-diagnosed illness than the settled population, including chronic bronchitis and asthma.  The study showed that Travellers had access to health services and most Travellers had a medical card.  However, Travellers are more likely to use accident and emergency departments at a higher rate than the settled population.  They also have poorer follow-up from hospitals than the settled population.<\/p><p>  An important factor to point out is that Traveller life expectancy is much shorter than that of the settled population.  The male Traveller life expectancy is 61 years, a statistic that has not improved since 1987 and equals the life expectancy for the settled male population in 1945.  Female Traveller life expectancy is now 71 years.  That is an improvement on the 1987 statistics and is the same as the life expectancy for the female settled population in 1960.  The causes of excess mortality among the Traveller community appear to be mainly respiratory and cardiac disease, particularly respiratory disease, and external factors such as accidents and suicides.<\/p><p>  I was involved in research carried out by Dr. Onja Van Doorslaer into the use of palliative care by Travellers.  At the time I conducted research into the Eastern Regional Health Authority.  It is important for us to remember that Travellers believe it is unlucky to talk about serious illness and approaching or impending death.  Travellers are reluctant to discuss serious illness and believe discussing the matter will bring bad luck.  As I said earlier, when a person is seriously ill in the Traveller community it is custom for families to visit.  A Traveller's close family can comprise hundreds of people, whereas a settled person would consider close family to amount to between ten and 20 people.  There may be added distress if staff do not understand the importance of large numbers of visitors for a very sick Traveller.  Travellers tend to be aware that the gathering of a large crowds in such settings causes upset to health care organisations.  Sometimes the health care organisation manages the matter by calling security and restricting the number of visitors, but that can cause difficulties.  It is important to identify the key people in the Traveller group.  Perhaps members of the Travellers community or religious communities could be asked to liaise between the health care organisation and the Travellers.<\/p><p>  Travellers view hospitals as places of hope where a cure is possible.  Travellers involved in the study had experienced hospice care but were not keen on it and considered a hospice a place of last resort.  They felt that recognising approaching death through the use of a hospice was not appropriate.  The research showed that Travellers felt more positive towards community palliative care because it allowed people to remain at home for longer.  However, dying at home is unacceptable among the Traveller culture.  Dying in hospital is considered most appropriate.  Death at home is unacceptable because Travellers will say that great sadness will be associated with the place of death.  In the past the caravan or trailer in which a Traveller had died would be burned.  That no longer happens, but that is more for economic reasons.  Nowadays, in cases in which Travellers live in a house but somebody dies in it, his or her family will move away and not return for a number of months until the house has been redecorated and blessed.  Similarly, when a Traveller dies in a trailer, attempts will be made to sell it off, but Travellers do not buy trailers in which a person has died.<\/p><p>  With regard to Traveller traditions associated with memorialisation, funerals are normally arranged by Traveller men.  Nowadays Travellers tend to be buried in the place where they have lived, because most of them no longer travel.  However, conflicts can arise between the desires of the original family and that of the family of marriage on the location for burial.  As I said earlier, death is an important event in such a collective society so hundreds of people may attend the funeral, thus leading to tension among the settled community.<\/p><p>  Travellers do not always cope well with grief and bereavement.  Sometimes small societies tend to view a death as a great loss.  Many people use alcohol as a way of coping and Travellers are aware that such action is not necessarily a useful coping mechanism.    <\/p><p>  With regard to planning ahead, even though it may be said, it is really important that a patient has a good understanding of his or her situation, gives informed consent, plans for the future and participates in care planning, perhaps even plans in advance.  Many societies do not want to think too far ahead.  That is definitely true for the Traveller community, and for  many Irish people whom I have dealt with; they find planning ahead and thinking about death quite difficult.  I am involved in developing advance care planning and it is important to recognise that advance care planning should be patient-led and done with patient agreement, rather than a requirement.  Many people want to live day-to-day and leave the matter in God's hands.  <\/p><p>  We must consider ways of reducing mortality rates among Travellers.  I will outline the recommendations made in the All Ireland Heath Study.  Accessible information for health care workers on caring for Travellers needs to be made available.  Perhaps this can be done in a straightforward manner using the Internet or an app.  We must also maintain our focus on care for people with a life-threatening illness, improve their present care and quality of life and, if the patient so wishes, be open to the idea of advance care planning.

The question &ldquo;What needs to happen to ensure that people die well in Ireland?&rdquo; cuts straight to the values that underlie our society.  Death remains the biggest threat as well as the greatest challenge to humanity.  It is the single universal event that affects all of us in more ways than we care to know.  There is a growing amount of literature that points to the fact that death is not a discrete event; rather, we die as we live.  Over the course of my clinical career I have worked with several hundred patients who have died and almost without exception each one has testified to that maxim.  In this way dying well does not simply involve the last days or weeks of life; rather, it is the product of attitudes and values that we hold as citizens and governors of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700012#N00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul D'Alton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383822600,"counter":1536,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. D'Alton for his excellent presentation.

I may not read word-for-word from my script.<\/p><p>  We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee.  The theme that we, the Irish Hospice Foundation, will speak about is bereavement in Ireland.  It explicitly acknowledges that each of the deaths the committee has heard about has a living legacy.  Today alone 80 people may die in Ireland.  Eighty people died yesterday and 80 will die tomorrow.  Since 24 October, when the joint committee met to begin these sessions, I estimate that 1,200 people have died in Ireland.  That makes for many bereaved families, parents, wives, husbands, brothers, sisters, children, grandchildren and friends.  They are the people whom members meet all the time in their constituencies.  Members will be very attuned to the individual circumstances, stories and complexities behind each death.  We estimate that if ten people are affected by a single death then 290,000 people are bereaved each year.<\/p><p>  The vision of our bereavement work at the Irish Hospice Foundation is that people experiencing loss and bereavement are met with informed compassion and with appropriate care regardless of the circumstances of the loss.  The committee will have heard already the variety of circumstances that may pertain to people's illnesses, including the age at which they die, the age at which people are bereaved, the type of death, and relationships, tradition and culture.  <\/p><p>  In my presentation I make three points that are further backed up in the written submission.  First, good bereavement care begins with good end-of-life care, good palliative care and good communication.  Second, bereavement is best supported through developing our communities, which includes our professional communities.  Third, we would like some form of strategic framework to guide development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700013#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Keegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383823200,"counter":1539,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Keegan for her excellent presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700014#P00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1383823200,"counter":1540,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

Would this be useful for children with life-limiting illnesses or are their lives so different that this would not be of much use to them?  Bereavement is difficult.  Do the witnesses think there should be more psychological and social supports available.  Palliative and bereavement care are not the same, but there is a substantial link between them.  Bereavement care is probably a neglected area.  Do the witnesses believe there is a need for more people in the health area to receive specific training to deal with this?  If so, how many trained people are required?<\/p><p>  It has been clearly illustrated that Travellers are not currently well predisposed towards dying at home or spending time in a hospice.  Also, staff in these centres are not used to Traveller behaviour towards a dying person.  Mention was made of the need to train staff.  What should such training involve?  More research is also required and there is a need to work with those at the end of life to ensure the best information possible is obtained regarding their psychological state.

I really would be very cautious that we would give the message that anyone who experiences the death of a loved one needs to see a bereavement counsellor or psychologist.  That is not the case.  It comes back to a question that was raised in terms of a whole-system approach.  We do not need necessarily to be focusing on specialists or specialist training, but we need to be thinking much more globally about how we as a culture interact with the loss of a loved one.  It is unhelpful to put out the idea that when we lose someone we love we need to go and see a specialist.  We do not.  There are clear guidelines on when it is necessary.  I constantly say to patients and family members that within the first year of loss one is quite entitled to do whatever one wants psychologically and if, in 12 months time, one is getting stuck there, then it is time to go and see someone.  It is a little about the specialisation.  We specialise loss, and that is not what we want to do at all.  Coming again to the whole-system approach, in any setting, be it in nursing care or the training of doctors, we need to think broadly, and not so specifically, about skilling staff.<\/p><p>  The other question that came up was around the research agenda and including those who are dying.  We have a programme-of-research stream in St. Vincent's called Living with Dying.  We have conducted three pieces of research where we have spoken to patients at the end of their life about their experience, first, of dying in an acute environment.  Not to be insensitive, it is about going to the customer or person who is receiving the care, in this case, in an acute environment, and asking him or her about his or her experience, and that experience then informs our clinical practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700015#T00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul D'Alton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383823800,"counter":1556,"content":"<p>I echo a little of that.

One of the points that came from the International, Access, Rights and Empowerment, IARE, study is that maybe hospitals where there is a large catchment area of Travellers need to have more specific training and induction for staff in those areas so that they have a better understanding that there is a bigger Traveller population here.

At the end of the training process there was a significant shift in the level of confidence in providing care for members of the lesbian, gay and bisexual community.  Working in St. Vincent's Hospital I had probably seen some of the most dedicated nurses and doctors delivering care to patients, often towards the end of life.  It was the lack of confidence which sometimes got in the way in this regard.  It was this lack of confidence with stymied conversations between patients and staff on partners, boyfriends or girlfriends.  This was only because of an intention not to hurt, but then the silence sometimes led to hurt.  The programme has been very successful and published internationally, with recommendations to the effect that all health care service providers receive similar training.  However, it is important to view it in the context of wider training needs.  Ms Keegan drew the committee's attention to the forthcoming competency framework in palliative care.

I am aware that I am covered by privilege, but I am still not sure whether I should be saying all of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700016#U00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Regina McQuillan"},{"type":"speech","time":1383824400,"counter":1571,"content":"<p>That is a fair point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700016#U00700","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383824400,"counter":1572,"content":"<p>Yes.  It is a question of whether one expects a loving or a vengeful God.  If someone is a Buddhist, it comes down to how committed he or she is to that religion and the notion of dying with a clear conscience in the face of an aggressive fatal illness.  I suspect that one cannot do the latter.  There is then the old dilemma about what people believe and what they want.  An issue may arise where a patient is of one religion, while his or her family is of a different one.  We must consider how to manage matters in such circumstances.  Religion is important but so is people's spirituality and what it is that gives meaning to their lives.  One is trying to figure this out for people.<\/p><p>  A resource which the HSE has developed is a guide for people of different cultures.  I should know the name of the document, but I cannot recall it.  I am involved in trying to develop it into an app in order that it will be available to those who need it.  The document is a guide on culture and religions and provides information on the beliefs, etc., that are important to people at different stages of their lives.  It should be easily accessible for health care staff.  One is obliged to ask people who are their next of kin, what gives meaning to their lives and whether they are religious and want to see a priest.  I have dealt with Bosnian Muslims who did not want to see imams because they stated they were all Arabs.  Although they are Muslims, they saw the cultural identities of the imams overtaking their religious identities and also colouring any support they might provide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700016#U00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Regina McQuillan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383824400,"counter":1573,"content":"<p>Dr. McQuillan has raised some important issues which arise in my clinical practice when working with LGBT patients towards the end of their lives.  This connects with what Dr. McQuillan stated about people's experiences of religious institutions and religious education.  At the end-of-life stage that notion of a very vengeful or judgmental God can become very active.  Many patients are dying in hospitals or hospices that are run by Catholic organisations.  This is going to become more of an issue in the future when women who spent much of their lives in Magdalen laundries and will come to die in facilities run by organisations that may have been involved in their earlier treatment.<\/p><p>  On the cult or tyranny of the positive, this issue has major implications for people's psychological well-being.  It also has huge implications with regard to the culture of death in this country.  There is a pseudo-psychological belief that one's attitude will change the course of one's disease.  That is simply not true.  There is no conclusive evidence which indicates that one's mental state will change the course of one's disease.  However, this belief has gripped people and, quite frequently, leads to their becoming isolated.  Members of the same partnership or family often become terrified of opening up a conversation as a result of the belief that if someone observes that matters are not going so well, it will have an impact on the course of the disease.  We need to be very careful about the language used.  One sees evidence of this in newspapers all the time.  If someone well known dies, it will be stated he or she lost his or her battle or gave up the fight.  We need to be very careful about such language and also about the term \"keeping positive\".  The language to which I refer creates a psychological experience, which is often one of isolation.  To return to what I said, we know that in creating a culture where people die well we must ensure relationships are maintained.  Relationships are what keep people well and all of the research indicates this to be the case.  The cult of the positive interrupts this.  We, therefore, need to be very cautious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700016#U00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul D'Alton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1383825000,"counter":1574,"content":"<p>The point has been made that religion can work in two ways - that it offers solace to some people who have been bereaved, while others have a sense of being abandoned.  It is not a one-on-one cause and effect scenario.<\/p><p>  The other point is related to the model of bereavement support that is primarily provided in the community.  Many of the voluntary bereavement support structures in the community have religious roots, which is appropriate provided people are aware of it.  Some will opt to use a support and befriending service, rather than a counselling service that has a religious ethos.  I can link this with the theme of nursing homes and the general work we are doing, through the Irish Hospice Foundation, in residential care settings in examining how end of life is approached in such settings.  One of our programmes is entitled, What matters to me, and, again, it does not make assumptions.  The person is approached with a view to finding out what is important to him or her in respect of religion, spirituality or other matters.  <\/p><p>  The issue of miscarriage is very important as it is a loss that can revisit people in later life.  It is not only a matter of how that loss is managed through our communities and health systems.  In terms of maternity hospitals, only the specialist hospitals take a formal, resourced approach to dealing with miscarriage and pregnancy loss.  Much work needs to be done in this area.  The maternity hospitals and units recently met as a network to share information on what they were doing well in this area and what additional support they required.  Research carried out in a rural Irish hospital and recently published in the <i>British Journal of Social Work<\/i> shows just how excluded mothers who have experienced miscarriage and pregnancy loss feel.  Hidden grievers, although primarily mothers, also include fathers.  This issue is very much worthy of note.<\/p><p>  On the issue of research, some longitudinal research studies are taking place in Ireland.  Two studies, the Irish LongituDinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, and Growing Up in Ireland, provide an opportunity to trace the natural course of loss and bereavement.  We could probably do more on this issue and in our approach to dying.  Rather than recruiting people to participate in studies when they are in particular circumstances, it is preferable to include their views and experiences as they occur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013110700017#V00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1383825000,"counter":1575,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for coming before us and making their presentations.
