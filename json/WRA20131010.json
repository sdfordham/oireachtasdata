The Report is a valuable contribution to the consideration of social protection for persons who are self-employed. It estimates that cover for Jobseekers Benefit would require a 1% increase in the self-employed contribution to be cost neutral, and cover for Invalidity Pension would require a 1.5% increase in contribution. It also showed that among those self-employed who do apply for the means-tested Jobseekers Assistance, the approval rate is high at 85% though it recognised that it is difficult to quantify the extent to which needs are being addressed. It pointed to a number of features of the system that may make it more difficult for self-employed persons to access entitlements in this area, ranging from lack of awareness to individual features of the means test. The Group also recommended compulsory cover for Invalidity Pension but was not persuaded of the extension of Jobseekers Benefit.<\/p><p>  In the present climate, Government must be careful of any measures that increase the costs of establishing and operating a business. <\/p><p>  On the positive side, entrepreneurs would be provided with an additional &lsquo;safety net&rsquo;.

The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 provides that reviews of each JLC be carried out by the Labour Court, as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Act, and at least once every 5 years thereafter. The review assisted the Labour Court's  deliberations as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended and the Labour Court is required to make recommendations to me to this effect.<\/p><p>  I have accepted the recommendations contained in the Report.   When I published the Report I indicated my intention to abolish the Dublin Hotels, and the Law Clerks' JLCs, to narrow the scope of the Agricultural, Hairdressing, Retail Grocery, Hotels (outside Dublin), Contract Cleaning and Security JLCs, while amending the administration of the two Catering JLCs pending their amalgamation following amended legislation. In the latter context, I also stated my intention to look at applying the Hairdressing JLC country-wide once the necessary legislation is passed.<\/p><p>  In publishing the Report and outlining the legal steps necessary for implementation of the Labour Court's recommendations, I have been particularly mindful of issues arising as a result of the recent Supreme Court ruling in relation to Registered Employment Agreements (the <i>McGowan <\/i>  case).<\/p><p>  With the exception of the Agriculture JLC, implementation of the recommendations regarding the scope of the other nine JLCs will be given effect by way of Ministerial Order.

By its nature the Scheme is demand driven. As at 4th  October there were 69 live CGS facilities resulting in &euro;9.7m being sanctioned through the Scheme by the participating lenders resulting in 433 new jobs being created and 139 jobs maintained. There are 3 banks participating: Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank.   Such an initiative has never been implemented in Ireland before, despite many calls for such a scheme to be introduced. <\/p><p>  The key challenge in relation to this Scheme is to ensure that in the first instance the banks, and in particular, the relevant local level bank officials are aware that there is support for SMEs, who because of a lack of collateral (Pillar 1) and\/or because of an inadequacy of understanding of the novelty of a business model, market, sector or technology, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit (Pillar 2). It is crucial that these bank officials see the Credit Guarantee Scheme as a key tool they have access to in order to facilitate lending to SMEs. Therefore, the banks need to integrate the Scheme into their credit function and to up-skill credit underwriters in relation to the Scheme. Any application for credit that is declined because of Pillar 1 and\/or 2 should then be considered by the bank for inclusion under the Scheme. I have been assured by the banks of their support for the operation of the Scheme and that it is being promoted appropriately within the bank structures. <\/p><p>  The second main challenge is around raising awareness amongst SMEs and their advisers. Awareness amongst these groups should increase the number of enquiries to banks for the Scheme, and this increase in demand should feed into the number of Credit Guarantee Facilities provided. <\/p><p>  Given these challenges and because take-up continued to be slow, the Scheme was recently independently reviewed with a view to identifying the reasons for this and recommending changes to the Scheme design. The Review included detailed consultations with all key stakeholders. A Steering Group, chaired by my Department, is currently assessing the expert Review and will shortly report back to me outlining what action needs to be taken to amend the Scheme.  I intend to publish the Review once this assessment is complete. <\/p><p>  I will then take whatever action is necessary to maximise the take-up of the Scheme. This may include amending the Credit Guarantee Act 2012, making a new Credit Guarantee Scheme and re-launching the Scheme with a marketing campaign and communications strategy supported by all interested parties. <\/p><p>  I recognise that there is a greater challenge around SMEs&rsquo; awareness of and understanding of the full suite of Government financial supports. The Government is working through the SME State Bodies Group, chaired by the Department of Finance, to develop a Communications Strategy in relation to all supports, financial and advisory, to business through the use of on-line and other resources and a Credit and Lending Newsletter for SMEs.

However, CSO data also indicates that significant numbers of Irish migrants have been returning to the country since 2008.  For example, 20,600 Irish people returned to Ireland in the year up to April 2012, and a further 15,700 returned up to April 2013.  Many of them are coming home having gained skills and expertise abroad that we can now capture to strengthen the operation and management of companies based here.  Some have also set up their own businesses and therefore help to support the objectives of the Action Plan for Jobs.  <\/p><p>  Lack of employment opportunities during the recession has, no doubt, contributed to emigration in recent years.  However, even during the so-called &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo; years, Irish people chose to emigrate for career or personal reasons.  <\/p><p>  A recent survey by UCC showed that 47% of Irish emigrants had full time jobs when they emigrated, while just under 40% wanted to travel and experience other cultures.

Many of these emigrants will gain important skills and insights from working overseas, but may well return to Ireland in the future.  <\/p><p>  We are also more engaged with those who have emigrated, through the Global Irish Network.

In Europe, wholesale gas prices have been on an upward curve since 2009. This is driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa, Japan and by the significant growth in demand from China and India. This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices, as most of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity is produced at gas-fired stations.<\/p><p>  The trend of increasing gas prices in European wholesale markets underlines the need to maintain the focus on continuing to address controllable costs factors, to increase the penetration of indigenous renewables into the Irish energy system and to take action on improving energy efficiency in businesses.  There are supports available to companies from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Environmental Protection Agency and Enterprise Ireland to help enterprises improve their resource efficiency, including energy efficiency.<\/p><p>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, Forf&aacute;s undertook a study to identify changes in the operation of sectoral regulators that would enhance cost competitiveness. The sectors examined in the report are energy, telecommunications, transport, waste and water.

The report suggests that there are a number of areas where changes to the operation of sectoral regulators could have a real and positive impact on cost competitiveness.

The Report owes its genesis to Section 41A of Industrial Relations Act 1946 (inserted by Section 11 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012) which provides that reviews of each JLC be carried out by the Labour Court, as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Act, and at least once every 5 years thereafter. The review assisted the Labour Court's  deliberations as to whether any JLC should be abolished, maintained in its current form, amalgamated with another JLC or its establishment order amended and the Labour Court is required to make recommendations to me to this effect.  <\/p><p>  I have accepted the recommendations contained in the Report.<\/p><p>  In publishing the Report and outlining the legal steps necessary for implementation of the Labour Court's recommendations, I have been particularly mindful of issues arising as a result of the recent Supreme Court ruling in relation to Registered Employment Agreements (the <i>McGowan <\/i> case).<\/p><p>  With the exception of the Agriculture JLC, implementation of the recommendations regarding the scope of the other nine JLCs will be given effect by way of Ministerial Order. As the Agricultural Workers JLC was established under primary legislation (the Industrial Relations Act 1976), an amendment to the Establishment Order requires amending primary legislation. I anticipate that the Establishment Orders necessary to give effect to the recommendations regarding the other nine JLCs will be made over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  At the conclusion of this process there will be eight JLCs remaining - and this will drop to seven when the legislation required to implement the recommendation relating to the Catering JLCs is enacted - leaving slightly over half the number that operated at the beginning of the reform process which I pursued on coming to Office. This latest development sits squarely within the context of the change required to improve Ireland's competitiveness by enhancing wage flexibility while also ensuring protection for vulnerable workers.<\/p><p>  The Industrial Relations Acts provide the legislative framework within which JLCs are established and function, including provisions in relation to the formulation and confirmation of Employment Regulation Orders.

The zero hour protection applies to all employees whose contract operates to require them to be available whether they work on a casual basis or not.  <\/p><p>  This feature of the legislation covers situations where, for example, an employee is sent home if things are quiet or is requested to be available for work and is not, on the day, asked to work.  Where an employee suffers a loss by not working hours he\/she was requested to work or be available to work, the zero hours provisions of the Act ensure that he\/she is compensated for 25% of the time which he\/she is required to be available or 15 hours whichever is the lesser.  The level of compensation may be impacted if the employee got some work.  An expectation of work does not, however, entitle an employee to compensation.<\/p><p>  The zero hours provision does not apply to lay-offs, short-time, emergency or exceptional circumstances, employee illness, employee on-call or where the employee is paid wages for making him\/herself available for work.<\/p><p>  Section 17 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 sets out the requirements regarding notification to the employee of the times at which he\/she will be required to work during the week. Generally, an employee is entitled to 24 hours' notice of his\/her roster for the week, although section 17(4) allows for changes as a result of unforeseen circumstances.<\/p><p>  Section 19 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 sets out an employee's entitlement to paid annual leave equal to 4 working weeks in a leave year in which he or she works at least 1,365 hours (unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment) or one-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works at least 117 hours or 8 per cent of the hours he or she works in a leave year (but subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks).<\/p><p>Zero hour contracts are covered by contract law.  A zero hour contract must be entered into freely between the employer and the employee - it cannot be forced upon an employee.  Zero hour contracts are, normally found in sectors such as retail, healthcare and hospitality. I am very conscious that in<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>certain circumstances, they may be of great benefit to<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>  both employers and employees.  They allow greater flexibility for both, reducing the employer's pay costs, while workers can decide when and if they want to work.  Such contracts may be preferred by employees who require flexibility to facilitate educational or other personal requirements and banning such contracts could do a disservice to these workers. However this is an area I will keep under review.  <\/p><p>  The deputy may have noted that recent recommendation of the Labour Court concerning home helps employed by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  This recommendation has been accepted by both sides as a binding recommendation of the Court. The HSE is proceeding to give effect to the recommendation, which will result in the region of 10,000 home helps receiving annualised hours contracts from the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000048#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Part-Time Job Incentive Scheme","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000048#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[42723\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000048#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on the fact that part-time employment is accounting for a very significant proportion of new jobs being created in the economy; the way firms can be encouraged to take on more full time employees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>Employment is now increasing across many sectors and occupations, both in full-time and in part-time employments. The latest information from the Quarterly National Household Survey shows an annual increase in employment of 1.8% or 33,800 in the year to the second quarter of 2013, bringing total employment to 1,869,900. This compares with a decrease of 1.3% in the year to Q2 2012. The QNHS data shows that the increase in total employment of 33,800 in the year to Q2 2013 was represented by an increase in full-time employment of 21,600 (+1.5%) and an increase in part-time employment of 12,100 (+2.8%).<\/p><p>  The signs of recovery in employment - and especially in the creation of more full-time jobs - are supported by the job creation figures of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland for their client companies in 2012. Ireland's enterprise development agency client companies cumulatively created nearly 9,000 net jobs in 2012. Total permanent full-time employment in agency-assisted companies operating in all sectors amounted to 294,785 in 2012, a net increase of 8,975 jobs (+3.1 per cent) on employment levels in 2011 and continues the trend of positive growth in employment following three consecutive years of employment losses between 2007 and 2010. <\/p><p>  Total full-time employment among Irish-owned companies amounted to 144,964 in 2012, an increase of 3,228 jobs (+2.3 per cent) on the previous year. Among foreign-owned companies, total full-time employment amounted to 149,821 in 2012, an increase of 5,747 (+4 per cent) on the previous year. Foreign-owned part-time employment also increased, by almost 600 jobs (+3.4 per cent) in 2012, whilst Irish-owned part-time employment levels increased marginally.<\/p><p>  The data from the enterprise agencies confirm that the vast majority of the additional jobs in grant-assisted companies were full-time jobs. We are seeing a pattern as we come out of the recession where initially the first signs of recovery were reflected in an increase exclusively in part time employment. Although job losses continue to be experienced in declining sectors such as construction, the positive results from the enterprise development agencies in 2012 underscores the merits of the Government's focus on innovation and export-driven sectors under the Action Plan for Jobs to create employment.<\/p><p>  In 2012, the total net full time jobs created in CEB assisted companies was 256 while the total net part time jobs created in CEB assisted companies was 769. <\/p><p>The Government incentives which we are putting in place are very much geared towards creating full-time employment rather than part-time employment.    is a new employer incentive which encourages and rewards employers who recruit jobseekers on the Live Register to fill full-time positions. The Action Plan for Jobs identifies a number of key targeted sectors in the Manufacturing and Services areas with the potential to create significant sustainable employment. The Action Plan identifies the challenges facing each sector and sets out the measures required to ensure these sectors achieve their potential. Ensuring that all of the measures in the 2013 Action Plan - and in the Action Plans for subsequent years - are implemented will provide the best means of ensuring that employment opportunities are maximised in each sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000048#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":74,"content":"<p>Question No. 30 answered with Question No. 28.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000048#WRB01450"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[42704\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000048#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will indicate based on the experience of the past two and a half years, the extent to which he expects innovation and technology to play a significant part in the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new job opportunities in future years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>Innovation and technology are key aspects of employment across most sectors.

Enterprise development agencies, Enterprise Ireland (EI), IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a spectrum of innovation and science\/ technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which sustainable employment will grow and expand. <\/p><p>  The importance of innovation to Ireland has been well recognised by the Government as being crucial to growth in both our indigenous and FDI sectors. It was most encouraging to see that the European Commission's Innovation Union Scoreboard, published in spring 2013, shows Ireland retaining its position among those EU Member States with above average performance in their research and innovation systems. Moreover, the European Commission 'Indicator of Innovation Output', announced in September 2013, shows Ireland, along with Sweden, Germany and Luxembourg as EU Member States getting the most out of innovation.<\/p><p>  IBM's Global Location Trends Report of 2012 places Ireland: <\/p><p>- 1<sup>st<\/sup>   in the world for inward investment by quality and value. <\/p><p>- 1<sup>st<\/sup>   in Europe for jobs created in Research and Development. <\/p><p>- 1<sup>st<\/sup>   in Europe for investment in the pharmaceutical sector. <\/p><p>- 2<sup>nd<\/sup> in Europe and 4<sup>th<\/sup>   globally for the number of investment jobs per capita. <\/p><p>  In addition, improvements have taken place in Ireland's cost competitiveness, reflected in the fact that, in 2013, Ireland's international competitiveness ranking improved 3 places from 20<sup>th<\/sup> in 2011, to 17<sup>th<\/sup> in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook for 2013, published past May.

In this way, implementation of Research Prioritisation, underway since March 2012, will see the majority of public research funding aligned with 14 priority areas where we are most likely to get economic and societal returns, particularly in the form of jobs. Another key initiative is the adoption of an Intellectual Property Protocol, which outlines a clear, robust and industry friendly policy for the commercialisation of IP arising from state funded research. As result of this, the central Technology Transfer Office ('cTTO') is currently being established. The aim of the cTTO is to encourage the commercialisation of IP arising from State funded research, with a view to achieving more job creation from our investment in this area. Furthermore, the remit of Science Foundation Ireland has been expanded to cover applied research, aligned with the 14 priority areas to further support the development of research findings into commercial opportunities, further enhancing our job creation potential. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000048#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":78,"content":"<p>Question No. 32 answered with Question No. 19.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Data","counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000049#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":81,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[42583\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000049#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of jobs that were promoted by the Industrial Development Agency that require foreign language skills to a fluent or native speaker level.","asker":"959","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":82,"content":"<p>The Forfas Annual Employment survey, which reports on job gains and losses in the enterprise development agencies does not track the language skills requirements of employees in individual companies nor their level of fluency in a foreign language.<\/p><p>  Research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills has identified foreign language skills as a key skill requirement for enterprise, trade and export performance, which includes the foreign owned multinational sector.<\/p><p>  In some cases the requirement is for native language speakers, due to the nature of the job\/function.

This has resulted in a very comprehensive analysis, with a new Manufacturing Strategy finalised by Forfas and published earlier this year. <\/p><p>  The <i>Action Plan for Jobs<\/i>   process has been shared with relevant parties in Northern Ireland.  In addition, I am glad to say that there is positive on-going engagement between my Department's enterprise agencies and their Northern Ireland counterparts.  Both sets of agencies are aware of each other's offerings and they collaborate closely, where appropriate, on schemes and programmes that will result in job creation and growth.<\/p><p>  From my own perspective, in relation to North South cooperation, I attend meetings in the Trade and Business development sectoral format of the North South Ministerial Council and, also, of the North South Plenary, which are hosted by either the Taoiseach or the First and Deputy First Ministers. At these meetings there is full engagement with Northern Ministers, and particularly at the sectoral meetings, where I have direct discussions with my NI counterpart, Ms Arlene Foster MLA, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, on a wide range of business issues of mutual interest including job creation generally and specifically in manufacturing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000049#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000049#WRC01350"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[42570\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000049#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on whether the programmes and initiatives run by both the Industrial Development Agency and Enterprise Ireland are now overlapping in a significant manner, thus diminishing their capabilities to conduct their work both here and abroad; if discussions have taken place regarding the pooling of resources to enhance job creation here and a potential merger of the two organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are both enterprise development agencies operating under the aegis of my Department.

Generally speaking the PPS numbers concerned are those that were historically assigned to a female spouse on marriage by adding the letter 'W' to her husband's PPS number, and<b><\/b>  were not actively in use for tax purposes.  The issue does not affect 'W' numbers that were active for tax purposes.<\/p><p>  The deduction at source payment method for Local Property Tax (LPT), which commenced in July 2013, operates by Revenue advising the Department of Social Protection of the individual deductions via electronic file transfer.  The individual case data is transferred between the Revenue and DSP computer systems and is downloaded exactly as provided by the taxpayer.  Revenue cannot validate the accuracy of the information provided, including the status of the PPS number quoted, in advance of the electronic file transfer.  A problem is identified only when a transaction fails, in which case the Department of Social Protection notifies Revenue, which in turn makes contact with the taxpayer. <\/p><p>  I note the Deputy's suggestion that Revenue should make reference on the LPT Return to the possibility of old style PPS numbers being invalid.  While this is not possible for 2013 and 2014, Revenue will consider it in the future, having regard to the scale of the problem.  In the meantime the LPT Frequently Asked Questions will be updated on the Revenue website with information and clarification on the issue. <\/p><p>  On the specific case outlined by the Deputy in Question No. [42927], I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person in question selected a number of different payment options when completing the LPT Return.  This delayed the initial processing of the Return while the LPT team attempted to clarify with her which option she preferred.  Unfortunately, Revenue was not aware that the person's spouse was recently deceased and arranged deduction at source from a Department of Social Protection pension, using the PPS number quoted, leading to the problem outlined above.  In the intervening period, and prior to Revenue making contact with the person, a family member contacted LPT Branch and indicated that the person wanted to change her payment method to a service provider. The LPT team member immediately set up the new payment method as requested.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, notwithstanding the delays in setting up a satisfactory payment option, the onus is still on the person to ensure the full LPT liability for 2013 is paid by 31 December 2013.

It is an employer demand-driven programme aimed at developing the skills of the apprentice to meet the needs of industry and the labour market.<\/p><p>  In recent years, the impact of the economic downturn has led to a collapse in demand for apprentices from employers, particularly in construction related trades.  Significant numbers of apprentices have also been made redundant before completion of their training.   <\/p><p>  While demand for a number of apprenticeship trades is not expected to recover to pre- recession levels, employment opportunities may emerge in other sectors of the economy not currently covered by the current apprenticeship scheme. <\/p><p>  Under the Government's Action Plan for Jobs my Department is committed to carrying out a review of the apprenticeship system in 2013.<\/p><p>  This review is being carried out in order to provide a modern 21st century, realistic and flexible Irish Apprenticeship System, reflective of the relevant skills requirements of industry both in the public and private sectors and potential apprentices including young unemployed jobseekers. <\/p><p>  The review of the Apprenticeship System is being undertaken in two phases, the first being the preparation of a background issues paper, and the second a public consultation process - which is being managed by an independent group appointed in May 2013.

The annual decreases in employment recorded were in the 20-24 (-2,100 or -1.7%) and the 25-34 (-11,900 or -2.3%) age groups. <\/p><p>  While a decrease in employment is always a cause for concern, the results for these two age cohorts have to be viewed in the light of three critical factors. First, the increased rate of young persons staying on longer in education; secondly, increased emigration; and thirdly, the overall demographic decline for these two cohorts.  It may also be noted that while  the numbers employed in these two cohorts declined over the twelve month period, both age groups experienced small increases in the numbers employed between quarter 1 and quarter 2 of 2013 (by 3.2% and 0.4% respectively).  <\/p><p>The Government's approach to tackling the issue of jobs growth and unemployment is through the twin strategies deriving from the <i>Action Plan for Jobs<\/i> and <i>Pathways to Work<\/i>  .  The primary strategy to tackle all forms of unemployment, including youth unemployment, is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth. Past experience suggests that youth unemployment, which tends to rise relatively rapidly in a downturn, can be expected to fall relatively rapidly during the recovery. In addition to this economic growth and competitiveness strategy there are a number of programmes and services to assist unemployed persons and keep jobseekers close to the labour market. With limited exceptions, these approaches are not age-specific - they are available to all unemployed people on the same basis.<\/p><p>The 2013 <i>Action Plan for Jobs <\/i>  contains a total of 333 actions for delivery across all Government Departments and 46 State agencies. Among the measures being delivered are:<\/p><p><i>- JobsPlus<\/i>  , a scheme to provide regular cash payments to employers to offset wage costs where they employ people who have been on the Live Register for over 12 months;<\/p><p>  - the roll-out of 31 Local Enterprise Offices across the country, a network of first-stop shops to deliver world-class services to start-ups and micro-businesses in every county in the country;<\/p><p>  - a new &euro;175 million Seed and Venture Capital Scheme, aimed at leveraging private sector funds to provide a total of &euro;700million in funding to high-growth Irish companies with the potential to grow employment, as well as mentoring and networks;<\/p><p>  - a National Step Change Initiative for manufacturing businesses, as part of the Government's plan to supply 20,000 additional jobs in the sector.<\/p><p><i>Pathways to Work 2013<\/i>  , the Government's 50-point action plan to fight long-term unemployment builds on the progress made over the past year by the Government to tackle the unemployment challenge.  Increasingly, the Department of Social Protection's referrals  for  job-search assistance and guidance is based on profiling people at the beginning of a spell of unemployment, so as to focus resources on those most in need at an early stage.  <\/p><p>During our recent EU Presidency, Ireland succeeded in achieving agreement among  Member States on the introduction of a Youth Guarantee. This agreement provides that Member States <i>&#8220;should<\/i><i>ensure that all young people under the age of 25 years receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a period of four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.&#8221;<\/i>   The Department of Social Protection has primary responsibility for implementing the Youth Guarantee in Ireland. An interdepartmental Group chaired by the Department of Social Protection has been established and includes representation from my Department.

That Report, in 2001, concluded that, because of high costs and limited potential industrial development returns, membership should not be a priority.  Since then, of course, the severely depleted resources which this Government inherited has meant that there is an even greater imperative to ensure that publicly funded research and development will yield the maximum benefits for the country - most particularly in terms of downstream jobs.<br \/><br \/>  As you are no doubt aware, the Government's priority in the area of science, technology and innovation is to implement the recommendations of the National Research Prioritisation Exercise which will see the majority of public research funding aligned with 14 priority areas where we are most likely to get economic and social returns, particularly in the form of jobs.  The Steering Group which undertook the exercise included representatives of the enterprise sector and its terms of reference specifically required that it take account of complementary developments at EU level and other international initiatives.  Research in the area of particle physics was not identified as a priority nor was there any recommendation that Ireland should join CERN. <br \/><br \/>  The costs of full membership of CERN are understood to be over &euro;10 million per annum.  In addition to substantial fees for any type of membership, it is important to note that significant extra amounts of expenditure would be necessitated in order to ensure that Ireland benefits fully from membership. While other associate membership options may be available involving lesser amounts, the issue remains that a decision about joining CERN must take into consideration the opportunity costs involved, as payment of any fees would mean that less funding is available for our existing research priorities.  <br \/><br \/>  Should budgetary circumstances change over the next few years, the question of membership of CERN could be reviewed again but only if there is a compelling business case from a cost\/benefit viewpoint.  Also, the selected national research priority areas will be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure their continued relevance and to also ensure that new opportunities are identified.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000056#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Numbers","counter":254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000056#WRK00950"},{"type":"question","counter":255,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[42799\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000056#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of jobs created in County Kerry and throughout the country to date; the areas in which these jobs have been created; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":256,"content":"<p>The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey reports on job gains in companies that are supported by the enterprise development agencies.

There is no data available on a month to month or county basis for each of these sectors in the survey.<\/p><p>Please see the following table setting out the breakdown of Job gains and losses as requested.<\/p><p>While manufacturing has been an important sector in Ireland since the 1960&rsquo;s, there has been a noticeable decline in numbers employed in this sector. This is not necessarily surprising, and it echoes what has been happening in most developed economies. A similar trend has also been experienced in other industrialised countries such as Germany, UK, USA, Netherlands and Korea. We still have 205,000 directly employed in manufacturing here and, when account is taken of indirect employment that means about 400,000 depend on manufacturing for a livelihood.  This impressive statistic highlighted the need for action.<\/p><p>Hence the initiation by me of two research projects -  Forf&aacute;s's <i>&quot;Making it happen Manufacturing 2020<\/i>&quot; and &quot;<i>The Future Skills Needs of the Manufacturing Sector to 2020<\/i> &quot; published by the Expert Group on Future Skills.  Both of these reports complement each other and will assist Government in reaching the target of creating an additional 20,000 jobs in manufacturing by 2016.<\/p><p>The <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2012<\/i>   also included a series of actions for the Manufacturing Sector and noted that Ireland is well positioned to exploit the advances in manufacturing technology, and to build and maintain a strong base of manufacturing activity. Ireland currently has a very diverse range of manufacturing businesses with many exciting and innovative companies in high-technology and emerging sectors.  We are well placed to take advantage of our current position to build on this expertise in both the FDI and indigenous companies.<\/p><p>The <i>2013 Action Plan for Jobs <\/i>also<i> <\/i>outlines a range of sectoral initiatives to facilitate new and established companies grow in the Services sector with particular focus on International Financial Services, Business Process Outsourcing\/Shared Services, Education Services, Retail and Wholesale, Tourism, Construction Services and ICT Services.<\/p><p>In respect of the contribution of innovation and technology to job creation in these sectors, my Department, and the relevant State Agencies under its remit, have a clear and steady focus on the potential and opportunities that exist and can be created by prioritising innovation as a key driver of success. Enterprise development agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a spectrum of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which sustainable employment will grow and expand.  It is not possible to separate out the precise contribution of innovation and technology elements from other factors.<\/p><p>All of our businesses face similar Competitiveness issues including the manufacturing and services sector.  It is clear that, arising from greater globalisation, reduction of tariff barriers and the ease of transporting goods, the nature of industry and the location of specialisations will be changing.  There will be an inevitable movement of production of lower cost, less specialised goods towards cheaper labour economies, e.g. in Asia.  This is part of a wider global pattern.<\/p><p>Last year, I requested Forf&aacute;s to undertake research into a number of factors impacting on Ireland's international competitiveness, to benchmark these factors and to develop proposals to systematically reduce excessive key business costs or delays.<\/p><p>That wider Forf&aacute;s research indicates that in the period between January 2000 and April 2008, Ireland suffered a 22.5% loss in competitiveness.  However, in the period from April 2008 to July 2012, Irish cost competitiveness improved by 19% as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices. Prices have now fallen back to levels last seen in 2002. The research benchmarks Ireland&rsquo;s performance against a number of our key trading partners, as well as the OECD and Euro area averages.  Positive trends are emerging in relation to some key cost factors, including Labour costs, where our labour cost competitiveness continues to improve; Construction and new rental costs, which have fallen significantly since the collapse of the property bubble; and the cost of most business services, which have fallen to, or below, 2006 levels.<\/p><p>The numbers employed in manufacturing have stabilised over the last two years.  It is noteworthy that exports of manufactured goods are continuing to rise despite a difficult environment.

Foreign owned firms contribute substantially to Ireland's exports, jobs, expenditure in the Irish economy and to Exchequer funds.  FDI plays a key role in stimulating the development of new sectors in Ireland, in enhancing our research, development and innovation performance, in contributing to balanced regional development and in accelerating the achievement of critical mass within sectors.<\/p><p>  At the end of 2012, there were 152,785 people employed in over 1,000 IDA Ireland client companies.  This, in turn, results in another 100,000 spin off jobs in the Irish economy.  The net effect is that 1 in 7 Jobs in the Irish economy is accounted for by FDI.<\/p><p>  There are a number of factors which are considered by potential investors before deciding to locate here. These include:<\/p><p>- A pro-business and technologically advanced environment;<\/p><p>- An attractive corporate tax rate;<\/p><p>- An educated and talented workforce;<\/p><p>- A blend of appropriate skill sets;<\/p><p>- Access to world class infrastructure - road access to key cities, ports and international airports;<\/p><p>- a range of affordable, state-of-the-art property solutions;<\/p><p>- a track record of success coupled with the right attitude and ambition of its people.<\/p><p>  In seeking to win FDI, IDA Ireland constantly promotes the availability of these factors to potential investors.  Indeed, Ireland's performance in attracting FDI has been recognised internationally and these international comparisons are impressive.  The 2012 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook and IBM's Global Location Trends Report for 2012<b><\/b> have classified some of Ireland's strengths, with Ireland ranked:<\/p><p>- 1<sup>st<\/sup> in the world for availability of skilled labour, flexibility of workforce, investment incentives and attitudes towards globalisation;<\/p><p>- 1<sup>st<\/sup> in the world for inward investment by quality and value;<\/p><p>- 1<sup>st<\/sup> in Europe for jobs created in Research and Development;<\/p><p>- 1st in Europe for investment in the pharmaceutical sector;<\/p><p>- 2<sup>nd<\/sup> in Europe and 4<sup>th<\/sup> globally for the number of investment jobs per capita; and<\/p><p>- 4th for corporate tax rates.  <\/p><p>  Amid significant economic challenges globally and locally, IDA Ireland achieved a strong FDI performance in 2012.  There were 145 individual investments, with over 40% from companies coming to Ireland for the first time. 12,722 gross job gains were generated with 6,570 net new jobs gains across a broad range of sectors.  Helping FDI clients to transform their operations within Ireland has also led to a significant reduction in employment losses, producing a strong year overall.<\/p><p>  Despite this success, Ireland faces a highly competitive landscape, with notable strong competition for FDI arising from the UK, the Netherlands and Switzerland, in particular.  Nevertheless, IDA Ireland's performance in the first 6 months of 2013 has been solid with 70 FDI investments, with potential to create in the region of 7,000 jobs being secured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000057#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Provision","counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000057#WRL00350"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[42940\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000057#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which he and his Department continue to have dialogue with the educational level sector at second and third level with a view to meeting the educational requirements of the workplace in a more specific fashion in view of the regularly expressed concerns to the need for a more dedicated approach to the market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These studies were in response to the Government's focus on addressing challenges facing the manufacturing sector in Ireland and targeting specific actions in support of the sector.  The EGFSN assessed the skills and competencies needed by the sector in the report.  A further expansion of the Springboard initiative this year includes a focus on programmes for jobseekers in skills areas in manufacturing -for example, engineers in validation, polymer, supply chain and automation, and polymer and plastics technicians.  F&Aacute;S in conjunction with the third level education sector is developing a range of initiatives which are designed to meet the skills identified at pre-craft, craft and technician levels.

The unemployment rate for young people fell from 33% to 29.6% over the same period.  This downward movement in youth unemployment in Ireland differs from the trend in the EU as a whole, where youth unemployment has continued to rise.  However, youth unemployment continues to present a major challenge for Ireland as it does for most other EU Member States. <\/p><p>  The latest CSO figures also indicate that the long term unemployment rate is also showing some signs of improvement, having decreased from 9.2% to 8.1% over the year to Q2 2013, a drop of 24,500 people.  Long term unemployment now accounts for 58.2% of total unemployment, compared with 61.8% a year ago.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity through the Action Plan for Jobs.  In addition, the Government recognises the need for measures to support the unemployed and keep jobseekers close to the labour market.  In this context, the major elements of the Government&rsquo;s response are set out in Pathways to Work, which is aimed at ensuring that as many as possible of the job vacancies that are created as the economy recovers are filled by people from the Live Register - with a particular focus on those who are long-term unemployed or at risk of long-term unemployment.  <\/p><p>  Pathways to Work has a target of moving 75,000 people into employment by the end of 2015 through programmes such as JobBridge, Springboard, Momentum and the ICT Action Plan, which are delivered by the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills.  The JobsPlus initiative, which encourages employers to recruit people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more, was also launched on 8th July last.  <\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection is also working with relevant Departments, including my own, to produce a concrete plan for implementation of the Youth Guarantee in Ireland, for consideration by the Government before being transmitted to the European Commission by the end of the year.  <\/p><p>  My Department is also keen to support young entrepreneurs and, in this context, initiatives such as Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Start Fund and New Frontiers Programme, along with the Microenterprise Loan Fund, will all contribute to supporting young entrepreneurs.

Innovation and technology are elements of a series of inputs which are requisite for a job to be sustained in commercial enterprise &ndash; companies need to identify markets to sell their goods and services, they need to have finance in order to invest in capital and human resources, they need to put in place the delivery and production capacity which meets their customers&rsquo; needs and they need to focus on the development of new and improved products, processes and services which can ably compete in international markets.  <\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises must be able to competitively differentiate themselves in global markets so that they can win sales and create sustainable employment.  A critical element of the Government&rsquo;s strategy is to provide supports to help companies to grow global sales and local employment through the most important economic differentiator; innovation.  My Department and the State Agencies under its remit are focused on the development and support of internationally trading manufacturing and services firms in Ireland in this regard.  The Action Plan for Jobs emphasises the significance of innovation and the use of technology as critical drivers of job creation in Ireland while seeking to maximise their impact in the coming years. Substantial ongoing investment has been made in Ireland&rsquo;s national innovation ecosystem and in the supports that build the innovative capability in Irish enterprise.  In tandem with this approach it is recognised that substantial international expertise and important sources of non-exchequer funding are available via EU research initiatives. <\/p><p>  The Seventh EU Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP7), with a budget of &euro;55 billion for the period 2007 to 2013, is the EU&rsquo;s main instrument for funding research and development in Europe. FP7 offers Ireland's SMEs, multinationals, and research institutions valuable opportunities to participate in high-calibre research collaborations with our European counterparts. Enterprise Ireland is the Irish agency responsible for helping Irish companies and third level researchers to participate in FP7.  <\/p><p>  The most recent statistics available from the European Commission show that the total amount of funding received from FP7 to date by Irish research organisations and companies is &euro;572 million.  We are therefore well on track to achieve the target amount of funding from FP7 of &euro;600 million. This funding has provided a considerable increase in the innovative capability of Irish academics and industry over and above existing exchequer investments in this area.  <\/p><p>  The innovation, technology and financial support from the European Commission to Irish research organisations, including companies, ultimately results in more sustainable jobs and leads to business expansion and increased job creation over the long term.

Full details and statistics are available in the annual reports published by the Pensions Ombudsman.<\/p><p>  I understand that there have been 611 determinations made by the Pensions Ombudsman since the establishment of his Office in 2003.  To date, there have been 9 appeals against determinations of the Pensions Ombudsman and none of these appeals have been successful.  Five determinations are currently the subject of High Court proceedings.  I further understand that the total legal costs of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman over the past five years was just under &euro;349,000, which includes the cost of prosecutions taken by the Office against persons failing to furnish information.  Legal costs have been awarded to the Pensions Ombudsman in all successful cases and are remitted directly to the State.<\/p><p>  The Pensions Ombudsman is independent and impartial in the exercise of his statutory functions.  The services of the Pensions Ombudsman are free and available to everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000058#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000058#WRM01050"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[42856\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000058#WRM01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the support or assistance that will be provided by her Department to citizens who have availed of early retirement or redundancy schemes in which the scheme has specifically indicated that the citizen will begin to receive a State pension from the age of 65 years but who will not now be entitled to receive any State pension until they reach 66 years of age due to recent changes to the State pension scheme.","asker":"1020","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, the Government decided to increase State pension age in three separate stages.

The Department is currently examining the operation of all its services in the context of the Pathways to Work commitments and the development of Intreo services nationally.  The Pathways to Work Programme represents a significant reform in the social welfare system and highlighted the need for the Department to focus its resources on the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance to unemployed people.  The Department is intensifying its level of engagement with the unemployed, in particular, those who are, or become, long-term unemployed.   The new Intreo service offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers, a model which is currently being rolled out across the country.  It is expected that three hundred staff will be redeployed to activation work from within the Department&rsquo;s existing resources by the end of the year.<\/p><p>  Overall, this is resulting in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices, which will provide a full range of services,  including the CWS and these will,  in general, be available in one location.  While there has been no closure of local or branch offices in the last two years, some 300 CWS clinics across the country have been re-structured during 2012 and 2013 as well as a small number of former F&Aacute;S offices.  This included offices where limited weekly CWS public clinics were held, in some cases for only one to two hours per week.<\/p><p>  Where the community welfare service has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service.  In general, this means that the frequency of available public clinics will be increased.  The staffing needs for all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department and that the services provided are reconstituted, where necessary, to meet the changing needs of Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000060#WRO00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Remuneration","counter":337,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000060#WRO00550"},{"type":"question","counter":338,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[43401\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000060#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of public servants in her Department that are being paid in excess of the Taoiseach's salary and in excess of the Government's pay cap; the annual cost of these excess payments over the past five years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The position is that, following on from the successful restructuring of my Department&rsquo;s local office network, which reduced the number of local offices from 58 to 16, my Department has decided to centralise the administrative support currently provided in the local offices into two offices, Cavan and Portlaoise. <\/p><p>  The decision to centralise the administrative support is based on a review by the Department of the business processes and procedures and, in particular, the administrative support requirements, in its remaining Local Offices. Arising from this review, the Department introduced a number of significant changes earlier this year to the procedures in relation to the implementation of controls in the context of the TB eradication programme. These changes and, in particular, the decision not to take up passports from restricted herds and to abolish the movement permit requirement for clear cattle in restricted herds, combined with the eradication of Brucellosis and a substantial reduction in the incidence of TB in the country, has significantly reduced the administrative staffing requirement in the local offices. In light of these developments, the review concluded that further significant efficiencies in terms of the number of administrative staff required will accrue from the centralisation of administrative support in one or more centralised office(s).<\/p><p>  My Department is in the process of implementing this recommendation and has already transferred the administrative functions out of a number of local offices, including Clonakilty, Limerick and Tipperary.  The transfer of the administrative functions out of other regional offices, including Roscommon, will be considered in light of the availability of opportunities to redeploy the staff concerned to support other critical public services.<\/p><p>  Centralising administrative procedures will enable my Department to reduce the number of administrative staff it requires to support Veterinary Office operations and, accordingly, the cost of providing its services. This is in line with Government policy. In addition, the centralisation of administrative functions will facilitate the re-deployment of staff from the regional offices to other State agencies and, thereby, enable the Government to provide services through these agencies more efficiently. <\/p><p>  I would like to emphasise that the centralisation of the administrative functions of the local offices should not negatively impact upon local access and services for local customers and experience to-date indicates that there has been no negative impact on the services provided by these offices. The Department vets, inspectors and technical officers will remain in place at these offices to service our clients across all of the schemes that are provided from our Regional Offices.  In view of this, I am satisfied that frontline services will be fully maintained and public access for all of the Departments stakeholders will continue to be available at the 16 regional offices, including Roscommon. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000066#WRU01600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":490,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000066#WRU01700"},{"type":"question","counter":491,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[42893\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101000066#WRU01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a person (details supplied) has had a deduction taken off their area based payment following on from their land being digitized.

My Department is bound, under EU Regulations, to maintain the accuracy the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), which underpins the processing of applications under these Schemes as well as REPS and AEOS.<\/p><p>  At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter.  In that letter, farmers are reminded to examine each map carefully and to identify and exclude from their application all ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes etc. included in the land parcels.  There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate.  These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers at the commencement of the application period each year.  In view of the size and structure of farm enterprises in Ireland, farmers are fully aware of all of the non-eligible areas of their holdings.<\/p><p>  In addition to any changes submitted by farmers, in order to insure the integrity of the LPIS, and in line with the EU conditions governing the payment of funds, my Department continuously reviews the eligibility of lands claimed by farmers for the Single Payment Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes.<\/p><p>  In line with this position, all lands claimed under Direct Payment Schemes in respect of the 2009 &ndash; 2012 scheme years are currently subject to ongoing review for eligibility purposes.  As this work is ongoing, it is not possible to give a county by country breakdown at the present time.  As a result of this phase of this review, payments made to farmers in respect of claimed areas, which were found to be ineligible, must be reimbursed. In such circumstances, farmers are advised that they can either refund the over-payment directly to my Department, or, alternatively, the overpayment can be recouped from their next payment(s) due from my Department.  Such reviews can only be undertaken when up-to-date imagery becomes available to my Department.  During the cross-checks undertaken it is necessary to verify that the ineligible feature (e.g. a house) was in existence in the years when over-claims of eligible areas are established.  Where ineligible features are identified, farmers are issued with maps of the re-digitised land parcel and are advised of the right of appeal. <\/p><p>  Applicants will be entitled to have their case reviewed by submitting their appeal on the form provided by my Department.  If they are not satisfied with the outcome of the review, they can appeal their case to the independent chaired Land Eligibility Appeals Committee.

Budget 2013 saw the extension of key reliefs that were already in place for young new entrants (such as the 100% relief from Stamp Duty and the 100% stock relief for Young Trained Farmers).  The Deputy will also be aware that changes were made to retirement relief in Budget 2012 to encourage inter-generational land transfers.  It should also be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT).  This means that farms worth up to &euro;2.25 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.<\/p><p>In addition, a new restructuring relief was announced in the 2013 budget.  Re-structuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land.  An EU Commission study found that &lsquo;<i>younger [farm] managers tend to perform better than the EU average, with 46% more area and 57% more economic potential for 21% more labour force.&rsquo; <\/i>.

A number of actions have been initiated in this regard.  These include the establishment by me of a Ministerial task force to deliver substantial improvements in delayed discharges, including a review of the operational arrangements associated with the &lsquo;Fair Deal&rsquo; scheme.  Senior personnel have been tasked with improving cross hospital-community process issues, focusing first on the &lsquo;longest waiting&rsquo; delayed discharges (&amp;gt;100 days).  The aim is to remove all local barriers to discharge and identify those matters which require action at a national level.  The management teams have been making good progress with respect to these tasks and it is intended to quickly roll-out this structure to all areas.  <\/p><p>  The HSE increased allocations of Fair Deal approvals, temporarily prioritised Fair Deal referrals for patients in acute hospitals, including referrals to  long stay facilities from acute hospitals for older persons with complex needs and also targeted appropriate homecare packages for older persons in acute hospitals experiencing significant delayed discharges.

A HSE web-based database that allows tracking at patient level (on an anonymous basis) is in the implementation phase in a number of hospital sites.  In addition, the categorisation of reasons for delay has been reviewed.  The data captured through the web-based system will facilitate revised metrics for each hospital.
