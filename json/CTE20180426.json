The response has been submitted and I believe it deals with the queries raised the last day.  The document is available but we did not discuss it.  We can note and publish it.

The last paragraph of the letter refers to having two people in procurement, one of whom is a temporary clerical officer, in an organisation of that size with a budget of approximately &euro;95 million as being completely inadequate.

If it is the case that there is a shortage of staff and difficulty with information technology systems and so on then this is a problem.  To be fair to this education and training board, those responsible have pointed it out to us and they have flagged that there is concern from their perspective.

I am pleased we have got the report.<\/p> <p>  The first thing to say is that the report is heavily redacted.  We do not have full information.  Several things strike me when reading the report.  This is an audit report into a section 38 organisation.  It chimes with similar reports we have seen of organisations that have had similar problems and where many red flags have been raised.  Cheques have been pre-signed and HSE funds have been used to fund staff gifts and gratuities.  There are issues relating to management of conflicts of interest.  Over &euro;100,000 was spent on a building where there was no certainty about the organisation owning the building.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding all these failures, if we are to call them failures - and that is being generous &ndash; the response from the organisation was phenomenal.  I have read the audit report.  Those responsible throw their hands up in the air in astonishment that there is even an investigation or examination of these issues taking place.  The previous chief executive, who was the Accounting Officer at the time, said that she knew nothing about the audit being carried out.<\/p><p>The arrogance of the organisation in how it responded to the issues is alarming, particularly in view of the fact that it gets a very substantial amount of funding from the taxpayer.  I ask that this issue be dealt with as part of our work programme.  We have been here before far too many times.  We raised this issue when the Comptroller and Auditor General was present at a meeting a number of weeks ago and he helpfully pointed out that this was a look-back at a specific period and that changes have been made since.  The report covers the period from 2010 to 2014.  Since then, this committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General's office have shone a spotlight on section 38 organisations.  We have had the HSE director general before us.  When I read the audit report and the response from very high-ranking people within the organisation, I was concerned.  I am not convinced that the type of changes we have been led to believe have been made in these organisations have actually been embedded.  I do not think we should just note this report and move on.  It is an internal audit report in which sections are colour coded in white, yellow and red to characterise the seriousness of the issues that are raised.  There is an awful lot of red here.  Red flags are being raised for us and it is our job to pay attention to them.  I am asking that we bring the HSE in again and, if necessary, the current CEO of the hospice at some point.  We should put this on our work programme and give it serious consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#B01000","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The Deputy is absolutely correct in everything he says and we will do what he requests.  Essentially, the response is unsatisfactory from the committee's point of view.  We wrote asking for copies of a report and the organisation responded by pointing to reports that it had already published on foot of freedom of information, FOI, requests.  Those reports, by the way, are heavily redacted.  We have received nothing of significance that is not already in the public arena.  We will ask again because those involved must accept that the Committee of Public Accounts is entitled to a little more information than that made available to any individual under FOI legislation.  We have been treated as if we are just ordinary citizens requesting a copy of a particular document.  The response is unsatisfactory.  We will also ask the organisation to reconsider the report and the redactions because the request is coming from this committee, not from an individual citizen.  We will hold this over for now.  We should not dignify the response by publishing something that has already been published under FOI.<\/p> <p>  Are we agreed that we should write to the organisation again, requesting a more detailed response, minus the redactions?

At our meeting on 29 March 2018, we agreed to request further information on the university&rsquo;s 2016 financial statements.  Information is provided on the Cork University Foundation and on procurement.  It is good that the university has agreed to provide information on the foundation and to supply copies of its financial statements.  However, when one looks at the document that was submitted, one sees that is a copy of Cork University Foundation's \"abridged\" financial statements.  We have only partial financial statements here and have not received the full financial statements.  I have looked at the documents supplied.  A balance sheet is attached but it contains no details of any income or expenditure whatsoever.  I note that at the end of the year, the foundation had cash in hand of &euro;3.588 million.  We will thank the university for the information received because it is a big step in the right direction to get the foundation accounts.

How do we know that if information on the indirect costs associated with PPPs is not even being compiled?  The statement is very broad, with no substance behind it.

In terms of judicial reviews, while one cannot stop them from happening, one can minimise their effects by making sure one's processes are really robust.<\/p><p>We might have information after the event in many different locations.  It is like buying a house; one is an expert on how to buy a house after one has bought one but one does not get a second chance to do it in most cases.  I do not see in this apart from the comments in the note from Arthur Cox anything to suggest we are unlikely to see more of this.  How do we ensure value for money if the process leave us open to judicial reviews?  I do not see the learning from those reviews.  It would almost be better to have an expert if we are going to do PPPs who could go around the country to proof them against each other as far as is possible.  I am sure we can take learning from other countries on how they do this but I am not satisfied with a scenario where something will happen because there is a change in environment.  We need to examine the process in this regard.  The cost of judicial reviews has to be built into the overall cost of the projects because it will all come out of the public purse in any event.  We need to catch issues before they get to the point where there is a failure in the process.<\/p><p> I am not sure I get the point in respect of the liquidation of Carillion Construction Limited on the bottom of the second page.

We asked them to leave during the previous meeting and when they returned, due to the paucity of information and lack of post-project reviews, we made it abundantly clear on the day that we would not complete our work until we received all the necessary information and we would return to that.  We have made a point of not signing off any appropriation account this year that has a PPP element until we get satisfactory answers.  The committee has started down a road that nobody else has been able to travel or has been prevented from travelling previously.  However, we are going there.<\/p> <p>  On Carillion and the schools, as Deputy Catherine Murphy said, the Sammon Group has other school contracts, which it was not awarded through the PPP process, but it had to go into administration because of the fallout from the Carillion issue.  That has affected many schools it was working on outside of the Carillion contract.  We hope they will all be sorted out satisfactorily.  Whether it is a PPP contract or a traditional contract, there are direct costs but in both cases, the Department has to bear associated costs and we have been unable to compare them or separate them.  We have a bit of a road to travel.  Mr. Walsh will appear before the committee at the beginning of May regarding his own Department's Vote.  This is too big a topic to lump in with that.  Responsibility for PPPs extends beyond the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  While we might refer to it in passing with Mr. Walsh, PPPs are a big topic that no public body or the Oireachtas has been able to get behind up to now.

It states there is an additional requirement on the Department and various agencies to give reasons a tender was unsuccessful.  That has not been addressed in his note.  Private companies are not interested anymore in the public sector, according to the briefing note.  We are told there has been a marked change in the behaviour of bidders who are now less reliant on the public sector for business and can as a result be more selective in terms of tendering for new business.  I would love to come back to that interesting comment.  The briefing note further states, \"They are now also much more aware of, and willing, to enforce their legal rights\", as if there was something wrong with that.  They are entitled to enforce their legal rights.  The obligation is on the agency awarding the tender to make sure all the laws are complied with.

However, we should also remind Mr. Watt that the issue under discussion at the time was public private partnerships.

While we must be fair to Mr. Watt, we should also remind him that he should have had more information at his disposal on the day.  Deputy Connolly is correct that the Accounting Officer's letter is helpful in the sense that he agreed at the meeting to publish the project reviews.

Professor O'Shea, at the end of his letter, states that the funding to support the annual &euro;60,000 investment in Cork Opera House is sourced from the university's \"own sources of income\", for example, non-Exchequer income.  If there is one issue that the committee nailed in its report on how money was being spent by universities and colleges, it was this mishmash whereby colleges argued that they could isolate income they received from other sources and use it for specific projects.  If taxpayers' money was not being provided to the colleges in the first instance, they would not be in a position to generate non-Exchequer income.  As such, the taxpayer is paying for the majority of this annual payment of &euro;60,000.<\/p> <p>  Given that we discussed this practice in detail previously, I will not bore members by doing so again.  However, this case is another example of the practice and it shows that UCC, my alma mater, has not learned from what took place in this committee.  Regardless of whether this is a good investment, for University College Cork to maintain that the &euro;60,000 it spends annually on Cork Opera House is from its own sources of income is an insult to the committee given what we decided on this matter.

I will just give a very short context on why I think this is important.  If we get follow-up information, that will allow us to make a decision next week.  It relates to the CervicalCheck audit that was carried out.  That resulted in 15 women being identified in 2014 as having a misdiagnosis.  My difficulty is that the doctors were not compelled to tell the women of the cancer test errors.  That is a clear breach of process and a system failure.  Our job here is to look at systems, processes and procedures.  There was a High Court judgment yesterday involving a very significant award.  I think it was the subcontractor who had to pay the damages but there may be costs for the State.  We do not know.<\/p> <p>  First, there was a clear breach in process where there was a misdiagnosis.  Second, a circular was sent stating that clinicians should use their judgment in individual cases where it is clear that discussion of the outcomes of the review could do more harm than good.  I find that extraordinary.  We had an examination of the issues surrounding the Grace case for exactly the same reasons, namely, process and procedure failures.  There could be a cost and I imagine there will be a cost to the State.  I do not suggest that we do any work on it because I am aware that there may be a role for the sectoral committee, but could we write to the Department and to CervicalCheck to get as much information as possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#H02300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>And to the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#H02400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Yes, and the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#H02500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I wish to add to that.  To my mind, this clearly is a systems failure.  The tragedy of it is that if things do not happen in the appropriate timeframe, which appears to be the case, the disease progresses quickly.  The key thing with cervical cancer is the three, six and nine years.  In young women in particular it tends to be aggressive and not to be diagnosed early.  I booked an additional check myself this morning.  It is very important that people have confidence in the system.  If there is a lack of confidence, there is no point in the State rolling out large sums of money on vaccination against HPV if on the other side there is a problem with the physical check in this case.  From a financial point of view, which is the remit of this committee, it is questionable to have the State rolling out vaccination but then testing not being adequate or not showing up disease.  In this case the lady is terminally ill and no amount of money will undo the situation for her and her family and for the many other women this morning who are stressed out about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#H02600","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I echo those points because there is a very human side to the current situation.

In the first instance, the information must be gathered, but if we are to do it, it may well be that the appropriate time falls within the space where we will consider the tardiness of the move towards open disclosure and, as a consequence, the huge amounts that are expended on legal costs.

Mr. McCarthy is not here, but I want to be clear that at next week's meeting we want to receive a list of all of the organisations which have not yet submitted accounts to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2017.  The deadline for their receipt was the end of March.  We wrote to all organisations in December and want to see a big improvement in the number of accounts received.  We are here to ensure public accountability and the first step in that process is the production of financial statements.  The second is the auditing of those statements.  We are not interfering in that process.  However, the first duty of the boards of organisations is to ensure the accounts are sent to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  Before the meeting next week we need a full list of the organisations which have not yet submitted accounts for audit.  We have actually given them a month's grace because they were due to be submitted by the end of March.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will carry out the audit.  We are proposing to invite up to ten of the organisations that have not submitted accounts to a committee session.  It will be short, with perhaps one speaker for each of the organisations represented to explain why they had not complied with their statutory duties.  We will require the assistance of the Comptroller and Auditor General to rate the organisations in terms of turnover, as it is most likely that we will invite the bigger organisations.  I am aware that most of the really big organisations have probably complied with their statutory duties, but there are many middle-sized organisations that might not have done so.  It would be useful, therefore, to receive some indication of the turnover of each organisation for the previous year in order to ensure the organisations we invite are reasonably substantial and people know about them.  At next week's meeting we hope to set a date for a meeting with those organisations, but we would appreciate it if a list could be provided in order that invitations could be sent and that the organisations were put on public notice.  Does that make sense?  Mr. Harkness is obviously ticking off each organisation as the accounts come in.  I am not saying the organisations have sent fully completed financial statements, but once something has been lodged, at least the ball is rolling.  We want to focus on those organisations that have not yet submitted anything.  Mr. Harkness or Mr. McCarthy can check with the committee during the week, if necessary.  There is no point in dealing with organisations which have not yet submitted accounts for last year as we accept that it will be months before the audit process is complete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#K01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524729600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>The committee went into private session at 10.35 a.m. and resumed in public session at 11 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Committee of Public Accounts Annual Report 2017","time":1524729600,"counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#N00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>In its private session the committee has approved its annual report for 2017, which will be published early next week and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.

This includes the Irish Probation Service, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, the Office of the State Pathologist, the Garda Ombudsman Commission and many others.  An overview of the main funded services and agencies is given in a summary diagram attached to this statement.<\/p> <p>  Members will also be aware that, in 2016, Vote 24 was one of eight Votes that made up the justice group.  The others were the Votes for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service, the Courts Service, the Property Registration Authority, the Valuation Office, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, and the Policing Authority.  These were all areas for which the Department had policy and legislative responsibility, but which are funded and accounted for separately.<\/p> <p>  Since 2016, there have been a number of significant changes in the organisational landscape of the justice group.  For example, responsibility for the Charities Regulatory Authority transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Rural and Community Development in 2017.  The Votes for the Property Registration Authority and the Valuation Office transferred to the housing, planning and local government Vote group in 2018.  The 2016 appropriation account for Vote 24 records gross expenditure of almost &euro;390 million in the year, spread across five spending programmes, as indicated in the figures provided.  More detail on the composition of the respective programmes can be seen in note 3 to the appropriation account.<\/p> <p>  On the receipts side, appropriations in aid of the Vote totalled almost &euro;65 million in 2016.  Almost three quarters of this related to a range of fees charged in respect of immigration registration, nationality and citizenship certification and visa issuance.  For the Vote as a whole, there was a net underspend of &euro;25.5 million relative to the Estimate provision for 2016.  This surplus was liable for surrender.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General was satisfied, following the audit, that the account properly presents the transactions on the Vote during 2016.  He drew attention, however, in the audit report to certain concerns around the development by the Department of a number of information and communications technology, or ICT, projects.<\/p> <p>  The Department provides ICT support services for many functional areas and for agencies within the Vote group.  Between 2012 and 2016, its activity in this regard included projects for three of the agencies it grant funds: a case management system for the Insolvency Service of Ireland; a reporting and registration system for the Charities Regulatory Authority; and an online licence renewal system for the Private Security Authority.  The Department had incurred direct project costs of around &euro;4.6 million to the end of March 2017 on these projects, with &euro;3.6 million of this relating to the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  Functional gaps remain in the systems developed for the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the Charities Regulatory Authority.  Both organisations are in the process of procuring replacement systems from the marketplace.<\/p> <p>  Our examination found that the projects, which were different in scale, complexity and background, had a number of shortcomings in relation to planning and oversight.  The report includes recommendations in relation to strengthening the Department&rsquo;s systems and procedures in the areas of business case development, adoption and monitoring of project budgets, and project governance.  The Accounting Officer accepted all the recommendations and will be able to brief the committee on their implementation.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the audit of the appropriation account also drew attention to non-effective expenditure of &euro;3.89 million in relation to the fit-out and rent of a property leased for the Probation Service in 2008.  Due to planning restrictions, the property could not be used for the purposes for which it was acquired, and the Department could not find an alternative use for the premises.  Legal proceedings in relation to the lease were settled in late 2016.  A summary of the events leading to the settlement is presented in note 6.8 of the account.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 2012 about the problems with the lease.<\/p><p>The previous Committee of Public Accounts sought to examine the matter on foot of his report but could not proceed at the time because of the legal proceedings.<\/p><p> Finally, the Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention in the audit report to non-competitive procurement of goods and services to the value of &euro;6.1 million disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Harkness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Harkness.

It is important to note at the outset that the Department fully accepts the recommendations in the report and there is now in place a much stronger governance structure than when the projects in question commenced.  The largest project mentioned in the Insolvency Service of Ireland started over five years ago and was completed in 2016 at a cost of &euro;3.6 million.  The context in which this was achieved was, by any standard, unprecedented.  The establishment of the new service was a top troika priority and was monitored weekly at the time by the Government and the Cabinet committee on mortgage arrears as well as by the troika in their regular reviews.  The Department was given the task of setting up the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, and the director designate was appointed in November 2012 while work continued on the draft legislation going through the Oireachtas.  Given the state of national indebtedness, this was a core deliverable in the troika agreement and, obviously, an ICT system would be required in order that this commitment could deliver on its mandate.  This was achieved in very pressurised circumstances and the ISI opened its doors in September 2013.  While key staff were still in the process of being recruited, the Department's ICT division has engaged in respect of the development on an urgent basis of an online case management system.  Because of the need to deliver the system quickly, a decision was taken to develop it in-house within the existing Lotus Notes environment.  This was undertaken by the Department's own IT team with support from contractors under established contracts.  While the case management system, the OCMS, is sometimes described as a single project, it is in fact an extensive and complex system which supports several elements linked to the personal insolvency infrastructure introduced by the 2012 Act.  It comprises two websites and three separate elements: the interface with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and registration of practitioners; the interface with the Courts Service, which is unique and groundbreaking and works well; and the case management system itself.  Various developments in the legislative structure meant the requirements were somewhat difficult to define, which contributed to the complexities of the system design and implementation.  Nevertheless, it was recognised in an external review we commissioned in 2016 that the hard work and co-operation by the joint project team resulted in the initial application going live on day one, as required, in September 2013.<\/p> <p>  It is accepted that difficulties emerged in the project for a period after this, which led to the then Secretary General putting in place strengthened governance arrangements, including the appointment of an experienced external chair and a new project board from February 2015.  It is also acknowledged that there are ongoing shortcomings within the existing system, particularly the level of manual intervention required as well as gaps in the management information and reporting needs of the service.  In the past year, the ISI, with support and oversight from the Department and the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, has gone to the market for a new system, and I understand that procurement process is now nearing conclusion.  By the time this is implemented, the existing ICT system will have been operational for approximately five years and will have been depreciated in full.  As Accounting Officer, I continue to work towards strengthening controls and implementing both internal and external audit recommendations.  In addition to the strengthening of the project management and governance arrangements, we are undertaking a comprehensive risk assessment across all aspects of ICT operations.  A further ongoing audit is reviewing the controls in place in a representative number of the bodies and agencies and how these organisations link back to the central ICT shared service.  The outcome of these audits will assist us in further strengthening the controls and management of the function across the Department.<\/p> <p>  Turning to other matters in Vote 24, members may recall that my predecessor provided an update to the committee last May on the leased premises on Wolfe Tone Street, which was procured in 2008 for use by the Probation Service.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General's office has pointed out, this was the subject of legal proceedings which were concluded in late 2016.  This is now reflected in the 2016 appropriation account.  It was previously the subject of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2011 report.  The central issue in this case was assurance provided by the vendor in respect of planning permission for the premises.  In his 2011 report, the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined that it was reasonable for the Department to rely on the legal advice provided in respect of the planning permission.  The total cost in respect of this matter, including the legal settlement in 2016, was &euro;3.89 million.  The settlement was based on strong legal advice and resulted in closure of the matter, thus avoiding any further costs accruing to the State.  The Department relied on legal advice at all times in respect of this matter.<\/p> <p>  Throughout 2016, the Department was also implementing its programme for change arising from the 2014 Toland report.  Over the past four years, we have focused on measures to strengthen our revised culture and identify and embed behavioural change.  All of this is supported by robust governance frameworks, revised management processes and formal agreements with the relevant agencies of the Department.  We continue to review and update these with a view to driving further improvement in the processes.  In 2017 the management board decided it would be timely to review progress on the implementation of the programme and engaged external experts to do this in a rigorous and independent manner.  That report was published earlier this year and it identified that significant progress has been made and also where more has to be done.  The board agreed with the analysis, which reflects its own view and feedback from staff across the Department.  I circulated details of the progress being made, and this is also published in more detail on the Department's website, so I will not detain the committee with that.<\/p> <p>  Arrangements for the governance of agencies, which is a particular focus, have been formalised and strengthened.  At the end of 2017, framework agreements were in place with 23 agencies.  These are all published on our website.  The process of updating and renewing annual oversight agreements for 2018 has begun and, again, these will be published when agreed.  Seven have been published to date this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh McPhillips"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Can we get this up on the screen properly?

It is also reassuring that the review found no evidence of any failure to comply with orders from the tribunal.  It is of course a matter of concern that emails were not located as part of the discovery process, and we are putting new measures in place that are aimed at ensuring that an oversight of this kind cannot happen in future.  These new measures include the use of specialist consultants, where needed, for discovery and the establishment of a separate unit to interact with tribunals and commissions.  There is also a Civil Service-wide initiative under way in respect of electronic file management which will help to ensure that electronic documents can more easily be associated with relevant files.

I am not trying to catch anyone out but my issue here is whether there was concern within the Department.  I asked parliamentary questions on this, as did others, and the report came through in January.  The Committee on Justice and Equality discussed this yesterday.  An IT audit report will come before this committee in the future.  I believe that this will require an external investigation on the scale of the projects, the tendering or lack thereof, the verbal sign-off on contracts, the volume of people on site in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the manner in which those people were allowed access on site.  I believe there are issues here on taxpayers' money, security, and tendering-procurement across the board.  A report is coming through on that.  As the overseeing Department, I want to know if the Department of Justice and Equality had any concern on this issue.  The witnesses have clarified that.  We will deal with that in due course and take on board what Ms McPhillips said.<\/p> <p>  I turn to other issues.  On taxpayers' money, and I will not encroach on the tribunal, the Department made a decision to sign off verbally on funding for the Charleton tribunal and for the Charleton liaison committee.

I thank the Deputy.  The main learning concerned business cases on budgets.  The Deputy will note from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that there was no business case or specific budget ring-fenced for the development of the ISI project.  That cannot happen now, so all projects that go to the governance group must have a business case and a budget line.  The governance group then monitors progress.  If there were any drift in terms of expenditure going beyond the allocated budget, that would be noted by governance in the course of the development of the project.<\/p> <p>  The other major development in respect of governance is the ongoing monitoring, as I said, but also the post-implementation review.  We go back and do a \"lessons learned\" and see whether it is achieving the things it set out in its business case that it would achieve.  That is the main thing.  I know the Deputy was not here earlier, but the other thing about governance is that the membership of the group has been refreshed and there are now two external members who have a great deal of expertise in their own organisations.  There is a principal officer from Revenue, the former head of ICT in one of our agencies, and the Property Registration Authority which, again, no more than Revenue, has a very large ICT responsibility.  We also refresh the representative of an agency from time to time.  The current representative is the head of the Charities Regulator.

As things stand, there are 15 cases in which the women concerned lack capacity.  This brings me to the developments in relation to the Magdalen scheme.  The Ombudsman issued a report last November which was critical in some respects of the operation of the scheme.  He made a number of recommendations, two of which are being dealt with by a recently appointed senior counsel, Ms Mary O'Toole SC.  She is looking at how best to address the issue of the 15 women who lack capacity.  She is also looking at cases where the assessed duration of stay was lower than that originally claimed by an applicant with the result that the award was reduced.

Ms O'Toole has suggested that rather than to give a general recommendation on how we deal with capacity issues overall, she has suggested that she should make recommendations on each of the individual cases.  I do not think we will be standing in her way in respect of that.<\/p> <p>  To stay on the issue of capacity as the Deputy has raised it, there were three routes we were looking at to deal with these cases.  We have no desire to hang onto the money which is properly the property of the women concerned.  The original intention was to use the assisted decision-making legislation, but there have been delays there which mean the necessary regulations and processes will not be in place until next year.  As such, that approach is not really possible.  The next route is the wards of court process, but it is a very significant decision in respect of any person to make him or her a ward of court.  The third route is one we have been exploring with the HSE which is the possibility of using the private property accounts scheme whereby the money belonging to each woman would be held by the HSE and disbursed to her according to need.  We cannot, obviously, predict what recommendation will be made by Ms O'Toole, but it seems the principal route will remain the ward of court procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#W00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Dowling"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":615,"content":"<p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was enacted in 2015.

The figure under that heading is &euro;3.89 million.  Non-effective expenditure in lay man's terms is a waste of taxpayer's money.  It is the polite way of saying a waste of taxpayer's money.  Effectively the Comptroller and Auditor General's report contains a paragraph which says that &euro;3.89 million of taxpayer's money was wasted.  It is one of the most egregious wastes of taxpayer's money that this committee has seen in that there was no value for the taxpayer when it was all over.  Despite the reports that were done in 2011, this committee is far less satisfied on this topic now than at any other stage.  We want a complete report on this from the Department.

The amendment is being proposed on foot of legal advice to bring additional clarity to section 8 to provide that the relevant activity is required to be authorised by the Environmental Protection Agency and that the person required under the regulations to hold a licence or registration for that purpose shall make such an application.  For the same reason, the Government is proposing amendment No. 7 which involves the deletion of the words &quot;which requires authorisation pursuant to regulations made under section 30(1) or 30(2) shall apply&quot; and their replacement with &quot;which, pursuant to regulations made under section 30(1) or (2), requires authorisation and who is required by those regulations to be a registered person or a licensee in respect of the relevant activity, shall make an application&quot;.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Government is proposing amendment No. 8 which involves the deletion of lines 32 to 39, inclusive, on page 11 of the Bill and their substitution with the following:<\/p><blockquote>(2)(a) Subject to paragraph (b), where the Agency receives an application referred to in subsection (1), the Agency shall decide, based on its regulatory experience and taking into account&mdash;(i) the magnitude of expected or potential doses of radiation, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) the complexity of the relevant activity to which the application relates,whether it is registration or a licence which would be appropriate to be granted in respect of the relevant activity concerned.<br \/><br \/>(b) The Minister may, in regulations made under section 30(1) or (2), provide in respect of a relevant activity that only a licence may be granted and, where provision is so made, the Agency shall, where it receives an application referred to in subsection (1) in respect of the relevant activity, consider the application on the basis that only a licence would be appropriate to be granted in respect of that relevant activity.<\/blockquote> <p>The amendment adds a new subsection (2)(b) to section 29A of the Radiological Protection Act 1991 which provides that the Minister may prescribe that certain activities be subject to licence only.  Certain practices are not appropriate to the new registration system owing to the associated inherent risk.  There are also certain activities which are required to be licensed under European legislation such as certain activities using high activity sealed sources.  The amendment is necessary to ensure the Minister can provide in secondary legislation for parameters and strictures to ensure safety will be paramount in the authorisation of relevant activities and to respond effectively to the future development of practices and use of radiation sources in industry.  The Government is also proposing amendment No. 9 which involves the deletion of the words &quot;made under&quot; on lines 6 and 7 of page 12 and their substitution with the words &quot;referred to in&quot;.  The amendment is being proposed on foot of legal advice to provide a correct reference.<\/p><p>I would also like to set out the position on amendments Nos. 11 and 12 which are being proposed by the Government.  Amendment No. 11 is a drafting amendment which involves the deletion of &quot;periodically.&quot; and its substitution with &ldquo;periodically.&quot;.&quot;.  The extra full stop is necessary to indicate the end of the section.  Amendment No. 12 which involves the deletion of lines 22 to 29 on page 12 of the Bill is being proposed on foot of legal advice.  The purpose of section 8 of the Bill is to give the Minister the necessary powers to make regulations to provide for a graded approach to authorisation and enable the transposition of certain requirements in Council Directive 2013\/59\/EURATOM which is known as the basic safety standards directive.  As the Bill is not the transposing instrument for the directive, the subsection is beyond the scope of this legislation.  Subsection (6), as drafted, transposes Article 27 of the basic safety standards directive.  Our legal advice is that this provision is more appropriate to the transposing instrument - the regulations made under section 30(1) and (2) of the 1991 Act.  The subsection, as drafted, is also misleading because it does not represent an exhaustive list of activities which require authorisation before they may be carried out.  There are other practices that are required to be authorised on foot of other directives such as the importation or exportation for disposal of radioactive waste from the State to another country under Council Directive 2011\/70\/EURATOM which established a Community framework for the responsible and safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste.  There may also be other activities and practices that should fall under this requirement and be considered in the context of the regulations made under section 30(1) and (2) of the 1991 Act.<\/p><p>On section 9 of the Bill, the Government is proposing amendment No. 14 on foot of legal advice.  The amendment involves the deletion of lines 7 to 16 on page 13 of the Bill and their substitution with a new paragraph 3 with the following text:<\/p><blockquote>(3) A relevant activity in respect of which registration or a licence is granted may be carried out in accordance with the registration or licence, as the case may be, from the date on which the particulars referred to in subsection (2) are entered in the register of registered relevant activities or the register of registered licensed activities, as appropriate.<\/blockquote> <p>The amendment clarifies that the operative date from which a registration or licence will come into effect will be the date on which the particulars are entered in the appropriate register.<\/p><p>On section 10 of the Bill, the Government is proposing amendment No. 15 on foot of legal advice.  The amendment involves the deletion of all words from and including &quot;the&quot; where it firstly occurs on line 25 on page 13 of the Bill down to and including &quot;activities&quot; on line 26 and their substitution with &quot;a European act which relates to relevant activities&quot;.  The amendment provides that the Minister may make regulations to provide for cases in which European Acts provide for discretionary measures which would not fall under the definition of &quot;obligations imposed on the State&quot;.<\/p><p>The Government is also proposing amendments Nos. 17 to 21, inclusive, to section 10.  Amendment No. 17 involves the deletion of &quot;subsection (2)&quot; on line 38 of page 13 of the Bill and its replacement with &ldquo;subsection (2A)&quot;.  Amendment No. 18 involves the insertion of the words &quot;addition to those matters referred to in subsection (2A), in&quot; after the word &quot;In&quot; on line 40 of page 13 of the Bill.  Amendment No. 19 involves the deletion of the word &quot;under&quot; on line 29 of page 16 of the Bill and its replacement with the words &quot;referred to in&quot;.  Amendment No. 20 involves the deletion of lines 33 to 37, inclusive, on page 18 of the Bill and their replacement with &quot;(vii) the issuing by the Agency of a licence or of a certificate in respect of a registration, including the form and manner of such a licence or certificate, the manner (including by electronic means) in which it is to be issued and the information it is to contain,&quot;.  Amendment No. 21 involves the insertion of the words &quot;(within the meaning of section 2 of the Principal Act)&quot; after the word &quot;authorisation&quot; on line 34 of page 19 of the Bill.<\/p><p>These are drafting amendments on foot of legal advice to correct cross-references in the text.<\/p><p> On amendment No. 22, the Government proposes, in page 21, line 22, to delete \"(as amended by Part 1)\" and substitute \"(amended by Part 2)\".

One of our concerns is that we are not paying sufficient attention to the issue of radon gas and its effect on health.  The radiological protection agencies have a role in this regard.  I refer to the need for them to report to the Oireachtas to highlight the level of risk.  In particular, as will be seen in later amendments, there is a real concern regarding the lack of attention to mitigating this real risk in rental properties.  It is a risk which can be mitigated at relatively low cost and with significant effect.  As I stated, it is estimated that there are 200 related fatalities a year.  That is the equivalent of the number of road deaths.<\/p><p>It is a failing in the current system that we do not set high conditions on addressing that risk.  I understand it was recommended that such reporting mechanisms would be included in the responsibility of the radiological protection authorities, but that has not been provided for in the legislation.  That is the reason for the proposed insertion of this wording, the obligation &quot;to report annually to the Oireachtas on the implementation of the National Radon Control Strategy&quot;.  It is a hugely significant health issue.  We are not addressing it at present.  This is an opportunity to strengthen the reporting requirements and I hope the Government can support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#C01100","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1758,"content":"<p>I support the amendment from the Green Party.

The reality is that radon is responsible for between five and six deaths a week.  It is something I am conscious of because my own constituency is to the fore in this regard.  I have been deeply engaged with my officials on this issue.<\/p><p>The provision exists since 2002.  Many Ministers have gone through the Department since 2002 who have sat on their hands in respect of it.  At long last we are getting movement on it.  As I announced in the House on Second Stage, we are putting in place a pilot scheme specifically to see what will work in practical terms.  On foot of that, we will draft an amendment to the current flawed primary legislation from 2002 to put an effective scheme in place, not only for rental properties but for every affected property in the country.<\/p><p>I accept that not enough attention has been paid by my predecessors to the issue of radon gas.  That is why I was determined as Minister to address this issue once and for all.  On foot of this pilot scheme, once we see what will work on the ground, my intention is to amend the flawed legislation of 2002 and come back with robust legislation that can ensure we address this problem right across the board.<\/p><p>The Government opposes amendment No. 3 as the proposal for the Environmental Protection Agency to report annually to the Oireachtas on the implementation of the national radon control strategy or any successor strategy is not workable for both legal and practical reasons.  The national radon control strategy has not been established on a statutory basis and it follows that statutory reporting obligations cannot be imposed on something that has not been put on a statutory basis.  On a practical level, the proposed amendment is not workable as the implementation of the national radon control strategy is not the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The policy function for tackling radon rests with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The national radon control strategy, chaired by my Department, is a multi-agency approach in improving awareness of and protection from radon gas.  While the Environmental Protection Agency is an important cog in that wheel, it does not provide the chair or secretariat for the strategy implementation group and is not responsible for delivering on the action points in the strategy.<\/p><p>There are 31 identified action points set out in the national radon control strategy and it is intended that all action points will be implemented.  A total of 11 actions are complete, ten actions are on track for completion by next month, and ten further actions will be commenced and will be either completed beyond the strategy end in 2018 or carried out on an ongoing basis.  Key achievements to date include: the establishment and launch of a dedicated website, <i>www.radon.ie<\/i>; the completion and roll-out of targeted training courses on radon remediation for construction site staff, local authorities and contractors; and the establishment of a registration scheme for radon measurement services and radon remediation contractors.<\/p><p>One of the key recommendations made by the strategy relates to financial incentives to encourage householder action on radon.  A comprehensive radon testing and remediation survey will shortly be undertaken to assess the degree of uptake of radon testing and remediation in homes in high-risk radon areas and adjacent lower risk areas and to inform the detailed design of a new financial incentive scheme.<\/p><p>Due to the success of the work programme of the national radon control strategy, I intend to establish a successor strategy on a statutory basis to continue the good work in identifying and remediating radon where it occurs.  In light of the point that the Deputy has raised in his amendment, I will give consideration to how best to inform the Oireachtas Members on its good work as part of that process.<\/p><p>The reports of the current strategy and working group are published and publicly available.

It talks about multi-departmental responsibility and is long-winded and convoluted.  This is a straightforward issue.  There are maps.  The Minister correctly states there is a website.  The website tells us there are areas of concern, including Mountmellick, Ballylinan and Graiguecullen.  I would ask that some of those areas be included in the pilot project.  Other Deputies will identify areas in their constituencies, but those are three high-risk areas in County Laois that need to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  This is simple.  The question for us is whether every house, every new build and every extension is being fitted with radon barriers.<\/p><p>We need a testing system for homes to determine which homes have radon barriers in the high-risk red zones.  We do not want every house in the country tested.  In the towns that are high risk, such as Ballylynan and Mountmellick, we should ensure that tests can be done very easily to determine what is there and then we should put a scheme in place.  I do not want to hold up the discussion of the amendment.  It is a very good amendment.  We should have a short session dedicated to this.  It is all over the place and that is no disrespect to the Minister.  When everyone is involved, it is nobody's responsibility.  Radon is a serious issue and is killing people.

I was slightly confused because he said at the start it is not possible to accept this amendment because the radon strategy reports are not statutory and therefore we cannot have a statutory provision.  At the end he says he is willing to lay the reports he has to hand before the Oireachtas, which in a sense is exactly what we are looking to do with the amendment, to report annually.  I might come back on Report Stage to see if there are other examples where non-statutory reports are laid before the House on a statutory basis.  I do not see that as a reason why it cannot be done.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the various agencies and where the authority lies, my understanding is the key role of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is as the expert in identifying risk areas.  That is the significant information.  It is really important.  When we are aware, as Deputy Stanley says, of those red zones, then we really have to kick into action to make sure all houses - not just rental houses although there is a particular problem in those - including new builds are covered.  We are talking about taking action that will save five lives a week and prevent the huge trauma that comes with lung cancer that arises from proximity to these gases.  It can be alleviated at relatively low cost.  That is the really critical point.  It is not an impossible issue to address if one has good information. <\/p> <p>  I will return to the core point about providing the detailed analysis from the EPA or other agencies in a public way in order that landlords, homeowners, builders, public services and others will target the problem that exists.  I stand by the amendment.  I might come back on whether it is legally possible to have a statutory call to report on something that does not have a statutory provision.

It has really opened my eyes.  It was my intention to do as Deputy Stanley proposed and introduce a national scheme to deal with radon gas and I was determined to do it.  It has been kicked around for long enough.  We are talking about five or six deaths every week, never mind the number of people who end up in hospital and in treatment for this on top of that.  It is a huge drain on the resources of the State.  For small money we can have a massive impact on health outcomes in this country.  There is absolutely no argument on that.  I have spent the past 12 months trying to put a scheme in place but because of the legislation that was enacted in 2002, it is not possible for me to do that unless I amend the 2002 Act with a detailed scheme.  I have learned that by putting something into legislation it makes it more difficult to do the right thing.  That is why we are looking at a very tight and quick pilot to look at how a scheme would run effectively in order that we can come back, amend the legislation and bring forward a proper scheme to cover every home in the country, whether rental or owner occupied.<\/p> <p>  Following on from Deputy Eamon Ryan's point, the advice I have is I cannot put a statutory provision in this legislation.  As a result of my experience of the scheme that is already there, I am very slow to put in place a statutory provision that could complicate matters when getting this scheme up and running in the future.  There should not be any reason not to have a reporting structure in place.  I will not try to impede it.  I am quite willing to look at it again.  I am also quite willing to look at any suggestions or examples of where there is a statutory provision.  I have no difficulty providing the information.  It is not an issue.  I am committing, as Minister, that the information will be laid before the Oireachtas and will be circulated to members of the committee.  I have absolutely no problem if members want to come in and have a broader debate on the implementation of the radon strategy and go through it.  I have no difficulty with that.  I have a difficulty with writing it in black and white without a statutory footing in place.  That difficulty arises as a result of the legal advice I got and from my experience with the 2002 scheme, which is not fit for purpose and which is now creating a barrier to me implementing a scheme across the country. <\/p> <p>  To answer Deputy Ryan's question, the areas identified across the country are identified by the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI.  It has identified from geology where the red zones and amber zones are.  We will look at it again.  If the Deputies have suggestions I am quite happy to look at them.  The advice I have is I cannot write it into statute without a legal provision being there but I am quite willing and give a commitment here to circulate the reports when they become available.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#D00600","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1767,"content":"<p>How stands the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#D00700","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1768,"content":"<p>I will press the amendment and return to it on Report Stage.

New politics is all well and good but at the end of the day, we are legislators.  We are supposed to bringing forward legislation that is legally sound.  I just want to mark my disappointment in regard to that because I am someone who spent a long time on the Opposition benches and who spent a lot of time drafting amendments.  I am quite willing to accept, and I am open to, amendments and I have spoken to my officials in that regard.  However, I would appreciate some assistance from the Opposition to ensure that whatever legislation is brought forward is actually legally sound.<br\/><br\/>The Government opposes amendment No. 4 for both legal and policy reasons.  Paragraph (<i>h<\/i>) of section 8 of the principal Act assigns a function to the Environmental Protection Agency to make recommendations on pre-existing legislative proposals by Ministers for legislation that contains measures for the protection against radiological hazards.  The amendment as drafted is not workable as the Oireachtas as an entity does not make legislative proposals.  If the intent of the amendment is to extend the current function, in that the Environmental Protection Agency should make recommendations on Private Members' Bills initiated by Members of the Oireachtas, the Government would oppose this for the reason of policy and potential cost.<br\/><br\/>The policy function for the environment area, including radiological hazards, rests with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  While certain functions are delegated in legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency role is to inform and facilitate the Minister in his or her exercise of those functions.  The Minister is responsible for the formulation and implementation of radiological policy and is directly accountable to the Oireachtas in this regard.<br\/><br\/>It would not be appropriate for the Environmental Protection Agency to bypass the Minister and to make recommendations directly on Private Members' Bills.  Any recommendations by the Environmental Protection Agency need to be considered by the Minister in the wider context of Government policy and a proper assessment of potential regulatory and legal impacts provided by the Minister's Department.  As part of the legislative process, the Government's considered views on Private Members' Bills, as informed by expertise resident in the various Departments and agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, are conveyed by the Minister with functional responsibility for the area.  The Minister is then responsible and accountable for implementing any such legislation.<br\/><br\/>Any attempt to undermine or bypass a Minister's responsibility or accountability to the Oireachtas raises constitutional implications that would require detailed legal scrutiny.  Irrespective of the policy and potential constitutional issues that this amendment raises, there is no costing for the impact of this amendment on the Environmental Protection Agency budget and I am not convinced that this would represent a good use of its resources.<br\/><br\/>The Government opposes amendment No. 5.  Both the principle and the details are already for in section 7 of the principal Act.  Paragraph 1(<i>d<\/i>) assigns the general function to the Environmental Protection Agency to advise the Government, the Minister and other Ministers of the Government on radiological safety matters relating to the transport, use, storage, maintenance and disposal of radiation sources, wheresoever located.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 1(<i>c<\/i>) further assigns the general function to the Environmental Protection Agency to advise the Government, the Minister and other Ministers of the Government and the public on measures for the protection of individuals in the State from radiological hazards.  The function of the Environmental Protection Agency to advise the Government, the Minister and other Ministers of the Government on radiological safety matters is comprehensive and is not restricted by geographical location, type or purpose of the radiation source.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#D02400","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1785,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1786,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 5 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1787,"content":"<p>Section 5 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1788,"content":"<p>Sections 6 and 7 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1789,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1790,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<\/p><blockquote>In page 11, lines 22 to 24, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;which&rdquo; in line 22 down to and including &ldquo;apply&rdquo; in line 24 and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;which, pursuant to regulations made under section 30(1) or (2), requires authorisation and who is required by those regulations to be a registered person or a licensee in respect of the relevant activity, shall make an application&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#E00700","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1791,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1792,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 7:<\/p><blockquote>In page 11, lines 28 and 29, to delete &ldquo;which requires authorisation pursuant to regulations made under section 30(1) or 30(2) shall apply&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;which, pursuant to regulations made under section 30(1) or (2), requires authorisation and who is required by those regulations to be a registered person or a licensee in respect of the relevant activity, shall make an application&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#E00900","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1793,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1794,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 8, 12 and 13 are related.

People working in those professions believe it is crucial to the care and the service they provide.<\/p> <p>  It may be best to address it within the upcoming statutory instrument and not in primary legislation, but the Minister needs to take our concerns on board.

I am familiar with the chiropractors' situation, in particular, and have visited some of the chiropractors' surgeries and have seen the equipment and the investment they have made in that equipment and in training and upskilling themselves to use those machines.  It is a significant outlay for their practices.  I suppose there is a dichotomy in that there is a divergence between the Department of Health and the Minister's Department.  To be fair, the Minister's Department has been quite helpful in engaging on this and trying to make it work.  As Deputy Stanley said, it may be dealt with in the statutory instrument coming through from the Department of Health.  There needs to be a joined-up approach between the two Departments.  Maybe we should get the Department of Health on the same wavelength as the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p> <p>  Whatever way it is worked out, it seems unfair to have a set of practitioners who have access to, and have invested in, equipment  and who have been using it for many years as part of the service to their patients but to have a sort of drop dead approach where overnight, they are not allowed to use it anymore.  This needs to be looked at.  We are happy to take advice or to engage in consultation with the officials in terms of what is the best way to tackle this.

There is a lot of co-operation between my Department and the Department of Health on this.  We are on the same wavelength and we have agreement now that the EPA will be the lead agency from our Department and HIQA will be the lead agency from the Department of Health to agree the procedures and so forth that would be required in regard to this.<\/p> <p>  However, I revert back to the evidence the Chief Medical Officer gave to the health committee yesterday.  I have no function or role, nor can I have one, in deciding which professionals can use these.  It is not my responsibility to determine the education and training and capacity and capability of medical professionals to use this equipment.<\/p> <p>  What we have done in this legislation is to make it clearer, far more transparent, far more streamlined and easier for whatever health professional is going to use this equipment to get licences and to be able to use it.<\/p><p>We streamlined the process and made it far more transparent.  However, only the Department of Health can decide who may apply to use it in a health context.  We can do as much as we are able in that regard but, ultimately, only the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, with the advice of the chief medical officer, can declare which health professionals may utilise it.  One would not expect me, as Minister, to be decide upon such matters in respect of any other profession.  I do not have the necessary expertise in the area.  Most members would agree the Department is quite busy anyway without dealing with the health aspects of this issue.<\/p><p> I will read out my prepared reply, which may be helpful to Deputy Stanley.  I accept his point on this issue.  He is probably correct.  This is a discussion that must take place when the statutory instrument is ready.  It would probably make far more sense for a draft statutory instrument to be circulated first but that is a matter for the Minister for Health.  I will express that view to him on foot of our discussion here.  I give a commitment to relay, through my officials, to the Minister for Health that it would be helpful for the draft statutory instrument to be circulated in advance of it being signed.<\/p><p> The Government opposes this amendment as it requires the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to adjudicate on or consider matters that are beyond the competency of the agency.  The Environmental Protection Agency does not regulate the professional conduct or competence of professions and has no function in determining the levels of education or professional development necessary to carry out procedures using radiation sources.  Section 7(2) of the principal Act provides that the function of the Environmental Protection Agency in respect of the use of radioactive substances, materials or sources, radiation sources and radiation generators as a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic agent for the purpose of the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of any human ailment, infirmity, injury or defect is limited to the supervision and care of the radioactive substance, materials or sources, radiation sources and radiation generators concerned, as well as ensuring that the said radioactive substances, materials or sources, radiation sources and radiation generators are properly calibrated and maintained.  In short, the role of the Environmental Protection Agency is to regulate the equipment used in such practices and ensure it is fit for purpose.<\/p><p> I recall that Deputy Stanley raised the issue of chiropractors on Second Stage of the Bill and I remind him that the designation of competent practitioners for the purposes of carrying out medical procedures is a matter for the Minister for Health and beyond the scope of the Bill.

A concern has been raised by the Irish Association of Physicists in Medicine, which has great knowledge of these practices, in regard to registration being a permanent and once-off process without any subsequent checks, renewals or inspections.  Once a practitioner is registered, that is it.  In any circumstance, if a test must be met and a person does so but then no longer has to worry about it, it is easy for practices and standards to subsequently slip or compliance levels to fall.  The concern is that there is merit in requiring a renewal of the licence or registration or an audit, check or some kind of renewal process.  There was previously an EPA system for licence renewal but, if I am reading the legislation correctly, that will be dropped and the registration will be a one-off.  When the EPA was doing those licence checks, it was difficult for it to get evidence of compliance.  It seems somewhat paradoxical that we are taking away the requirement to look for evidence of compliance in a situation where sometimes there is difficulty in getting such evidence.  We are giving practitioners a free run in terms of there being once-off registration and that not having to be revisited or renewed when there has previously been difficulty in getting evidence of compliance.  I raise this in the context of the Bill and the registration process but it seems good practice that such registration would have to be renewed periodically or revisited.  I am interested in the Minister's views in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#F01900","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1820,"content":"<p>I see from where Deputy Lawless is coming but the legislation turns the practice in this area on its head.  The Bill provides for a single point at which one applies for a licence but there will be ongoing inspections in that regard.  There may have previously been issues with compliance but a different approach to regulation was taken until now.  We now have a graded approach relating to use and risk, which are assessed.  As I stated in reply to Deputy Stanley, a process will be agreed between the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the EPA in that regard.  One must remember that there is ongoing training, registration and monitoring of these professions.  We are discussing radiation, radiation sources and equipment, which will be addressed by ongoing inspection.  We are trying to get rid of unnecessary bureaucracy, which causes duplication.  Either one is competent to use this equipment or one is not.  The equipment and paperwork will be inspected on an ongoing basis.
