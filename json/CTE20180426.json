The response has been submitted and I believe it deals with the queries raised the last day.  The document is available but we did not discuss it.  We can note and publish it.

The last paragraph of the letter refers to having two people in procurement, one of whom is a temporary clerical officer, in an organisation of that size with a budget of approximately &euro;95 million as being completely inadequate.

If it is the case that there is a shortage of staff and difficulty with information technology systems and so on then this is a problem.  To be fair to this education and training board, those responsible have pointed it out to us and they have flagged that there is concern from their perspective.

I am pleased we have got the report.<\/p> <p>  The first thing to say is that the report is heavily redacted.  We do not have full information.  Several things strike me when reading the report.  This is an audit report into a section 38 organisation.  It chimes with similar reports we have seen of organisations that have had similar problems and where many red flags have been raised.  Cheques have been pre-signed and HSE funds have been used to fund staff gifts and gratuities.  There are issues relating to management of conflicts of interest.  Over &euro;100,000 was spent on a building where there was no certainty about the organisation owning the building.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding all these failures, if we are to call them failures - and that is being generous &ndash; the response from the organisation was phenomenal.  I have read the audit report.  Those responsible throw their hands up in the air in astonishment that there is even an investigation or examination of these issues taking place.  The previous chief executive, who was the Accounting Officer at the time, said that she knew nothing about the audit being carried out.<\/p><p>The arrogance of the organisation in how it responded to the issues is alarming, particularly in view of the fact that it gets a very substantial amount of funding from the taxpayer.  I ask that this issue be dealt with as part of our work programme.  We have been here before far too many times.  We raised this issue when the Comptroller and Auditor General was present at a meeting a number of weeks ago and he helpfully pointed out that this was a look-back at a specific period and that changes have been made since.  The report covers the period from 2010 to 2014.  Since then, this committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General's office have shone a spotlight on section 38 organisations.  We have had the HSE director general before us.  When I read the audit report and the response from very high-ranking people within the organisation, I was concerned.  I am not convinced that the type of changes we have been led to believe have been made in these organisations have actually been embedded.  I do not think we should just note this report and move on.  It is an internal audit report in which sections are colour coded in white, yellow and red to characterise the seriousness of the issues that are raised.  There is an awful lot of red here.  Red flags are being raised for us and it is our job to pay attention to them.  I am asking that we bring the HSE in again and, if necessary, the current CEO of the hospice at some point.  We should put this on our work programme and give it serious consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#B01000","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The Deputy is absolutely correct in everything he says and we will do what he requests.  Essentially, the response is unsatisfactory from the committee's point of view.  We wrote asking for copies of a report and the organisation responded by pointing to reports that it had already published on foot of freedom of information, FOI, requests.  Those reports, by the way, are heavily redacted.  We have received nothing of significance that is not already in the public arena.  We will ask again because those involved must accept that the Committee of Public Accounts is entitled to a little more information than that made available to any individual under FOI legislation.  We have been treated as if we are just ordinary citizens requesting a copy of a particular document.  The response is unsatisfactory.  We will also ask the organisation to reconsider the report and the redactions because the request is coming from this committee, not from an individual citizen.  We will hold this over for now.  We should not dignify the response by publishing something that has already been published under FOI.<\/p> <p>  Are we agreed that we should write to the organisation again, requesting a more detailed response, minus the redactions?

At our meeting on 29 March 2018, we agreed to request further information on the university&rsquo;s 2016 financial statements.  Information is provided on the Cork University Foundation and on procurement.  It is good that the university has agreed to provide information on the foundation and to supply copies of its financial statements.  However, when one looks at the document that was submitted, one sees that is a copy of Cork University Foundation's \"abridged\" financial statements.  We have only partial financial statements here and have not received the full financial statements.  I have looked at the documents supplied.  A balance sheet is attached but it contains no details of any income or expenditure whatsoever.  I note that at the end of the year, the foundation had cash in hand of &euro;3.588 million.  We will thank the university for the information received because it is a big step in the right direction to get the foundation accounts.

How do we know that if information on the indirect costs associated with PPPs is not even being compiled?  The statement is very broad, with no substance behind it.

In terms of judicial reviews, while one cannot stop them from happening, one can minimise their effects by making sure one's processes are really robust.<\/p><p>We might have information after the event in many different locations.  It is like buying a house; one is an expert on how to buy a house after one has bought one but one does not get a second chance to do it in most cases.  I do not see in this apart from the comments in the note from Arthur Cox anything to suggest we are unlikely to see more of this.  How do we ensure value for money if the process leave us open to judicial reviews?  I do not see the learning from those reviews.  It would almost be better to have an expert if we are going to do PPPs who could go around the country to proof them against each other as far as is possible.  I am sure we can take learning from other countries on how they do this but I am not satisfied with a scenario where something will happen because there is a change in environment.  We need to examine the process in this regard.  The cost of judicial reviews has to be built into the overall cost of the projects because it will all come out of the public purse in any event.  We need to catch issues before they get to the point where there is a failure in the process.<\/p><p> I am not sure I get the point in respect of the liquidation of Carillion Construction Limited on the bottom of the second page.

We asked them to leave during the previous meeting and when they returned, due to the paucity of information and lack of post-project reviews, we made it abundantly clear on the day that we would not complete our work until we received all the necessary information and we would return to that.  We have made a point of not signing off any appropriation account this year that has a PPP element until we get satisfactory answers.  The committee has started down a road that nobody else has been able to travel or has been prevented from travelling previously.  However, we are going there.<\/p> <p>  On Carillion and the schools, as Deputy Catherine Murphy said, the Sammon Group has other school contracts, which it was not awarded through the PPP process, but it had to go into administration because of the fallout from the Carillion issue.  That has affected many schools it was working on outside of the Carillion contract.  We hope they will all be sorted out satisfactorily.  Whether it is a PPP contract or a traditional contract, there are direct costs but in both cases, the Department has to bear associated costs and we have been unable to compare them or separate them.  We have a bit of a road to travel.  Mr. Walsh will appear before the committee at the beginning of May regarding his own Department's Vote.  This is too big a topic to lump in with that.  Responsibility for PPPs extends beyond the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  While we might refer to it in passing with Mr. Walsh, PPPs are a big topic that no public body or the Oireachtas has been able to get behind up to now.

It states there is an additional requirement on the Department and various agencies to give reasons a tender was unsuccessful.  That has not been addressed in his note.  Private companies are not interested anymore in the public sector, according to the briefing note.  We are told there has been a marked change in the behaviour of bidders who are now less reliant on the public sector for business and can as a result be more selective in terms of tendering for new business.  I would love to come back to that interesting comment.  The briefing note further states, \"They are now also much more aware of, and willing, to enforce their legal rights\", as if there was something wrong with that.  They are entitled to enforce their legal rights.  The obligation is on the agency awarding the tender to make sure all the laws are complied with.

However, we should also remind Mr. Watt that the issue under discussion at the time was public private partnerships.

While we must be fair to Mr. Watt, we should also remind him that he should have had more information at his disposal on the day.  Deputy Connolly is correct that the Accounting Officer's letter is helpful in the sense that he agreed at the meeting to publish the project reviews.

Professor O'Shea, at the end of his letter, states that the funding to support the annual &euro;60,000 investment in Cork Opera House is sourced from the university's \"own sources of income\", for example, non-Exchequer income.  If there is one issue that the committee nailed in its report on how money was being spent by universities and colleges, it was this mishmash whereby colleges argued that they could isolate income they received from other sources and use it for specific projects.  If taxpayers' money was not being provided to the colleges in the first instance, they would not be in a position to generate non-Exchequer income.  As such, the taxpayer is paying for the majority of this annual payment of &euro;60,000.<\/p> <p>  Given that we discussed this practice in detail previously, I will not bore members by doing so again.  However, this case is another example of the practice and it shows that UCC, my alma mater, has not learned from what took place in this committee.  Regardless of whether this is a good investment, for University College Cork to maintain that the &euro;60,000 it spends annually on Cork Opera House is from its own sources of income is an insult to the committee given what we decided on this matter.

I will just give a very short context on why I think this is important.  If we get follow-up information, that will allow us to make a decision next week.  It relates to the CervicalCheck audit that was carried out.  That resulted in 15 women being identified in 2014 as having a misdiagnosis.  My difficulty is that the doctors were not compelled to tell the women of the cancer test errors.  That is a clear breach of process and a system failure.  Our job here is to look at systems, processes and procedures.  There was a High Court judgment yesterday involving a very significant award.  I think it was the subcontractor who had to pay the damages but there may be costs for the State.  We do not know.<\/p> <p>  First, there was a clear breach in process where there was a misdiagnosis.  Second, a circular was sent stating that clinicians should use their judgment in individual cases where it is clear that discussion of the outcomes of the review could do more harm than good.  I find that extraordinary.  We had an examination of the issues surrounding the Grace case for exactly the same reasons, namely, process and procedure failures.  There could be a cost and I imagine there will be a cost to the State.  I do not suggest that we do any work on it because I am aware that there may be a role for the sectoral committee, but could we write to the Department and to CervicalCheck to get as much information as possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#H02300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>And to the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#H02400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Yes, and the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#H02500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I wish to add to that.  To my mind, this clearly is a systems failure.  The tragedy of it is that if things do not happen in the appropriate timeframe, which appears to be the case, the disease progresses quickly.  The key thing with cervical cancer is the three, six and nine years.  In young women in particular it tends to be aggressive and not to be diagnosed early.  I booked an additional check myself this morning.  It is very important that people have confidence in the system.  If there is a lack of confidence, there is no point in the State rolling out large sums of money on vaccination against HPV if on the other side there is a problem with the physical check in this case.  From a financial point of view, which is the remit of this committee, it is questionable to have the State rolling out vaccination but then testing not being adequate or not showing up disease.  In this case the lady is terminally ill and no amount of money will undo the situation for her and her family and for the many other women this morning who are stressed out about this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#H02600","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I echo those points because there is a very human side to the current situation.

In the first instance, the information must be gathered, but if we are to do it, it may well be that the appropriate time falls within the space where we will consider the tardiness of the move towards open disclosure and, as a consequence, the huge amounts that are expended on legal costs.

Mr. McCarthy is not here, but I want to be clear that at next week's meeting we want to receive a list of all of the organisations which have not yet submitted accounts to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2017.  The deadline for their receipt was the end of March.  We wrote to all organisations in December and want to see a big improvement in the number of accounts received.  We are here to ensure public accountability and the first step in that process is the production of financial statements.  The second is the auditing of those statements.  We are not interfering in that process.  However, the first duty of the boards of organisations is to ensure the accounts are sent to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  Before the meeting next week we need a full list of the organisations which have not yet submitted accounts for audit.  We have actually given them a month's grace because they were due to be submitted by the end of March.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will carry out the audit.  We are proposing to invite up to ten of the organisations that have not submitted accounts to a committee session.  It will be short, with perhaps one speaker for each of the organisations represented to explain why they had not complied with their statutory duties.  We will require the assistance of the Comptroller and Auditor General to rate the organisations in terms of turnover, as it is most likely that we will invite the bigger organisations.  I am aware that most of the really big organisations have probably complied with their statutory duties, but there are many middle-sized organisations that might not have done so.  It would be useful, therefore, to receive some indication of the turnover of each organisation for the previous year in order to ensure the organisations we invite are reasonably substantial and people know about them.  At next week's meeting we hope to set a date for a meeting with those organisations, but we would appreciate it if a list could be provided in order that invitations could be sent and that the organisations were put on public notice.  Does that make sense?  Mr. Harkness is obviously ticking off each organisation as the accounts come in.  I am not saying the organisations have sent fully completed financial statements, but once something has been lodged, at least the ball is rolling.  We want to focus on those organisations that have not yet submitted anything.  Mr. Harkness or Mr. McCarthy can check with the committee during the week, if necessary.  There is no point in dealing with organisations which have not yet submitted accounts for last year as we accept that it will be months before the audit process is complete.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#K01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524729600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>The committee went into private session at 10.35 a.m. and resumed in public session at 11 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Committee of Public Accounts Annual Report 2017","time":1524729600,"counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#N00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>In its private session the committee has approved its annual report for 2017, which will be published early next week and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.

This includes the Irish Probation Service, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, the Office of the State Pathologist, the Garda Ombudsman Commission and many others.  An overview of the main funded services and agencies is given in a summary diagram attached to this statement.<\/p> <p>  Members will also be aware that, in 2016, Vote 24 was one of eight Votes that made up the justice group.  The others were the Votes for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service, the Courts Service, the Property Registration Authority, the Valuation Office, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, and the Policing Authority.  These were all areas for which the Department had policy and legislative responsibility, but which are funded and accounted for separately.<\/p> <p>  Since 2016, there have been a number of significant changes in the organisational landscape of the justice group.  For example, responsibility for the Charities Regulatory Authority transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Rural and Community Development in 2017.  The Votes for the Property Registration Authority and the Valuation Office transferred to the housing, planning and local government Vote group in 2018.  The 2016 appropriation account for Vote 24 records gross expenditure of almost &euro;390 million in the year, spread across five spending programmes, as indicated in the figures provided.  More detail on the composition of the respective programmes can be seen in note 3 to the appropriation account.<\/p> <p>  On the receipts side, appropriations in aid of the Vote totalled almost &euro;65 million in 2016.  Almost three quarters of this related to a range of fees charged in respect of immigration registration, nationality and citizenship certification and visa issuance.  For the Vote as a whole, there was a net underspend of &euro;25.5 million relative to the Estimate provision for 2016.  This surplus was liable for surrender.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General was satisfied, following the audit, that the account properly presents the transactions on the Vote during 2016.  He drew attention, however, in the audit report to certain concerns around the development by the Department of a number of information and communications technology, or ICT, projects.<\/p> <p>  The Department provides ICT support services for many functional areas and for agencies within the Vote group.  Between 2012 and 2016, its activity in this regard included projects for three of the agencies it grant funds: a case management system for the Insolvency Service of Ireland; a reporting and registration system for the Charities Regulatory Authority; and an online licence renewal system for the Private Security Authority.  The Department had incurred direct project costs of around &euro;4.6 million to the end of March 2017 on these projects, with &euro;3.6 million of this relating to the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  Functional gaps remain in the systems developed for the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the Charities Regulatory Authority.  Both organisations are in the process of procuring replacement systems from the marketplace.<\/p> <p>  Our examination found that the projects, which were different in scale, complexity and background, had a number of shortcomings in relation to planning and oversight.  The report includes recommendations in relation to strengthening the Department&rsquo;s systems and procedures in the areas of business case development, adoption and monitoring of project budgets, and project governance.  The Accounting Officer accepted all the recommendations and will be able to brief the committee on their implementation.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the audit of the appropriation account also drew attention to non-effective expenditure of &euro;3.89 million in relation to the fit-out and rent of a property leased for the Probation Service in 2008.  Due to planning restrictions, the property could not be used for the purposes for which it was acquired, and the Department could not find an alternative use for the premises.  Legal proceedings in relation to the lease were settled in late 2016.  A summary of the events leading to the settlement is presented in note 6.8 of the account.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 2012 about the problems with the lease.<\/p><p>The previous Committee of Public Accounts sought to examine the matter on foot of his report but could not proceed at the time because of the legal proceedings.<\/p><p> Finally, the Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention in the audit report to non-competitive procurement of goods and services to the value of &euro;6.1 million disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andy Harkness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Harkness.

It is important to note at the outset that the Department fully accepts the recommendations in the report and there is now in place a much stronger governance structure than when the projects in question commenced.  The largest project mentioned in the Insolvency Service of Ireland started over five years ago and was completed in 2016 at a cost of &euro;3.6 million.  The context in which this was achieved was, by any standard, unprecedented.  The establishment of the new service was a top troika priority and was monitored weekly at the time by the Government and the Cabinet committee on mortgage arrears as well as by the troika in their regular reviews.  The Department was given the task of setting up the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, and the director designate was appointed in November 2012 while work continued on the draft legislation going through the Oireachtas.  Given the state of national indebtedness, this was a core deliverable in the troika agreement and, obviously, an ICT system would be required in order that this commitment could deliver on its mandate.  This was achieved in very pressurised circumstances and the ISI opened its doors in September 2013.  While key staff were still in the process of being recruited, the Department's ICT division has engaged in respect of the development on an urgent basis of an online case management system.  Because of the need to deliver the system quickly, a decision was taken to develop it in-house within the existing Lotus Notes environment.  This was undertaken by the Department's own IT team with support from contractors under established contracts.  While the case management system, the OCMS, is sometimes described as a single project, it is in fact an extensive and complex system which supports several elements linked to the personal insolvency infrastructure introduced by the 2012 Act.  It comprises two websites and three separate elements: the interface with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and registration of practitioners; the interface with the Courts Service, which is unique and groundbreaking and works well; and the case management system itself.  Various developments in the legislative structure meant the requirements were somewhat difficult to define, which contributed to the complexities of the system design and implementation.  Nevertheless, it was recognised in an external review we commissioned in 2016 that the hard work and co-operation by the joint project team resulted in the initial application going live on day one, as required, in September 2013.<\/p> <p>  It is accepted that difficulties emerged in the project for a period after this, which led to the then Secretary General putting in place strengthened governance arrangements, including the appointment of an experienced external chair and a new project board from February 2015.  It is also acknowledged that there are ongoing shortcomings within the existing system, particularly the level of manual intervention required as well as gaps in the management information and reporting needs of the service.  In the past year, the ISI, with support and oversight from the Department and the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, has gone to the market for a new system, and I understand that procurement process is now nearing conclusion.  By the time this is implemented, the existing ICT system will have been operational for approximately five years and will have been depreciated in full.  As Accounting Officer, I continue to work towards strengthening controls and implementing both internal and external audit recommendations.  In addition to the strengthening of the project management and governance arrangements, we are undertaking a comprehensive risk assessment across all aspects of ICT operations.  A further ongoing audit is reviewing the controls in place in a representative number of the bodies and agencies and how these organisations link back to the central ICT shared service.  The outcome of these audits will assist us in further strengthening the controls and management of the function across the Department.<\/p> <p>  Turning to other matters in Vote 24, members may recall that my predecessor provided an update to the committee last May on the leased premises on Wolfe Tone Street, which was procured in 2008 for use by the Probation Service.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General's office has pointed out, this was the subject of legal proceedings which were concluded in late 2016.  This is now reflected in the 2016 appropriation account.  It was previously the subject of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2011 report.  The central issue in this case was assurance provided by the vendor in respect of planning permission for the premises.  In his 2011 report, the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined that it was reasonable for the Department to rely on the legal advice provided in respect of the planning permission.  The total cost in respect of this matter, including the legal settlement in 2016, was &euro;3.89 million.  The settlement was based on strong legal advice and resulted in closure of the matter, thus avoiding any further costs accruing to the State.  The Department relied on legal advice at all times in respect of this matter.<\/p> <p>  Throughout 2016, the Department was also implementing its programme for change arising from the 2014 Toland report.  Over the past four years, we have focused on measures to strengthen our revised culture and identify and embed behavioural change.  All of this is supported by robust governance frameworks, revised management processes and formal agreements with the relevant agencies of the Department.  We continue to review and update these with a view to driving further improvement in the processes.  In 2017 the management board decided it would be timely to review progress on the implementation of the programme and engaged external experts to do this in a rigorous and independent manner.  That report was published earlier this year and it identified that significant progress has been made and also where more has to be done.  The board agreed with the analysis, which reflects its own view and feedback from staff across the Department.  I circulated details of the progress being made, and this is also published in more detail on the Department's website, so I will not detain the committee with that.<\/p> <p>  Arrangements for the governance of agencies, which is a particular focus, have been formalised and strengthened.  At the end of 2017, framework agreements were in place with 23 agencies.  These are all published on our website.  The process of updating and renewing annual oversight agreements for 2018 has begun and, again, these will be published when agreed.  Seven have been published to date this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Oonagh McPhillips"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Can we get this up on the screen properly?

It is also reassuring that the review found no evidence of any failure to comply with orders from the tribunal.  It is of course a matter of concern that emails were not located as part of the discovery process, and we are putting new measures in place that are aimed at ensuring that an oversight of this kind cannot happen in future.  These new measures include the use of specialist consultants, where needed, for discovery and the establishment of a separate unit to interact with tribunals and commissions.  There is also a Civil Service-wide initiative under way in respect of electronic file management which will help to ensure that electronic documents can more easily be associated with relevant files.

I am not trying to catch anyone out but my issue here is whether there was concern within the Department.  I asked parliamentary questions on this, as did others, and the report came through in January.  The Committee on Justice and Equality discussed this yesterday.  An IT audit report will come before this committee in the future.  I believe that this will require an external investigation on the scale of the projects, the tendering or lack thereof, the verbal sign-off on contracts, the volume of people on site in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the manner in which those people were allowed access on site.  I believe there are issues here on taxpayers' money, security, and tendering-procurement across the board.  A report is coming through on that.  As the overseeing Department, I want to know if the Department of Justice and Equality had any concern on this issue.  The witnesses have clarified that.  We will deal with that in due course and take on board what Ms McPhillips said.<\/p> <p>  I turn to other issues.  On taxpayers' money, and I will not encroach on the tribunal, the Department made a decision to sign off verbally on funding for the Charleton tribunal and for the Charleton liaison committee.

I thank the Deputy.  The main learning concerned business cases on budgets.  The Deputy will note from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that there was no business case or specific budget ring-fenced for the development of the ISI project.  That cannot happen now, so all projects that go to the governance group must have a business case and a budget line.  The governance group then monitors progress.  If there were any drift in terms of expenditure going beyond the allocated budget, that would be noted by governance in the course of the development of the project.<\/p> <p>  The other major development in respect of governance is the ongoing monitoring, as I said, but also the post-implementation review.  We go back and do a \"lessons learned\" and see whether it is achieving the things it set out in its business case that it would achieve.  That is the main thing.  I know the Deputy was not here earlier, but the other thing about governance is that the membership of the group has been refreshed and there are now two external members who have a great deal of expertise in their own organisations.  There is a principal officer from Revenue, the former head of ICT in one of our agencies, and the Property Registration Authority which, again, no more than Revenue, has a very large ICT responsibility.  We also refresh the representative of an agency from time to time.  The current representative is the head of the Charities Regulator.

As things stand, there are 15 cases in which the women concerned lack capacity.  This brings me to the developments in relation to the Magdalen scheme.  The Ombudsman issued a report last November which was critical in some respects of the operation of the scheme.  He made a number of recommendations, two of which are being dealt with by a recently appointed senior counsel, Ms Mary O'Toole SC.  She is looking at how best to address the issue of the 15 women who lack capacity.  She is also looking at cases where the assessed duration of stay was lower than that originally claimed by an applicant with the result that the award was reduced.

Ms O'Toole has suggested that rather than to give a general recommendation on how we deal with capacity issues overall, she has suggested that she should make recommendations on each of the individual cases.  I do not think we will be standing in her way in respect of that.<\/p> <p>  To stay on the issue of capacity as the Deputy has raised it, there were three routes we were looking at to deal with these cases.  We have no desire to hang onto the money which is properly the property of the women concerned.  The original intention was to use the assisted decision-making legislation, but there have been delays there which mean the necessary regulations and processes will not be in place until next year.  As such, that approach is not really possible.  The next route is the wards of court process, but it is a very significant decision in respect of any person to make him or her a ward of court.  The third route is one we have been exploring with the HSE which is the possibility of using the private property accounts scheme whereby the money belonging to each woman would be held by the HSE and disbursed to her according to need.  We cannot, obviously, predict what recommendation will be made by Ms O'Toole, but it seems the principal route will remain the ward of court procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018042600002#W00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Dowling"},{"type":"speech","time":1524729600,"counter":615,"content":"<p>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was enacted in 2015.

The figure under that heading is &euro;3.89 million.  Non-effective expenditure in lay man's terms is a waste of taxpayer's money.  It is the polite way of saying a waste of taxpayer's money.  Effectively the Comptroller and Auditor General's report contains a paragraph which says that &euro;3.89 million of taxpayer's money was wasted.  It is one of the most egregious wastes of taxpayer's money that this committee has seen in that there was no value for the taxpayer when it was all over.  Despite the reports that were done in 2011, this committee is far less satisfied on this topic now than at any other stage.  We want a complete report on this from the Department.

I welcome the Commissioner here to this joint meeting of the Joint Committee of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development.  I am joined by Deputy Joe Carey, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development.  The officials, Mr. Kiely, head of European Commission Representation in Ireland, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Tynan of the Commissioner's cabinet, are very welcome.  The joint meeting is convened today to discuss some developing issues in the formation of the new Common Agricultural Policy policy as well as additional EU developments including Brexit, EU trade negotiations and the roads development programme.  The Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae is also present.  I welcome him to the meeting.  I welcome the Commissioner back.  I know he was due to come here in March but weather changed all those plans.  I thank him very much for rescheduling the meeting.<\/p> <p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Due to the number of attendees at today's meeting, I ask members to limit their questions to two minutes initially if that is possible.  If time permits, supplementary questions may be allowed.  We only have about an hour in total.  The Commissioner has other appointments later on.<\/p> <p>  As the Commissioner is aware, the EU is at a very crucial juncture in its history and the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, itself is undergoing a reform process that could define its future.  As he is also aware, a delegation of the committee participated in the parliamentary committee meeting that he addressed at the European Parliament on Tuesday where a number of the pressing issues were discussed.  Perhaps the most serious issue of all is the budget and how the new CAP will be resourced, particularly where there is a distinct possibility this may be reduced.  Another very serious issue is generational renewal and encouraging more young people to enter and maintain an interest in farming.  Environmental measures and external conversions also appear to have the potential to be contentious in the months ahead.  Outside CAP, the farming community is concerned with Brexit, Mercosur, the possibility of a hard border still looming in the absence of concrete and specific proposals, coupled with a more open trade policy that could be detrimental to EU interests, more notably for beef, but also for sugar and ethanol.  Before I invite the Commissioner to make his opening statement, I ask the Chair of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development, Deputy Joe Carey to say a few words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#A00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1729,"content":"<p>Good afternoon.  On behalf of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development, I thank the Chairman for organising and proposing this meeting and I thank the Commissioner for coming back here, our previous meeting having been postponed because of the snow.  On behalf of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development, I welcome Commissioner Hogan and look forward to discussions on issues of rural and community development at EU level.  The Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development is a new Oireachtas committee and held its first meeting on 29 November 2017.  The committee shadows the Department of Community and Rural Development whose remit extends to rural development, community development and infrastructure, national broadband roll-out, administration of EU funding programmes, development of libraries, social inclusion, water safety and charity regulation.<\/p> <p>  Rural developments support the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy and my committee is very interested in several elements of this policy.  The EU plans to spend nearly &euro;100 billion on a rural development policy for the period 2014 to 2020 through the European agricultural fund for rural development.  We plan to spend more than &euro;4.02 billion of public money on a rural development programme for Ireland over the same period and &euro;2.19 billion of this funding will be from EU sources.  Given the level of expenditure involved and its importance in supporting a vital part of our economy, I welcome the opportunity today to discuss such issues as the Leader programme, CAP reform, EU trade policy and the effect of Brexit.  However, the future is unknowable and unforeseen shocks to the system such as Brexit and the recent threats to international trade can undo the best laid plans.<\/p> <p>  The committee welcomes the publication of the EU Commission's communication last November on the future of food and farming, which followed a consultation on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy.  In my committee's view, this will assist in getting a better understanding of where the current policy can be simplified and modernised to the benefit of all parties.  This is in line with the recommendations from the special report on rural development programming of the European Court of Auditors 2017 which called for increased consistency and simplification.  We welcome in particular the following proposals under the reform - to make the CAP simpler; increase subsidiarity in view to reducing the administration burden; improved co-ordination between different policies such as CAP and the rural development policy; and recognise the need for co-operation between state and local agencies to sustain rural communities.<\/p> <p>  My committee looks forward to budget proposals from the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and the full proposals on how the goals outlined in the EU communication on the future of CAP will be achieved.  It is within this context that my committee recommends promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development in rural areas, simplifying the processes to access EU funding, for example, that provided under the Leader programme, so that local groups can focus on working on the ground in rural communities, supporting rural and agricultural communities affected by Brexit.  On behalf of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development, I would now like to put the following questions and observations to the Commissioner.  The CAP has had clear successes to date and in order that it continues to do so, what greater responsibilities does he see for Ireland in meeting the objectives of a more simple and reformed policy?<\/p><p>How can the local-led approach of the Leader programme be improved to achieve better co-ordination and to fully realise rural potential?  What impact will Brexit have on the EU budget and what is the likely outcome for rural development in Ireland?  Overall, how satisfied is the Commissioner with the EU's rural development policy?  I look forward to Commissioner Hogan's responses to these questions and I am sure that the other members of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development will also have comments and questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#A00500","speaker":"1273","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1731,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Carey.

It is good to be back.  I thank the committees for facilitating this meeting.  As the Co-Chairman has said, earlier this week I participated in an interparliamentary committee meeting with the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.  Some of the members present were able to be there.  We covered a number of issues but we can always go back over them again.<\/p> <p>  Last week, I spoke in a debate in the European Parliament in which I acknowledged that \"national Parliaments play an essential role in bringing the Union closer to its citizens\".  We have to rely on members to scrutinise the activities of their own Government but they should also be able to scrutinise the programmes which we have at European level.  As public representatives, this is the way it should be.   <\/p> <p>  I recognise the immense hardship caused by the prolonged winter and the rainfall levels in recent months, which have particularly affected livestock and tillage farmers throughout the country.  We are all very conscious of the stress that this has caused for farmers, both financial and emotional.  The weather seems to have improved and the images of animals going back out into the fields were certainly welcome, though obviously we would have liked to have seen them in better condition.  As members are aware, last October the European Commission was requested to allow additional advance payments to be made under the basic payment scheme and advance payments were increased from 50% to 70%.  I was requested to allow that increase by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In recent weeks the Minister also requested me to allow Irish tillage farmers to derogate from the crop diversification requirement, which is known as the \"three-crop rule\".  This is being implemented since 11 April.  I made a political decision with the Commissioner for the Environment to do so.  Of course the paperwork has to be completed but nevertheless farmers have been able to sow their corn and their crops from 11 April without having to comply with the three-crop rule.<\/p> <p>  This meeting comes at an opportune time.  Next week, the European Commission will adopt its budget proposal for the period from 2020 to 2027.  Like the Estimates process with which the members are all familiar, there is always a little bit of toing and froing between the relevant Commissioners and the Commissioners responsible for the budget.  It is no secret that this is also going on in Brussels at the moment.  The difficulty this time arises because we have &euro;12 billion less as a result of Brexit and because of the expectation of member states that more money will be spent on other policy areas at European level, particularly security, defence and migration.  That would cost another &euro;12 billion if it were to be implemented immediately.  There are only two places from which we can get money, that is, from the member states or from \"own resources\" as it called.  This refers to various sources of money such as the emissions trading scheme.  This money is required to fill the deficit in the EU budget.  The Irish Government and other governments - 21 governments out of 27 in fact - have indicated that they are prepared to look at putting more money into the pot.  However, this decision must be made by unanimity so we have to work hard over the next year to convince the five or six countries which are holding back if we want to get agreement on a well-funded and fully-funded European budget, such as we have at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I have made this point strongly  when I visited a number of countries and met not only ministers for agriculture, but prime ministers.  I have also been offering a robust defence of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the value for money it delivers.  I genuinely believe that the CAP has stood the test of time and has been a remarkable success, but a successful policy is often taken for granted.  Nobody here should be under any illusion about the extent of the challenge facing the budget.  My job is to try to build strong alliances in order to resist the worst of these cuts and achieve the best possible outcome for our family farm model.  That is what I am doing at the moment.  <\/p> <p>  We are proposing some significant changes in the context of the CAP communication.  As members will know, on 29 November I indicated that we have to have a new way of delivering the CAP in order to bring about greater simplification of this policy.  We have European rules and we have member state rules.  In my view we do not need both.  We want to move from a rules-based and compliance-based approach to an approach based on performance and results.  We have to do more for the environment and for public goods.  This is the only way we can adapt our CAP policy in order to be able to show our European taxpayers and all members of society that food security is important but that public goods are equally important.  Our farmers certainly have a role to play and I want to see farmers as part of the solution, not part of the problem.<\/p> <p>  Guaranteeing a fair level of direct payments for farmers to support their work is, in my view, not alone essential and not alone for the benefit of farmers, but for the benefit of the wider society.  Farmers are both the producers and providers of our food and the custodians of the countryside and the front line in the protection of the rural environment.  They are effectively our boots on the ground in delivering on environment and climate change.  I also want to see our small and medium-sized farmers protected from the worst excesses of what may be a difficult budget.  I have been making the case throughout Europe that this is about equity and fairness for our farmers, who provide our people with so many public goods.<\/p> <p>  Some pure economists, in this country and outside it, advocate the abolition of direct payments and say that there should only be payments for public goods.  I do not agree with this.  We need income support for our farmers in order that they can survive.  We cannot have a sustainable society without sustainable farmers.  This is particularly the case for our small and medium-sized farmers.  If we expect our farmers to make a bigger contribution to climate challenge and other societal goals, that has to be taken into account in terms of the budgetary allocations made.  Members will hear more about this over the next few days, next Wednesday to be precise.  <\/p> <p>  On the proposals for CAP reform, which will be published in late May or early June, we are moving away from the one-size-fits-all solution designed to be applicable from the Inishowen Peninsula to the Greek islands, or from Slea Head to Lapland.  Not every farmer in these places does things in the same way and we have to reflect that in the spirit of subsidiarity and flexibility at member state level.  We are addressing this in the context of our proposals on the CAP.  The European Union will continue to have decision-making responsibility in respect of policy and key objectives, while there will be more flexibility for member states to draw up CAP strategic plans in order to meet those objectives.  Member states will have discretion to decide on the appropriate measures to meet these objectives, having regard to their own specific circumstances, whether that is in terms of farming practices, climate or other conditions.  In Ireland's case, these measures will have to be included in Ireland's CAP strategic plans, which will be subject to approval by the Commission.  The achievement of these measures will be assessed by reference to set indicators and targets.<\/p> <p>  Some members will be aware that the existing approval system for the rural development programme can be lengthy, cumbersome and, sometimes, frustrating.  We are determined, as part of our commitment to greater simplification, to make the new approval process more straightforward and efficient.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I referred to the dreadful weather under which farmers have been trying to operate.  These conditions have added to the costs of farming and it will not be easy for many of those farmers to recover these costs in the short term.  Farmers deserve a fair price for their produce.  This is where we are tackling the issue of unfair trading practices.  These proposals are targeted not just at farmers and small and medium enterprises, but also at tackling the broader food waste crisis across Europe.  Buyers will have to become smarter and more responsive to consumer demands when they can no longer load the risk and cost of food waste on producers.  We will have a more ordered and more governed food supply chain.  It is an initial proposal, which can be built upon by the member state governments and the European Parliament.  We are doing this in the form of a directive which recognises that many member states are already doing things about unfair trade practices.  These proposals can supplement and improve those actions.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, said at the April Council of Ministers' meeting that the purpose of the legislation is to complement, not replace, that which functions well already, where that is the case.<\/p><p>With regard to trade, Ireland is a major exporting country in agrifood exports.  For the year as a whole, it is estimated that the value of food and drink exports increased by 13%, representing growth of almost 60% since 2010.  Exports to the UK rose by an estimated 7% to some &euro;4.4 billion despite the weakness of sterling.  However, Bord Bia figures suggest the share of exports to the UK has continued to fall despite the top-line growth figure, and the market share for exports to the UK is now estimated at 35%, down two points on last year.  Therefore, we have to diversify.  We have been travelling around the world with various business delegations in order to see what we can do to diversify, and we have succeeded in many places, for example, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, Canada and, recently, in Mexico.  I know there are concerns about trade negotiations with Mercosur, and these are certainly recognised as sensitive by the EU and as part of the mandate of member state Governments in the European Parliament.<br\/><br\/>A diversification strategy is essential if the agricultural sector as a whole, and particularly the beef sector, is to be protected from the worst effects of Brexit, given we have no idea yet what kind of future relationship we will have or what will exist between the UK and the EU.  I am continuing my economic offensive to identify and access new and emerging markets.  I remind the committee that the most recent EU figures showed monthly exports at a record level of &euro;11.5 billion, adding up to a 12-month total of more than &euro;130 billion in 2017, which is the highest ever.  I am not saying that is happening because I am the Commissioner but, nevertheless, if there was anything going wrong, I am sure I would have heard about it.  I look forward to many people mentioning this figure in the months ahead.<br\/><br\/>I am going to China with a business delegation arising from the very important opening of that market to beef in recent times, and four meat companies from Ireland will be accompanying us as part of a 71-strong delegation.  The opening of the Chinese market is fortuitous and we hope Bord Bia and the Department will be able to deliver exports there, sooner rather than later.  I pay tribute to the relationship the Irish Government and Irish public representatives have had with the Chinese embassy and the Chinese authorities in bringing this about.  This has been a long time in gestation and it has come about because of painstaking political dialogue over a long period, and I am happy to see it has now come to fruition.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, I want to deal with the issue of relations between the United States and the EU in the context of trade.  These are sensitive times and there is always the potential for a trade war in agriculture and food products between the US and the rest of the world in which European agricultural food products could become collateral damage, for example, in a trade war between the US and China.  It is very difficult to understand how the US would target EU companies because we are supposed to be on the same side of the argument when it comes to the surplus of aluminium and steel <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>China.  Nevertheless, the strategy and tactics of the US are certainly something that change from day to day, so there will be sensitivities around some Irish products that might be on the list.  However, we have to reflect that all regions of the EU are affected and all regions take the responsibility if this is the way the US wishes to proceed.<br\/><br\/>Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m has been very active.  She has gone to the US and the economy Ministers of many states have also been to the US, particularly those from Germany and France, to try to highlight the difficulties that would be created for the trading relationship of European companies <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the US if this was to come to pass.  We hope that common sense will prevail and that the good relationship we have on the trading side, given the 11% increase in trade between the EU and the US last year, will not be affected and will continue.  We want to assure co-operatives and medium-size businesses in the food and drinks area, which are worried about this situation, that we are doing everything to convince the US President by 12 May so he will not in any way pull the levers of some irresponsible action that will have unintended consequences for our agrifood trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1734,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for his overview of the situation.

On Brexit and the future of the EU, does he have any insights on whether the UK will change its mind on staying within the customs union or find some customs solution that will go a long way to mitigating the impact on the Border with Northern Ireland?  How does he see Ireland's place in the future of the EU without the UK, and how much do we need to change our strategy?<\/p> <p>  The Commissioner knows there are serious concerns in Ireland about the future of the suckler herd.  Simply put, it is not profitable at present for them to stay in business, given the current status of payments to suckler farmers.  If we want to continue with a strong beef sector, we must have suckler farmers making a profit.  At the moment, given what it costs to maintain a cow and keep it alive for 12 months, if all the farmer is gaining is the fact that cow will produce a calf, then the return versus the cost is not enough.  This has been compounded by the weather, which the Commissioner acknowledged, although I will not blame him for the weather today.  Having said that, there is a very serious situation for suckler farmers.<\/p> <p>  I look to the Commissioner for a comment and an assurance in regard to part-time farmers.  He was a politician in Ireland for long enough to know the down-to-earth facts that young people growing up today - the sons and daughters of farmers - if they are to survive, in the majority of cases, will need to have some other type of employment.  They will need to have some other type of job, be that a part-time job in conjunction with part-time farming, or a full-time job in conjunction with part-time farming.  I hear a lot of what can be at times negative reporting by our media, and sometimes our media can be at sea when it comes to discussing agricultural matters because they are so far removed from reality that they would not realise the impact of what they are saying.  I would like an assurance from the Commissioner in order to support people who are involved in farming on a part-time basis.<\/p> <p>  With regard to transport for fodder, systems were put in place which are finishing up over the coming days.  We need the Commissioner to assist the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure that farmers will get assistance for the next couple of weeks.  I could not finish without acknowledging the work that is being done by our farming organisations, such as the IFA, the ICMSA and all the other groups which have worked so diligently in trying to highlight the problems we have today with agriculture, in particular that since last July it has been torture to be involved in farming.  It was a shame the Government woke up so late to the fact that we were in the middle of a crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#C00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1736,"content":"<p>We will take four questions together, if the Commissioner does mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#C00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524747600,"counter":1737,"content":"<p>I have five already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1738,"content":"<p>I am sure Mr. Hogan is quite capable of lumping them together.

I thank him for taking the time to meet both committees.  I acknowledge the importance from a national point of view of having him in the role of Agriculture Commissioner.  I also acknowledge the work he is doing in regard to putting the next CAP programme together, which by and large is amenable to Irish national interests and will be welcomed by countries across Europe in terms of its structure.  The Commissioner mentioned subsidiarity and returning more power to the individual member states to frame CAP in a way that suits them, moving from a rules-based CAP to an outputs-based CAP and ensuring there is flexibility within that.  Those are all welcome.<\/p> <p>  Of course, the overarching issue is going to be that of the budget.  I know the Commissioner has been very clear on that in his comments.  We have to look at this against a backdrop where, in the past ten years, there has been a 20% drop in the income coming to Irish farmers from CAP.<\/p><p>It was &euro;1.8 billion in 2007 but it is &euro;1.48 billion now.  It is crucial that a line be drawn under the matter and that those reductions be stopped.  I do not believe any reduction in the next CAP will be acceptable.  Instead, we should acknowledge that CAP is a key part of ensuring that quality food of the highest standard is produced.  That should be acknowledged at EU level in the context of keeping the budget intact.  I know there are challenges but we are certainly depending on the Commissioner to drive this home.  Could he update us about the potential for getting the relevant member states on board with regard to agreeing to contribute more?  I think up to 1.3% of GNI would be required.  Every effort needs to be made in respect of this.<\/p><p> I welcome the &euro;60,000 cap outlined in the draft communiqu&eacute;.  This is something Fianna F&aacute;il has pushed for and it is a welcome move on the part of the Commissioner.  I certainly hope the Government will back him up on that because he will need support at European level over the coming period.<\/p><p> I would be interested in hearing the Commissioner's perspective on the recent comments of the UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis.  The Commissioner has been frank up to now regarding the position of the UK.  It appears that the British Government is still living in dreamland in the context of its approach to Brexit.<\/p><p> On our preparedness for Brexit, in the context of agriculture, I do not believe we are fully on top of the issues.  There is a role to be played by the European Commission in supporting Irish agriculture to prepare for it.  I would be interested in hearing what engagement the Commissioner has had with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on that and whether it has any asks of the Commissioner in terms of support for what it is doing.<\/p><p> What is the Commissioner's position with regard to current negotiations on the Mercosur trade deal?  I emphasise that this proceeding is totally against the interests of farmers, particularly those in the beef sector.  I have grave concern about the impact on the beef sector of the mooted increase on beef imports to 99,000 tonnes.<\/p><p> In the context of fodder, I acknowledge that the Commissioner has outlined clearly his understanding of the pressure farmers have been under domestically.  Certainly, the response at domestic level has been in no way sufficient.  From the point of view of ensuring that the structures are in place to deal with such issues in the future and adverse weather conditions in particular, what more can be done in the context of CAP with regard to putting structures in place so that we are better able to respond to such conditions as they happen instead of taking the kind of haphazard approach that, unfortunately, we have seen in recent times?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#C00700","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1741,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for attending.  I have no doubt he is firmly in our corner with regard to CAP.  I remember saying in the D&aacute;il two years ago that this was the real hole in the bucket.  We are looking at other matters such as trade but the contribution of the British to the CAP budget - at a little over &euro;12 billion - will certainly be a huge issue.  I have no doubt that the Commissioner is fully aware and will be advocating but we must be honest with people.  We must bring some big hitters along like the Dutch and the Danes and get them on board because unanimity is required.  Of course, the Irish Government has already indicated its position.  We pay over &euro;400 million into CAP.  Another 1.1% would bring that up by a further &euro;40 million, &euro;50 million or &euro;60 million and things would still be very good for us here.  We can explain to taxpayers why the increase is necessary.  That is no problem but we have to bring everybody else along.  I have no doubt that the Government and our bureaucrats will play their role but we have to bring everybody else along because they have to be convinced.  Those to whom I refer must, in turn, convince their consumers and the public at large in their jurisdictions so let us not say that we can go in with a big stick.  It will take a lot of very purposeful negotiation to ensure that this will happen and that the budget will be increased.  As the Commissioner said, there are only two places to get this money - one is from here and the other is from other member states.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues I have come across in recent days relates to a concern in respect of which, perhaps, the farming organisations have not advocated as much as should have been the case.  I will advocate what Macra na Feirme has advocated for.  In recent times, significant concern has been expressed by many stakeholders about young farmers and the concept of generational renewal.  There is an issue with structural supports for young farmers.  The moment this is mentioned, people say that they do not want any straight lines, cuts or anything else.  In such circumstances, let us be clear: we cannot swing on both sides.  We must come down somewhere in the middle and that is the way I go in political life.  We need to increase the maximum level of funding beyond 2% and focus on reducing additional barriers to young farmers such as those relating to access to capital, lack of business skills and insufficient succession plans.  To what extent does the Commission propose to protect the family farm structure?  There has been a trend away from doing so in recent years.  Will the Commission explore a long-term strategy for generational renewal, which is very important?  What incentives are under consideration to incentivise greater involvement in agriculture on the part of young people?  I was at Punchestown yesterday and two farmers and an auctioneer told me that this is the big issue and that nobody is talking about it.  I was amazed.  The number of people under 35 who are going into farming is dropping drastically.  It is not just dropping in Ireland.  According to the European Court of Auditors, it decreased from 3.3 million in 2005 to 2.3 million in 2013.  The number of hectares held by young farmers has fallen from 57.7 million across Europe in 2005 to 51 million.  That is a drop of over 6 million.  There will be nothing for the future if we do not sort this out.<\/p> <p>  The EU negotiators are fully aware of the importance of the equine sector, particularly in the context of the horse racing and horse breeding industries, to Ireland's rural economy.  Will the Commissioner take account of the current position of free movement of thoroughbreds between Ireland, Great Britain and France?  A tripartite agreement is in place between the Ministers with responsibility for agriculture in the three countries.  We must remember that 80% of Ireland's exports of thoroughbreds are to the UK.  The Commissioner can, therefore, readily appreciate the importance of the role of trade in the Brexit negotiations, particularly in the context of this vital industry.  We should not lose sight of that fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#D00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1742,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner and his staff.  CAP is the big issue facing us for the next few years.  The budget is vital.  We must ensure the largest possible budget for Irish farmers and farm families.  I welcome the announcement this morning of the &euro;60,000 cap.  That is appropriate at this point.  We must find some way of capping that budget.  This brings me to Pillar 1 in particular.  We have an entitlement system based on something involving farming activities 20 years ago.  Entitlements are becoming a commodity that is traded, leased, rented and messed around with.  There is an opportunity to find a way out of that.  I would appreciate hearing the Commissioner's comments on the matter.  Previously, there was an element of greening in Pillar 1.  Will that be removed?  It was mentioned that there will be more flexibility and that member states will have more autonomy over it.  Will that mean fewer rules and less counting of things, which I think farmers want to see happen, so that there will be an element of trust that the farmer is doing the right thing and does not need to be checked, watched and studied all the time?  The latter has certainly been the experience up to now.<\/p> <p>  With regard to fair trade and fair prices, it always strikes me that every farmer says we need the live export trade.  Unless there is a release valve that creates pressure on the price so that factories can start to pay more, the processors will not give farmers a fair price.  This tells us that the processors and the big meat barons are in the driving seat, which should not be the case.  It is about regulation and trying to bring some flexibility into it so that we can be sure we are looked after.<\/p> <p>  Theresa Villiers has a motion before the House of Commons to stop live exports from Great Britain after Brexit.  This would mean that a farmer in my part of the country in Leitrim who bought a bullock in Fermanagh could not bring it back across the Border because it would be a live export from the UK.  This is the type of nonsensical situation at which we could arrive.<\/p><p>I wish to ask again about the Mercosur trade deal.  On the previous trip to Brussels which I was on the Commissioner said he expected it to be concluded quite soon.  We are some way down the road since then and we have not seen much movement on it.  I welcome that fact.  I hope there will not be much movement on it.  Where does the Commissioner believe that deal is going?  What direction is the EU taking in respect of not only Mercosur but all trade deals?  How vulnerable will Irish agriculture continue to be in the future in respect of such deals, which are being made, by and large, at the behest of big industry and the commercial sector, in particular insurance and financial services, that want to get into other markets and are trading off against the importation of cheap agricultural produce?  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#D00300","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1744,"content":"<p>I now call on Commissioner Hogan and ask him to be as brief as possible although there is a number of issues to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#E00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524747600,"counter":1745,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Chairman.

As Deputy Penrose and I know very well from the time we were in a little bit of hardship together down in the Custom House when we had to go to see the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, it was not an easy place to be in terms of an Estimates process when there was very little money.  In fact, we were going into a situation where we had no money, and the challenge was to try to hold onto the programmes we had.  The current situation is a little bit like that now, in that due to Brexit we have &euro;12 billion less in funding and we have a demand for more money for other initiatives.  There is a finite number of places we can get funding but the principal one is based around the gross national income of the member state.  At the moment we are paying equivalent to 1.13% of gross national income on the basis of an EU 27.  If Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland and Austria want to hold the line and say there should not be another euro for Europe then we are in trouble because unanimity is required.  We hope that at the end of the day they will like the new policy initiatives that are being discussed more than the ones that affect us in relation to Brexit.  The negotiations for the next year will be difficult.  The Commission can only make a proposal and it is ultimately the member states in the European Parliament that will make the final decisions.<\/p> <p>  On the impact of the budget on rural development, of course there is going to be a knock-on effect on all programmes, including agriculture and cohesion, if there is going to be less money.  In response to Deputy Healy-Rae, Ireland without the UK will have to build new alliances.  That work is ongoing and an effort is being made to build alliances with an arc of countries around the United Kingdom, where there is a lot of dependence on the UK market.  That is an obvious place to start.  We are very conscious of the suckler herd.  We can give flexibility to the member state and the Minister of the day on the type of issues the Deputy mentioned, to draw up their priorities in the context of the CAP plan.  They have the chance of putting in a little bit of voluntary, coupled support if they wish for sectors that are under pressure, and that will be retained.  I do not know where the notion came from that we were going to prevent part-time farmers from getting money.  It must be a Kerry issue because I got a letter from Kerry County Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1746,"content":"<p>No, it is not.

I did not get a letter from anywhere else.  I want to give an absolute assurance that the way part-time farmers get their money at the moment will continue.  There are no plans whatsoever by me anyway to change that.  Perhaps others have plans to change it but I do not.  I have given the responsibility for defining an active farmer back to the member state.  That discussion will be had in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with the Minister of the day.  I wish Deputy Healy-Rae well in that regard.  The last time the measure came up for discussion in the reform programme, agreement could not be reached in the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers on the definition of an active farmer for 28 member states.  Bringing it back to each member state means that there will be differences in each member state about what an active farmer is.  It will be an interesting debate.  Part-time farmers should not have anything to worry about.<\/p> <p>  We certainly feel empathy and sympathy for farmers affected by the fodder crisis following eight months of rain.  Anytime I was asked to do something I did, whether it was to bring forward payments, do something with the three-crop rule or finish the payments for GLAS, we approved it.  That is as much as I can do.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue asked about Mr. Davis's comments.  I noted them.  This is the first indication that we have got from the Brexit secretary that there will be some proposals tabled on customs arrangements and partnership, building on the Mansion House speech of Prime Minister May.  It will be very interesting to see what is tabled on 17 May.  The next five weeks will be very important in the UK because there are local elections, the initiatives outlined by Mr. Davis, and we are also getting close to the timeline of the June European Council Summit.  They know the clock is ticking and that they have to get real about what kind of partnership arrangement they need on customs.  We definitely need some movement on customs in order to deal with a lot of the concerns we have on the island of Ireland and in the future relationship between the UK and European Union.  They have to get more real about it.  It is make-your-mind-up time now in terms of what direction to go.  The House of Commons will play a role in that as well.  Some significant votes will take place there in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  On Mercosur and trade generally, I was asked a question at an IFA event last Friday night about the need to be careful with our carbon footprint regarding Mercosur.  That is fine but, equally, the same logic should apply to what we do in Japan and China.  We must be very careful.  Trade is the essence of the negotiation but there will be winners and losers.  Depending on the country one is dealing with, there will be offensive and defensive situations that will have to be tackled.  If one is in a trading environment one might not get as much as one wants one day but one could get a lot more than one expected another day.  That is what happened in Japan.  We got a deal for 65,000 tonnes of beef.  Nobody mentioned that because it is good news.  We have opened links with the Chinese market, which will have an immediate effect rather than having to wait for ten years.  If we do a deal in the morning with Mercosur it will take ten or 12 years before it is implemented.  We have a bit of time in terms of the concerns that have been expressed.  The sensitivity around beef is reflected in the mandate given by the Council of Ministers to the negotiators, and it has to be approved by every member state subsequently.  There is no point in negotiating a deal without striking the right balance because it will subsequently be turned down.  It would be a hell of a waste of time.  The negotiations on Mercosur have been going on for 20 years.  Elections are taking place in Brazil at the moment.  The next round of negotiations with Mercosur countries will effectively take place at the end of May.  I do not know whether the Brazilians will moderate their view sufficiently on cars or industrial products to satisfy some member states in the European Union.  If there is no change there will be a standstill again for another while.  That has been the way for a long time.  I was here at the time of the last meeting and I thought there was sufficient momentum for something to happen.  We certainly did not get what we asked for, and that is the reason there is no deal.<\/p> <p>  On trade generally, we are making a lot of progress on skimmed milk powder.  Most people I hear talking about skimmed milk powder in storage are farmers and I think they should not be talking about it because they are allowing co-ops and other people that are buying milk to use it as an opportunity to reduce their price on the basis of there being an overhang in the market.  We will handle this in a sensitive way that will not in any way impact on the price of milk for the farmer.  If co-operatives or businesses that are buying milk want to use it as an excuse then they are wrong, because there is no excuse.  We sold 24,000 tonnes last week.  We did a deal for 30,000 tonnes with Mexico which will happen next year and we did a deal for 10,000 tonnes with Tunisia this week.  We will move it, slowly but surely, into markets that are outside the European Union.  The deals are very satisfactory.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I will make a couple of points on the equine sector.  This is a very sensitive sector which is hugely important economically and in terms of employment for the country.  I initiated discussions a year ago between the French, the UK and the Irish to try to see if we could mobilise together those three countries that have 90% of equine activity.  It will be one of the issues to be discussed in any future trading arrangement.<\/p><p>That is progress but the matter will not be easy to solve because there are veterinary and animal health issues in the context of the movement of animals and decisions made at short notice about race meetings and so on.  Members are all very familiar with these issues.  The breeding of animals and all these movements will be tricky to deal with but the matter is on the agenda.  It is on the British agenda, as well as the European Union agenda.  That is a good step.  I met the industry this week to discuss it further.  We want to continue with the tripartite arrangement, if possible.<\/p><p> On young farmers, I have made it a specific objective of the new CAP that one will not get approval for one's plan from any member state unless one is doing something substantial for young farmers.  I am saying to everybody that we will take a strong line on this.  We will build on the excellent document produced by Macra na Feirme and the ideas therein in order to have them implemented at European level.<\/p><p> Taxation is, of course, a competence of the member state.  We have nothing to do that in the European Union and we are unlikely to have for a long time to come.  Taxation measures are matters for the members but we can add value at European Union level to force member states to do more.  That includes opening up.  We have to consider possibilities in regard to internal convergence and entitlements to afford some opportunities in terms of the national reserve and to build on that for young people.  It is a serious problem that will not go away unless we take decisive action.<\/p><p> With regard to greening rules, we are going to abolish the existing greening arrangement.  There will be, in Pillar 1 payments, what we call conditionality in regard to the environment and climate.  We are considering what we can do to say to farmers that in return for the money they are getting, they have to do a little more for the environment and climate.  I cannot say what we are going to do and how it will manifest itself yet but that is the principled position we have taken.  The present greening system has not worked for the environment or farmers and therefore needs to be abolished.  We will take the best of all possible worlds in terms of good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, and cross-compliance and will determine how we can proceed in a less complex way.  I want to reduce the burden of the rules significantly so that if one is doing good work and signing up to a comprehensive plan under CAP, there is more responsibility on the member state and less in terms of the rules that come from Brussels on counting the trees, distances between trees, and distances from buffer strips and ecological focus areas.  We have to get away from this prescriptive approach and give more flexibility.  That is what I mean by flexibility.  Ireland can meet these objectives in a different way from farmers in Spain or Greece.  Therefore, we should give the flexibility.<\/p><p> On unfair trading practices, we have made a basic proposal.  It can now be built upon by the member states and the Parliament.  There is a lot of opposition to this from the big supermarkets and people interested in competition.  We heard this debate in respect of the groceries order in 2006.  We should never have got rid of it.  We were told at the time by the pure economists that there would be a bonanza for consumers in terms of cheap food, that there would be no problem with the level playing pitch for farmers and that farmers would continue to receive a good income.  This was a ridiculous argument.  If one reads the D&aacute;il debates from around 2006 &mdash; I do not have time to do so anymore &mdash; one will note they were very interesting and how wrong the assumptions were at the time in terms of what happened.  There are people who are now very interested in public health issues.  We allowed big supermarkets to open their doors to cheap drink products for young people.  Nobody worries about the damage done to young people by the irresponsible action of abolishing the groceries order on the spurious grounds that it would give a fair boost to consumer spending and reduce the groceries bill of the consumer.  This never happened.  A study of this will show that consumer prices went up rather than down.  Therefore, some of the advocates at the time should be brought back to the committee to learn what went wrong.  It would be a very interesting debate.  I am glad I got that off my chest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1749,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

We should not be apologetic about the CAP or about seeking the maintenance of the CAP budget.  The European taxpayer has got value for money from the CAP.  European farmers have produced high-quality, safe products for European consumers over a long period.  That is what the CAP was designed for.  It has delivered on its objectives.  We should not be apologising for trying to protect the CAP.  I hope there will be agreement in all the member states to increase the contribution to the budget in order that we can maintain the CAP budget.  If we get agreement, we want to make sure the CAP percentage is ring-fenced and that we do not find ourselves with an increased contribution from member states spent on issues that might not be as important as CAP is to the Irish economy.  The ring-fencing of the CAP budget in any increased donations is essential.<\/p><p>The Commissioner talked about Mercosur and said the development in this regard is some way down the road.  It has come to a crossroads on a few occasions and has never reached a conclusion.  We are in CAP negotiations now and there has to be recognition of the concession made by the Commission regarding imports to the European Union and the damage this can do to the European beef sector.  If we are to get more concessions, now is the time to get them in the context of the Mercosur deal.  The fact that such concessions are being made by the Commission gives us a bargaining tool in trying to get a better deal for our beef sector in the future.<\/p><p>The final point I would like to make is on volatility.  The Commissioner talked about skimmed milk powder and the amount in storage.  The fixed price ceiling for the purchase of skimmed milk powder for intervention is suspended for 2018.  I would like the Commissioner's view on the market supports that will exist in<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>the CAP for the period 2020 to 2027.

I totally agree with his comments on the groceries order.  We debated when considering the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill how we dealt with that issue.  I have consistently called for its re-examination.  There is such a gap in the market, with underselling of alcohol as a loss leader to get people into the supermarket.  We legislated for this.  What was occurring was absolutely appalling.  I hope this committee can restart the debate on getting the groceries order back into the frame.<\/p> <p>  The Commissioner mentioned the importance of the CAP budget.  What are his views on the reference years in the original CAP, namely, 2002 and 2003?  If we are to have another CAP for the period to 2027, there will be reference years dating back a quarter of a century.  This should be taken into consideration when thinking about young farmers coming into the system.  Is the Commissioner happy that this is the approach we should be taking at European level to ensure young farmers entering the system have single farm payments to work with?  In many ways, having single farm payments dating back a quarter of a century is one of the key issues that need to be examined in order that the CAP can be sustainable and young farmers entering the landscape can be promoted.  Is it the approach of the Commission to have entitlements dating back 25 years if the new CAP for the period to 2027 is introduced?  Can the Commissioner shed some light on that important issue?<\/p> <p>  I welcome in particular the Commissioner's statement last Friday in Kilkenny that a political agreement was made regarding the three-crop rule.  Could he shed light on when the paperwork will be completed?  Single farm payment applications must be submitted by 15 May.  There is a process that needs to be put in place so they will be above board and legal.  Some of the advisers and Teagasc staff are anxious that the initial paperwork be done so the single farm payment forms can be completed to the letter of the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#F00400","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1752,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner and his team.

At the end of the day, will the Commissioner and the EU decide the new CAP?  What input will member states have into it?<br\/><br\/>With regard to penalties, which the Commissioner has tried to address, could a system be introduced whereby an inspector could give a farmer a yellow card and tell him that he will be back a month later and if everything is not right, it is kaput for him in order that farmers are not afraid of their lives?<br\/><br\/>For the past 16 years, the EU has had a category called the forgotten farmer for those who missed out on entitlements.  The Commissioner and Senator Lombard are correct about the need to get young farmers into the industry.  The farmers in this category have ended up with nothing for 16 years because they did not have a certain amount of stock and so on.  Before Christmas, the EU said they will now be entitled to payments but they will need a linear cut or whatever to get the money.  What incentives will there be for Ireland and other member states to get older farmers to transfer farms?  Unfortunately, many are having accidents,  Will there be an early retirement scheme or something similar?  People were over from the EU before speaking about it.<br\/><br\/>Due to the recent weather problems, we were looking for money to be front-loaded under GLAS and other schemes?  Has the Commissioner any objections?  If farmers want to buy fertiliser, meal and so on and they are in trouble financially, could the Exchequer bring the payments forward by six months?  Does he have a problem with that?<br\/><br\/>The EU is being blamed for the new online system here.  Many elderly farmers may not have broadband and there is concern about filling the new online system up.  As Deputy Healy-Rae pointed out about the suckler herd, we are in trouble.  What are the Commissioner's views on this and the future of the dairy sector?  The IFA and other farming organisations are represented at the meeting.  A big problem is emerging with vulture funds.  Mr. Goodman has bought a large farm off a vulture fund, according to the <i>Irish Farmers Journal<\/i>today.  There are 2,500 farmers in trouble around the country with vulture funds.  Could the Minister ensure low interest loans are made available to them to help them to secure their farms?  They are blackened at the moment but many of their farms could be viable if they are given an opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#F00500","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1754,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner and I am glad we have had a robust discussion on many issues of concern to farming families.  I welcome the fact that he strongly acknowledged in his presentation that incomes must be protected, particularly for those with small and medium-sized farms.  There is a huge concern about suckler farmers.  They are struggling on an average payment of &euro;13,000 a year.  Some of them can afford to diversify but many cannot and that is a serious problem.  The Commissioner mentioned one intervention but this issue needs to be prioritised.  Suckler farmers have become the poor relation in the agriculture industry and they need to be treated fairly.  I welcome the huge campaign on the issue.  Many farming organisations have come out strongly on it, on which I commend them.  Hopefully, we can keep everything going in that regard.<\/p><p>The Mercosur deal is also a huge concern for farmers in Offaly and north Tipperary.  They do not want it to proceed, as they want to protect their livelihoods and the farming community in general.  They have a significant role to play in our exports and we do not need to jeopardise that.<\/p><p>With regard to young farmers, I welcome the reintroduction of agricultural apprenticeships, which was reported in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal<\/i>recently.  That will help matters.  The Commissioner is strong on this issue and he has embraced the Macra na Feirme recommendations.  The main issue for young farmers is income but it has always been an issue for farming families.  The difficulty accessing credit and the burdensome nature of preparing for inspections as well as the fear of inspections are also deterrents for young farmers.  Some went into farming reluctantly to keep their parents satisfied.  They did not apply for schemes because of the fear of inspection.  Inspections need to become more supportive.  High standards and regulations are needed but they need to be more supportive and encouraging to attract young farmers.  There is an interest among young people in agriculture, as indicated by the increase in the number of agriculture courses available through the Central Applications Office last year.  They need more support and encouragement and I hope that can be done because we need to protect the future of Irish farming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#G00200","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1755,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner.

It is a matter for the British Government, which initiated their exit from the European Union.

In trade, generally we make cumulative concessions on beef and we also have to go around the world and get good results, such as the 65,000 tonnes of beef we got from Japan.  There are swings and roundabouts and we have to ensure we improve the situation in Europe at the moment, where beef consumption is going down.

All dairy co-operatives are getting involved so as to have ring-fenced money, with longer terms and at a fixed interest rate, to deal with price volatility in the payment schedule.  These are innovative products which we are trying to build on and they are very welcome.<\/p> <p>  We have to look at entitlements in respect of reference years and many member states have already implemented a new regime but Ireland, Spain and a few other countries have still not adjusted their systems to reflect this.  We are having a conversation internally to see what we need to do and we will say something about it when the legislative proposal is open.  If we are serious about prioritising young farmers we have to see this as a barrier to entry.  The paperwork for the three-crop rule will be completed by 29 May but no member state has objected to date about what we are trying to do.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has to give the official position but I can speak politically and can tell farmers they can sow their corn and will not have any problem with the three-crop rule.<\/p> <p>  We are extending the basic payment scheme applications by one month from 15 May to 15 June because of the weather and other things, if member states wish to take this up.  There is a bit of a logjam and the extension might help people cope with online applications, 100% of which must be completed this year.<\/p> <p>  I can tell Deputy Fitzmaurice that no airlines are going to get money from the Common Agricultural Policy as far as I know.  If the Deputy has any idea who or where they are I would like to know.  We have transferred the active farmer clause to the member state because we could not get the agreement of 28 member states.  Ireland can now change the definition of active farmer as of now, because we did this in the mid-term review, but it has to notify the Commission of what it intends to do by a certain date every year.  The last date was 31 March and I doubt if they applied because I would have heard about it if they had.  For reasons I gave earlier, every member state has different issues relating to active farming but the member state plan, which will be put up in the next reform, will have to be approved by the European Commission.  It will be based around nine objectives, one of which will be in the area of young farmers and generational renewal.  There will be no approval of the plan unless a genuine effort is made by the member state to do something to get more people involved in agriculture.  It is a big change and targets will be set by the member state for what it intends to do.<\/p> <p>  I have brought in approximately 100 changes and simplifications and perhaps the committee should familiarise itself with them.  It is obvious that the Co-Chairman is not familiar with the changes.  The last reform made the policy hugely complex.  I did not introduce greening.  It came at the last minute in order to protect the budget and farmers went along with it on the basis that at least they got the money.  Its implementation was very difficult, however, so I am going to get rid of it.  I hope we are not going to replace it at member state level with something that is more complex so we have to keep an eye on it.  We are going to get rid of a lot of EU rules because they duplicate member state rules and we do not need two sets of rules.  We need more technology rather than physical inspections.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Nolan, I have not come across a farmer who was so afraid of an inspection that they would not apply for a cheque.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1764,"content":"<p>I have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#H00800","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524747600,"counter":1765,"content":"<p>There are a good few of them here and I doubt if they have met anybody who will not apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018042600002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":1766,"content":"<p>I have.

The amendment is being proposed on foot of legal advice to bring additional clarity to section 8 to provide that the relevant activity is required to be authorised by the Environmental Protection Agency and that the person required under the regulations to hold a licence or registration for that purpose shall make such an application.  For the same reason, the Government is proposing amendment No. 7 which involves the deletion of the words &quot;which requires authorisation pursuant to regulations made under section 30(1) or 30(2) shall apply&quot; and their replacement with &quot;which, pursuant to regulations made under section 30(1) or (2), requires authorisation and who is required by those regulations to be a registered person or a licensee in respect of the relevant activity, shall make an application&quot;.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Government is proposing amendment No. 8 which involves the deletion of lines 32 to 39, inclusive, on page 11 of the Bill and their substitution with the following:<\/p><blockquote>(2)(a) Subject to paragraph (b), where the Agency receives an application referred to in subsection (1), the Agency shall decide, based on its regulatory experience and taking into account&mdash;(i) the magnitude of expected or potential doses of radiation, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) the complexity of the relevant activity to which the application relates,whether it is registration or a licence which would be appropriate to be granted in respect of the relevant activity concerned.<br \/><br \/>(b) The Minister may, in regulations made under section 30(1) or (2), provide in respect of a relevant activity that only a licence may be granted and, where provision is so made, the Agency shall, where it receives an application referred to in subsection (1) in respect of the relevant activity, consider the application on the basis that only a licence would be appropriate to be granted in respect of that relevant activity.<\/blockquote> <p>The amendment adds a new subsection (2)(b) to section 29A of the Radiological Protection Act 1991 which provides that the Minister may prescribe that certain activities be subject to licence only.  Certain practices are not appropriate to the new registration system owing to the associated inherent risk.  There are also certain activities which are required to be licensed under European legislation such as certain activities using high activity sealed sources.  The amendment is necessary to ensure the Minister can provide in secondary legislation for parameters and strictures to ensure safety will be paramount in the authorisation of relevant activities and to respond effectively to the future development of practices and use of radiation sources in industry.  The Government is also proposing amendment No. 9 which involves the deletion of the words &quot;made under&quot; on lines 6 and 7 of page 12 and their substitution with the words &quot;referred to in&quot;.  The amendment is being proposed on foot of legal advice to provide a correct reference.<\/p><p>I would also like to set out the position on amendments Nos. 11 and 12 which are being proposed by the Government.  Amendment No. 11 is a drafting amendment which involves the deletion of &quot;periodically.&quot; and its substitution with &ldquo;periodically.&quot;.&quot;.  The extra full stop is necessary to indicate the end of the section.  Amendment No. 12 which involves the deletion of lines 22 to 29 on page 12 of the Bill is being proposed on foot of legal advice.  The purpose of section 8 of the Bill is to give the Minister the necessary powers to make regulations to provide for a graded approach to authorisation and enable the transposition of certain requirements in Council Directive 2013\/59\/EURATOM which is known as the basic safety standards directive.  As the Bill is not the transposing instrument for the directive, the subsection is beyond the scope of this legislation.  Subsection (6), as drafted, transposes Article 27 of the basic safety standards directive.  Our legal advice is that this provision is more appropriate to the transposing instrument - the regulations made under section 30(1) and (2) of the 1991 Act.  The subsection, as drafted, is also misleading because it does not represent an exhaustive list of activities which require authorisation before they may be carried out.  There are other practices that are required to be authorised on foot of other directives such as the importation or exportation for disposal of radioactive waste from the State to another country under Council Directive 2011\/70\/EURATOM which established a Community framework for the responsible and safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste.  There may also be other activities and practices that should fall under this requirement and be considered in the context of the regulations made under section 30(1) and (2) of the 1991 Act.<\/p><p>On section 9 of the Bill, the Government is proposing amendment No. 14 on foot of legal advice.  The amendment involves the deletion of lines 7 to 16 on page 13 of the Bill and their substitution with a new paragraph 3 with the following text:<\/p><blockquote>(3) A relevant activity in respect of which registration or a licence is granted may be carried out in accordance with the registration or licence, as the case may be, from the date on which the particulars referred to in subsection (2) are entered in the register of registered relevant activities or the register of registered licensed activities, as appropriate.<\/blockquote> <p>The amendment clarifies that the operative date from which a registration or licence will come into effect will be the date on which the particulars are entered in the appropriate register.<\/p><p>On section 10 of the Bill, the Government is proposing amendment No. 15 on foot of legal advice.  The amendment involves the deletion of all words from and including &quot;the&quot; where it firstly occurs on line 25 on page 13 of the Bill down to and including &quot;activities&quot; on line 26 and their substitution with &quot;a European act which relates to relevant activities&quot;.  The amendment provides that the Minister may make regulations to provide for cases in which European Acts provide for discretionary measures which would not fall under the definition of &quot;obligations imposed on the State&quot;.<\/p><p>The Government is also proposing amendments Nos. 17 to 21, inclusive, to section 10.  Amendment No. 17 involves the deletion of &quot;subsection (2)&quot; on line 38 of page 13 of the Bill and its replacement with &ldquo;subsection (2A)&quot;.  Amendment No. 18 involves the insertion of the words &quot;addition to those matters referred to in subsection (2A), in&quot; after the word &quot;In&quot; on line 40 of page 13 of the Bill.  Amendment No. 19 involves the deletion of the word &quot;under&quot; on line 29 of page 16 of the Bill and its replacement with the words &quot;referred to in&quot;.  Amendment No. 20 involves the deletion of lines 33 to 37, inclusive, on page 18 of the Bill and their replacement with &quot;(vii) the issuing by the Agency of a licence or of a certificate in respect of a registration, including the form and manner of such a licence or certificate, the manner (including by electronic means) in which it is to be issued and the information it is to contain,&quot;.  Amendment No. 21 involves the insertion of the words &quot;(within the meaning of section 2 of the Principal Act)&quot; after the word &quot;authorisation&quot; on line 34 of page 19 of the Bill.<\/p><p>These are drafting amendments on foot of legal advice to correct cross-references in the text.<\/p><p> On amendment No. 22, the Government proposes, in page 21, line 22, to delete \"(as amended by Part 1)\" and substitute \"(amended by Part 2)\".

One of our concerns is that we are not paying sufficient attention to the issue of radon gas and its effect on health.  The radiological protection agencies have a role in this regard.  I refer to the need for them to report to the Oireachtas to highlight the level of risk.  In particular, as will be seen in later amendments, there is a real concern regarding the lack of attention to mitigating this real risk in rental properties.  It is a risk which can be mitigated at relatively low cost and with significant effect.  As I stated, it is estimated that there are 200 related fatalities a year.  That is the equivalent of the number of road deaths.<\/p><p>It is a failing in the current system that we do not set high conditions on addressing that risk.  I understand it was recommended that such reporting mechanisms would be included in the responsibility of the radiological protection authorities, but that has not been provided for in the legislation.  That is the reason for the proposed insertion of this wording, the obligation &quot;to report annually to the Oireachtas on the implementation of the National Radon Control Strategy&quot;.  It is a hugely significant health issue.  We are not addressing it at present.  This is an opportunity to strengthen the reporting requirements and I hope the Government can support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#C01100","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1863,"content":"<p>I support the amendment from the Green Party.

Many Ministers have gone through the Department since 2002 who have sat on their hands in respect of it.  At long last we are getting movement on it.

On foot of this pilot scheme, once we see what will work on the ground, my intention is to amend the flawed legislation of 2002 and come back with robust legislation that can ensure we address this problem right across the board.<\/p><p>The Government opposes amendment No. 3 as the proposal for the Environmental Protection Agency to report annually to the Oireachtas on the implementation of the national radon control strategy or any successor strategy is not workable for both legal and practical reasons.  The national radon control strategy has not been established on a statutory basis and it follows that statutory reporting obligations cannot be imposed on something that has not been put on a statutory basis.  On a practical level, the proposed amendment is not workable as the implementation of the national radon control strategy is not the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The policy function for tackling radon rests with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The national radon control strategy, chaired by my Department, is a multi-agency approach in improving awareness of and protection from radon gas.  While the Environmental Protection Agency is an important cog in that wheel, it does not provide the chair or secretariat for the strategy implementation group and is not responsible for delivering on the action points in the strategy.<\/p><p>There are 31 identified action points set out in the national radon control strategy and it is intended that all action points will be implemented.  A total of 11 actions are complete, ten actions are on track for completion by next month, and ten further actions will be commenced and will be either completed beyond the strategy end in 2018 or carried out on an ongoing basis.  Key achievements to date include: the establishment and launch of a dedicated website, <i>www.radon.ie<\/i>; the completion and roll-out of targeted training courses on radon remediation for construction site staff, local authorities and contractors; and the establishment of a registration scheme for radon measurement services and radon remediation contractors.<\/p><p>One of the key recommendations made by the strategy relates to financial incentives to encourage householder action on radon.  A comprehensive radon testing and remediation survey will shortly be undertaken to assess the degree of uptake of radon testing and remediation in homes in high-risk radon areas and adjacent lower risk areas and to inform the detailed design of a new financial incentive scheme.<\/p><p>Due to the success of the work programme of the national radon control strategy, I intend to establish a successor strategy on a statutory basis to continue the good work in identifying and remediating radon where it occurs.  In light of the point that the Deputy has raised in his amendment, I will give consideration to how best to inform the Oireachtas Members on its good work as part of that process.<\/p><p>The reports of the current strategy and working group are published and publicly available.  In light of what Deputy Eamon Ryan has said to me, however, I have no issue with laying those reports before the Oireachtas and circulating them directly to members of this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#C01300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1865,"content":"<p>That is a fluffy response.  It talks about multi-departmental responsibility and is long-winded and convoluted.  This is a straightforward issue.  There are maps.  The Minister correctly states there is a website.  The website tells us there are areas of concern, including Mountmellick, Ballylinan and Graiguecullen.  I would ask that some of those areas be included in the pilot project.  Other Deputies will identify areas in their constituencies, but those are three high-risk areas in County Laois that need to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  This is simple.  The question for us is whether every house, every new build and every extension is being fitted with radon barriers.<\/p><p>We need a testing system for homes to determine which homes have radon barriers in the high-risk red zones.  We do not want every house in the country tested.  In the towns that are high risk, such as Ballylynan and Mountmellick, we should ensure that tests can be done very easily to determine what is there and then we should put a scheme in place.  I do not want to hold up the discussion of the amendment.  It is a very good amendment.  We should have a short session dedicated to this.  It is all over the place and that is no disrespect to the Minister.  When everyone is involved, it is nobody's responsibility.  Radon is a serious issue and is killing people.  We have a responsibility in the House to legislate for it.

I was slightly confused because he said at the start it is not possible to accept this amendment because the radon strategy reports are not statutory and therefore we cannot have a statutory provision.  At the end he says he is willing to lay the reports he has to hand before the Oireachtas, which in a sense is exactly what we are looking to do with the amendment, to report annually.  I might come back on Report Stage to see if there are other examples where non-statutory reports are laid before the House on a statutory basis.  I do not see that as a reason why it cannot be done.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the various agencies and where the authority lies, my understanding is the key role of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is as the expert in identifying risk areas.  That is the significant information.  It is really important.  When we are aware, as Deputy Stanley says, of those red zones, then we really have to kick into action to make sure all houses - not just rental houses although there is a particular problem in those - including new builds are covered.  We are talking about taking action that will save five lives a week and prevent the huge trauma that comes with lung cancer that arises from proximity to these gases.  It can be alleviated at relatively low cost.  That is the really critical point.  It is not an impossible issue to address if one has good information. <\/p> <p>  I will return to the core point about providing the detailed analysis from the EPA or other agencies in a public way in order that landlords, homeowners, builders, public services and others will target the problem that exists.  I stand by the amendment.  I might come back on whether it is legally possible to have a statutory call to report on something that does not have a statutory provision.  If it is the case, maybe the Minister could come back with an amendment that would give the report the statutory footing to allow us to do it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#D00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1868,"content":"<p>How does the amendment stand?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#D00300","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1869,"content":"<p>I will press the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#D00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1870,"content":"<p>I will allow the Minister in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#D00500","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1871,"content":"<p>I have learned a lot in dealing with this legislation.  It has really opened my eyes.  It was my intention to do as Deputy Stanley proposed and introduce a national scheme to deal with radon gas and I was determined to do it.  It has been kicked around for long enough.  We are talking about five or six deaths every week, never mind the number of people who end up in hospital and in treatment for this on top of that.  It is a huge drain on the resources of the State.  For small money we can have a massive impact on health outcomes in this country.  There is absolutely no argument on that.  I have spent the past 12 months trying to put a scheme in place but because of the legislation that was enacted in 2002, it is not possible for me to do that unless I amend the 2002 Act with a detailed scheme.  I have learned that by putting something into legislation it makes it more difficult to do the right thing.  That is why we are looking at a very tight and quick pilot to look at how a scheme would run effectively in order that we can come back, amend the legislation and bring forward a proper scheme to cover every home in the country, whether rental or owner occupied.<\/p> <p>  Following on from Deputy Eamon Ryan's point, the advice I have is I cannot put a statutory provision in this legislation.  As a result of my experience of the scheme that is already there, I am very slow to put in place a statutory provision that could complicate matters when getting this scheme up and running in the future.  There should not be any reason not to have a reporting structure in place.  I will not try to impede it.  I am quite willing to look at it again.  I am also quite willing to look at any suggestions or examples of where there is a statutory provision.  I have no difficulty providing the information.  It is not an issue.  I am committing, as Minister, that the information will be laid before the Oireachtas and will be circulated to members of the committee.  I have absolutely no problem if members want to come in and have a broader debate on the implementation of the radon strategy and go through it.  I have no difficulty with that.  I have a difficulty with writing it in black and white without a statutory footing in place.  That difficulty arises as a result of the legal advice I got and from my experience with the 2002 scheme, which is not fit for purpose and which is now creating a barrier to me implementing a scheme across the country. <\/p> <p>  To answer Deputy Ryan's question, the areas identified across the country are identified by the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI.  It has identified from geology where the red zones and amber zones are.  We will look at it again.  If the Deputies have suggestions I am quite happy to look at them.  The advice I have is I cannot write it into statute without a legal provision being there but I am quite willing and give a commitment here to circulate the reports when they become available.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#D00600","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1872,"content":"<p>How stands the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#D00700","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1873,"content":"<p>I will press the amendment and return to it on Report Stage.

New politics is all well and good but at the end of the day, we are legislators.  We are supposed to bringing forward legislation that is legally sound.  I just want to mark my disappointment in regard to that because I am someone who spent a long time on the Opposition benches and who spent a lot of time drafting amendments.  I am quite willing to accept, and I am open to, amendments and I have spoken to my officials in that regard.  However, I would appreciate some assistance from the Opposition to ensure that whatever legislation is brought forward is actually legally sound.<br\/><br\/>The Government opposes amendment No. 4 for both legal and policy reasons.  Paragraph (<i>h<\/i>) of section 8 of the principal Act assigns a function to the Environmental Protection Agency to make recommendations on pre-existing legislative proposals by Ministers for legislation that contains measures for the protection against radiological hazards.  The amendment as drafted is not workable as the Oireachtas as an entity does not make legislative proposals.  If the intent of the amendment is to extend the current function, in that the Environmental Protection Agency should make recommendations on Private Members' Bills initiated by Members of the Oireachtas, the Government would oppose this for the reason of policy and potential cost.<br\/><br\/>The policy function for the environment area, including radiological hazards, rests with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  While certain functions are delegated in legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency role is to inform and facilitate the Minister in his or her exercise of those functions.  The Minister is responsible for the formulation and implementation of radiological policy and is directly accountable to the Oireachtas in this regard.<br\/><br\/>It would not be appropriate for the Environmental Protection Agency to bypass the Minister and to make recommendations directly on Private Members' Bills.  Any recommendations by the Environmental Protection Agency need to be considered by the Minister in the wider context of Government policy and a proper assessment of potential regulatory and legal impacts provided by the Minister's Department.  As part of the legislative process, the Government's considered views on Private Members' Bills, as informed by expertise resident in the various Departments and agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, are conveyed by the Minister with functional responsibility for the area.  The Minister is then responsible and accountable for implementing any such legislation.<br\/><br\/>Any attempt to undermine or bypass a Minister's responsibility or accountability to the Oireachtas raises constitutional implications that would require detailed legal scrutiny.  Irrespective of the policy and potential constitutional issues that this amendment raises, there is no costing for the impact of this amendment on the Environmental Protection Agency budget and I am not convinced that this would represent a good use of its resources.<br\/><br\/>The Government opposes amendment No. 5.  Both the principle and the details are already for in section 7 of the principal Act.  Paragraph 1(<i>d<\/i>) assigns the general function to the Environmental Protection Agency to advise the Government, the Minister and other Ministers of the Government on radiological safety matters relating to the transport, use, storage, maintenance and disposal of radiation sources, wheresoever located.<br\/><br\/>Paragraph 1(<i>c<\/i>) further assigns the general function to the Environmental Protection Agency to advise the Government, the Minister and other Ministers of the Government and the public on measures for the protection of individuals in the State from radiological hazards.  The function of the Environmental Protection Agency to advise the Government, the Minister and other Ministers of the Government on radiological safety matters is comprehensive and is not restricted by geographical location, type or purpose of the radiation source.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#D02400","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1890,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1891,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 5 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1892,"content":"<p>Section 5 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1893,"content":"<p>Sections 6 and 7 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1894,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1895,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<\/p><blockquote>In page 11, lines 22 to 24, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;which&rdquo; in line 22 down to and including &ldquo;apply&rdquo; in line 24 and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;which, pursuant to regulations made under section 30(1) or (2), requires authorisation and who is required by those regulations to be a registered person or a licensee in respect of the relevant activity, shall make an application&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#E00700","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1896,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1897,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 7:<\/p><blockquote>In page 11, lines 28 and 29, to delete &ldquo;which requires authorisation pursuant to regulations made under section 30(1) or 30(2) shall apply&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;which, pursuant to regulations made under section 30(1) or (2), requires authorisation and who is required by those regulations to be a registered person or a licensee in respect of the relevant activity, shall make an application&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#E00900","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524733200,"counter":1898,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1899,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 8, 12 and 13 are related.

It is not my responsibility to determine the education and training and capacity and capability of medical professionals to use this equipment.<\/p> <p>  What we have done in this legislation is to make it clearer, far more transparent, far more streamlined and easier for whatever health professional is going to use this equipment to get licences and to be able to use it.<\/p><p>We streamlined the process and made it far more transparent.  However, only the Department of Health can decide who may apply to use it in a health context.  We can do as much as we are able in that regard but, ultimately, only the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, with the advice of the chief medical officer, can declare which health professionals may utilise it.  One would not expect me, as Minister, to be decide upon such matters in respect of any other profession.  I do not have the necessary expertise in the area.  Most members would agree the Department is quite busy anyway without dealing with the health aspects of this issue.<\/p><p> I will read out my prepared reply, which may be helpful to Deputy Stanley.  I accept his point on this issue.  He is probably correct.  This is a discussion that must take place when the statutory instrument is ready.  It would probably make far more sense for a draft statutory instrument to be circulated first but that is a matter for the Minister for Health.  I will express that view to him on foot of our discussion here.  I give a commitment to relay, through my officials, to the Minister for Health that it would be helpful for the draft statutory instrument to be circulated in advance of it being signed.<\/p><p> The Government opposes this amendment as it requires the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to adjudicate on or consider matters that are beyond the competency of the agency.  The Environmental Protection Agency does not regulate the professional conduct or competence of professions and has no function in determining the levels of education or professional development necessary to carry out procedures using radiation sources.  Section 7(2) of the principal Act provides that the function of the Environmental Protection Agency in respect of the use of radioactive substances, materials or sources, radiation sources and radiation generators as a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic agent for the purpose of the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of any human ailment, infirmity, injury or defect is limited to the supervision and care of the radioactive substance, materials or sources, radiation sources and radiation generators concerned, as well as ensuring that the said radioactive substances, materials or sources, radiation sources and radiation generators are properly calibrated and maintained.  In short, the role of the Environmental Protection Agency is to regulate the equipment used in such practices and ensure it is fit for purpose.<\/p><p> I recall that Deputy Stanley raised the issue of chiropractors on Second Stage of the Bill and I remind him that the designation of competent practitioners for the purposes of carrying out medical procedures is a matter for the Minister for Health and beyond the scope of the Bill.  However, I note the comments that have been made and will relay them to the Minister for Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#E01700","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1907,"content":"<p>I am happy for the Minister to so do, as long as the issue is being addressed.

A concern has been raised by the Irish Association of Physicists in Medicine, which has great knowledge of these practices, in regard to registration being a permanent and once-off process without any subsequent checks, renewals or inspections.  Once a practitioner is registered, that is it.  In any circumstance, if a test must be met and a person does so but then no longer has to worry about it, it is easy for practices and standards to subsequently slip or compliance levels to fall.  The concern is that there is merit in requiring a renewal of the licence or registration or an audit, check or some kind of renewal process.  There was previously an EPA system for licence renewal but, if I am reading the legislation correctly, that will be dropped and the registration will be a one-off.  When the EPA was doing those licence checks, it was difficult for it to get evidence of compliance.  It seems somewhat paradoxical that we are taking away the requirement to look for evidence of compliance in a situation where sometimes there is difficulty in getting such evidence.  We are giving practitioners a free run in terms of there being once-off registration and that not having to be revisited or renewed when there has previously been difficulty in getting evidence of compliance.  I raise this in the context of the Bill and the registration process but it seems good practice that such registration would have to be renewed periodically or revisited.  I am interested in the Minister's views in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12018042600002#F01900","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1925,"content":"<p>I see from where Deputy Lawless is coming but the legislation turns the practice in this area on its head.  The Bill provides for a single point at which one applies for a licence but there will be ongoing inspections in that regard.  There may have previously been issues with compliance but a different approach to regulation was taken until now.  We now have a graded approach relating to use and risk, which are assessed.  As I stated in reply to Deputy Stanley, a process will be agreed between the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the EPA in that regard.  One must remember that there is ongoing training, registration and monitoring of these professions.  We are discussing radiation, radiation sources and equipment, which will be addressed by ongoing inspection.  We are trying to get rid of unnecessary bureaucracy, which causes duplication.  Either one is competent to use this equipment or one is not.  The equipment and paperwork will be inspected on an ongoing basis.  Practitioners must also register with their professional body, which will ensure they are competent to operate the equipment.<\/p> <p>  I had a note drafted in response to amendment No. 10 and to assist the Deputy I will read it into the record.

I would also like to provide members with an overview of current peacekeeping missions and to acknowledge the vital role played by the Defence Forces overseas in this anniversary year of Ireland&rsquo;s first participation on a UN mission in 1958.<\/p> <p>  In terms of CSDP, Ireland is a strong proponent of the important role the EU can play in support of international peace and security and the UN.  It is important, therefore, to remain fully engaged in all CSDP processes.  Fully participating in these developments ensures that we have a voice and can influence their evolution.  At a time when the world has become a more unstable and insecure place, Ireland remains fully supportive of the efforts of EU member states, within the treaty provisions, to improve the Union's capacity to respond to the challenging security environment, including in the area of defence.  Those efforts are being advanced through the implementation of the EU global strategy of foreign policy and security, the Commission&rsquo;s European defence action plan and enhanced co-operation with international partners, including the UN and NATO.<\/p><p>Ireland's approach to these matters will always be both constructive and realistic.  We remain strong supporters of initiatives which improve the capacity of the EU to contribute to international peace and security, particularly in support of the UN and to delivering the necessary capabilities in this regard.  Our engagement with our EU colleagues through CSDP currently involves participation in a number of areas.<br\/><br\/>The Foreign Affairs Council (Defence) held in Brussels on 6 March included an exchange of views on PESCO and on CSDP missions and operations.  This was an important opportunity for Ministers to come together to take stock of the PESCO initiative to date and to chart a realistic yet progressive way forward.  Discussions were open and constructive and were followed by the adoption of a Council decision detailing the first set of PESCO projects and a Council recommendation on the way forward regarding PESCO implementation.  Key areas discussed in respect of the way forward for PESCO were the specific rules governing PESCO projects and the participation of exceptional third states.  As members are aware, the Government and the D&aacute;il approved Ireland's participation in PESCO - along with 24 fellow EU member states - last December. The establishment of PESCO represents a further important development in EU co-operation in support of international peace and security under CSDP.  Under PESCO, member states will come together in different groups to develop and make available additional capabilities and enablers for peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  Participation in PESCO and specific PESCO projects will enable our Defence Forces to further develop their capabilities in support of peacekeeping through collaboration in joint projects with like-minded partners.  Joint projects should also drive down the costs of developing and procuring capabilities.  Ireland is participating in two PESCO projects as part of the first tranche of PESCO projects agreed via the Council decision by the Foreign Affairs Council (Defence) in March this year.  Ireland is participating in the German-led project to develop a centre of excellence for EU military training missions and the Greek-led upgrade of maritime surveillance systems.  Ireland's participation in PESCO also involves fulfilling a number of common commitments that are detailed in the national implementation plan, NIP.  Ireland and other participating member states recently received general feedback on the first NIPs and will participate in further discussions in this area.<br\/><br\/>Improving military mobility also features as one of the PESCO projects, with the Netherlands as the lead nation and with the participation of 24 member states.  Ireland has observer status on this project for the purpose of keeping abreast of developments in the area.  This issue has gained prominence on the EU agenda given difficulties that countries have experienced in moving their troops through other EU countries for the purposes of training and exercises.  Perceived obstacles, such as diplomatic clearance and customs requirements, as well as the ability of the EU transport infrastructure to carry heavy military equipment, have been identified.  On 28 March 2018, the joint communication regarding the action plan on military mobility was published by President Juncker and the High Representative, Ms Mogherini.  The action plan builds on the roadmap on military mobility developed in the framework of the European Defence Agency, EDA, and covers a number of areas, which are military requirements, infrastructure, dangerous goods, customs and VAT, as well as cross-border movement permission.  These actions are not restricted to the defence area alone but affect areas for which the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Revenue Commissioners, among others, are responsible.  The action plan recognises that full respect will be given to the sovereignty of EU member states over their national territory and national decision-making processes regarding military movements.  Ireland welcomes this recognition that our constitutional requirements and national sovereignty relating to this issue cannot be overlooked.  The action plan is submitted to the EU member states for consideration and endorsement with the first actions expected to be carried out in the coming months.<br\/><br\/>The co-ordinated annual review on defence, CARD, aims to create greater transparency amongst member states by sharing information on future defence policy, capability development, budgets and investment by member states.  Ireland recognises that CARD could potentially offer opportunities to pool capability requirements and provide a more economic and efficient means of equipment procurement.  It could also assist capability development for the Defence Forces by combining with others procuring similar equipment and services.  Participation in CARD is open to all member states on a voluntary basis, recognising that the defence policies of member states, including defence spending and capabilities, are entirely a national competence.  The detailed implementation and information sharing requirements for CARD have been developed by the EDA and are currently being tested through a trial run that commenced in the autumn of 2017.  Ireland is co-operating actively with regard to CARD and a bilateral meeting as part of the CARD trial run took place between Ireland and the EDA on 14 December 2017.  A report to Ministers on the trial run will be made in November 2018 with the first full CARD expected to be launched in autumn 2019.<br\/><br\/>Following on from the adoption of the European defence action plan by the College of Commissioners in November 2016, the European Commission launched the European defence fund last June.  The purpose of the fund is to promote research and innovation and contribute to the strengthening of the European defence technology and industrial base and to further stimulate the development of key defence capabilities.  The fund is divided into two strands or windows, namely, research and capability development and acquisition.  The main feature of the capability development and acquisition strand is the proposed European defence industrial development programme.  It is proposed that the programme will be funded from the EU budget.  The focus of the fund is on the development of new research and technology in the defence sector.  Activities under both the research and capability development and acquisition windows will be linked to defence capability priorities agreed by member states.  Ireland sees the fund as a means of supporting the development of EU military capabilities for CSDP operations.  The regulation on the European defence industrial development programme is expected to be finalised in May 2018 in order to facilitate financing of projects in 2019.<br\/><br\/>A key embodiment of CSDP in real terms is Ireland's participation in EU battle groups.  Participation in EU battle groups supports the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces, together with improved interoperability with like-minded states.  Ireland's participation also reflects our support for the UN.  Successive Secretaries General of the UN have endorsed the development of the EU battle group concept and our participation therein.  Ireland's active engagement in EU battle groups demonstrates its commitment to the development of EU capabilities in the area of crisis management and contributes to our overall credibility within the Union.  It also enhances our capacity to influence the ongoing development and evolution of the rapid response capacity of the EU, particularly the role battle groups can play in reinforcing and acting as a strategic reserve for UN blue-hat operations.  Participation in EU battle groups further supports our international security and defence policy by helping to secure essential partners for future UN operations.  Ireland has participated in the EU battle groups on a number of occasions commencing with the Nordic battle group in 2008.  On 6 February 2018, the Government approved Ireland's participation in the German-led EU battle group 2020, which will be on stand-by for the second six months of 2020.  The total number of Defence Forces personnel expected to be involved will be approximately 148.  However, this level of resource commitment will only arise should the battle group be called on to undertake an operation and should Ireland agree to participate.  The Government decision to participate in the 2020 battle group does not presume any future decision regarding deploying the Defence Forces on an actual battle group operation.  Ireland's participation in an actual battle group operation would, as always, be subject to the usual triple-lock requirements of a UN mandate and Government and D&aacute;il approval, as appropriate, in accordance with the Defence Acts.  Ireland continues to retain the absolute right to determine for itself, on a case-by-case basis, whether it will participate in any particular battle group operation.<br\/><br\/>In July 2017, I secured Government and D&aacute;il approval for the deployment of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to serve as part of the EU naval operation against human smugglers and traffickers in the southern central Mediterranean entitled Operation Sophia.  In the course of the subsequent deployment of <i>L&Eacute; Niamh<\/i>from October to December 2017 as part of Operation Sophia, the crew took part in search and rescue operations rescuing 613 migrants and assisting with a further 107 migrant rescues.  In addition, the Irish vessel also undertook activities in support of the core task of the mission including gathering information on oil smuggling, patrols focusing on countering illegal arms trafficking, operations to intercept smugglers and monitoring the effectiveness of the Libyan navy and coastguard activity.<\/p><p>Together with other European Union member states, Ireland must continue to play its part in addressing the migrant crisis.<\/p><p> In February the Government again approved the continued participation of the Naval Service in Operation Sophia.  This will involve a total of two naval vessels deployed consecutively during the year for approximately 30 weeks.  The Naval Service deployment will run from mid-April to the end of November.  Operation Sophia&rsquo;s mission is to identify, capture and dispose of vessels and enabling assets used or suspected of being used by migrant smugglers or traffickers, which includes the capture and disposal of weapons and oil in the possession of smugglers or traffickers.  The objectives of the operation are not only to disrupt the activities of smugglers and traffickers but also to prevent further loss of life at sea and reduce the suffering and exploitation of migrants by countering and challenging the criminal organisations engaged in such activities.<\/p><p> EU-NATO co-operation is a feature of the defence landscape within the European Union, given that 23 of the 28 member states are also members of NATO.  Sharing strategic interests and facing similar security challenges, NATO and the European Union co-operate on issues of common interest, particularly in the areas of crisis management, new security threats and capability development.  A key focus of this co-operation is to avoid duplication of effort in the development of military capabilities and structures, systems and interoperability standards.  Co-operation across both organisations also ensures maximum synergy where both are deployed in the same theatre, for example, in the Balkans, the Mediterranean, the Horn of Africa and Afghanistan.  In the face of new and emerging security challenges, in particular, cyber and transnational crime, as well as international terrorism, co-operation is essential in developing an effective and comprehensive response to these more complex security challenges.<\/p><p> In 2017 work continued on a common set of proposals for the implementation of the joint declaration on EU-NATO co-operation.  The declaration was made on 8 July 2016 and highlights areas for further co-operation.  They focus on co-operation in the key areas of countering hybrid threats, operational co-operation that includes maritime issues, cybersecurity and defence, defence capabilities, defence industry and research, and exercises and capacity building.  On 14 June 2017 a joint progress report on implementation on the common set of proposals was issued.  A further set of new additional proposals building on the key areas set out was agreed to on 5 December 2017, including new topics such as counterterrorism, military mobility and women, peace and security.  In conclusions from 14 December 2017 the European Council requested that work proceed in implementing the full set of proposals, including the additional proposals agreed to in December 2017.<\/p><p> Ireland welcomes greater EU-NATO co-operation where it contributes to international peace and security and is focused on avoiding duplication of structures, systems and interoperability standards.  This ensures better coherence and effectiveness on the ground in peace support and crisis management operations.  It is important to note that the 2016 declaration confirms that EU-NATO co-operation will fully respect the decision-making autonomy of both organisations and not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of any member state.  This is a strong acknowledgement that Ireland&rsquo;s policy of neutrality and non-NATO membership will in no way be affected by enhanced co-operation.<\/p><p> Ireland has always been a strong supporter of the United Nations and UN-mandated peacekeeping operations.  Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and has been an important dimension in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations as a member of the United Nations and the European Union.  A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations.  In that regard, Ireland has taken seriously its obligation under the United Nations charter to make available to the Security Council armed forces, assistance and facilities in order to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s peacekeeping story began in the Lebanon in 1958, when 50 members of the Permanent Defence Force were deployed as military observers with the UN observer group in Lebanon.  Ireland&rsquo;s first troop contribution came shortly after in 1960, with its deployment to the UN mission in the Congo.  Defence Forces personnel have since served in peace support missions all over the world, including Europe, Africa, the Middle East, the Far East and South America.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in UN and UN-mandated peacekeeping missions is a tangible demonstration of its commitment to the pursuit of international peace and security.  We can be justifiably proud that since our first deployment to the Middle East in 1958 not a day has passed without a member of the Permanent Defence Force being on peacekeeping duty somewhere in the world.  It is a very practical expression of the values in which we believe and our commitment to the United Nations.  This commitment is also expressed in our engagement in the European Union's Common Security and Defence Policy.<\/p><p> Today over 640 Irish men and women are serving on UN duties, with the majority serving in the Middle East, including Ireland&rsquo;s current contribution of some 375 personnel participating in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.  This is a very significant contribution in the context of the resources available for defence.  In all my interactions with mission and political leaders in the host countries during my recent visit overseas what was clearly evident was the respect and high regard they held for the professionalism displayed by Irish peacekeepers.  When abroad on peacekeeping duties, the Defence Forces are representing Ireland in a very visible and special way and it is a source of pride for people at home in Ireland.<\/p><p> The Defence Forces and the wider defence organisation are making an invaluable contribution to international peace and security and conflict resolution.  This is achieved through their professionalism and competence by engaging with the United Nations, the European Union, NATO, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and other international engagements within a bilateral context.  <\/p><p> I have broadly outlined the current state of play in a number of international dimensions of Irish defence policy.  Committee members have been provided with briefing material on the specific topics mentioned and I look forward to positive engagement on matters they wish to discuss.  Next week I will be travelling to the informal ministerial meeting in Sofia where some of the issues I have highlighted will feature on the agenda for further discussion.  I welcome opportunities such as this which stimulate debate in the area of security and defence and can ultimately contribute to public discourse.  I thank the committee for its kind invitation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018042600002#A00300","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1977,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed presentation.

Will he update us on where the proposals stand and the timeframe in that regard?  <\/p> <p>  The Minister of State has mentioned overseas personnel and the wonderful work they do.

Whoever leaked it or gave the information to the reporter was misinformed.  The Deputy is aware of the report of the Public Service Pay Commission published in May 2017.  Members of the Defence Forces are highlighted throughout the report.  The public service stability programme to restore core pay to 2020 was agreed to last year and members of the Defence Forces will see core pay rise between now and 2020.  The Public Service Pay Commission is looking at specialist pay and there have been negotiations between the Department, unions and military management in the past few months.<\/p><p>Military management was asked to submit a discussion document only.  It did so in late February this year.  It was negotiated in March and into April.  From the document, on which the media were briefed last Sunday, came the submission on pilot retention in the Air Corps.  It was submitted to the Public Service Pay Commission a number of weeks ago.  We are working on further evidence-based data for the rest of the organisation that will be submitted to the commission.  I want to have them submitted as soon as possible.  Officials of my Department are working with military management in preparing an evidence-based submission to the commission.<\/p><p> On foot of the exact document submitted by military management to my Department in February 2017, a submission on pilot retention has been prepared and sent to the Public Service Pay Commission.  It annoys me to hear it alleged that my Department is sitting on something.  That is totally untrue.  I take the allegation almost personally because I know exactly how hard the officials in my Department are working on the submission.  To say they are not working on it is totally untrue.  I ask people to reflect on what appeared in the newspaper.<\/p><p> On the gap analysis, the Deputy is correct.  This is a White Paper project which was brought forward under my instructions.  I expect work to begin on the gap analysis project and the White Paper in the next month or two.  My priority is the submission to the Public Service Pay Commission.  Military management has raised it with me as its priority.  It is also my priority to get this issue sorted out.  When that is done, we will work on the gap analysis and the White Paper.<\/p><p> On my appointment in May 2016, I initiated the initiative on entry and re-entry.  I am sometimes frustrated by the number of times it has to go between the Department, management and the representative associations.  This is something that will happen and I am determined to make it happen.  The military organisation has to change.  If one examines our counterparts in Europe and beyond, one notes that people who leave the military organisation and gain what may be vital experience in the private sector should be given an opportunity to bring it back to the organisation.  The next chief of staff of the Australian defence forces will be a re-entrant.  He gained considerable experience in the private sector and has re-entered the military to share his experience.<\/p><p> Direct entry has happened in the Naval Service.  It is working quite well, but I want it to work right throughout the organisation, including the Air Corps and the Army.<\/p><p> On re-entry, a number of people, mainly officers and pilots, have come to me to say they want to re-enter the organisation.  They have gained experience elsewhere and seen life on the other side, but terms and conditions have to be worked out before we can sign off on it.  I understand and hope I can sign off before the end of June, or perhaps in July.<\/p><p> Over 640 personnel are serving overseas.  As I stated, the Naval Service departed to engage in Operation Sophia last Sunday week.  It is great to see members of the Air Corps and the Naval Service serving alongside members of the Army in the likes of UNDOF and Lebanon through UNIFIL.<\/p><p> The 60th anniversary of the United Nations is coming up, as is the 40th anniversary of UNIFIL.  Both anniversaries will be marked.  A civil team and a military team will come up with an appropriate ceremony.  I want every member of the Defence Forces who served overseas in the past 60 years, from the time of the Congo mission until today, to participate.  I hope something can be done in each barracks across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018042600002#C00400","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":1981,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Jack Chambers who is to be followed by Senator Gabrielle McFadden.

Unless the Minister of State addresses that issue, it is stated the current trend of premature voluntary retirement is not sustainable and that the Defence Forces &quot;cannot continue to commit such a high proportion of its resources to training increasingly large recruit and cadet intakes to the detriment of enhancing and evolving its capabilities to meet the threats of a dynamic operating environment&quot;.  Members are leaving <i>en masse<\/i>.  They are doing so because the Government has not adequately addressed issues concerning pay and conditions, as demonstrated by the University of Limerick study of the health and safety concerns.

This turnover is a race to the bottom and until the Minister of State plugs the hole, we will face serious consequences.

It has peeled away over many years.  People who may have been injured on duty may have to wait up to two years, like anyone else, for an appointment.  There are consequences of this.  PDFORRA has had to introduce an initiative for its members for upfront diagnostics because it could, for example, impact on a soldier's ability to get promoted.  If a medical problem has not been addressed or resolved the personnel could be retired on the basis that they are not getting the treatment they need.

I do, however, need to ask some of the questions.  I never doubt the Minister of State's pride in the Defence Forces, and I never doubt his or Fine Gael's commitment to the Defence Forces.  We all know that pay and conditions are obviously a huge issue.  I appreciate that the military management submitted their document to the Department, which has forwarded it to the Public Service Pay Commission.  That is, however, all taking a very long time.  While this process is happening, members of the Defence Forces are applying for family income support.  Some members of the Defence Forces are sleeping in their cars.  As a proud supporter of the Defence Forces I cannot accept that any member of the Defence Forces who wears the uniform with pride should ever have to rely on family income support.  I cannot accept that we have to wait for the Public Service Pay Commission to come back on this.  It should be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  Previous speakers spoke of retention, which is a huge issue.  From information the Minister of State gets on the ground, what is the morale of soldiers? From what I hear it is not very positive.  Pay for duty is a way we can restore pay for Defence Forces personnel.  This is vital for the serving members.<\/p> <p>  I was at Farmleigh House for the launch of the White Paper, but there were not too many others there on the day.  It was a great day.

The Naval Service deployed on Operation Sophia last Sunday week.  A total of 54 personnel is participating in that operation.  Since Ireland entered into Operation Sophia the Naval Service has been gathering information on oil smuggling, has focused patrols on countering illegal arms trafficking, has operations around intercepting smugglers and is monitoring the effectiveness of the Libyan coastguard and navy.  There is a perception that when the Naval Service picks up migrants they are brought back to the Libyan coastline.  That could not be further from the truth; they are actually brought to Italy to a safe haven.<\/p><p>Any migrant that the Irish Defence Forces picked up was either transferred to another vessel and then transported, or we transported him or her ourselves.  It is one or the other.<\/p><p> The family income supplement was raised.  Fewer than 100 members of the Defences Forces are in receipt of the family income supplement.  I think \"family income supplement\" is a bad name for it.  It is a family payment.  There are many people in different organisations in the private and public sectors who are in receipt of the family payment.  It is there for a specific reason depending on the circumstances of a family.  A three-star private, who is on &euro;27,000, could have five kids, for example.  Do we increase the salary for that person because he has five kids?  The reason the family income supplement is there is to support that person because he - or she - has five kids; I do not want to be sexist by just saying \"he\".  We cannot just increase someone's salary by 20% because he or she has five kids.  That is the reason for the family income supplement, which is now more appropriately called the family payment.  Between the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, I think there are 165 or 170 personnel in receipt of the family income supplement.  There are members of staff in the Department of Defence and right across every Department in receipt of it.  I am not sure how many members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are in receipt of it.  Family circumstances are the reason for that payment.<\/p><p> The morale of the soldiers was raised.  If there is one thing I do, it is to speak to the soldiers.  We would not have an Army without the enlisted and the privates.  For me, that is the Army.  We depend on them.  They are the guys and women who will go to the front line.  The officers do an outstanding job as do all members of the Defence Forces.  No one has come to me about sleeping in cars.  This is another rumour that is out there.  I have spoken to PDFORRA and there is assistance available, whether a family income supplement payment, support through the representative organisations or support through the Defence Forces themselves or the Department; there is support out there for these people.  I believe if anyone was sleeping in a car, I would know about it by now.  This rumour is going on since I came into government in 2011.  They were even sleeping in cars when Deputy Chambers's party was in government.

I am not going to dispute that.  We have been competing through a very buoyant economy over the past two or three years.  This has always been the case.  When the economy was buoyant back in the early 2000s, there were people leaving the Defence Forces and going into the private sector.  I outlined to the Deputy the work I am doing with civil and military management on the Public Service Pay Commission.  There is and has been pay restoration across the board from very senior level right down to the more junior ranks.  One of the issues I addressed when I came in was the pre-2013 and post-2013 entrants.  We brought that back up and gave them a 20% increase, bringing their pay back up to &euro;27,000.  That was a &euro;5,000 increase for a new entrant coming in as a three-star private.<\/p> <p>  We have given military management a budget for 9,500 personnel.  There is a full budget there for all of that.  It is not up to me to do the recruitment.  I and the Department will assist but the Defence Forces and military management have taken responsibility for recruitment into the Defence Forces.  That is within their space.  We provide the budget and they do the recruitment.  There is a recruitment campaign open at the moment which is closing next Sunday night.  There was recruitment in September and October of last year as well.<\/p> <p>  There were gaps within the junior ranks of the officer corps.  Under my instruction in 2016, the number of cadets was increased to 100 between the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Army.  The biggest cadet classes in the history of the Defence Forces are going through at this moment.  On Monday of this week, I met with cadets commissioned from the ranks.  It is the first time in ten years we have a cadet class being commissioned from the ranks.  There are 23 of them being brought forward.  That is something I am very proud of and have worked on.  It is very important that we give the junior ranks an opportunity to become officers of the Defence Forces.  There are outstanding members and enlisted personnel who should be given the same opportunity as anybody else to progress through the organisation.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the University of Limerick study and said there were health and safety concerns.  I have been assured by the chief of staff that if there are health and safety concerns, I will know about them.

Now that we are dealing with the Public Service Pay Commission, the team has identified a number of the gaps in the data and so on, so the work that has been done on the pay commission will be able to work directly into the gap analysis.  The largest gaps are in the junior ranks, specifically the ranks of captain, lieutenant and sub-lieutenant.  The reason I brought in the biggest cadet classes in 2016 and 2017 - I hope to do so again in 2018 - as well as commissions from the ranks, is to address the gaps within the officer corps.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the RACO budget issue, RACO has been in conversation with officials from my Department, who have subsequently been in contact with and, I understand, met officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this issue.

It will not affect us for the next three to four years but it will be an issue down the line because of the retirement age for members of the Defence Forces.  This is being worked on.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers spoke about Brexit.  We have an assistant secretary - as a matter of fact, the assistant secretary who is with me today - who is responsible for Brexit within the Department of Defence and who attends all the meetings in this regard.  I will not say we have a full Brexit team but we have personnel within the Department who are working on this with the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade and other Departments.  As the Deputy will understand, security on the Border and so on is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will, under aid to the civil power, provide assistance into the future, as we did in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s - indeed, as we have always done.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers also spoke about cybersecurity.  A cybersecurity strategy is being drawn up my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  This is a matter for Cabinet committee F as well, but there are members of the Defence Forces who are based in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and who work on cybersecurity.  As a matter of fact, we have members of the Defence Forces who went overseas only recently to work on cybersecurity with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and members of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Fine Gael MEPs' discussion document - I am glad the Deputy called it a discussion document - I of course welcome debate on absolutely anything, like the debate we are having today.  Stimulating debate and discussion is very good.  I might not agree with everything in the document but that is a matter for the MEPs.  In any position I take, including at European Council level, the number one priority is the policies set out within our own State, Ireland's own defence policy.  I will not deviate from that.

Some of it was to be expected anyway.<\/p><p>Regarding Operation Sophia, which the Minister of State mentioned in his contribution and which has come before the committee on a number of occasions, I have raised concerns in the past about the change from the original operation to Operation Sophia.  He explains in his contribution some of the logic behind Operation Sophia.  It concerns not just people smuggling, but also oil smuggling and weapons smuggling.  Perhaps at some stage he will be able to tell us how successful Operation Sophia has been in respect of the oil smuggling and weapons smuggling, if at all, because most of what we have heard thus far is that the international force involved, now including the <i>L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett<\/i>, in the Mediterranean is concerned mainly with intercepting the people smugglers, whether in Libyan or international waters.  My concern is that I have had a number of reports from different NGOs, some of which are no longer operating in the area because of restrictions placed by the Italians and others, that are concerned that the naval ships in international waters have stood by - &quot;stood to&quot; might be the correct term but I am not 100% sure - while the Libyan coastguard has got aggressive with people in boats which are foundering and people in the water, including those swimming towards those vessels.  These people would prefer to be picked up by the international ships than by the Libyans.<\/p><p>The other concern we raised at the time, and which I am still concerned about, is the state of the detention centres to which we are condemning those who are picked up to be returned.  A photographic booklet was circulated recently.  I do not know how up to date the photos are.  It concerns the human suffering inside Libya's migrant detention centres.  The M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res group has circulated it.  The information I have is that conditions have got worse than the horrific portrayal in the aforementioned booklet.<\/p><p>What work is being done by the EU in particular, because this is what we are dealing with-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018042600002#G00800","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2036,"content":"<p>On the detention centres?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018042600002#H00200","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2037,"content":"<p>Yes, what work is being done on the detention centres and on ensuring the Libyan coastguard does not return people to official or unofficial detention centres that are not fit for purpose, that are in industrial units and that house up to 2,000 people with no proper sanitation or food?  It has been pointed out that some of those being returned then end up on another boat within a week, which suggests there is some skulduggery behind those running the detention centres or public sales of these migrants are happening.  There is an element of this that is worth looking at in terms of foreign affairs rather than defence.  I know the Minister of State specifically deals with defence matters, but if the Naval Service is in any way complicit through lack of knowledge then we need to have the knowledge to inform it that it cannot be part of an operation which ends up enhancing or increasing the suffering of migrants.<\/p> <p>  I have raised my concerns about PESCO and Ireland's association with it being a drift against our neutrality.  The Minister of State has discussed this recently.  What additional commitments does the Minister of State expect to be placed on Ireland with regard to increasing our capacity and interoperability in the action plan outlined by the President of the Commission, Mr. Juncker, which the Minister of State mentioned in his introduction, on military mobility in particular?  This is a man who has committed to a fully fledged European defence union by 2025.  He has outlined this and has been honest enough to state this is where he wants to go.  His roadmap on military mobility is part of this, and Ireland's association in any way with it is an association with the drift towards an EU army, defence union or whatever title we wish to call it.  There is still a full debate required around all of the changes and moves that the Government has signed up to, but today is probably not the day.  I might come back to this, but there are a number of other issues I want to ask the Minister of State to address.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has had a very proud tradition in UNIFIL, and it has managed to keep the peace relatively secure in Lebanon.  It has managed to be involved in the area without taking sides.  Major General Michael Beary is in charge at present and he came under severe attack by the US ambassador to the UN, who accused him of being partial to Hezbollah.  The information I have is that recently the opposite has been happening, in that the Lebanese and Palestinians have huge concerns about his association with particular events.  He tweeted photographs of himself celebrating a great event on the 70th anniversary of Israel being founded.  Included in the photographs is one of him with what looks like members of the Israeli Defense Forces.  This is the wrong message.  It undermines him in particular and it looks like he is taking sides.  It could endanger Irish troops out there if they are seen in any way to be partial.  The advantage we have had over the years is that we have remained aloof.  The day he tweeted this was the anniversary of an attack by Israel on UN forces in the area in Qana.  I have been told it has not gone down well locally and internationally among a community that would have had respect for Irish troops in the past.  I do not know whether the Minister of State can say anything about it, but at the very least we should state that the military should not be associated with such events, especially not when they are involved in peacekeeping in the area.  It suggests taking sides.  I know the record and I know this is probably not the intention but it is the way it is being perceived.<\/p> <p>  With regard to other overseas operations, there have been operations in Afghanistan over the years, and only last week the Minister of State replied to Deputy Clare Daly to suggest the Army Ranger Wing was in Afghanistan for various periods over the years.  In the past I have asked, first and foremost, what Irish troops were doing on a NATO operation.  I also asked what was their role.  I was told by a previous Minister with responsibility for defence that their role was administrative.  A Ranger Wing being sent to Afghanistan does not suggest administrative duties.  We have also been led to believe in the past they were there to work on ordnance and deal with unexploded mines.  A different section of the Army deals with this and not the Ranger Wing.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to answer why we were not told or tell us that the D&aacute;il was misled in terms of the operations in which Irish troops were involved in Afghanistan.<\/p> <p>  In this meeting I will stick to dealing with international affairs in the main because, as I have said, we can have many debates about the Army itself.  Its established strength is supposed to be 9,500.  We have specific UN commitments and this Government and the previous Government signed up to commitments in terms of EU battle groups.  The German battle group now has the Army Ranger Wing involved.  If numbers continue to deplete and we do not manage to retain people, and my information is that by the end of this year even with new recruits we will have fewer people in the Defence Forces than we did at the start of the year due to an increase in retirements and the number of those who leave, what is the commitment we have at present with regard to the UN and the battle groups and can we live up to it?  My understanding is a maximum number of members of the Irish Defence Forces can be overseas at a given time.  This was set in the past based on the established strength but we do not have this.  Could it be undermined?  A key aspect of depletion and retention, outside of the lack of numbers, is the loss of experience and corporate knowledge if we lose people from the top levels of the Defence Forces.  We have discussed this previously and I do not know how it can be addressed quickly.  It is similar to the Garda and nursing.  We can increase numbers, but if we lose experience it will take quite a number of years to regain the corporate knowledge required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018042600002#H00300","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2038,"content":"<p>We all acknowledge the tremendous work the Defence Forces do nationally and, in particular, internationally.

Migrant numbers in detention centres have gone down by 60%, which is approximately 4,000, and I gave the number in the course of a Topical Issue debate with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on Tuesday evening.

We might transfer some migrants to other naval vessels involved in Operation Sophia and they then transport them.  If another country picks up 500 migrants and we pick up 100, instead of two ships travelling it makes sense for us to transfer ours to the other naval vessel to be brought to Italy.<\/p> <p>  Any decision we make regarding PESCO is based on our own domestic policy in regard to neutrality, something which was a priority for us when we joined it.  I brought it to the D&aacute;il, I got Government approval for it and I am hiding nothing in this area.  We are participating in two projects at the moment, one on officer training and the other on maritime security.  We will look at other projects on a case-by-case basis to see if they fit us and whether we could get a benefit from them.<\/p> <p>  The comments by Jean-Claude Juncker represent his own personal opinion.  If we are to have an EU army, it will not be a matter for me, the Department of Defence or any other Department.  It will be a decision for the people of Ireland to make.  While the previous referendum reflected that, under no circumstances would we sign up to any European army without a decision of the Irish people, and I do not expect such a thing any time soon.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about UNIFIL and mentioned Major General Michael Beary, who has done an outstanding job over the past two years.  We should be very proud of him.  There has been peace in Lebanon since 2006 and I heard an interview with him on \"Drivetime\" last week in which he said there were people in their 20s who did not remember any conflict there.  That is brilliant and it is because of the work of UNIFIL and the participation of Irish troops.  As head of the UNIFIL mission, Major General Beary is under the authority of the United Nations, and not me.  In peacekeeping, it is very important to communicate with both sides, and Major General Beary has been outstanding in this regard.  I have received briefings from him and I know that the relationship he has with both the Israeli and the Lebanese sides is very important.  He is bringing these people together for the first time ever in bilateral and trilateral meetings.  It is monumental to see these people communicating and it is for the betterment of the Lebanese people, as well as for peace and security and for the mission itself.  When Mick Beary leaves his position as head of mission, he can look back very proudly on the work he has done for the past two years.<\/p><p> I spent St. Patrick's Day in Lebanon and visited the region to celebrate the 40th anniversary of UNIFIL.  The ceremony was attended by the Deputy Chief of Staff Operations of the Defence Forces, Major General Kieran Brennan, and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Murphy, assistant secretary in the Department of Defence.  I heard feedback from the Lebanese people, including the Lebanese armed forces and the political parties in Lebanon.  Everyone was full of praise for Major General Beary.<\/p><p> Peacekeeping is an art and I have only learned that since I was thrust into my current position.  It has been a wonderful experience for me to see peacekeeping in operation.  Peacekeeping is about bringing all of the people together, communicating with them and ensuring they communicate with each other.  If Major General Beary was not in conversation and communication with the Israelis then something would be amiss.  It is important that he is involved in all events but he currently operates under the authority of the UN and not under my authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018042600002#J00400","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2043,"content":"<p>I have praised the work done by him before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018042600002#K00200","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2044,"content":"<p>Yes, I know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018042600002#K00300","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2045,"content":"<p>I was just surprised by his appointment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018042600002#K00400","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2046,"content":"<p>That is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018042600002#K00500","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2047,"content":"<p>I hope that if an event happens, whether it is arranged by the Lebanese Government or whatever, that Major General Beary can attend and be treated the same.

I know that the Chairman and all of the members of this committee greatly appreciate the work that has been done by Major General Beary.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about how many members of the Irish Defence Forces served in Afghanistan.  I understand that there were seven members and only one of them came from the Army Ranger Wing.  That is a situation similar to other units.  Members of the Air Corps and the Naval Service serve in Lebanon with UNIFIL or UNDOF.  All members of the Defence Forces deserve the opportunity to serve overseas.  The issues that the personnel who served in Afghanistan dealt with were counterfeit identifications, IDs, landmines, etc.  Some administrative and staff members were also located in the headquarters.<\/p> <p>  In terms of recruitment, we have given a budget to the military to recruit 9,500 personnel.  I accept that there are gaps in the service and there are challenges.  I regularly hold recruitment meetings with the Deputy Chief of Staff, Major General Kevin Cotter, and his staff.<\/p> <p>  In terms of any mission that the Defence Forces participate in, my number one commitment is to ensure that the Government fulfils of the issues that are sought by the Defence Forces.

There are a range of different missions.  I can never say that we have an absolute watertight mission where no one will be injured.

However, one must take risks.  There has been loss of life with UNIFIL or in the Congo during the 60 years that the Irish Defence Forces have proudly participated in UN peacekeeping missions.<\/p> <p>  There is no provision for members of the RDF to participate in overseas missions.

I would like to think we are thinking about this and there is some forward planning that we could consider.  <\/p><p> I am a former Minister for Defence.  Ireland's role in peacekeeping is worth diamonds.  We have built up a tremendous reputation and tremendous skills in the art of peacekeeping.  It is not just about sending out a couple of hundred troops to wander around the place.  They do the job in an expert way.  I have been to Lebanon on numerous occasions to see these people in operation.  I used to bring my wife with me and she was part and parcel of the entourage.  She was brought into the homes of different people.  It is about building up trust and communication within a community.  They are brilliant and they are quite capable of using those skills in many parts of the world.  We should be forward planning because of our small numbers and because Britain, which is our next door neighbour, will not be a member of the EU.  Our fishery protection rights must also be looked after.  We should know exactly what we intend to do.  It is a different ballgame when our next-door neighbour is not a member of the same club.  I get the impression, rightly or wrongly, that we do not like talking about it because we do not really want it to happen.  It is a fact.  There is not enough debate or discussion about this or preparation for it.  The role of the Defence Forces will be different in this new context.  Are there plans looking forward?  If there are could we perhaps get the opportunity of discussing with the Minister of State and his staff what those plans will be?<\/p><p> That is the main point I wanted to make, without interfering with the very good work being done by the Defence Forces in various exercises around the world.  We will have to think seriously about where we will be after the exit of our neighbour and what consequences it will have for us.  I would like to see it down in black and white so we can consider it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018042600002#K02100","speaker":"1219","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2064,"content":"<p>I apologise that I could not be here before this point.  If the Minister of State has already covered something I ask, I can check it in the Official Report.  I have a number of points.  Our review of Irish Aid, which we discussed last night and will debate today,  is looking at the aid and development aid agenda and the tremendous reputation Ireland has as a humanitarian country.  It is all about our aid, where it is targeted, the way in which it is untied and the way in which we are so well respected.  I still believe that being part of PESCO is undermining that.  We are playing with our neutrality.<\/p> <p>  We are now taking part in an EU military training mission.  How much of that will be about our peacekeeping operations?  How much will be about what we have been about and not getting caught up in something that has never been part of our agenda?  I feel there is a real danger of us being involved in unjust conflicts and I have serious concerns around that.  <\/p> <p>  We discussed our Navy in the Mediterranean during a Topical Issue debate this week.  I was delighted to hear what the Minister of State said and I accept that our Navy is not bringing any refugees it finds in boats back to Libya.  Our Navy will have to stand by and look at inappropriate behaviour by the Libyan coastguard which is bringing everyone it finds back to Libya and back to detention centres that an EU delegation has suggested should be closed down as soon as possible.  There are boats with refugees on them and when they see the Libyan coastguard, an NGO boat or one of the Navy boats, there is a race to get to our Navy or to an NGO boat before the Libyan coastguard can get them.  Our Navy will be standing by helpless in situations it is not part of.  They are supposed to be involved in the training of the Libyan coastguard yet the eyewitness accounts coming from reputable people who have been there - I spoke to a medic who is just back from working on a ship and working in the detention centres - is that the behaviour of the Libyan coastguard is at times aggressive and brutal.  We are putting our Navy in a terrible situation by being part of Operation Sophia.  <\/p> <p>  I am sure someone has raised my last issue.  Will we be supporting the UN Secretary General's call for an independent inquiry into what has been happening in Israel-Palestine and the number of Palestinian civilians who were shot by the Israeli army?    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2018042600002#L00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2065,"content":"<p>I will address the Deputy's last comment first.

As Deputy Barrett knows, one can get one's wings clipped very quickly if one encroaches on another Minister's area.<\/p> <p>  I agree 100% with Deputy Barrett that the role of the Defence Forces is changing rapidly.  It is a conversation that an awful lot of people fear having.  Perhaps they do not want to have it or whatever the story is.  It is important we explore and exchange views even if people have views that are on totally different spectrums.  It is important we share our views.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers raised the issue of the Fine Gael document on neutrality this morning.  It is good to have all these documents out there.  People can like it, lump it, agree or disagree with it but it is important we have it because the role of the Defence Forces and the role of Europe are changing rapidly and we have to be able to change with them.  <\/p> <p>  The issue of the fishery rights and the Naval Service was raised.  There is a memorandum of understanding drafted between the Department of Defence and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority where it involves the Irish Naval Service.  We have responded to every request made by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Agency.  We have never failed.  I assure the Deputy there is a lot of dialogue going on.  The assistant secretary, Mr. Ciaran Murphy, who is sitting to my left, is the lead in my Department on all Brexit-related issues.  He has other people within the Defence Forces.  He is feeding into the Defence Forces.  There is prudent planning and contingency planning going on in the background.  For security reasons and because I do not want to alarm people, I will not say we will be doing particular things but we have to think about it.  That is happening through the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  All senior officials are talking.  An awful lot of work is going on in the background.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority is primarily a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine issue.  The Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, is the lead on the Department side dealing with our sea fisheries.  He is responsible for our sea fisheries and for what will happen post-Brexit.

The bell is going to ring very shortly, it would appear, and we do not want to be found with our trousers down at our ankles.  There is at least a year's planning in all of this from a political point of view.  I understand that the officials are talking and so forth, but there is no need for any secrecy about this.  It is a very serious issue that affects ordinary people in the street, the people we represent, and we need to know.  This has huge consequences for us.  We are stuck out in the middle of the Atlantic, Britain is between us and our colleagues in the European Union and Britain is withdrawing from the European Union.  There are huge consequences to this in terms of all the structures that must be put in place regarding the role of the Naval Service and our Defence Forces.  However, there appears to be a silence about it.  Discussions might be taking place in certain rooms in different parts of different Departments, but I am talking about public representatives and if people ask us what we will do about it.  We should be discussing this in the D&aacute;il.  It is one of the most serious issues this country has faced for donkey's years.  Nobody seems to understand the seriousness of Britain withdrawing from the European Union as far as the Republic of Ireland and part of the island, Northern Ireland, are concerned.  Everybody is shying away from it.  Mr. Davis turned up in the North and the public representatives were not even told he was wandering around there.<\/p> <p>  This issue has huge consequences for our security people.  Can the Minister of State understand?  There are guys lying in the ditches who have not gone away.  If they feel that their rights are being infringed one can foresee a return, God forbid, to the days we want to forget.  Perhaps there might be planning behind the scenes but I am referring to the Oireachtas and the committees I have encountered.

We will leave it to the Minister to ensure that when he is there and speaking to the people who are in charge of the overall operation these questions are strongly put to them.  The humanitarian aspect of the work in which our Naval Service is involved is more important.  It is rescuing people.

The representative association is anxious that when the Department is preparing to amend the regulations it be involved and consulted about the changes.<\/p> <p>  On the Naval Service Reserve, apparently there is a serious problem with the eye sight standards required to be met to become a member.  The standards are higher than those required to join as a permanent member of the Naval Service.  Will the Minister of State have somebody look again at the eye sight standards required to be met?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State may recall that when he was before the committee two years ago, we discussed recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force.  He outlined the difficulties experienced in getting people to join it.  We discussed the suggestion of using the institutes of further education and other third level colleges as potential sources of recruits.  I was told that one of the advertisements for the recruitment of personnel for the force was during the month of August last year.  Most of us know that the vast majority of colleges and educational establishments are closed in August, as well as the months on either side of August.  Will the Minister of State ensure the next recruitment drive will take place at a time of the year when colleges are open, not when students are on holidays?  <\/p> <p>  Another issue Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett and his colleagues have highlighted is the direction defence policy in Europe is taking.  It ties in with the issue of Brexit.  In the report to which Deputy Jack Chambers referred, the document which the Minister of State's MEP colleagues brought out, Commissioner Mogherini is quoted as saying: \"More progress has been made on intensifying EU defence cooperation in the last year, than was achieved in the last 10 years put together.  Big developments are potentially on the horizon.\"  That type of statement by a very senior member of the Commission has to be worrying for us.  Perhaps the Minister of State might give us some idea of the sense he has gathered from his colleagues in the Council of Ministers on the Commission's reflection papers?  He will recall that when the Commission's reflection paper was published almost a year ago, it included three options for consideration: first, security and defence co-operation; second, shared security and defence; and, third, common defence and security.  We would all have to have concerns that the latter, common defence and security, seems to be the one Mr. Juncker and his colleagues in the Commission, some elected Members of the European Parliament and some Ministers are pushing.

I highlight the Irish policy position on every occasion.  I am not hiding any issue.  It is important that I come before the committee to debate the issues and inform it and the Houses of exactly what is happening in Europe.  In my response to Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh on Mr. Juncker's comments on a European Army, I have said this is what Mr. Juncker has been saying for the past three years.  It is his personal view.  It is a matter for the people to decide.

One hears about discussions on the future of Europe, but it is senior members of the Commission who are talking about and forcing this agenda.  They are non-elected members; they are appointed officials, yet they seem to be the ones who are driving this change.  I would like to know where is the Council of Ministers in all of this?  Who gives Mr. Juncker or anybody in a similar position the right to stand up and say this is European policy?  He is a paid official of the European Commission.  Therefore, with the greatest of respect, Irish Ministers should say: \"Hold on a second - this does not apply to us, as Ireland is a neutral country.\"  We should not have to come to the Oireachtas and defend our neutrality among ourselves.  It is time we put a stop to this.

I sent a statement to the secretariat and will take it as read.  I will address the issues to which the Chairman asked me to speak.<\/p> <p>  It is good to be before the joint committee.  About 70% of the work I do in the European Parliament relates to my work as a full member of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.  Most of the debates that happen in this Parliament are related directly to the work we are doing on a pan-European level.  I welcome the efforts of the Chairman which I am assisting to get the president of the ECB to attend the committee.  It is really important and I congratulate the Chairman on the initiative.  I am confident that we will get there between now and the end of the mandate of the president of the ECB.<\/p> <p>  The regulatory supervisory element has changed radically as a consequence of the crisis.  If one looks at what the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, and the ECB do in terms of the 253 banks at which they look, four of which are in Ireland, it is a totally new landscape.  It is really important that those who are involved in the detail of work in the European Parliament relate directly to colleagues back home.  I have listed the files I have done thus far and the files on which I am working and I am happy to take questions on them.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with the four issues I was requested to deal with.  First, on the taxation of the digital economy, any taxation matter in the European Union requires unanimity at the European Council; thankfully, it is not an issue for the European Parliament.  Ireland does not have a majority on the key issues that face us on these files, but that is not to say the Parliament does not have a view on this issue; of course, it does, but my sense is we cannot be forced to do something we do not want to do.  Ultimately, we have a veto.  It is not a good place to be in to constantly say we want to use the veto, but on the question of a digital tax, we are not alone in our view as a country.  A large number of member states in the east of Europe, the Scandinavian countries and the more export oriented economies in the north agree with our views. <\/p> <p>  Let us be frank about the taxation of the digital economy.  Companies are not paying enough; the effective tax rate is under 10%.  We have to find a means to have a fairer taxation system in circumstances where their intellectual property is in one location and their distribution system is elsewhere.  We have not been good because our traditional means of taxing the corporate sector has been based on the question of profits, where somebody is domiciled and where real value is added.  We have to address this issue.  The interim measure Commissioner Moscovici has proposed is not fit for purpose in that it is a turnover tax, effectively a tax on the clicks on Google, Airbnb or whatever else.  In that way it would be a radical departure, but it would not be a major tax.  Mr. Moscovici has suggested to those of us on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee that it would be about &euro;5 billion on an annualised basis and affect the biggest corporate companies with a turnover of more than &euro;750 million, but there are issues that we must address.  It could be perceived as an attack on US businesses because essentially it would affect large US tech companies, many of which are based in Ireland.  Where the trade disputes are with the new US Administration and the European Union is of concern.  <\/p> <p>  The other question is what is and is not digital.  Is the German car manufacturer BMW which produces something at &euro;50,000, 40% of which is digital, in the digital category?   Should it be taxed?  I cannot see too many people in Germany putting their hands up.  If it is just a surcharge on digital companies, it would be a pretty blunt instrument.  A better way to approach the issue is to do what the OECD has done on the BEPS side, where the report is available and its want a period of time within which to see if it can be organised on an international basis.  <\/p> <p>  Let me be very frank with my colleagues.  We all know that taxation is a highly political issue, no matter from which political family we come.  If one were to ask Google or Facebook whether it was okay with them that a percentage of what they pay in tax on an annual basis should relate to the location of users, I think they would probably say  yes.  If they can see the principle, the next question is what percentage of the tax payable should it be.  If a significant number of the people who are clicking on their services come from the larger member states, is it appropriate that some of the money should go to these member states?  The question is about percentages.  The bigger issue for Ireland is related to the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, not a digital tax, because a digital tax is about more than taking away something we0 have.  We must box clever.  I have made a suggestion to the Commissioner on a sunset clause, that we could have such a tax for a number of years.  That is not Commissioner Moscovici's proposal, but this proposal is fit for purpose.  The correct approach, as the Minister for Finance said, is to work with other member states and stay at the table in order that we can come up with a proposal that will resolves the issue.  This is still a piece of work that has to be done, but for me, the digital companies have to pay more but how they pay more is the question.  Certainly, we need to be open-minded about it.  <\/p> <p>  I do not need to tell members who have done sterling work on the issue of non-performing loans, NPLs, how important this issue is in the European Union.  We have to solve the problem and it has to be solution oriented.  If we do not solve the problem of NPLs, the implications are that it will dull the investment in new borrowings to businesses, families and individuals.  Second, if we do not solve the problem of NPLs, it means that a larger percentage of a bank's capital will have to be used to offset the NPLs on the balance sheet, which is not a good position in which to be.  Historically, banks that have large NPLs on balance sheets are ones that overcharge on mortgages and other services.  We must address that question.<\/p> <p>  There are Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, guidelines, but the question is whether we should move to a more exacting standard.  That is not yet clear from what the SSM has stated, but progress has been made.  We have reduced the debt on NPLs in Ireland from &euro;80 billion to &euro;30 billion.  The current rate is about 13%, a reduction from 27%.  Much progress has been made on the commercial side, but there are outstanding issues on the residential side.  The real question is whether we should move from the SSM guidelines which are to a more exacting standard.  I do not think there is clarity within the SSM on that question.  <\/p> <p>  The other point that must be made is that we face very severe stress tests later this year by the European Banking Authority, EBA.  The stress tests will not just be about capital but also about how much collateral lies behind the balance sheets of the banks.  Split mortgages is another issue we can discuss further.  <\/p> <p>  On the Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF, next week the Commission will propose the draft Cohesion Policy funding for the next seven years.  It will not be decided  by this Parliament but in the run-up to 2020.  It is very important for Ireland that we continue agricultural and regional communities to have very strong exposure to the Structural and Cohesion Funds.  I very much agree with the Taoiseach recent remarks, in which he said we were prepared to pay more to breach the 1% GNI threshold.  We should pay more.  Ireland is now a net contributor.  We have gained about &euro;50 billion since 1973 and have done a good job in utilising them.  From my perspective, for the PEACE and INTERREG programmes and the agricultural communities, we need to do it.  The other advantage is that if one pays in more, one has more control of the design of the funds.  We will possibly need funding to deal with the impact of Brexit which we can obtain if we are open to paying more.<\/p> <p>  They key argument in the paper I have submitted on Brexit financial services is that it is virtually impossible to regard the United Kingdom as a third country when it comes to financial services.  I have set out in my paper how integrated they are with the European market.  Some 40% of European assets under management are in the City of London, as is 60% of the EU capital markets business.  A total of &euro;1.1 trillion of EU lending is provided through the City of London.  One cannot regard it as a Mexico or a Venezuela in the context of third country equivalence.  We have to find a solution to the problem that will allow systemic threats to be addressed.  It will be a disaster if we do not have agreement.  It is a new systemic threat that no one has articulated.  What will happen?<\/p><p>My view is Europe will say a third party can have equivalence.  Equivalence is not the gold standard because it does not exist in all of the files.  Even if it does exist in existing regulations, it only applies in some elements of those regulations.  The British are looking for mutual recognition, which, generally speaking, we do not do as a Community in third-country negotiations.  There is a new term out there of \"enhanced equivalence\", which means we could come to a special deal with the UK as a separate financial services chapter, which is what we are trying to do with the Americans on TTIP.  It could then make it clearer what they will follow.  <\/p><p> The big concern in Brussels is the British will have a race to the bottom.  The British counter that by saying ten years ago, they were before the European Union when it came to creating new standards in supervision.  We have to be very clear about this.  Our task in Ireland and as a member of the European Union is to get a good outcome and an extensive deal with the UK.  The best outcome would be to make sure we had a financial services chapter in whatever that new deal is and hopefully it would make some difference.  Let us be clear about it.  The UK is leaving.  The activities of the City of London make it cheaper for us in other parts of the European Union because of cost competitiveness.  There are economies of scale in London in a way there are not in Frankfurt, Dublin, Amsterdam or Paris.  Over time we will get stronger but we should not underestimate the importance of the City of London in the financing generally of the European Union.  <\/p><p> I will make a final point.  I have gone on too long.  I will appeal to people on the broader Brexit issue.  No matter who the Government of Ireland is - Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Socialist Party or Communist Party of Ireland - the issues are the issues and the challenges are the challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2123,"content":"<p>Mr. Hayes better mention Leo because he has mentioned most things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#D00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2124,"content":"<p>That includes our crowd, my apologies.

We are often critical of the fact there is not enough engagement between the representatives of the D&aacute;il and those of us who represent the country in Europe.  When I first went to the European Parliament in 2014 and joined the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs as a substitute member, I had very clear priorities.  At the time we advocated strongly for retrospective recapitalisation of the Irish banks to alleviate the burden that had been placed upon us, to stand up for Irish citizens and to oppose an austerity agenda that was very much championed at an EU level and imposed on the Irish State and other countries by the troika and to support regulation of the financial sector to make it more stable and fairer for consumers.  These priorities still stand although in some cases, the position of the Government has made it very difficult to see how we can achieve them, particularly with regard to retrospective capitalisation.  It seems the Government has surrendered in that battle.<\/p> <p>  On the debt and deficit rules, I welcome that the Government has belatedly begun to call for flexibility after enshrining those rules in the Constitution.  Since I have been in the European Parliament and over the past number of years, we have had new priorities, primarily as a result of Brexit.  It is a notion none us ever thought we would see.  I am in a position where it now makes up around 40% or 50% of my work, which is the case across the Sinn F&eacute;in team of MEPs.  Our priorities now include the protection of Ireland, particularly with regard to the all-Ireland economy, the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and the EU budget in the post-Brexit scenario considering that one of our larger contributors will exit the European Union.  Other issues have arisen as a result of what is now a strong international focus on tax avoidance, tax evasion, money-laundering and other financial crimes as a result of some of the leaks we have seen.  I sat as a member of the Panama Papers inquiry committee that was established by the European Parliament and which completed its work last December.  I am now a member of the new Special Committee on Financial Crimes, Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance, which is looking into all of these issues.  We are also working on ensuring that Irish mortgage holders are protected, insofar as possible, from the sell-off of their homes to vulture funds.  We are also involved with colleagues across the EU to try to resist what is a new way of financial deregulation.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to taxation, people will be aware of my party's position on tax sovereignty.  It is one of our principal issues.  I have consistently argued at an EU level that the Irish State and other EU member states should retain maximum economic powers in order to safeguard the democratic decision-making process but also to be able to respond effectively to the specific challenges that happen in very diverse economies in the EU.  That includes the power to set and collect our own taxes, whether corporate or otherwise.  Having said that, and having sat on the committees I mentioned, I am now convinced the only way we can tackle cross-border tax avoidance - it is almost all cross-border - is through binding and enforceable international rules.  My preference is that those global tax rules would be set at the United Nations.  I support the OECD BEPS process as an important step forward internationally but I recognise its limitations in terms of both its ambition and implementation.  There is a role for specific EU-wide action to combat base erosion and profit shifting across borders within the Single Market.  It does not mean we support every EU tax proposal - far from it.  We examine every proposal on its merits and make judgments on it with regard to the potential impact it would have on the Irish economy, its impact on tackling tax avoidance and its impact on sovereignty issues.<\/p> <p>  On the digital taxation proposals, I am following these two files as closely as possible.  I will engage constructively with them.  It is far more focused and targeted than the more sweeping proposals that were outlined in the CCTB and CCCTB proposals and which I and Sinn F&eacute;in have opposed for several reasons.  It is important that members all recognise where these proposals are coming from.  There are four reasons for the Commission's proposals.  One reason, as Mr. Hayes has already said, is that digital firms are effectively paying a corporate tax rate of less than 10%, which is half of the effective tax rate for bricks and mortar.  The prevalence of tax avoidance schemes and tax breaks on intellectual property in many EU member states means that in some cases the effective rate is far lower than 10% and sometimes as low as 0% to 1%.  There is a crucial problem with the OECD on this issue because members of the OECD disagree on how to implement action 1 of BEPS, whether to create a digital tax and if so what form it would take.  The interim report from the OECD on this issue released last month demonstrates the level of the disagreement, particularly the very strong opposition from the Trump Administration.  It means it is unlikely we will see OECD action in the near future.  We know there are a number of EU member states that are already trying to tackle this issue unilaterally.  The 3% levy on turnover proposal is the aspect most reported on but the general approach of defining a taxable digital permanent establishment is an important proposal, which warrants close consideration.  While global approaches are absolutely preferable, we also need to be wary of the approach that states there can be no action outside of the OECD framework at all.  In the short to medium term, that means there will be no action at all.  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the potential impact on the Irish economy, it is something we need to examine closely.  It is important to recognise the actions of successive Irish Government have contributed to the situation where the Commission is proposing its own legislative initiatives on taxing technology giants.<\/p><p>Last month, the Commission released a report on aggressive tax planning indicators in the framework of the European semester.  The report revealed that a staggering 23% of Irish GDP from 2010 to 2015 was made up of royalty payments.  The capital allowance regime for intangible assets, which was put in place in 2015, prompted a surge in corporations using intellectual property-related tax avoidance schemes in Ireland and other states.  Although an allowance cap of 80% was reintroduced in budget 2018, this huge and unjustified tax break for intellectual property is still allowing digital giants to avoid paying their fair share.<\/p><p> We have been engaging recently with the ECB on its guidance to banks on non-performing loans, which was circulated last month.  Along with my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, who is a member of this committee, I am dealing with this matter with the aim of understanding whether the Irish banks' mass sale of mortgages to vulture funds was required under the ECB guidance, as the banks were telling us at that stage.  The very firm and clear answer we received was \"absolutely not\".  The chair of the Single Supervisory Mechanism has written to me in response to a letter to state definitively that the ECB has no preference regarding the resolution of non-performing loans.  Now that the EU and the Irish regulators have rejected the claim that the Irish banks are required to sell these loans to vulture funds, and have confirmed definitively that debt restructuring and write-downs are alternative options, we need to put in place actions to prevent the continued sale of these loans.<\/p><p> The ECB has also clarified that split mortgages can be classified as performing loans as long as particular legal structures are put in place.  Last month, the Commission made a specific legislative proposal based on four key aspects - provisions by banks, securitisation of non-performing loans, debt recovery and a non-binding blueprint for member states to establish an asset management company.  Basically, we are going to share our experiences of NAMA with the rest of Europe, God help them.  While I have clear issues with some aspects of the proposal, I welcome the decision not to include consumers in the debt recovery proposal and I am pleased that the establishment of asset management companies will be voluntary.  The Commission's efforts to revive the securitisation market for non-performing loans is troubling from my point of view.  We will engage actively with these proposals as they come before the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.  I would be interested to hear the views of members in this regard.<\/p><p> Mr. Hayes has outlined the context in which the multi-annual financial framework will take place.  My colleague, Liadh N&iacute; Riada, MEP, sits on the European Parliament Committee on Budgets, which has estimated that the Brexit gap could be between &euro;12 billion and &euro;14 billion, which is quite significant.  EU Commissioners have been floating various notions and ideas, including the possibility of a 50:50 split between spending cuts in programmes and increases in contributions by member states.  I am not fully comfortable with either of these prospects.  As we know, EU funds are of clear importance in areas across Ireland.  In addition to CAP, initiatives such as PEACE are very important for large parts of my constituency.  We need to bear in mind that the Irish State is now a net contributor to the EU budget.  As time moves on, we are going to be paying increased contributions anyway.  Of course, this committee and other committees here in the Oireachtas will have to consider that for every additional &euro;1 we pay to the EU, our Minister for Finance will have &euro;1 less to distribute as part of his annual budget.  Given that the CAP budget is going to come under threat - it would have come under challenge regardless of Brexit - the potential exists for Ireland to agree to increase its gross national income contributions without seeing a corresponding increase in the CAP budget, or even the maintenance of that budget at its current level.  We need to be very vigilant in that regard.<\/p><p> I am aware that I have spoken for longer than the Chairman would have liked.  I will conclude by referring briefly to Brexit and financial services.  As I have said, my priority with regard to Brexit is not to campaign for, support or defend financial services firms in the City of London but to ensure our own interests and our own communities are protected.  I am thinking particularly of Border communities and communities in the North.  My view on financial services in a post-Brexit scenario largely coincides - for once - with the current position of the Commission, which is that the market actors themselves should be responsible for responding and adapting to the new circumstances while maintaining our own financial services and our own economy, in so far as that is possible.  I apologise for taking a little too much time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Carthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2127,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carthy and Mr. Hayes for their attendance this morning.

It is not an issue for the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.  It relates to the budget.  My understanding is that the Irish Government is fully supportive of the PEACE and INTERREG funding.  I know that because when I was in government, we were pushing it in a way that the British Government was not pushing it.  When Ireland held the Presidency of the EU during the period of the last multi-annual financial framework, we made sure these programmes remained in place for all seven years of the framework.  I do not see any departure from that.  The question we need to consider is how the British Government will fund this when Northern Ireland is no longer in the EU.  Having spoken to Michel Barnier about this issue, I am aware that there is a willingness for these programmes to continue.  There is considerable support in Brussels and Dublin for their continuation.  A mechanism needs to be found to enable this to happen.

One of the first resolutions regarding Ireland to be adopted after the Brexit vote was an amendment proposed by my colleague Liadh N&iacute; Riada, MEP, to a budget file in respect of the multi-annual financial framework.  It was a statement of intent to protect PEACE funding in the post-Brexit scenario.  This clear and definitive statement on the part of the European Parliament happened within a couple of months of the Brexit vote, at a time when it was refusing to make clear and definitive statements on almost any other aspect of Brexit.  We have tried to capitalise on that.  We have met Michel Barnier and all the key negotiating figures at European level.  All of them have indicated that this is the case.  The problem in a worst-case Brexit scenario is that in order for PEACE to happen, we will need the British Government to pony up the money and agree to the structure that is in place.  At the moment, there is a special EU programmes body, the role of which is to roll out this funding.  There will need to be another body that is not simply an EU body so that the British Government will be able to tie into it.  One of the successes of the PEACE programme has been the value of the engagement with it by all communities on both sides of the Border.  People might not like every decision that is made by the special EU programmes body.<\/p><p>They might not like where all of the funding has been allocated.  Those who submit applications will always think they are good and that they deserve more but they have always considered the scheme to be administered by a politically neutral body in terms of how decisions are made.  There is a fear -  it is one I share - that we have not adopted a strong position on the PEACE programme.  The Minister must strongly emphasise that whatever body is put in place to distribute funding is politically neutral.  I assume and hope that we can take everybody at their word that they will remain committed to that goal.  We just need to be very focused about this matter.<\/p><p> The issue of broader INTERREG funding is more worrying from my point of view because there is not the same commitment.  In that instance and, again, dealing with the worst-case Brexit scenario, the more optimum cases or even Britain remaining in the Single Market and the customs union, there is no guarantee that Britain would remain part of the INTERREG programme.  In some cases, it is the INTERREG programme as opposed to PEACE funding specifically that has delivered some of the major infrastructural projects, whether it be transport projects or other infrastructural developments, on a cross-Border basis.  In that context, we probably have not - I say this collectively in terms of the Government and all representatives - had an opportunity to put the amount of time and detailed work into formulating an Irish position that we can articulate.  There will be openness at European level.  When one talks to British representatives, it depends on who one speaks to and what day of the week it is in the context of figuring out the British Government's position on anything Brexit-related.  The Senator is quite right in what she said.  I cannot imagine what my community in County Monaghan and communities in many other Border counties would look like today were it not for the provision of PEACE and INTERREG funding over the past number of decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#E01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Carthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2140,"content":"<p>We have argued that Ireland needs a Brexit package to be included in the next budget and through other means, such as state aid flexibility and other flexibilities, in order to respond to the potential negative impacts of Brexit.

Yes, there is an appetite for a post-Brexit funding stream for counties and sectors that will suffer as a result of Brexit but it is difficult to predict how that will be formulated.  I am of the view that it would be better to argue for sector-wide packages.  In terms of agrifood, I met representatives of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association in Brussels yesterday.  The sector faces huge external threats as a result of Brexit.  Quite a number of other sectors will also be affected.  It would be much easier to seek that an EU-wide package be made available to any sector that is damaged by Brexit.  Ireland relies heavily on the agrifood sector so we know that it will get more than its fair share of suffering because it will be hit harder that any other member state.  We would have a stronger case if we asked for an EU-wide package rather than a package for Ireland.  However, that is not to say that we should not argue for both.<\/p> <p>  Who knows exactly what goes on behind the doors of the European Council because it is a secretive body and lacks transparency.  In my view, the excuse that the Irish Government did a bad thing because of another thing is overplayed.  Sometimes the Government sees the Council as a handy way of getting bad things through.  Permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, has been given as an example.  I listened to the debates in the House during which Members claimed that the only reason Ireland signed up to PESCO was because of Brexit and the fact that we felt we owed them one.  The only reason that we signed up to PESCO is because Fine Gael is committed to PESCO.

I will focus on two issues.  One is the issue at hand this morning, namely, the digital services tax proposals from the Commission, while the second is on non-performing loans.  The digital tax strikes me as a fundamental shift in the operation of taxation across the European Union.  It is currently a matter for each member state and there is a veto, as both witnesses said.  However, taxing companies on a pan-European basis is a significant shift and it could be the start of more to come.  We have spoken a little about the CCCTB but this is a move away from the system based on tax residency that currently obtains.  Can the witnesses give us a sense of the timeframes for these proposals, COM (2018) 0147 and COM (2018) 0148?  They were only published in March.  When will they go before the European Council for decision?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#G00400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2177,"content":"<p>Commissioner Moscovici proposed the measure in Buenos Aires when he was there for a G20 meeting.  He came before the ECON committee and I questioned him on it.  Mr. Tang and Mr. Lamassoure were also before the committee.  In the two reports on the CCCTB that went before the European Parliament, the digital tax component was put in on the question of intangible assets.  It is already the stated position of the Parliament that it wants this.  However, it has no power in this area with the exception of putting up important signposts.<\/p> <p>  My sense is this.  Two things happen with a year to go before the end of a European Parliament mandate.  Proposals are put out there for the purposes of the legacy of a Commissioner and his or her future plans.  The proposals can obtain general agreement in Council but I do not see a chance that the digital tax can be agreed in the lifetime of this Parliament's mandate or any time soon.  I say that for two reasons.  The recent comments of the new socialist German Finance Minister, Mr. Scholz, have been very interesting.  He sees the implications for Germany, which has a highly export-orientated economy like our own, and he sees the issues of trade ramping up the difficulties with the Trump Administration, a matter to which my colleague referred.  Without Germany and France pushing this, there will not be a quick decision.<\/p> <p>  The Commission constantly puts forward ideas and many of them take five years to come before the co-decision-making bodies of Parliament and the Council but they often remain on the shelves, and I think the digital tax is one such idea.  However, I would not underestimate the political imperative to do something about this.  As Deputy Michael McGrath said, internationally tax and accountancy are normally based on profit, residency and value added.  If one moves to a sectoral approach and sets out to get the big digital companies with a nebulous turnover formula, one is changing the rules.  Nevertheless, there is a political concern in large member states which get none of this income but who use the service.  At some point, one has to ask how that is to be resolved.  Our task as MEPs is not just to articulate Ireland's concerns but to explain other people's concerns to people here.  The right approach is to stay around the table and try to work on a better and more proportionate proposal but I do not see this going anywhere fast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2178,"content":"<p>There was an estimate of &euro;5 billion being raised from a 3% turnover tax.

It is true that it could be some time before we see movement on this file and it could be never.  However, something has to happen as citizens across Europe are demanding that companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple pay some level of tax.  It is morally indefensible to have the current situation whereby they can exploit different tax bases.  We cannot say that we will figure out a way of taxing these companies in the same way as we tax traditional, bricks-and-mortar companies because the nature of these business is fundamentally different.  As a result, their tax will also have to be different.<\/p> <p>  The second part of the Deputy's question is also important because it deals with building public support for this move.  There are people in the European Commission who want this to be an own resource of the Commission, meaning all the money is soaked up and distributed as the EU institutions see fit.  I have huge concerns about that in terms of accountability and transparency.  Money is power and those within the EU who want the EU to have more power are adamant about getting additional resources.<\/p> <p>  The distribution would be different from under the CCCTB in that, under it, there is a threat to money coming into the Irish Exchequer, which could leave a hole in our finances.  There is no digital taxation at the moment so we should perhaps come up with proposals to input into the discussion and this committee, or the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, could have a role in that.  We could propose a mechanism whereby these companies could be taxed and for how the money could be distributed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Carthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2180,"content":"<p>If they paid this tax, presumably it would reduce the taxable profits available to be taxed in the member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#G00800","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2181,"content":"<p>That is not the case.

We are trying to get to the bottom of why AIB split mortgages are regarded as performing and those of Permanent TSB are regarded as non-performing.  We teased this out at meetings with representatives of both organisations.  Ms Nouy probably cuts to the heart of the matter without mentioning any institution.  She states in her letter it is \"essential that the split-loan restructuring has resulted in two separate and independent payment obligations with substantially different terms and conditions\" so an obliger or borrower should not be subject to any contractual repayment obligations in respect of repayment of the junior debt, which I take to be the warehouse debt, until the senior debt, the active mortgage, has been repaid in full, or if the borrower defaults on the senior debt.

It was actually a reply to the question I posed at the time.  A determination had not been reached on the proposal by Permanent TSB when it asked that its split mortgages be considered.  Ms Nouy is making a differentiation.  She is saying that there are two elements to the payment, namely, the active amount and the warehousing amount.  She is regarding the active amount as the senior and the warehousing amount as the more junior, meaning greater collateral is required.  In our circumstances and given the way Permanent TSB operates, as I understand it, one is paying both at the same time.  As I understand it, Ms Nouy is expecting the active amount to be paid in its totality and then regarding it as outside the loop of the non-performing loans.  That is a difficulty I do not believe we have resolved yet.<\/p> <p>  I have seen newspaper reports in this regard from sources here and abroad.  I very much hope a definitive view can be given on this.  As the Deputy knows from his work here, not all non-performing loans are the same.  Equally, not all banking legacy problems are the same.  The one-size-fits all approach, which I understand the SSM is trying to move towards, may not help our situation here.<\/p> <p>  There was a great expectation in Brussels up until recently that there would be a move towards a more exacting standard.  The 5% is a guideline rather than a standard.  Ultimately, Permanent TSB and others that still have a capital reserve problem are working with the SSM teams in this regard.  As they tried to work out the problem, there was an expectation that a very exacting standard would be published by March.  That has not happened.  There is still a long way to go, largely because the Italian problem is worse than ours.  Quite frankly, it is the unknown quantity in terms of the capital reserve ratios that remain.  I hope we can achieve some progress on this but I am not pretending I am very optimistic at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2187,"content":"<p>On what issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#H00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2188,"content":"<p>On the split mortgages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2189,"content":"<p>In the context of what Ms Nouy said and insofar as it relates to AIB and Permanent TSB, it seems that because of the way Permanent TSB structures its split mortgages, and because it is open to the bank at any time to transfer some of the warehouse debt into the active mortgage-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#H00500","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2190,"content":"<p>Making the distinction between-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2191,"content":"<p>She was saying they then had to be regarded as non-performing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#H00700","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2192,"content":"<p>Correct.

It is very good to have interaction between MEPs and members of the various committees.  I will not go over the ground covered by the two previous speakers so I will move on slightly.  I have two questions.<\/p> <p>  First, the average Irish mortgage is probably double the European average.  Is there any proposal for, or do our guests envisage, an EU-wide mortgage facility?  Mortgage terms elsewhere in the European Union are much longer than in Ireland.  The vast majority are 35 years or longer, and in some cases up to 50 years.  Do our guests envisage our being able to obtain a European mortgage?  It would put a lot of pressure on the banks here to bring down their mortgage rates and it would bring more competition to the market here.  This should be examined.  I would like to hear our guests' views on it.<\/p> <p>  The second issue concerns insurance.  Quite a number of businesses have closed down recently because of the high cost of insurance here.  In my home town, a pub called Bosh, owned by Mr. Michael McDonald, has closed because his annual insurance premium is &euro;67,000.  It is an ordinary pub that does a bit of food.  Obviously, Mr. McDonald had a couple of claims but the insurance premium is outrageous for a small business in the west.<\/p> <p>  Elsewhere in Europe, the insurance set-up is different from that in Ireland.  The state takes some of the responsibility in some European countries.<\/p><p>If one changes from one insurance company to another in some European countries, the state part of it does not kick in, I think, for about six months, so there are differences in this regard.  While the European Union says there must be competition and one is allowed to switch from insurance company to insurance company, there are differences in the way in which insurance companies operate right around Europe.  In some cases it seems the state covers part of the premium or pays out in some instances, perhaps for flooding or whatever else.  If this were the case, it could well reduce the cost of insurance in Ireland, so perhaps the witnesses and the European Parliament should look at this.  I would like to hear their views on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#H01400","speaker":"1380","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2200,"content":"<p>The Senator has asked two good questions, for which I thank him.

Our banks are screwing the very people who bailed them out, to put it very bluntly.  I would be wary of an EU mortgage scheme because - to refer to the next question, on insurance - we saw what happened with Setanta Insurance, for example, a company based in one member state and regulated at that level but operating in another state in respect of financial transactions.

The reason consumers on the Continent are in a better position - and this is where I fundamentally disagree with my colleague - is competition.  They have significant banks pitching against one another on rates and conditions.  We will not get to a better place in respect of standard variable rates here unless we get competition.  We need to encourage banks to come into Ireland, to set up here and either to use the distribution channels that are here or compete against our own banks.  This is the only way we will get rates down because competition, ultimately, will ensure we get mortgage products.<\/p> <p>  I am much more ambitious than Mr. Carthy; I think we can have mortgage products across the European Union.  We have done so much in the past decade to stabilise the banks, to put the supervisory system in place and to change the rules from Central Bank of Ireland national competent authorities to the ECB SSM for the big banks.  However, we have not done enough for consumers.  Regarding the Single Market, in so many areas we have driven down prices - for example, on roaming and the airline industry.  These are huge benefits for ordinary people.  The one area on which we have done nothing is cross-border financial services, and I am passionate about this.  There is so much that can be done.<\/p> <p>  What can we do to get to what the Senator wants done?  If I may be very frank, in our time in government, when I was a Minister of State, the one thing I am most ashamed about is the length of time it took us to get insolvency working.  It was a disgrace.  The first thing the IMF told us when we came into government was to get our insolvency laws right because the longer one puts off putting the inevitable in place, the more difficult it gets.  If there were an EU-wide insolvency regime, I think there would be confidence in moving more operators to Ireland.  Furthermore, if there were an EU-wide valuation process with confidence and a kind of gold standard of valuation, I think there would be more new entrants to the mortgage market in Ireland.  That is my sense of the matter.  The past ten years have been very good for the banks, the supervisors and governments, particularly with Mr. Draghi's doing everything he could to save the euro, which has worked, broadly speaking, but not good enough for cross-border business.  Be it insurance or mortgages, we can do so much more to embrace the principles of the Single Market and drive down our standard variable rates.  I think it is possible to do this, but it requires political will.  What government will put its hand up and say it will go to an EU-wide solvency regime?  People will not put money into Ireland if they cannot get it out.  They have been burnt enough.  This is the nature of risk.  We have now moved to a risk-based model - rightly so, given the light-touch regulation Mr. Carthy spoke about.  We must embrace the Single Market, and I hope the next ten years can be about taking down those protectionist barriers that exist between member states which drive up the cost of insurance premiums and borrowings for mortgages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Hayes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2202,"content":"<p>May I say just one thing on that?

It is good to have this engagement with our ECON MEPs.  I wish to focus on the issue of digital taxation.  I will start by putting the issue in a broader context because this definitely takes place in a broader context.  There are two fundamental aspects to this broader context.  The first is an increasing tension between the US and the EU.  This is real, I think we can acknowledge it as such and it does play a part in the broader context.<\/p> <p>  The second is related but also has an independent dynamic.  I refer to the moves on taxation that are taking place, including the CCCTB and the digital taxation proposals, both of which I am broadly supportive of.  These point to the fact that, whether one likes it or not - and I do like it - the clock is ticking on Ireland's tax model, to be very neutral, or Ireland's tax haven model, to be descriptive, as I would be.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions related to this general point for both MEPs.  First, would they accept the point that, whether they agree with it or not, the global picture is changing to put Ireland's tax model into question, between what is happening in the US and in Europe and with Brexit?  Second, would they agree with the description of Ireland's tax model as a tax haven, specifically a conduit tax haven, reflected by the fact that over 50% of royalty outflows from Ireland go to countries that are quite clearly tax havens.  I refer to Bermuda and other such countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#J00600","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2205,"content":"<p>Is the global picture changing?  The dynamic absolutely is.  As I mentioned, I have been a member of the committees in the European Parliament dealing with this issue.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons this is becoming an issue.  Governments are recognising that they are losing income at a time when citizens are being asked to pay ever increasing stealth charges and additional family taxes, whether it be on homes or whatever.  There is increasing pressure on governments also to ensure corporations pay their fair share of tax.  There is also an issue globally.  An awful lot of people are asking themselves about issues pertaining to the injustice of tax avoidance by corporations.  Nicolas Shaxson wrote a very good book in which he estimated or quoted someone else's figures to the effect that for every &euro;1 western countries provide in development aid to Third World countries, our corporations deny those same countries &euro;8.  If we got tax justice right, we could contribute eight times more to the developing world.  It would be fair, it would not be charity and it would not cost us as citizens a single penny.<\/p><p> For all of those issues, there has been a very welcome shift in dealing with this.  We can have discussions around the measures.  For example, when the CCCTB proposals were initially being put in place, tax avoidance had very little to do with it.  It was a power grab.  The latest package put forward is couched in the language of tax avoidance and put forward on that premise.  The GUE-NGL group in the European Parliament, which Deputy Murphy will know very well, commissioned a report assessing the potential impact of CCCTB and found there were many questions.  The report noted that in some cases, CCCTB would result in some companies paying less tax.  There were a number of fundamental flaws in the Commission's package, even without going into the issue of tax sovereignty which, of course, was an issue for our own party.<\/p><p> As to whether Ireland is a tax haven, it does not matter what I think.  The problem, from our point of view, is that lots of other people think so.  Oxfam has repeatedly described Ireland as a tax haven.  As a member of the committee dealing with tax avoidance, every report and book I have read and the majority of people addressing these issues at our hearings have cited Ireland as an example of bad practice.  That is bad for us on a number of levels, including in terms of our international reputation, our capacity to withstand moves at EU level to harmonise taxation rates and, crucially, it is bad for those of us who want to protect and maintain foreign direct investment and encourage others to come.<\/p><p> The fact of the matter is that, right across the world, consumers and shareholders are demanding of their companies that they be squeaky clean when it comes to tax avoidance.  It is fitting into the framework when companies decide where to locate.  I do not want to be provocative, but it is like the child labour issue for our generation.  Companies do not want to be associated with it.  If a country has a reputation which is clouded at even the most peripheral level with the notion of tax avoidance, some companies will want to move away from it.  I can understand at some level why people would think us taking the Apple case to court and adopting other measures might be necessary to protect foreign direct investment, but in the medium to long term those actions could in fact damage the economic model they claim they want to protect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Carthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2207,"content":"<p>We were asked two questions, the first of which was whether things are changing.  They are changing and the evidence from BEPS is that it has made a difference.  We are trying to assess as a consequence of the 13 actions so far how much extra has been brought in.  Irish corporate tax receipts are a bit frothy and we need to be concerned about their sustainability.  Of our total tax pie, 15% of tax receipts are the corporates whereas the OECD average is 8%.  For every man, woman and child, the corporates pay &euro;1,700 whereas in Germany it is &euro;600 and in France it is &euro;700.  We depend on this.  If it is knocked out by &euro;1 billion, it is a major problem no matter who is in government.<\/p> <p>  The international environment has actually helped us to get more money in as more money is brought onshore.  An interesting point I raised recently with President Draghi is on the changes brought about in the USA recently.  One of President Trump's few achievements domestically has involved the tax changes implemented from 1 January 2018.  We will not see their full effect until next year's reporting period.  There will be two effects.  First, a huge amount of money will be brought onshore to the United States of America to take the credit of this redistributive tax rate.  That will prolong the US economy's comeback.  It will be a significant tax return, as we are already hearing in the USA.  Second, significant holes will be left in eurozone banks as a consequence of the money coming onshore to the USA.  The ECB admits that it has yet to see the full implication of that.  In this world of tax changes, it is not just at OECD level, it is also within the European Union and the USA.<\/p> <p>  I reject the notion that Ireland has tax haven status, obviously.  However, I get the point that Mr. Carthy makes, which is about what other people think.  I want to be the first to admit honestly that there was significant reputational damage done to Ireland as a consequence of the Apple case.  Those of us who work in the institutions can testify to that.  People do not fully understand the context of these things and they do not understand the arms-length principle of the OECD and how it is applied by our Revenue.  All of these issues will be worked out.  Nevertheless, significant reputational damage was done to Ireland as a consequence of that decision.  That is not to say significant improvements were not made when Deputy Burton and others were in government in closing down the double Irish, establishing the FATCA arrangement and changing residency rules.  All of those things are very important.  We have a legacy issue here which is hard to explain and we can point to a very significant tax take on the corporate side as evidence of the fact that corporates pay their fair share in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  For Europe to remain strong, we must always be welcoming to investment.  Very significant international players from outside the European Union, that is from third countries, operate within the EU, including its peripheral regions.  I can keep making the point that Apple employs 6,000 people in Ireland.  These are real people doing real jobs in real communities and paying real mortgages.  They are ordinary people and our Irish people.  We have a collective responsibility to defend a model of industrial development which has been very successful for Ireland, produces genuine goods and services and real value added across the European Union.  A lot of people are jealous of that success.  We did not have an industrial revolution and we did not have colonies.  We were colonised.  The idea that everyone is the same on day 1 is not the case.  We had to do things differently because of that model.  Of course, the model will adapt and change as it must as things move up the value chain.  However, in trying to rebut some of these arguments, we must point to our successes also.  I am very conscious of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2208,"content":"<p>That was the easy question.

The Government acknowledges that there is a problem and a danger of reputational damage and it has to be seen to do something.  As such, it is in favour of something happening.

I do not have any illusions about where the European Commission is coming from and that it is seriously interested in tackling tax evasion for the benefit of the public.  It reflects the interests of the bigger states and it is trying to grab more tax revenue.  In referring to the paper, Sinn F&eacute;in is trying to say it is left-sided opposition to the CCCTB but it is not.  The points made by the witness relate to tax sovereignty, and fundamentally it is about sending a signal to businesses operating in this country.  It is establishing the idea that although they may not agree with everything, Sinn F&eacute;in will be a safe pair of hands when it is in government.

It is a fundamental right of people to elect a Government to make such decisions.  With monetary and fiscal policy, we have given away too much power and that has limited our ability to enact progressive change in this country.  The problem with a common corporate tax system across the EU is that the ink would not be dry before the next proposal would come in on income and other tax regimes.  The argument would be fundamentally undermined as parties in countries like Ireland would have acceded to the principle that there would be taxation on an EU level.  We are not opposed to unitary taxation regimes.  For example, we believe the corporation tax regime should be on a global scale.  In the EU, companies are manipulating individual states.  If there is an EU-only CCCTB type of system, we would be further offshoring the practice as companies would move their base to other parts of the world, as they have done on many levels.<\/p> <p>  To be clear, I want corporations to pay their fair share of tax.  I do not get bogged down on issues of flat rate or the issue of the 12.5% rate.  I am happy with the 12.5% rate for corporation tax as long as corporations pay it, which they are not.  We need to be much more vocal about that and put measures in place in that respect.  I agree entirely that the Government's position on public country by country reporting is an absolute scandal and cannot be equated to anything relating to tax sovereignty.  It is about tax transparency, which is a completely different matter.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if we are trying to appease corporations or whatever.

We will not on day one try to drive out foreign direct investment that we have as it plays a pivotal role in many parts of the economy.  Many workers and people who support my party and the Deputy's party work for those companies.  If corporations, wherever they are based, are willing to come to Ireland and provide well-paid employment while paying their corporation tax, Sinn F&eacute;in will be a safe pair of hands for them.

I will come back to the broader tax issue later but I will first speak to a slightly different area.  This week we had another event with Ulster Bank and I am asking about consumer protection.  Frankly, I do not believe the bank's explanation.  European banking is part of the global banking process and there is a massive amount of outsourcing of back office services to different countries.  In 2012, Ulster Bank had a disastrous meltdown with its accounting functions.  It was a systems breakdown that might have been affected by outsourcing to countries around the world by the parent company, Royal Bank of Scotland.<\/p> <p>  This is apparently an extraordinary case of human error, with somebody pressing or not pressing a button or whatever, leading to people's accounts losing much money.  We are all expected to trust that banks are okay, even given what happened as recently as 2012.  Many pensioners right across Ireland have pensions from places like the Department of Social Protection paid directly into bank accounts, as it is the mechanism of choice.  The problem in 2012 went on for a number of weeks, leading to difficulty for many people.  Consumer protection and regulation is definitely a problem in Ireland but is it a European problem?  There is a destructive tension between regulation and consumer protection, and the loser is always consumer protection.  We really do not get adequate reports on what happens.  Perhaps somebody fell asleep in this case or was working for too long.  We have not heard anything and the bank told us nothing happened, except that many people's accounts were affected.  It was a major event in banking.<\/p><p>Do the witnesses have a view on that tension between consumer protection and regulation?  They will both be aware that here in Dublin the Central Bank is responsible for consumer protection as well as regulation.  There is a separate but much weaker consumer protection agency.  In respect of much relating to the trackers and, particularly, to distressed mortgages in cases where people are making an effort to pay, if there was a stronger consumer protection model it would be possible to get deals done for people who are co-operating.  That is my view.  From a European point of view, do the witnesses get any sense of that?<\/p><p> The second thing again relates to Ireland.  For approximately six years a German bank has been offering to run a pilot somewhere in Ireland, possibly in the middle or north of the midlands, around small-scale banking based on the German model.  Mr. Hayes will remember from his time in the Department that this German bank was coming in to meet people and so on.  To be perfectly honest, there seems to be incredible negativity towards that initiative.  Do the witnesses also find that in Europe?  Clearly banks are fleeing less well-off parts of big cities and towns.  There is often not even an ATM.  The same is true in significant numbers of rural areas.  From a consumer service point of view, do the witnesses have any sense of there being a European model which we could access?  Clearly there has been a deal with An Post in respect of its potential future viability.  However that will again take a bit of time.  They are my two questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#L01400","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2224,"content":"<p>To address the last question first, this is a huge problem within the European Union which is regularly reflected in debates in the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, ECON.  As Deputy Burton rightly says, it started even before the fintech revolution, but with the rise of technology in banking banks are getting out of branches and distribution arms.  Everything is online.  That is putting more and more pressure on the systems as banks move from one platform to the next, which we saw this week not only in Ulster Bank, but in the case of TSB in the UK.  It is a huge problem not just for consumers, but for the banks who have to decide how to deal with this and how to provide for it in their balance sheets.<\/p> <p>  Our consumer protection in the European Union is not good enough.  When the tracker mortgage scandal hit I made a complaint directly to Commissioner Vestager asking whether the banks were colluding in this matter.  Her investigation remains open on the basis that she has real, genuine power.  If one looks at competition policies one will see that the Directorate-General for Competition, DG COMP, has significant power in the European Union.  That is not the case in the area of consumer protection.  We have not done enough to advance that.  It is probably a cop-out for the European institutions to say that the Central Bank of Ireland is the consumer protection arm of the State and that it is up to it to deal with these things.  I made a note of what the Deputy said.  We have directives on the issue of unfair contracts and on unfair commercial practices, UCP, both of which affect consumers, but they are not within DG COMP.  DG COMP has the stick and the power.  It can go after institutions with genuine fines and it frightens them.  We need to move to that model.<\/p> <p>  Earlier on we had a discussion on mortgages.  I personally believe we need more players in that market.  I was making that case.  There are two things we could do to help.  One is that we could have an EU-wide directive on insolvency which would allow more players into Ireland because they would have more certainty that they could get their money out at the end of it.  The second thing is that we need an EU approach to valuations.  If we had that there would certainly be more players in financial services.  It is the one great failure of the past ten years.  A lot of progress has been made on regulation, supervision and putting in a directive on how to resolve banks, but no progress has been made on cross-country financial services, which account for less than 10% of insurance and mortgages.  That is work for the next ten years but it cannot be done without proper EU-wide consumer protection.  The question is whether member states will give up that function.  It will require a significant bumping up of responsibilities at an EU level.  Some 85% of all competition cases are taken at member state level.  They are not taken by DG COMP.  It takes the big cases like Monsanto and Apple but it does not take the other cases of genuine dereliction of duty by businesses.  That is something we need to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Hayes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2225,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Burton for her questions.  I do not have much to add in respect of consumer protection because, as Mr. Hayes has said, the EU is very weak in that area in terms of financial services.  As we have seen the advances with the capital market union and all the rest, one of the things we have been calling for is an expansion of powers at EU level for the European supervisory authorities.  We need an EU consumer protection agency specifically for financial services.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, every time we raise particular issues with the European Central Bank, ECB, in respect of Irish banks and their treatment of consumers - which as the Deputy knows sometimes verges on the atrocious, particularly in respect of the tracker mortgage scandal, in which we have seen even more developments in recent days - it continually redirects us to the Central Bank.  I know this committee and others have been having detailed discussions on whether the Central Bank needs additional powers or whether it needs to use the powers it currently has.  Last night I was reading the story of someone who has lost their home as a direct consequence of the tracker mortgage scandal.  Something needs to happen.  I will not direct this committee on what needs to happen.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised a really good point on small banking.  It is one of the things I found most surprising in the European Parliament because there is a European representative body for many of those small community banks.  It regularly comes to the European Parliament and meets us and gives its input in respect of legislative proposals coming from the Commission and how they would impact its members.  It is a source of real disappointment that we do not have an equivalent sector here in Ireland because one can see the support it provides for small businesses and families.  I know we have the credit union movement and post offices, which the Deputy mentioned, but these banks are on a different level in terms of being able to provide a certain level of investment.  Of course we need to be mindful of some of the other provisions we put in place.  I know of many very successful credit unions that are under huge pressures as a result of measures being put in place by the regulator that were intended for the larger financial institutions.  That is not to say that we do not need regulation for credit unions because clearly we do.  <\/p> <p>  I would absolutely welcome any initiative taken on this issue in these Houses.  We might be able to facilitate something like that at an EU level and could assist with discussions on how we could promote and encourage the establishment of that type of banking sector.  I am sure that other Irish MEPs would be very eager to engage with committees such as this if they were to come to us with a proposal for an initiative in the European Parliament to bring some of the actors in other states together in order to learn from their experiences and perhaps encourage people in Ireland to make a move on something like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Carthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1524733200,"counter":2226,"content":"<p>To go back slightly, my second question is on digital taxation.  In recent times Italy seems to have been having conversations with companies about locating in Italy and thereby creating a jobs base, particularly in parts of northern Italy.  The consequence of that, in terms of some of the discussions on the digital tax, is that Italy is going to allow credit in respect of other taxes levied on such entities in that country.  Is that a model which the French, for example, will follow?  The French actually do well out of IT but they certainly have a fixation on Ireland in that respect.  They have had that fixation over the tenure of the last two or three presidents.  It is kind of a long-running thing for them.  Do the witnesses have a sense of what the trade-offs are likely to be?

Many of the questions to the Commissioner in ECON were on how he would assess this.  It would be self-administered by companies with regard to how many users they had in Apple, Google and Airbnb, which is effectively deciding that policy within each company.  They see it as an additional amount, not as a substitute on existing tax that is paid.  They do not see it as a potential write-off for the purposes the Italians might be using at present.  I do not see that proposal working.  However, I see some movement.  The Deputy asked about the trade off.  The trade off could well be some movement on digital tax over a period of time as an interim measure before the OECD can come to an agreement with possibly a sunset element.  As I said in my statement earlier, there is some potential in that, with the trade off ultimately being for member states to believe that the wider question on the corporate tax base and consolidation would be left to another day.<\/p> <p>  To be frank, the bigger concern for Ireland is the CCCTB issue, not digital tax, because of its additionality.  The Germans, and this has only changed since the new Finance Minister took over, are now very concerned about the impact this is going to have with the United States of America in this tit-for-tat warfare between the US and the EU.  Consider the very hefty fine that was given to Deutsche Bank, during the Obama Administration, for a tiny indiscretion which most American bankers would feel was totally disproportionate.  However, then they say in the next breath, \"Well look at how you are treating Apple.  We will treat Deutsche Bank this way\".  The whole thing disconnects itself.  I believe the Germans are very concerned at present that this can turn into a tit-for-tat.  As the Deputy knows, proposals that are made in the last year of a Commission are generally ironed out much later.  However, potentially there will be a trade off by accepting some type of digital tax on the basis that the broader issue of CCCTB is left to one side.  That is my political sense at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#N00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Hayes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2228,"content":"<p>Not to repeat anything that has just been said or anything I said earlier, it will be interesting to see what happens in Italy.

In terms of Facebook what does one do if a company in France advertises on Facebook, an individual in Germany hits \"like\" on that sponsored advertisement and then the algorithm is used by Facebook or sold to a third party to generate an economic strategy in a third country?  Where exactly is the profit made and directed and which state draws it down?  There are big questions.  As I said earlier, the only clear answer I have is that we need to figure out a way of taxing these guys because it is unfair and unsustainable.  The tech sector is likely to become much bigger in the future and if we do not find a mechanism to tax it sufficiently we know that either services will suffer or families will suffer because they will be expected to pay even more taxes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Carthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2229,"content":"<p>I wish to make another point.

We will bring forward the views of the committee in that.<\/p> <p>  I oppose digital taxation or tax harmonisation.  Each state has its own obligations and responsibilities in that regard and that is how it should be.  With regard to the Central Bank, it tells us that it deals with the issue of consumer protection.  However, looking at what happened with the tracker mortgage issue, for example, and the recent failure of Ulster Bank's systems, it is not consumer protection but standards within banking that have caused both of those issues to arise.  The ECB must have a view on the Irish banks that have allowed such circumstances to arise whereby so many Irish customers are now affected by the tracker mortgage issue and by the breakdown of the system in Ulster Bank.  When this committee went about contacting the ECB it very quickly kicked the ball back to the Central Bank.  The ECB was very active when this country was broke and it did all sorts of things to restructure the banks, but when there was even a smell of consumer protection it turned its back on us and on the Irish people.  Is there any way of raising this issue in a significant way with the European Central Bank and to show it that it is not a consumer protection issue but a failure of regulation in Ireland and a failure of the banking system, which directly affects the citizens of this country and the European Union?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#N00600","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2233,"content":"<p>My sense is that the ECB regards the local central banks in the 19 member states of the eurozone as the conduits for consumer protection and it does not want to get involved in what is their responsibility.  If one asks that question the ECB will reply that if its mandate and articles are changed it will do that, but that at present it does not have the power to do it.  It will be constantly aware of the issues that are going on in the banks but it looks at these issues on a macro prudential basis.  Of course, there is a macro prudential basis.  If banks are conning people to the tune of &euro;500 million, as we now know on the tracker issue, involving not 8,000 or 9,000 but 35,000 people, I believe it is a macro prudential issue.  I have raised that with the ECB in terms of the stability of the Irish banking sector in circumstances where people have been let down.  That is an important point and we have to keep raising it.  However, the ECB is slow to get involved in what it describes as national competent authorities, NCAs, in this case the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Central Bank of Ireland is on the board of the ECB and the SSM and the ECB wants to create clear independence between its monetary function and the operation of that monetary policy in Ireland through the Central Bank.

I believe a very senior individual from the European Union was a director of that bank at the time.  In spite of making the formal complaint, nothing ever happened.  When I attended with him at the Central Bank recently to make the complaint and find out what was happening and get its response, it made every effort to close him down and to close down that meeting.  I will deal with that when its representatives come before us again.  The Central Bank said it was one incident but he said it was not just one incident.  He said that over a long period of time there were a number of breaches of the regulation and that he was told by that bank not to make another complaint to the Central Bank.  As an employee he was forced not to do it, and everyone disregards that.  That is a very bad reflection on the European Central Bank.  It undermines the regulation to think that that individual told the guards and the Central Bank:  \"I am here.  I have broken the rules.\"  He should have been arrested and the bank charged, but nothing happened.  I am asking the witnesses, as Members of the European Parliament, what they think of that.  How do they protect that man's rights?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018042600002#O00400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524733200,"counter":2243,"content":"<p>That is the fundamental question.  The European Parliament was very clear on this question.  In any of the reports I have supported attempts were made to protect whistleblowers to make sure that where people make disclosures there is not just a beginning but a middle and an end point.  As I understand it, the dilemma in the case the Chairman refers to is that there is no end point to that investigation.  What people want to see when they come forward with a disclosure in the financial services area, or anywhere, is that there is a process which will get to an end point.  They may not be satisfied with the end point.  They may not have confidence in the outcome, but they need to know that the process is in train to get that outcome.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked what we can do.  When the tracker issue broke, I knew what the reply would be from the ECB.  It would be that the Irish Central Bank is dealing with it.  The Central Bank representatives were very slow off the blocks in this committee.  I remember what was said very well.  Things have improved since then.  It has taken us longer, and I believe by the summer we will be in a better position in terms of the number of people who were abused in that entire process as a consequence of the tracker scandal.  The Chairman of this committee and the Government can look back over a 12-month period and tell people that that issue has been resolved but unless it changes its mandate, the European Central Bank will not get involved on a country-specific issue like that.  However, the window is on the issue of the Commission.  I complained on the tracker scandal.  I argued that there was systemic collusion within the banking system, which effectively allowed all of them to take people off the legitimate rate they were on over that period of time.<\/p> <p>  As I said, Commissioner Vestager, in a comprehensive reply, said she was aware of and understood this problem and that within her Directorate-General, DG, there is an opportunity for people to make a disclosure secretly without publicising their name, rank or whatever.  If there is information on collusion, she wants to hear about it and she will be on top of the banks like a tonne of bricks.  That was the effect of what she was saying.  I believe that is a more effective arm of the institution of the Commission because, as I said to Deputy Burton earlier, it has genuine built-up confidence in this area and a legal basis for what it is doing, but it requires evidence to be brought forward.  The investigation I complained about is still open.  If there were people who saw some form of collusion or anti-competitive practice because effectively there would have been collusion in Irish banks against other banks in other member states of the European Union, it would have been a fundamental breach of EU law to come forward with that information to her.

I would argue it played a very destructive role in terms of the troika and the bailout programme.  We know of the telephone call about bombs going off in Dublin, and the letters Mr. Trichet sent to our Minister for Finance at the time.  It is very frustrating when we know the impact they have had on Ireland's economy for the ECB to simply reply, when we say, \"By the way, these banks that you forced us to bail out are now treating our citizens with absolute disdain\" that there is nothing it can do about that and that we should go back to our Central Bank.<\/p> <p>  The accountability of the ECB is to the European Parliament and both myself and Mr. Hayes would have engaged on that.

It ultimately see its mandate in monetary policy and getting the rate of inflation to 2%, which would solve a lot of the debt problems we face.  The view of the independence of central banks is different in other parts of the European Union.  Some have a more political view, while others have an entirely independent view of what the functions of central banks are, that they cannot be contaminated by politics and must have a singular view of monetary policy.

They will tell us what they can, but they are very guarded about what their mandate is.

It does not interfere with their trade, but smaller countries are afraid to engage.  The European Union office is staffed by different member states who are trading there.  I would like to see the European Union deciding as a collective  to support that office in order that Ireland could work through it and to protect everyone.  It is an initiative the European Union could certainly take.  There are 24 million people living in Taiwan and it would be a worthwhile trading partner once the one China policy was overcome.

The officials, Mr. Kiely, head of European Commission Representation in Ireland, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Tynan of the Commissioner's cabinet, are very welcome.  The joint meeting is convened today to discuss some developing issues in the formation of the new Common Agricultural Policy policy as well as additional EU developments including Brexit, EU trade negotiations and the roads development programme.  The Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae is also present.  I welcome him to the meeting.  I welcome the Commissioner back.

The Commissioner has other appointments later on.<\/p> <p>  As the Commissioner is aware, the EU is at a very crucial juncture in its history and the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, itself is undergoing a reform process that could define its future.  As he is also aware, a delegation of the committee participated in the parliamentary committee meeting that he addressed at the European Parliament on Tuesday where a number of the pressing issues were discussed.  Perhaps the most serious issue of all is the budget and how the new CAP will be resourced, particularly where there is a distinct possibility this may be reduced.  Another very serious issue is generational renewal and encouraging more young people to enter and maintain an interest in farming.  Environmental measures and external conversions also appear to have the potential to be contentious in the months ahead.  Outside CAP, the farming community is concerned with Brexit, Mercosur, the possibility of a hard border still looming in the absence of concrete and specific proposals, coupled with a more open trade policy that could be detrimental to EU interests, more notably for beef, but also for sugar and ethanol.  Before I invite the Commissioner to make his opening statement, I ask the Chair of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development, Deputy Joe Carey to say a few words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#A00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2278,"content":"<p>Good afternoon.  On behalf of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development, I thank the Chairman for organising and proposing this meeting and I thank the Commissioner for coming back here, our previous meeting having been postponed because of the snow.  On behalf of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development, I welcome Commissioner Hogan and look forward to discussions on issues of rural and community development at EU level.  The Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development is a new Oireachtas committee and held its first meeting on 29 November 2017.  The committee shadows the Department of Community and Rural Development whose remit extends to rural development, community development and infrastructure, national broadband roll-out, administration of EU funding programmes, development of libraries, social inclusion, water safety and charity regulation.<\/p> <p>  Rural developments support the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy and my committee is very interested in several elements of this policy.  The EU plans to spend nearly &euro;100 billion on a rural development policy for the period 2014 to 2020 through the European agricultural fund for rural development.  We plan to spend more than &euro;4.02 billion of public money on a rural development programme for Ireland over the same period and &euro;2.19 billion of this funding will be from EU sources.  Given the level of expenditure involved and its importance in supporting a vital part of our economy, I welcome the opportunity today to discuss such issues as the Leader programme, CAP reform, EU trade policy and the effect of Brexit.  However, the future is unknowable and unforeseen shocks to the system such as Brexit and the recent threats to international trade can undo the best laid plans.<\/p> <p>  The committee welcomes the publication of the EU Commission's communication last November on the future of food and farming, which followed a consultation on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy.  In my committee's view, this will assist in getting a better understanding of where the current policy can be simplified and modernised to the benefit of all parties.  This is in line with the recommendations from the special report on rural development programming of the European Court of Auditors 2017 which called for increased consistency and simplification.  We welcome in particular the following proposals under the reform - to make the CAP simpler; increase subsidiarity in view to reducing the administration burden; improved co-ordination between different policies such as CAP and the rural development policy; and recognise the need for co-operation between state and local agencies to sustain rural communities.<\/p> <p>  My committee looks forward to budget proposals from the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and the full proposals on how the goals outlined in the EU communication on the future of CAP will be achieved.  It is within this context that my committee recommends promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development in rural areas, simplifying the processes to access EU funding, for example, that provided under the Leader programme, so that local groups can focus on working on the ground in rural communities, supporting rural and agricultural communities affected by Brexit.  On behalf of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development, I would now like to put the following questions and observations to the Commissioner.  The CAP has had clear successes to date and in order that it continues to do so, what greater responsibilities does he see for Ireland in meeting the objectives of a more simple and reformed policy?<\/p><p>How can the local-led approach of the Leader programme be improved to achieve better co-ordination and to fully realise rural potential?  What impact will Brexit have on the EU budget and what is the likely outcome for rural development in Ireland?  Overall, how satisfied is the Commissioner with the EU's rural development policy?  I look forward to Commissioner Hogan's responses to these questions and I am sure that the other members of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development will also have comments and questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#A00500","speaker":"1273","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2280,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Carey.

It is good to be back.  I thank the committees for facilitating this meeting.  As the Co-Chairman has said, earlier this week I participated in an interparliamentary committee meeting with the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.  Some of the members present were able to be there.  We covered a number of issues but we can always go back over them again.<\/p> <p>  Last week, I spoke in a debate in the European Parliament in which I acknowledged that \"national Parliaments play an essential role in bringing the Union closer to its citizens\".  We have to rely on members to scrutinise the activities of their own Government but they should also be able to scrutinise the programmes which we have at European level.  As public representatives, this is the way it should be.   <\/p> <p>  I recognise the immense hardship caused by the prolonged winter and the rainfall levels in recent months, which have particularly affected livestock and tillage farmers throughout the country.  We are all very conscious of the stress that this has caused for farmers, both financial and emotional.  The weather seems to have improved and the images of animals going back out into the fields were certainly welcome, though obviously we would have liked to have seen them in better condition.  As members are aware, last October the European Commission was requested to allow additional advance payments to be made under the basic payment scheme and advance payments were increased from 50% to 70%.  I was requested to allow that increase by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In recent weeks the Minister also requested me to allow Irish tillage farmers to derogate from the crop diversification requirement, which is known as the \"three-crop rule\".  This is being implemented since 11 April.  I made a political decision with the Commissioner for the Environment to do so.  Of course the paperwork has to be completed but nevertheless farmers have been able to sow their corn and their crops from 11 April without having to comply with the three-crop rule.<\/p> <p>  This meeting comes at an opportune time.  Next week, the European Commission will adopt its budget proposal for the period from 2020 to 2027.  Like the Estimates process with which the members are all familiar, there is always a little bit of toing and froing between the relevant Commissioners and the Commissioners responsible for the budget.  It is no secret that this is also going on in Brussels at the moment.  The difficulty this time arises because we have &euro;12 billion less as a result of Brexit and because of the expectation of member states that more money will be spent on other policy areas at European level, particularly security, defence and migration.  That would cost another &euro;12 billion if it were to be implemented immediately.  There are only two places from which we can get money, that is, from the member states or from \"own resources\" as it called.  This refers to various sources of money such as the emissions trading scheme.  This money is required to fill the deficit in the EU budget.  The Irish Government and other governments - 21 governments out of 27 in fact - have indicated that they are prepared to look at putting more money into the pot.  However, this decision must be made by unanimity so we have to work hard over the next year to convince the five or six countries which are holding back if we want to get agreement on a well-funded and fully-funded European budget, such as we have at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I have made this point strongly  when I visited a number of countries and met not only ministers for agriculture, but prime ministers.  I have also been offering a robust defence of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the value for money it delivers.  I genuinely believe that the CAP has stood the test of time and has been a remarkable success, but a successful policy is often taken for granted.  Nobody here should be under any illusion about the extent of the challenge facing the budget.  My job is to try to build strong alliances in order to resist the worst of these cuts and achieve the best possible outcome for our family farm model.  That is what I am doing at the moment.  <\/p> <p>  We are proposing some significant changes in the context of the CAP communication.  As members will know, on 29 November I indicated that we have to have a new way of delivering the CAP in order to bring about greater simplification of this policy.  We have European rules and we have member state rules.  In my view we do not need both.  We want to move from a rules-based and compliance-based approach to an approach based on performance and results.  We have to do more for the environment and for public goods.  This is the only way we can adapt our CAP policy in order to be able to show our European taxpayers and all members of society that food security is important but that public goods are equally important.  Our farmers certainly have a role to play and I want to see farmers as part of the solution, not part of the problem.<\/p> <p>  Guaranteeing a fair level of direct payments for farmers to support their work is, in my view, not alone essential and not alone for the benefit of farmers, but for the benefit of the wider society.  Farmers are both the producers and providers of our food and the custodians of the countryside and the front line in the protection of the rural environment.  They are effectively our boots on the ground in delivering on environment and climate change.  I also want to see our small and medium-sized farmers protected from the worst excesses of what may be a difficult budget.  I have been making the case throughout Europe that this is about equity and fairness for our farmers, who provide our people with so many public goods.<\/p> <p>  Some pure economists, in this country and outside it, advocate the abolition of direct payments and say that there should only be payments for public goods.  I do not agree with this.  We need income support for our farmers in order that they can survive.  We cannot have a sustainable society without sustainable farmers.  This is particularly the case for our small and medium-sized farmers.  If we expect our farmers to make a bigger contribution to climate challenge and other societal goals, that has to be taken into account in terms of the budgetary allocations made.  Members will hear more about this over the next few days, next Wednesday to be precise.  <\/p> <p>  On the proposals for CAP reform, which will be published in late May or early June, we are moving away from the one-size-fits-all solution designed to be applicable from the Inishowen Peninsula to the Greek islands, or from Slea Head to Lapland.  Not every farmer in these places does things in the same way and we have to reflect that in the spirit of subsidiarity and flexibility at member state level.  We are addressing this in the context of our proposals on the CAP.  The European Union will continue to have decision-making responsibility in respect of policy and key objectives, while there will be more flexibility for member states to draw up CAP strategic plans in order to meet those objectives.  Member states will have discretion to decide on the appropriate measures to meet these objectives, having regard to their own specific circumstances, whether that is in terms of farming practices, climate or other conditions.  In Ireland's case, these measures will have to be included in Ireland's CAP strategic plans, which will be subject to approval by the Commission.  The achievement of these measures will be assessed by reference to set indicators and targets.<\/p> <p>  Some members will be aware that the existing approval system for the rural development programme can be lengthy, cumbersome and, sometimes, frustrating.  We are determined, as part of our commitment to greater simplification, to make the new approval process more straightforward and efficient.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I referred to the dreadful weather under which farmers have been trying to operate.  These conditions have added to the costs of farming and it will not be easy for many of those farmers to recover these costs in the short term.  Farmers deserve a fair price for their produce.  This is where we are tackling the issue of unfair trading practices.  These proposals are targeted not just at farmers and small and medium enterprises, but also at tackling the broader food waste crisis across Europe.  Buyers will have to become smarter and more responsive to consumer demands when they can no longer load the risk and cost of food waste on producers.  We will have a more ordered and more governed food supply chain.  It is an initial proposal, which can be built upon by the member state governments and the European Parliament.  We are doing this in the form of a directive which recognises that many member states are already doing things about unfair trade practices.  These proposals can supplement and improve those actions.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, said at the April Council of Ministers' meeting that the purpose of the legislation is to complement, not replace, that which functions well already, where that is the case.<\/p><p>With regard to trade, Ireland is a major exporting country in agrifood exports.  For the year as a whole, it is estimated that the value of food and drink exports increased by 13%, representing growth of almost 60% since 2010.  Exports to the UK rose by an estimated 7% to some &euro;4.4 billion despite the weakness of sterling.  However, Bord Bia figures suggest the share of exports to the UK has continued to fall despite the top-line growth figure, and the market share for exports to the UK is now estimated at 35%, down two points on last year.  Therefore, we have to diversify.  We have been travelling around the world with various business delegations in order to see what we can do to diversify, and we have succeeded in many places, for example, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, Canada and, recently, in Mexico.  I know there are concerns about trade negotiations with Mercosur, and these are certainly recognised as sensitive by the EU and as part of the mandate of member state Governments in the European Parliament.<br\/><br\/>A diversification strategy is essential if the agricultural sector as a whole, and particularly the beef sector, is to be protected from the worst effects of Brexit, given we have no idea yet what kind of future relationship we will have or what will exist between the UK and the EU.  I am continuing my economic offensive to identify and access new and emerging markets.  I remind the committee that the most recent EU figures showed monthly exports at a record level of &euro;11.5 billion, adding up to a 12-month total of more than &euro;130 billion in 2017, which is the highest ever.  I am not saying that is happening because I am the Commissioner but, nevertheless, if there was anything going wrong, I am sure I would have heard about it.  I look forward to many people mentioning this figure in the months ahead.<br\/><br\/>I am going to China with a business delegation arising from the very important opening of that market to beef in recent times, and four meat companies from Ireland will be accompanying us as part of a 71-strong delegation.  The opening of the Chinese market is fortuitous and we hope Bord Bia and the Department will be able to deliver exports there, sooner rather than later.  I pay tribute to the relationship the Irish Government and Irish public representatives have had with the Chinese embassy and the Chinese authorities in bringing this about.  This has been a long time in gestation and it has come about because of painstaking political dialogue over a long period, and I am happy to see it has now come to fruition.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, I want to deal with the issue of relations between the United States and the EU in the context of trade.  These are sensitive times and there is always the potential for a trade war in agriculture and food products between the US and the rest of the world in which European agricultural food products could become collateral damage, for example, in a trade war between the US and China.  It is very difficult to understand how the US would target EU companies because we are supposed to be on the same side of the argument when it comes to the surplus of aluminium and steel <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>China.  Nevertheless, the strategy and tactics of the US are certainly something that change from day to day, so there will be sensitivities around some Irish products that might be on the list.  However, we have to reflect that all regions of the EU are affected and all regions take the responsibility if this is the way the US wishes to proceed.<br\/><br\/>Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m has been very active.  She has gone to the US and the economy Ministers of many states have also been to the US, particularly those from Germany and France, to try to highlight the difficulties that would be created for the trading relationship of European companies <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the US if this was to come to pass.  We hope that common sense will prevail and that the good relationship we have on the trading side, given the 11% increase in trade between the EU and the US last year, will not be affected and will continue.  We want to assure co-operatives and medium-size businesses in the food and drinks area, which are worried about this situation, that we are doing everything to convince the US President by 12 May so he will not in any way pull the levers of some irresponsible action that will have unintended consequences for our agrifood trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2283,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for his overview of the situation.

On Brexit and the future of the EU, does he have any insights on whether the UK will change its mind on staying within the customs union or find some customs solution that will go a long way to mitigating the impact on the Border with Northern Ireland?  How does he see Ireland's place in the future of the EU without the UK, and how much do we need to change our strategy?<\/p> <p>  The Commissioner knows there are serious concerns in Ireland about the future of the suckler herd.  Simply put, it is not profitable at present for them to stay in business, given the current status of payments to suckler farmers.  If we want to continue with a strong beef sector, we must have suckler farmers making a profit.  At the moment, given what it costs to maintain a cow and keep it alive for 12 months, if all the farmer is gaining is the fact that cow will produce a calf, then the return versus the cost is not enough.  This has been compounded by the weather, which the Commissioner acknowledged, although I will not blame him for the weather today.  Having said that, there is a very serious situation for suckler farmers.<\/p> <p>  I look to the Commissioner for a comment and an assurance in regard to part-time farmers.  He was a politician in Ireland for long enough to know the down-to-earth facts that young people growing up today - the sons and daughters of farmers - if they are to survive, in the majority of cases, will need to have some other type of employment.  They will need to have some other type of job, be that a part-time job in conjunction with part-time farming, or a full-time job in conjunction with part-time farming.  I hear a lot of what can be at times negative reporting by our media, and sometimes our media can be at sea when it comes to discussing agricultural matters because they are so far removed from reality that they would not realise the impact of what they are saying.  I would like an assurance from the Commissioner in order to support people who are involved in farming on a part-time basis.<\/p> <p>  With regard to transport for fodder, systems were put in place which are finishing up over the coming days.  We need the Commissioner to assist the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure that farmers will get assistance for the next couple of weeks.  I could not finish without acknowledging the work that is being done by our farming organisations, such as the IFA, the ICMSA and all the other groups which have worked so diligently in trying to highlight the problems we have today with agriculture, in particular that since last July it has been torture to be involved in farming.  It was a shame the Government woke up so late to the fact that we were in the middle of a crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#C00300","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2285,"content":"<p>We will take four questions together, if the Commissioner does mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#C00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524747600,"counter":2286,"content":"<p>I have five already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2287,"content":"<p>I am sure Mr. Hogan is quite capable of lumping them together.

I thank him for taking the time to meet both committees.  I acknowledge the importance from a national point of view of having him in the role of Agriculture Commissioner.  I also acknowledge the work he is doing in regard to putting the next CAP programme together, which by and large is amenable to Irish national interests and will be welcomed by countries across Europe in terms of its structure.  The Commissioner mentioned subsidiarity and returning more power to the individual member states to frame CAP in a way that suits them, moving from a rules-based CAP to an outputs-based CAP and ensuring there is flexibility within that.  Those are all welcome.<\/p> <p>  Of course, the overarching issue is going to be that of the budget.  I know the Commissioner has been very clear on that in his comments.  We have to look at this against a backdrop where, in the past ten years, there has been a 20% drop in the income coming to Irish farmers from CAP.<\/p><p>It was &euro;1.8 billion in 2007 but it is &euro;1.48 billion now.  It is crucial that a line be drawn under the matter and that those reductions be stopped.  I do not believe any reduction in the next CAP will be acceptable.  Instead, we should acknowledge that CAP is a key part of ensuring that quality food of the highest standard is produced.  That should be acknowledged at EU level in the context of keeping the budget intact.  I know there are challenges but we are certainly depending on the Commissioner to drive this home.  Could he update us about the potential for getting the relevant member states on board with regard to agreeing to contribute more?  I think up to 1.3% of GNI would be required.  Every effort needs to be made in respect of this.<\/p><p> I welcome the &euro;60,000 cap outlined in the draft communiqu&eacute;.  This is something Fianna F&aacute;il has pushed for and it is a welcome move on the part of the Commissioner.  I certainly hope the Government will back him up on that because he will need support at European level over the coming period.<\/p><p> I would be interested in hearing the Commissioner's perspective on the recent comments of the UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis.  The Commissioner has been frank up to now regarding the position of the UK.  It appears that the British Government is still living in dreamland in the context of its approach to Brexit.<\/p><p> On our preparedness for Brexit, in the context of agriculture, I do not believe we are fully on top of the issues.  There is a role to be played by the European Commission in supporting Irish agriculture to prepare for it.  I would be interested in hearing what engagement the Commissioner has had with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on that and whether it has any asks of the Commissioner in terms of support for what it is doing.<\/p><p> What is the Commissioner's position with regard to current negotiations on the Mercosur trade deal?  I emphasise that this proceeding is totally against the interests of farmers, particularly those in the beef sector.  I have grave concern about the impact on the beef sector of the mooted increase on beef imports to 99,000 tonnes.<\/p><p> In the context of fodder, I acknowledge that the Commissioner has outlined clearly his understanding of the pressure farmers have been under domestically.  Certainly, the response at domestic level has been in no way sufficient.  From the point of view of ensuring that the structures are in place to deal with such issues in the future and adverse weather conditions in particular, what more can be done in the context of CAP with regard to putting structures in place so that we are better able to respond to such conditions as they happen instead of taking the kind of haphazard approach that, unfortunately, we have seen in recent times?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#C00700","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2290,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for attending.  I have no doubt he is firmly in our corner with regard to CAP.  I remember saying in the D&aacute;il two years ago that this was the real hole in the bucket.  We are looking at other matters such as trade but the contribution of the British to the CAP budget - at a little over &euro;12 billion - will certainly be a huge issue.  I have no doubt that the Commissioner is fully aware and will be advocating but we must be honest with people.  We must bring some big hitters along like the Dutch and the Danes and get them on board because unanimity is required.  Of course, the Irish Government has already indicated its position.  We pay over &euro;400 million into CAP.  Another 1.1% would bring that up by a further &euro;40 million, &euro;50 million or &euro;60 million and things would still be very good for us here.  We can explain to taxpayers why the increase is necessary.  That is no problem but we have to bring everybody else along.  I have no doubt that the Government and our bureaucrats will play their role but we have to bring everybody else along because they have to be convinced.  Those to whom I refer must, in turn, convince their consumers and the public at large in their jurisdictions so let us not say that we can go in with a big stick.  It will take a lot of very purposeful negotiation to ensure that this will happen and that the budget will be increased.  As the Commissioner said, there are only two places to get this money - one is from here and the other is from other member states.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues I have come across in recent days relates to a concern in respect of which, perhaps, the farming organisations have not advocated as much as should have been the case.  I will advocate what Macra na Feirme has advocated for.  In recent times, significant concern has been expressed by many stakeholders about young farmers and the concept of generational renewal.  There is an issue with structural supports for young farmers.  The moment this is mentioned, people say that they do not want any straight lines, cuts or anything else.  In such circumstances, let us be clear: we cannot swing on both sides.  We must come down somewhere in the middle and that is the way I go in political life.  We need to increase the maximum level of funding beyond 2% and focus on reducing additional barriers to young farmers such as those relating to access to capital, lack of business skills and insufficient succession plans.  To what extent does the Commission propose to protect the family farm structure?  There has been a trend away from doing so in recent years.  Will the Commission explore a long-term strategy for generational renewal, which is very important?  What incentives are under consideration to incentivise greater involvement in agriculture on the part of young people?  I was at Punchestown yesterday and two farmers and an auctioneer told me that this is the big issue and that nobody is talking about it.  I was amazed.  The number of people under 35 who are going into farming is dropping drastically.  It is not just dropping in Ireland.  According to the European Court of Auditors, it decreased from 3.3 million in 2005 to 2.3 million in 2013.  The number of hectares held by young farmers has fallen from 57.7 million across Europe in 2005 to 51 million.  That is a drop of over 6 million.  There will be nothing for the future if we do not sort this out.<\/p> <p>  The EU negotiators are fully aware of the importance of the equine sector, particularly in the context of the horse racing and horse breeding industries, to Ireland's rural economy.  Will the Commissioner take account of the current position of free movement of thoroughbreds between Ireland, Great Britain and France?  A tripartite agreement is in place between the Ministers with responsibility for agriculture in the three countries.  We must remember that 80% of Ireland's exports of thoroughbreds are to the UK.  The Commissioner can, therefore, readily appreciate the importance of the role of trade in the Brexit negotiations, particularly in the context of this vital industry.  We should not lose sight of that fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#D00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2291,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner and his staff.  CAP is the big issue facing us for the next few years.  The budget is vital.  We must ensure the largest possible budget for Irish farmers and farm families.  I welcome the announcement this morning of the &euro;60,000 cap.  That is appropriate at this point.  We must find some way of capping that budget.  This brings me to Pillar 1 in particular.  We have an entitlement system based on something involving farming activities 20 years ago.  Entitlements are becoming a commodity that is traded, leased, rented and messed around with.  There is an opportunity to find a way out of that.  I would appreciate hearing the Commissioner's comments on the matter.  Previously, there was an element of greening in Pillar 1.  Will that be removed?  It was mentioned that there will be more flexibility and that member states will have more autonomy over it.  Will that mean fewer rules and less counting of things, which I think farmers want to see happen, so that there will be an element of trust that the farmer is doing the right thing and does not need to be checked, watched and studied all the time?  The latter has certainly been the experience up to now.<\/p> <p>  With regard to fair trade and fair prices, it always strikes me that every farmer says we need the live export trade.  Unless there is a release valve that creates pressure on the price so that factories can start to pay more, the processors will not give farmers a fair price.  This tells us that the processors and the big meat barons are in the driving seat, which should not be the case.  It is about regulation and trying to bring some flexibility into it so that we can be sure we are looked after.<\/p> <p>  Theresa Villiers has a motion before the House of Commons to stop live exports from Great Britain after Brexit.  This would mean that a farmer in my part of the country in Leitrim who bought a bullock in Fermanagh could not bring it back across the Border because it would be a live export from the UK.  This is the type of nonsensical situation at which we could arrive.<\/p><p>I wish to ask again about the Mercosur trade deal.  On the previous trip to Brussels which I was on the Commissioner said he expected it to be concluded quite soon.  We are some way down the road since then and we have not seen much movement on it.  I welcome that fact.  I hope there will not be much movement on it.  Where does the Commissioner believe that deal is going?  What direction is the EU taking in respect of not only Mercosur but all trade deals?  How vulnerable will Irish agriculture continue to be in the future in respect of such deals, which are being made, by and large, at the behest of big industry and the commercial sector, in particular insurance and financial services, that want to get into other markets and are trading off against the importation of cheap agricultural produce?  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#D00300","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2293,"content":"<p>I now call on Commissioner Hogan and ask him to be as brief as possible although there is a number of issues to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#E00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524747600,"counter":2294,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Chairman.

There will be ring-fenced resources in the future, post-2020, in the same way as there are now.<\/p> <p>  Many speakers asked about the budget and the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  As Deputy Penrose and I know very well from the time we were in a little bit of hardship together down in the Custom House when we had to go to see the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, it was not an easy place to be in terms of an Estimates process when there was very little money.  In fact, we were going into a situation where we had no money, and the challenge was to try to hold onto the programmes we had.  The current situation is a little bit like that now, in that due to Brexit we have &euro;12 billion less in funding and we have a demand for more money for other initiatives.  There is a finite number of places we can get funding but the principal one is based around the gross national income of the member state.  At the moment we are paying equivalent to 1.13% of gross national income on the basis of an EU 27.  If Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland and Austria want to hold the line and say there should not be another euro for Europe then we are in trouble because unanimity is required.  We hope that at the end of the day they will like the new policy initiatives that are being discussed more than the ones that affect us in relation to Brexit.  The negotiations for the next year will be difficult.  The Commission can only make a proposal and it is ultimately the member states in the European Parliament that will make the final decisions.<\/p> <p>  On the impact of the budget on rural development, of course there is going to be a knock-on effect on all programmes, including agriculture and cohesion, if there is going to be less money.  In response to Deputy Healy-Rae, Ireland without the UK will have to build new alliances.  That work is ongoing and an effort is being made to build alliances with an arc of countries around the United Kingdom, where there is a lot of dependence on the UK market.  That is an obvious place to start.  We are very conscious of the suckler herd.  We can give flexibility to the member state and the Minister of the day on the type of issues the Deputy mentioned, to draw up their priorities in the context of the CAP plan.  They have the chance of putting in a little bit of voluntary, coupled support if they wish for sectors that are under pressure, and that will be retained.  I do not know where the notion came from that we were going to prevent part-time farmers from getting money.  It must be a Kerry issue because I got a letter from Kerry County Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2295,"content":"<p>No, it is not.

I did not get a letter from anywhere else.  I want to give an absolute assurance that the way part-time farmers get their money at the moment will continue.  There are no plans whatsoever by me anyway to change that.  Perhaps others have plans to change it but I do not.  I have given the responsibility for defining an active farmer back to the member state.  That discussion will be had in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with the Minister of the day.  I wish Deputy Healy-Rae well in that regard.  The last time the measure came up for discussion in the reform programme, agreement could not be reached in the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers on the definition of an active farmer for 28 member states.  Bringing it back to each member state means that there will be differences in each member state about what an active farmer is.  It will be an interesting debate.  Part-time farmers should not have anything to worry about.<\/p> <p>  We certainly feel empathy and sympathy for farmers affected by the fodder crisis following eight months of rain.  Anytime I was asked to do something I did, whether it was to bring forward payments, do something with the three-crop rule or finish the payments for GLAS, we approved it.  That is as much as I can do.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue asked about Mr. Davis's comments.  I noted them.  This is the first indication that we have got from the Brexit secretary that there will be some proposals tabled on customs arrangements and partnership, building on the Mansion House speech of Prime Minister May.  It will be very interesting to see what is tabled on 17 May.  The next five weeks will be very important in the UK because there are local elections, the initiatives outlined by Mr. Davis, and we are also getting close to the timeline of the June European Council Summit.  They know the clock is ticking and that they have to get real about what kind of partnership arrangement they need on customs.  We definitely need some movement on customs in order to deal with a lot of the concerns we have on the island of Ireland and in the future relationship between the UK and European Union.  They have to get more real about it.  It is make-your-mind-up time now in terms of what direction to go.  The House of Commons will play a role in that as well.  Some significant votes will take place there in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  On Mercosur and trade generally, I was asked a question at an IFA event last Friday night about the need to be careful with our carbon footprint regarding Mercosur.  That is fine but, equally, the same logic should apply to what we do in Japan and China.  We must be very careful.  Trade is the essence of the negotiation but there will be winners and losers.  Depending on the country one is dealing with, there will be offensive and defensive situations that will have to be tackled.  If one is in a trading environment one might not get as much as one wants one day but one could get a lot more than one expected another day.  That is what happened in Japan.  We got a deal for 65,000 tonnes of beef.  Nobody mentioned that because it is good news.  We have opened links with the Chinese market, which will have an immediate effect rather than having to wait for ten years.  If we do a deal in the morning with Mercosur it will take ten or 12 years before it is implemented.  We have a bit of time in terms of the concerns that have been expressed.  The sensitivity around beef is reflected in the mandate given by the Council of Ministers to the negotiators, and it has to be approved by every member state subsequently.  There is no point in negotiating a deal without striking the right balance because it will subsequently be turned down.  It would be a hell of a waste of time.  The negotiations on Mercosur have been going on for 20 years.  Elections are taking place in Brazil at the moment.  The next round of negotiations with Mercosur countries will effectively take place at the end of May.  I do not know whether the Brazilians will moderate their view sufficiently on cars or industrial products to satisfy some member states in the European Union.  If there is no change there will be a standstill again for another while.  That has been the way for a long time.  I was here at the time of the last meeting and I thought there was sufficient momentum for something to happen.  We certainly did not get what we asked for, and that is the reason there is no deal.<\/p> <p>  On trade generally, we are making a lot of progress on skimmed milk powder.  Most people I hear talking about skimmed milk powder in storage are farmers and I think they should not be talking about it because they are allowing co-ops and other people that are buying milk to use it as an opportunity to reduce their price on the basis of there being an overhang in the market.  We will handle this in a sensitive way that will not in any way impact on the price of milk for the farmer.  If co-operatives or businesses that are buying milk want to use it as an excuse then they are wrong, because there is no excuse.  We sold 24,000 tonnes last week.  We did a deal for 30,000 tonnes with Mexico which will happen next year and we did a deal for 10,000 tonnes with Tunisia this week.  We will move it, slowly but surely, into markets that are outside the European Union.  The deals are very satisfactory.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I will make a couple of points on the equine sector.  This is a very sensitive sector which is hugely important economically and in terms of employment for the country.  I initiated discussions a year ago between the French, the UK and the Irish to try to see if we could mobilise together those three countries that have 90% of equine activity.  It will be one of the issues to be discussed in any future trading arrangement.<\/p><p>That is progress but the matter will not be easy to solve because there are veterinary and animal health issues in the context of the movement of animals and decisions made at short notice about race meetings and so on.  Members are all very familiar with these issues.  The breeding of animals and all these movements will be tricky to deal with but the matter is on the agenda.  It is on the British agenda, as well as the European Union agenda.  That is a good step.  I met the industry this week to discuss it further.  We want to continue with the tripartite arrangement, if possible.<\/p><p> On young farmers, I have made it a specific objective of the new CAP that one will not get approval for one's plan from any member state unless one is doing something substantial for young farmers.  I am saying to everybody that we will take a strong line on this.  We will build on the excellent document produced by Macra na Feirme and the ideas therein in order to have them implemented at European level.<\/p><p> Taxation is, of course, a competence of the member state.  We have nothing to do that in the European Union and we are unlikely to have for a long time to come.  Taxation measures are matters for the members but we can add value at European Union level to force member states to do more.  That includes opening up.  We have to consider possibilities in regard to internal convergence and entitlements to afford some opportunities in terms of the national reserve and to build on that for young people.  It is a serious problem that will not go away unless we take decisive action.<\/p><p> With regard to greening rules, we are going to abolish the existing greening arrangement.  There will be, in Pillar 1 payments, what we call conditionality in regard to the environment and climate.  We are considering what we can do to say to farmers that in return for the money they are getting, they have to do a little more for the environment and climate.  I cannot say what we are going to do and how it will manifest itself yet but that is the principled position we have taken.  The present greening system has not worked for the environment or farmers and therefore needs to be abolished.  We will take the best of all possible worlds in terms of good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, and cross-compliance and will determine how we can proceed in a less complex way.  I want to reduce the burden of the rules significantly so that if one is doing good work and signing up to a comprehensive plan under CAP, there is more responsibility on the member state and less in terms of the rules that come from Brussels on counting the trees, distances between trees, and distances from buffer strips and ecological focus areas.  We have to get away from this prescriptive approach and give more flexibility.  That is what I mean by flexibility.  Ireland can meet these objectives in a different way from farmers in Spain or Greece.  Therefore, we should give the flexibility.<\/p><p> On unfair trading practices, we have made a basic proposal.  It can now be built upon by the member states and the Parliament.  There is a lot of opposition to this from the big supermarkets and people interested in competition.  We heard this debate in respect of the groceries order in 2006.  We should never have got rid of it.  We were told at the time by the pure economists that there would be a bonanza for consumers in terms of cheap food, that there would be no problem with the level playing pitch for farmers and that farmers would continue to receive a good income.  This was a ridiculous argument.  If one reads the D&aacute;il debates from around 2006 &mdash; I do not have time to do so anymore &mdash; one will note they were very interesting and how wrong the assumptions were at the time in terms of what happened.  There are people who are now very interested in public health issues.  We allowed big supermarkets to open their doors to cheap drink products for young people.  Nobody worries about the damage done to young people by the irresponsible action of abolishing the groceries order on the spurious grounds that it would give a fair boost to consumer spending and reduce the groceries bill of the consumer.  This never happened.  A study of this will show that consumer prices went up rather than down.  Therefore, some of the advocates at the time should be brought back to the committee to learn what went wrong.  It would be a very interesting debate.  I am glad I got that off my chest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2298,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

We should not be apologetic about the CAP or about seeking the maintenance of the CAP budget.  The European taxpayer has got value for money from the CAP.  European farmers have produced high-quality, safe products for European consumers over a long period.  That is what the CAP was designed for.  It has delivered on its objectives.  We should not be apologising for trying to protect the CAP.  I hope there will be agreement in all the member states to increase the contribution to the budget in order that we can maintain the CAP budget.  If we get agreement, we want to make sure the CAP percentage is ring-fenced and that we do not find ourselves with an increased contribution from member states spent on issues that might not be as important as CAP is to the Irish economy.  The ring-fencing of the CAP budget in any increased donations is essential.<\/p><p>The Commissioner talked about Mercosur and said the development in this regard is some way down the road.  It has come to a crossroads on a few occasions and has never reached a conclusion.  We are in CAP negotiations now and there has to be recognition of the concession made by the Commission regarding imports to the European Union and the damage this can do to the European beef sector.  If we are to get more concessions, now is the time to get them in the context of the Mercosur deal.  The fact that such concessions are being made by the Commission gives us a bargaining tool in trying to get a better deal for our beef sector in the future.<\/p><p>The final point I would like to make is on volatility.  The Commissioner talked about skimmed milk powder and the amount in storage.  The fixed price ceiling for the purchase of skimmed milk powder for intervention is suspended for 2018.  I would like the Commissioner's view on the market supports that will exist in<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>the CAP for the period 2020 to 2027.

I totally agree with his comments on the groceries order.  We debated when considering the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill how we dealt with that issue.  I have consistently called for its re-examination.  There is such a gap in the market, with underselling of alcohol as a loss leader to get people into the supermarket.  We legislated for this.  What was occurring was absolutely appalling.  I hope this committee can restart the debate on getting the groceries order back into the frame.<\/p> <p>  The Commissioner mentioned the importance of the CAP budget.  What are his views on the reference years in the original CAP, namely, 2002 and 2003?  If we are to have another CAP for the period to 2027, there will be reference years dating back a quarter of a century.  This should be taken into consideration when thinking about young farmers coming into the system.  Is the Commissioner happy that this is the approach we should be taking at European level to ensure young farmers entering the system have single farm payments to work with?  In many ways, having single farm payments dating back a quarter of a century is one of the key issues that need to be examined in order that the CAP can be sustainable and young farmers entering the landscape can be promoted.  Is it the approach of the Commission to have entitlements dating back 25 years if the new CAP for the period to 2027 is introduced?  Can the Commissioner shed some light on that important issue?<\/p> <p>  I welcome in particular the Commissioner's statement last Friday in Kilkenny that a political agreement was made regarding the three-crop rule.  Could he shed light on when the paperwork will be completed?  Single farm payment applications must be submitted by 15 May.  There is a process that needs to be put in place so they will be above board and legal.  Some of the advisers and Teagasc staff are anxious that the initial paperwork be done so the single farm payment forms can be completed to the letter of the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#F00400","speaker":"1386"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2301,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner and his team.  I have a few questions on which the Commissioner might have figures.  Am I correct in saying that the farmers get one part of the CAP budget and that airlines and shipping companies get a lot of the rest?<\/p><p>Am I correct in saying that were the &euro;12 billion to be taken out of the slice of the cake, it would result in a figure of approximately &euro;100 million in Ireland's case?  That is what I was looking at in the figures for different countries.<\/p><p>I saw in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>that there was a leak about the new CAP.  It was alleged, in respect of front-loading, that there would be an option for the member state.<\/p><p>Will active farming be done by the member state?  At the end of the day, will the Commissioner and the EU decide the new CAP?  What input will member states have into it?<br\/><br\/>With regard to penalties, which the Commissioner has tried to address, could a system be introduced whereby an inspector could give a farmer a yellow card and tell him that he will be back a month later and if everything is not right, it is kaput for him in order that farmers are not afraid of their lives?<br\/><br\/>For the past 16 years, the EU has had a category called the forgotten farmer for those who missed out on entitlements.  The Commissioner and Senator Lombard are correct about the need to get young farmers into the industry.  The farmers in this category have ended up with nothing for 16 years because they did not have a certain amount of stock and so on.  Before Christmas, the EU said they will now be entitled to payments but they will need a linear cut or whatever to get the money.  What incentives will there be for Ireland and other member states to get older farmers to transfer farms?  Unfortunately, many are having accidents,  Will there be an early retirement scheme or something similar?  People were over from the EU before speaking about it.<br\/><br\/>Due to the recent weather problems, we were looking for money to be front-loaded under GLAS and other schemes?  Has the Commissioner any objections?  If farmers want to buy fertiliser, meal and so on and they are in trouble financially, could the Exchequer bring the payments forward by six months?  Does he have a problem with that?<br\/><br\/>The EU is being blamed for the new online system here.  Many elderly farmers may not have broadband and there is concern about filling the new online system up.  As Deputy Healy-Rae pointed out about the suckler herd, we are in trouble.  What are the Commissioner's views on this and the future of the dairy sector?  The IFA and other farming organisations are represented at the meeting.  A big problem is emerging with vulture funds.  Mr. Goodman has bought a large farm off a vulture fund, according to the <i>Irish Farmers Journal<\/i>today.  There are 2,500 farmers in trouble around the country with vulture funds.  Could the Minister ensure low interest loans are made available to them to help them to secure their farms?  They are blackened at the moment but many of their farms could be viable if they are given an opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#F00500","speaker":"1341","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2303,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner and I am glad we have had a robust discussion on many issues of concern to farming families.  I welcome the fact that he strongly acknowledged in his presentation that incomes must be protected, particularly for those with small and medium-sized farms.  There is a huge concern about suckler farmers.  They are struggling on an average payment of &euro;13,000 a year.  Some of them can afford to diversify but many cannot and that is a serious problem.  The Commissioner mentioned one intervention but this issue needs to be prioritised.  Suckler farmers have become the poor relation in the agriculture industry and they need to be treated fairly.  I welcome the huge campaign on the issue.  Many farming organisations have come out strongly on it, on which I commend them.  Hopefully, we can keep everything going in that regard.<\/p><p>The Mercosur deal is also a huge concern for farmers in Offaly and north Tipperary.  They do not want it to proceed, as they want to protect their livelihoods and the farming community in general.  They have a significant role to play in our exports and we do not need to jeopardise that.<\/p><p>With regard to young farmers, I welcome the reintroduction of agricultural apprenticeships, which was reported in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal<\/i>recently.  That will help matters.  The Commissioner is strong on this issue and he has embraced the Macra na Feirme recommendations.  The main issue for young farmers is income but it has always been an issue for farming families.  The difficulty accessing credit and the burdensome nature of preparing for inspections as well as the fear of inspections are also deterrents for young farmers.  Some went into farming reluctantly to keep their parents satisfied.  They did not apply for schemes because of the fear of inspection.  Inspections need to become more supportive.  High standards and regulations are needed but they need to be more supportive and encouraging to attract young farmers.  There is an interest among young people in agriculture, as indicated by the increase in the number of agriculture courses available through the Central Applications Office last year.  They need more support and encouragement and I hope that can be done because we need to protect the future of Irish farming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#G00200","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2304,"content":"<p>I welcome the Commissioner.

There are 80 million people with disabilities throughout the EU and when their families are included, the number of people affected trebles.  A fair share of them are in farm families while many older farmers are not on the fit to play list.  There are many issues relating to disability, chronic illness and so on.

The position adopted by the European Commission negotiators, Mr. Barnier and others, is also the correct one.  Hopefully they will see that there are no alternatives.  Our colleagues across the water have, sadly, adopted a policy that is not very progressive and it appears that they are waiting for everything to resolve itself in its own good time.  It is not going to be that way and cannot be that way.  It is of fundamental importance that there is a recognition that this issue is not going to go away.  It is a matter for the British Government, which initiated their exit from the European Union.  Nobody forced them to do it and it now falls to them to take the responsibility of ensuring that it is accommodated to this country, North and South.  I ask the Commissioner to keep in mind the issues affecting the agrifood sector, North and South, because, in the 20 years since peace came to Northern Ireland, we have enjoyed an economic situation that we have not had before.

We can only deal with the money we have at the moment and if new money comes onto the horizon we have to make sure we benefit from that too.  In trade, generally we make cumulative concessions on beef and we also have to go around the world and get good results, such as the 65,000 tonnes of beef we got from Japan.  There are swings and roundabouts and we have to ensure we improve the situation in Europe at the moment, where beef consumption is going down.  There has been a strong attack by various lobbies on the beef sector, which is also not easy to overcome.  The challenge to beef comes from within the European Union as much as outside.<\/p> <p>  Significant market supports along the lines of those we have now will become available to deal with volatility and we want to enhance our risk management tools, which we have just done with the omnibus regulation.  A mid-term review came into effect with the changes we made on 1 January 2018, which recognised that we needed to do more in the area of income stabilisation tools in Pillar 2, in respect of the active farmer and greening.  More insurance products are also available now, and which are easier to deliver on the ground in respect of Pillar 2.<\/p> <p>  The MilkFlex programme has been a major success and &euro;100 million has been borrowed in the Glanbia area alone.  All dairy co-operatives are getting involved so as to have ring-fenced money, with longer terms and at a fixed interest rate, to deal with price volatility in the payment schedule.  These are innovative products which we are trying to build on and they are very welcome.<\/p> <p>  We have to look at entitlements in respect of reference years and many member states have already implemented a new regime but Ireland, Spain and a few other countries have still not adjusted their systems to reflect this.  We are having a conversation internally to see what we need to do and we will say something about it when the legislative proposal is open.  If we are serious about prioritising young farmers we have to see this as a barrier to entry.  The paperwork for the three-crop rule will be completed by 29 May but no member state has objected to date about what we are trying to do.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has to give the official position but I can speak politically and can tell farmers they can sow their corn and will not have any problem with the three-crop rule.<\/p> <p>  We are extending the basic payment scheme applications by one month from 15 May to 15 June because of the weather and other things, if member states wish to take this up.  There is a bit of a logjam and the extension might help people cope with online applications, 100% of which must be completed this year.<\/p> <p>  I can tell Deputy Fitzmaurice that no airlines are going to get money from the Common Agricultural Policy as far as I know.  If the Deputy has any idea who or where they are I would like to know.  We have transferred the active farmer clause to the member state because we could not get the agreement of 28 member states.  Ireland can now change the definition of active farmer as of now, because we did this in the mid-term review, but it has to notify the Commission of what it intends to do by a certain date every year.  The last date was 31 March and I doubt if they applied because I would have heard about it if they had.  For reasons I gave earlier, every member state has different issues relating to active farming but the member state plan, which will be put up in the next reform, will have to be approved by the European Commission.  It will be based around nine objectives, one of which will be in the area of young farmers and generational renewal.  There will be no approval of the plan unless a genuine effort is made by the member state to do something to get more people involved in agriculture.  It is a big change and targets will be set by the member state for what it intends to do.<\/p> <p>  I have brought in approximately 100 changes and simplifications and perhaps the committee should familiarise itself with them.  It is obvious that the Co-Chairman is not familiar with the changes.  The last reform made the policy hugely complex.  I did not introduce greening.  It came at the last minute in order to protect the budget and farmers went along with it on the basis that at least they got the money.  Its implementation was very difficult, however, so I am going to get rid of it.  I hope we are not going to replace it at member state level with something that is more complex so we have to keep an eye on it.  We are going to get rid of a lot of EU rules because they duplicate member state rules and we do not need two sets of rules.  We need more technology rather than physical inspections.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Nolan, I have not come across a farmer who was so afraid of an inspection that they would not apply for a cheque.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2313,"content":"<p>I have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#H00800","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524747600,"counter":2314,"content":"<p>There are a good few of them here and I doubt if they have met anybody who will not apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018042600002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1524747600,"counter":2315,"content":"<p>I have.
