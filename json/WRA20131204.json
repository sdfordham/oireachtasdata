Implementation of this policy, as well as delivering substantial environmental benefits, is securing significant economic benefits for the State and our citizens. For example, the wind energy sector employs around 3,400 people in Ireland. In addition, the SEAI estimates that &euro;255 million in gas imports was avoided by wind energy in 2012 alone. Wind energy accounts for the largest proportion of our renewable energy resource. The development of wind energy projects must take account of the concerns of local communities in relation to the potential impacts of such projects in their areas. A range of measures are being taken in this regard. The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), is undertaking a targeted review of the Wind Energy Planning Guidelines to address key issues such as noise (including separation distance) and shadow flicker. I understand draft revised guidelines will be issued for public consultation in the next week or so, with a view to revised guidelines being in place from mid-2014.    I have clearly stated my view that renewable energy developers must ensure that they undertake effective and timely communication from the initiation of projects right through to commissioning and operation. It is essential that local communities are engaged and consulted on an on-going basis. <\/p><p>  Such an approach is of course also necessary in the development of community wind farms. I agree with the Deputy that there is real potential for wind farms to be developed and owned by local communities which would make an important contribution to improving public acceptance of the technology, and to ensuring benefits are delivered directly to the community in which a wind generation facility is located. <\/p><p>SEAI has taken a number of initiatives aimed at fostering social acceptance of wind energy and the development of community wind farms. The report commissioned by the SEAI &quot;To Catch the Wind: the potential for Community Ownership of Wind Farms in Ireland&quot;, provides a template for development of community wind farms. More recently, SEAI has commissioned research which will include guidance on the financial models for the execution of community wind energy projects. This research is nearing completion. All of this work develops the resource available to communities wishing to develop their own wind farms and avail of existing market supports such as the REFIT scheme and the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development, to which community wind farm project developers may apply through the regional Leadership Partnerships.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400068#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sale of State Assets","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400068#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[51566\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400068#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on the current situation regarding the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy.","asker":"1020","askee":"947"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[51688\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400068#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to sell Bord G&aacute;is Energy in the future despite the final bids being lower than he expected; his views on whether extending the deadline would have any impact on the value of any bids; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 13 together.<\/p><p>  As I announced on 27 November, I have confirmed to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann that none of the final bids received for the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business are at an acceptable value at the present time.

EirGrid's consultations have involved opening five regional information centres at Midleton, Carlow, New Ross, Carrick-on-Suir, and Kilcullen, a lo-call project information telephone line, local radio advertising, and national and local print advertising. I understand that thirty-three open days were held within the project area over the last 16 months and that since autumn 2012, the Grid Link Project team has visited marts, shopping centres and agricultural shows, attending over 120 events to date where thousands of stakeholders have engaged with the team. <\/p><p>  I am also aware that EirGrid&rsquo;s report on Stage 1 of Grid West identified a number of route corridor options for the new line. Eirgrid recently announced the Emerging Preferred Route Corridor following extensive consultation on 16 potential route corridors. EirGrid have held five open days in October in Moygownagh, Ballaghaderreen, Swinford, Foxford and Carrick on Shannon to discuss the preferred route. Residents from the project area were invited to view maps of the route corridor options, and to provide feedback on any constraints near or on the corridors. EirGrid has also taken observations and feedback at a project information centre in Linenhall Street, Castlebar. The preferred route will be the subject of further public consultation between now and spring 2014. <\/p><p>  The current consultation process is a key opportunity for public input as no decisions have been made regarding the final routes of these electricity lines.

Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our energy requirements. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources. Provisional figures for 2012 indicate that 19.6% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by renewables. To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2012, 15.3% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of quarter three this year, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was over 2,100 MW. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Currently, approximately 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme. The primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity in Ireland are the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes. In order to facilitate the rate of build of renewable generation capacity required to meet the 2020 target, a number of changes to the REFIT 1 and 2 schemes were introduced in 2013.    Ireland&rsquo;s excellent renewable energy potential can also be developed for export. Expert advice and evidence shows that Ireland has the capability to achieve its national target for renewable electricity from onshore renewable generation alone, with capacity to spare. This means that there is potential for projects of scale, both onshore and offshore, that are aimed at the export market. Work is progressing well on negotiating an Inter-Governmental Agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom for the export of renewable energy from Ireland to Great Britain. <\/p><p>  One of the key requirements for proposals of a significant scale for wind energy export will be the achievement of the necessary planning consents in Ireland. Planning permission for such projects, which will be determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must await the putting in place of a clear national planning policy framework and I have asked my Department to prepare such a framework. The Renewable Energy Export Policy and Development framework, which will be developed over the next 12 to 15 months, will provide the opportunity to integrate relevant EU Directive requirements (including Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment), trans-boundary dimensions and stakeholder participation within the context of a national framework. <\/p><p>  Separately and in order to progress the development of our wind energy resource, while at the same time ensuring that wind energy developments do not have a negative effect on local communities, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, is undertaking a targeted review of the Wind Energy Planning Guidelines to address key issues of noise (including separation distance) and shadow flicker.

","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":38,"content":"<p>The Digital Agenda for Europe set out specific targets for the achievement of high speed broadband services across all Member States. Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services are available to all of our citizens and businesses. The Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband to all parts of Ireland through two principal means: (a) by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and (b) by providing a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, there is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan. eircom has extended its plans for the rollout of high speed services, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, to 1.4m premises, UPC has increased its minimum and top speed products to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively, and mobile operators are rolling out enhanced product offerings, including 4G mobile. Other operators continue to invest and ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distirbution network to rollout fibre broadband services. <\/p><p>  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  It is the case, in Europe and elsewhere that all countries are seeking solutions to the challenge of rolling out quality broadband services. When making comparisons with other countries, care needs to be taken to compare like with like. In Ireland we have a highly dispersed low density population, in contrast to some other countries. Additionally, the manner in which broadband speeds are calculated is relevant. OECD publishes advertised speeds without reference to customer access. The speeds are the highest speeds marketed nationally. These comparisons do not necessary reflect universal public access to those speeds. <\/p><p>  The availibility and uptake of higher speed offerings in the market place in Ireland is evident, with the largest growth in subscriptions taking place in the category of speeds greater than or equal to 30Mbps, at 29.9% at end Q2 2013.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400068#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan Implementation","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400068#WRA02750"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[51574\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400068#WRA02800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when the mapping process for the national broadband plan will be complete; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

About a quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development assistance is channelled through Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). This reflects the strong contribution which Irish NGOs are making to the fight against world poverty and hunger, and the broad support which they continue to receive from the Irish public. Funding is provided to support the long-term development work carried out by NGOs in developing countries, as well as emergency humanitarian assistance and development education programmes. Given the level of Government funding for the NGO sector, the issue of their internal governance arrangements is a matter of legitimate public interest.   It is important to note, however, that NGOs are independent organisations.

Solid fuel is defined under section 77 of the Finance Act 2010, as amended and means coal or peat.  Coal is further defined to include coal and lignite, solid fuel manufactured from coal and lignite, and any other energy product within the meaning of Article 2.1 of Council Directive 2003\/96\/EC of 27 October 2003 in solid form.  Peat means peat falling within CN Code 2703 of the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities referred to in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2658\/87 of 23 July 1987, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2031\/2001 of 6 August 2001 and includes any solid fuel manufactured from peat.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government  that the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 326 of 2012), specifies the environmental standards for coal placed on the market and provides the regulatory framework in relation to the distribution and sale of coal in the State. <\/p><p>  Under the Regulations, all coal bagging operators and certain solid fuel suppliers trading in bituminous coal must be registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Those who must register include all fuel wholesalers and distributors of bituminous coal but only those retailers for whom 50% or more of their total annual sales proceeds are from bituminous coal. However all retailers who trade in bituminous coal must ensure that their fuel wholesalers are registered with the EPA and must hold a record to this effect with their supplier's registration number. Furthermore, retailers who sell bituminous coal are required to hold a record setting out the registration number of the bagging operator who supplied the product. Retailers must also ensure that, where the unit of sale is a bag, then the bag must be sealed.  <\/p><p>  In particular, the Regulations also require that all bituminous coal sold outside smoky coal ban areas for residential use outside those areas must have a sulphur content of no more than 0.7% , which is lower than that in Northern Ireland and therefore bituminous coal supplied to Northern Ireland standards for sale on that market may not be sold in the State. Compliance with the Regulations will be enforced by the Local Authorities. A verification mechanism, SWiFT 7, has been developed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) for the verification of sulphur content in coal. This provides for a robust mechanism to counter the sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>  Suppliers who produce and supply solid fuels in contravention of these regulations are subject to investigation and prosecution by local authorities and other State Agencies charged with enforcing the regulations and preventing such supply.  <\/p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of carbon tax on solid fuels, also advise me that on commencement of the carbon tax provisions under the Finance Act 2010, any Northern Ireland-based wholesaler of solid fuels selling into the market in Ireland will be obliged to register as a supplier and comply with the same regulatory requirements as wholesalers based in the State. Such suppliers will be obliged to make returns on solid fuels supplied in the State in the accounting period concerned and pay the amount of carbon tax due in respect of that supply. <\/p><p>  Therefore it is not my intention to defer the second phase of the carbon tax which is due for implementation in May 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400068#WRA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":57,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400068#WRA04050"},{"type":"question","counter":58,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[52035\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400068#WRA04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a person who has been in receipt of one-parent family payment for a period in excess of 15 months, and who is seeking to work full time in their own business, will be eligible to avail of the start your own business scheme which allows for a two-year exemption from income tax for certain persons who set up their own businesses.

In March 2011, following a competitive tender process, the NTMA appointed a panel of legal firms (A&amp;L Goodbody, Arthur Cox and Matheson) under a framework agreement to provide legal services to the NTMA Banking Unit. As part of the same competitive tender process, the NTMA also entered into a general agreement with Arthur Cox to provide general legal services on an ad hoc basis to the NTMA Banking Unit.

The agreements were awarded for a period of three (3) years and services were drawn down as and when required &ndash; accordingly, there was no contract value specified.<\/p><p>  In April 2011, the Minister for Finance announced the creation of a stand-alone unit accountable to him through the Department of Finance to provide State oversight of the banking system and drawing on the resources of the NTMA to carry out its work.

The agreements referred to above were subsequently novated to the Department of Finance with effect from January 2012 to support the performance of the Department&rsquo;s banking functions.

","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":84,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the basis for calculating the capital value of pension rights under the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) regime is set out in Schedule 23B to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.    In the case of defined benefit arrangements, the schedule provides a formula for determining the capital value of uncrystallised rights (that is rights being built up but which have not yet been drawn down) with a view to establishing if an individual can apply to Revenue for a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT). Where an individual&rsquo;s uncrystallised pension rights on the specified date (which for the purposes of the latest revision to the SFT regime, contained in Finance (No.2) Bill 2013, will be 1 January 2014) exceed the new lower SFT of &euro;2m, the individual may claim a PFT from Revenue in order to protect or &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; those rights against any risk of chargeable excess tax when the pension is eventually drawn down. Under the current Finance Bill changes, a PFT may in no case exceed &euro;2.3m, the level of the existing SFT. Schedule 23B also provides a formula for determining the capital value of defined benefit pension rights at the point of retirement.<\/p><p>  In establishing the capital value of uncrystallised defined benefit pension rights for PFT purposes, the formula in schedule 23B distinguishes between defined benefit arrangements that provide for a separately accrued lump sum and those that permit a lump sum to be taken by way of a discretionary commutation of part of the pension. In the former case, the capital value is determined by establishing the annual amount of pension that the individual would receive under the rules of the scheme on the specified date (i.e. 1 January 2014) on the assumption that he or she retired on that date at their salary and service on that date and on the assumption that they had attained normal retirement age on that date. The gross annual pension so determined is then multiplied by 20 (the standard valuation factor) and added to the cash value of the separately accrued lump sum, calculated on the same assumptions, to arrive at the overall capital value of the pension rights. In the case of defined benefit arrangements with a discretionary lump sum commutation option, the capital value is determined solely by multiplying the gross annual amount of pension, determined on the same assumptions as above, by the standard valuation factor of 20. <\/p><p>  In order for the SFT regime to operate as intended, it is necessary for the capital value of defined benefit pension rights at the point of retirement to be determined in the same manner as the corresponding PFT calculation. In the case of a defined benefit arrangement with an option to commute part of the pension for a lump sum, this means that the capital value at retirement is the annual amount of pension multiplied by the appropriate valuation factors without having regard to any commutation decision that the individual may make.<\/p><p>  This ensures that the administrator of a defined benefit scheme, when measuring the capital value of an individual&rsquo;s retirement benefits from a defined benefit arrangement against, for example, the individual&rsquo;s PFT, is comparing like with like, as both the capital value of the PFT and the retirement benefits will have been calculated in the same fashion. Only in this way can any chargeable excess arising be correctly determined. The same approach to the calculation of the capital value of defined benefit pension rights at the point of retirement applies where an individual does not have a PFT, as clearly it would be incongruous if the method of calculation in respect of similar defined benefit arrangements were to vary depending on whether an individual had a PFT or not.<\/p><p>  It had come to the attention of the Commissioners that pension advisors and administrators had been interpreting the legislation in a manner that allowed the capital value of defined benefit pension arrangements with discretionary lump sum commutation rights to be calculated, at the point of retirement, on the basis of the annual amount of pension, after commutation for a lump sum, multiplied by the relevant valuation factor, plus the cash value of the lump sum so commuted. In light of that, I am putting it beyond doubt, by way of an amendment in Finance (No.2) Bill to the relevant formula in Schedule 23B, that this approach is incorrect and that, in such cases, the capital value calculation must be based on the annual amount of pension that would have been payable if no commutation of the pension had taken place.  \t<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400069#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Loans","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400069#WRB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[52144\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400069#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation special liquidator has considered offering to sell loans to the original borrowers at a 10% margin, or any other margin figure, over the price sought from overseas financial institutions; if he will estimate the additional income which would be accrued for the State in such a scenario; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Special Liquidators that they have corresponded with all IBRC borrowers providing them with an opportunity to make written representations on the method of disposal of their loans and the criteria for determining who may bid for loan assets.

The purpose of the Home Tuition scheme is to provide a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school or for children with a special educational need who are awaiting an educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.<\/p><p> Children with autism between the ages of 2.5 and 3 are eligible for home tuition.  The home tuition continues from their 3rd birthday if no placement in a school based autism early intervention class is available for them. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a national network of Special Educational Needs Advisors who can assit parents in identifying school placements for their children, if required. As home tuition takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that home tutors are qualified to provide an educational programme.  It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard in the Home Tuition Scheme generally reflects that required in a school environment.<\/p><p>  The qualification requirements for tutors providing home tuition to children have not changed. It remains the case that home tutors should be fully qualified teachers. When it is not possible to recruit a fully qualified teacher then alternative appropriate third level qualifications may be acceptable.

The number of SNAs employed in a school depends on the allocation given to the school by the NCSE, based on its assessment of the special educational needs of pupils in the school.  If the Deputy requires further information regarding the methodology around the allocation of SNA resources to schools then her query should more appropriately be directed to the NCSE.<\/p><p>The NCSE does not have a role in setting the contractual hours of work of SNAs.<\/p><p>  The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in the standard SNA contract of employment, which was agreed by this Department, the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) representing SNAs and the Management Bodies in 2005. In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. <\/p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year. <\/p><p>SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment. Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement). The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:<\/p><p>&quot;SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTSHoursUnder the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant. Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited. Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions. These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013\/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT\/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers. This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400070#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Site Acquisitions","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400070#WRC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[52207\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400070#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding site selection for a new campus for a school (details supplied) in County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":149,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, my officials are working closely with officials from Galway City Council in relation to identifying and acquiring a suitable site for new school accommodation for the school to which he refers.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations for local authority rating is his sole prerogative. There are two provisions in the legislation governing the assessment of valuations, i.e. revision and revaluation.<\/p><p>  Revision of valuation is the mechanism used to maintain existing local authority valuation lists. It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuations of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list. The valuations of commercial properties at revision are determined by reference to the net annual values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. That is to say that they are compared with similar type properties in the same local authority area to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they are all treated equally.<\/p><p>  In accordance with the 2001 Act, which came into force on 2nd May, 2002, a national programme is being rolled out progressively for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties in the State. The revaluation programme aims to provide up-to-date valuations for individual properties across all economic sectors that are subject to local authority rates. It is an important programme, especially given the significant changes in rental values following the economic downturn of recent years. The revaluation process is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists for rates purposes and in individual ratepayers&rsquo; rates liabilities. <\/p><p>  The purpose of a revaluation is to redistribute commercial rates liabilities among ratepayers based on up-to-date values. Following revaluation, there will be a much closer relationship between rental value and commercial rates liability. Even though property values have fallen generally, some ratepayers will gain while others will lose from the process of redistribution but, overall, there will be a fairer distribution of the rates burden.<font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font>  In general, however, the relative gains to ratepayers have exceeded the losses in the revaluations carried out to date. <\/p><p>  The revaluation programme which has been completed in three County Council areas in Dublin began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed in 2009 and D&uacute;n Laoghaire- Rathdown was completed in 2010.  <\/p><p>  After publication of the valuations, the Act provides for an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation and following the Commissioner&rsquo;s decision on this appeal, the ratepayer has the further option of making an appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal. There is also a further appeal on a point of law to the High and Supreme Courts.<\/p><p>  As requested, the number of revaluations completed and the number of appeals to the Commissioner of Valuation arising from those revaluations is indicated in the following table. All appeals to the Commissioner arising from the revaluation have to be lodged within 40 days of publication of the new valuation list.  <table><tr><th>Local Authority<br \/><br \/>Area<\/th><th>Number of Revaluations<\/th><th>Number of Appeals to <br \/><br \/>Commissioner of Valuation<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin County<\/td><td>6,304<\/td><td>725<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal County<\/td><td>5,676<\/td><td>819<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DunLaoghaire- Rathdown County<\/td><td>                      5,165<\/td><td>1,148<br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>  The revaluation programme for the Dublin City Council area is currently underway and is expected to be completed by 31st December, 2013.

There is also provision in the Bill to allow for the piloting of the assessment of valuations by contract valuers under an external delivery scheme. The Bill also contains provisions to streamline the overall process of revaluation and the appeal mechanisms available to ratepayers subsequent to the revaluation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400070#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Burial Grounds","counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400070#WRC01550"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[52154\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400070#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the transferring of lands for the use of a public burial ground at Abbey Island in Derrynane, County Kerry (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in relation to protecting people from poverty. To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments. The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September this year, an increase of 25%. Each year almost 10,000 extra customers become eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients. <\/p><p>  I am keenly aware of the impact on the Department&rsquo;s customers and particularly those who are living alone. While we are ending the telephone allowance the savings that this will provide means that we have been able to keep at the same rates the other elements of the household benefits package, including the free electricity\/gas allowance and the free television licence. We have also retained the fuel allowance, free travel and the living alone increase. <\/p><p>  Of course it is important to be aware that Ireland&rsquo;s pensioners as a group have the lowest consistent poverty rate and, as a group compared to the rest of the population, are least likely to be at risk of poverty - pointing to the adequacy and importance of the State pension. Between 2004 and 2011, consistent poverty for older people (those over 65) fell from 3.3% to 1.9%. The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate for people in that age group also reduced from 27.1% to 9.7% over the same period. <\/p><p>  The monthly allowances under the household benefits package are a contribution towards the cost of services; they are not intended to meet those costs in full. The ending of the telephone allowance of &euro;9.50 per month (or about &euro;2.20 per week) will not result in the automatic removal of any landline service linked to a personal alarm. Indeed, since the Budget announcement, I am aware that one telephone company has advertised that they will cover the value of the allowance. I would hope that other telephone companies will consider this. <\/p><p>  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephones were expensive and uncommon and a landline service was the only option available to the customer. The market has changed enormously since the introduction of the allowance, with several companies providing a range of services and rates with bundled services including television, telephone and broadband and pay-as-you-go mobiles. There are also personal security services that use mobile technology rather than land lines.  My Department has no role in the funding or operation of the seniors alert scheme which provides grant support for the supply of equipment such as personal alarms, smoke detectors and security lighting to enable older people without sufficient means to continue to live securely in their homes.  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government operates the scheme.  The budget allocation for 2013 was &euro;2.35 million. There has been no reduction in this funding in Budget 2014. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400070#WRC04600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Data","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400070#WRC04650"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[52173\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400070#WRC04700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons in receipt of rent allowance at present; the number of such in each country; and the total cost of same.","asker":"1013","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":207,"content":"<p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.

Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our energy requirements. The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources.<\/p><p>  The Renewable Energy Directive also requires that Member States set out in a National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) their trajectories towards meeting these targets. Ireland&rsquo;s NREAP, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, assumes Ireland&rsquo;s 16% target will be met incrementally at around 1% per annum. Provisional figures for 2012 indicate that 7.1% of our overall energy requirements and 19.6% of electricity demand were met from renewable sources.<\/p><p>  The primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity in Ireland are the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes. These schemes are designed to incentivise the development of electricity generation capacity from a range of renewable sources including wind, biomass and hydropower.<\/p><p>  To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2012, 15.3% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation. At the end of quarter three this year, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was approx. 2,100 MW. It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target. Currently, approximately 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme. <\/p><p>  The development of the clean, indigenous, renewable energy resources, which Ireland is fortunate to have in abundance, holds the prospect of reducing our reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports, thereby improving our energy security, and opening up opportunities for the engineering, ICT and communication sectors with consequent potential for job creation. This potential is already recognised by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technologies strategies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400071#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Transmission Network","counter":248,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400071#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[52187\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400071#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans for the use of interconnectors to increase the availability of electricity in this jurisdiction at times of fluctuating requirements; the extent to which such interconnectors can be used to off-load electricity surplus to requirements at particular times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":250,"content":"<p>The interconnected power systems of Ireland and Northern Ireland form a single synchronous power system and all electricity generated on the island is traded in the Single Electricity Market (SEM), the wholesale electricity market for the island of Ireland, regulated jointly by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and its counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Utility Regulator (UR). The Irish system is connected to the electricity system of Great Britain system via two Direct Current (DC) interconnectors, the Moyle Interconnector and the East-West Electricity Interconnector (EWIC).The Moyle subsea interconnector links the electricity grids of Northern Ireland and Scotland. It went into commercial operation in 2002 and has a capacity of 500 Mega Watts (MW). The EWIC links the electricity grids of Ireland and Great Britain. It has a capacity of 500 MW, and therefore doubled Ireland and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s electricity interconnection with Great Britain when it went live in 2012. The two interconnectors allow market participants to trade electricity between the SEM on the island of Ireland and the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements (BETTA) market in Great Britain. EWIC&rsquo;s increasing of this island&rsquo;s interconnector capacity greatly enhances our ability to trade electricity with our neighbours and accelerates the integration of Ireland with other electricity systems.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at   . <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<\/p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, there is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan. eircom has extended its plans for the rollout of high speed services, with speeds of up to 100Mbps to 1.4m premises, UPC has increased its minimum and top speed products to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively, and mobile operators are rolling out enhanced product offerings, including 4G mobile. Other operators continue to invest and ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distribution network to rollout fibre broadband services. <\/p><p>  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. <\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400071#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","counter":258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400071#WRD01650"},{"type":"question","counter":259,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[52190\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400071#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the envisaged or enhanced role he sees for the post office network including sub-post offices and counter services with particular reference to the utilisation of technology by An Post thereby enhancing opportunities for growth in the sector in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":260,"content":"<p>Operational matters and the role of developing commercial strategies for the post office network are a matter for the management and Board of An Post and one in which I have no statutory function.

On hearing this complaint, the PRTB can order the tenant to pay any rent due. The matter is then adjourned for a period of no more than 14 days to allow the tenant comply with the Order. Where the tenant does not comply the PRTB will have the power to terminate the tenancy irrespective of whether a notice of termination has been served.<\/p><p>  Essentially, the non-payment of rent issue is fast-tracked and any other aspects of the dispute will be dealt with in the normal way.

Upheaval and conflict in Syria in particular has seen the spectacle of many individuals travelling from Europe to the fighting and tragically a number of our citizens have lost their lives there.<\/p><p>  This is an issue of concern to the majority of European States and one to which I gave priority during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the  European Union. In that connection Ireland was successful in gaining the agreement of the Member States to carry out a review of the EU Strategy for Countering Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism. Work is currently ongoing on this matter at various levels within the EU. One of the aspects to be addressed in the review is that of how best to manage the &quot;foreign fighter&quot; phenomenon. In addition, Ireland is also a member of a small group of like minded States, that was set up during the Irish Presidency to develop a response to this issue and I have met with my EU Ministerial colleagues in this regard. <\/p><p>  The development of appropriate responses to the foreign fighter phenomenon is at a very early stage across the EU. However, it is widely accepted that a key element in addressing this problem is a programme of pro-active engagement with the communities most affected with a view to persuading those inclined to travel that there may be more beneficial and positive ways of contributing to a resolution of the conflict than simply taking up arms.

The ICC has confirmed that it has systems in place to underpin the welfare of animals participating in coursing events. These include mandatory inspections of hares and coursing venues in advance of the commencement of an event. Greyhounds involved in coursing are subject to the provisions of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the Code of Practice for the care and welfare of greyhounds, published by Bord na gCon.<\/p><p>The ICC has assured the Department that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards are adhered to during coursing. ICC rules and regulations require the postponement of coursing meetings if the weather is unfavourable for example where snowfall or frost could impact negatively on the greyhound or the hare. The ICC has confirmed that a coursing meeting scheduled to take place on 23 November 2013 was postponed due to heavy frost. During extreme weather conditions, it is also the practice of ICC clubs to provide additional food for the hares living in the wild, within hare preserves protected by the ICC.  <\/p><p>  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2012, has responsibility for the issue of an annual licence to the ICC and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares. These licences currently have a total of 26 conditions attached to them.  The conditions of these licences cover a range of items, including veterinary supervision at coursing meetings and a number of requirements attaching to the welfare of hares.<\/p><p>  The ICC ensures that a veterinary surgeon and a control steward are present at all coursing meetings.  In addition to this, veterinary staff from my Department and rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (part of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht) carry out random monitoring inspections during the coursing season to verify compliance with the licences and the rules governing animal welfare.  <\/p><p>  As a further control, a Monitoring Committee on Coursing was established during the 1993\/94 coursing season and is comprised of officials from my Department and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the ICC to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of hares and greyhounds alike.<\/p><p>  A very high proportion (98.09%) of the hares captured for hare coursing were returned to the wild at the end of the 2012\/2013 season. <\/p><p>  The systems that are in place are, in my view, effective, proportionate and are working well. The ICC has demonstrated its willingness in recent weeks to postpone an event due poor weather. Accordingly I see no need for any unilateral intervention on my part to suspend or prohibit hare coursing during adverse weather conditions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400072#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Administration","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400072#WRE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[52117\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400072#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will confirm that a single farm payment was made for land for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Leitrim","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":353,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[52118\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400072#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will confirm that only one applicant sought single farm payment for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 for a land parcel (details supplied).","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[52119\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400072#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will confirm that more than one applicant sought single farm payment for the years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 in respect of a land parcel (details supplied).","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[52120\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400072#WRE01700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the necessary steps required in order to claim single farm payment for land parcel for the years 2005 to 2009 in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Leitrim","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":356,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 to 134, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  The Single Payment Scheme commenced in 2005 and generally is applicable to farmers who actively farmed during all or any of the three reference years 2000, 2001, and 2002, and who were paid Livestock Premia and\/or Arable Aid payments in one or more of those years and for whom Single Payment entitlements were therefore established.

The development of a new Rural Development Programme under Pillar 2 will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.<\/p><p>  A general EU co-financing rate of 53% is set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, and LEADER projects. Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%. The total Exchequer funding that will be required to draw down the available EAFRD funding will depend on the types of measures included in the new Rural Development Programme and on the co-financing rates applied to these measures.<\/p><p>  There are a number of conditions attached to Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;313 million per annum.  The draft Regulation provides that at least 5% of EAFRD funding must be reserved for LEADER while the draft Common Provisions Regulation provides that 6% of EAFRD funding must be set aside to a national performance reserve. The funding set aside to the performance reserve will be allocated to each Member State following a performance review in 2019. The draft Rural Development Regulation also sets out that 30% of the total EAFRD amount must be reserved for environmental operations and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. <\/p><p>  Work is currently ongoing in my Department to design the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period from 2014 &ndash; 2020. In designing the new RDP, my Department must take account of the range of requirements set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation and the need to support key policy aims for the agri-food sector in the light of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. In undertaking this work, a number of ex-ante analyses are being undertaken and a public consultation process has also taken place.<\/p><p>  While final decisions in relation to what measures are to be included in the new RDP have not yet been made, my Department is in ongoing contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the overall financing that will be required.

My Department is currently carrying out a comprehensive exercise by excluding ineligible features, such as houses, roads, scrub, rivers, etc. in land parcels declared by farmers. In the vast majority of cases, the exclusion has no impact on payments as the farmers in question have taken a prudent approach and reduced the declared area to take account of the ineligible feature. <\/p><p>  However, there are some cases where the level of over-declaration determined as part of this review process is greater than 20%. Under the provisions of the governing EU Regulations, an over-declaration of over 20% means that no payment can be made to the farmer in the year of application. Given the significance of such a finding for the farmer concerned, it is seen as prudent that a Department official visit each farm where the review has found an over-declaration of greater than 20%, in order to verify the position on the ground. <\/p><p>  All such applicants will be written to by my Department informing them of the outcome of the determination in their case.

They are also informed of their right to seek a review of the Department&rsquo;s finding and to submit any information and documentation that they consider is relevant. It is a matter for each individual farmer to decide whether he or she will seek a review of the decision made in their case. Some farmers may take the view that the determination made is correct and not seek a review. In some cases where the farmer has sought a review of the determination, it may be necessary to visit the farm in order to verify the accuracy of the information submitted by the farmer as part of the review process. <\/p><p>  All applicants, whose eligible areas have been reduced as part of this process, have the right to seek an internal Department review of the determination in their case.

Revenue has advised me that the tax stamp, which contains a range of sophisticated security features, is a key means for them to distinguish between legal and illegal products, irrespective of the way in which the cigarettes are packaged. <\/p><p>  Research carried out by Revenue, in conjunction with the HSE National Tobacco Control Office, indicates that contraband represents the majority of illicit cigarettes and not counterfeit products. Figures from 2012 indicate that the proportion of smokers classified as having an illegal pack was 13%. These findings indicate that the level of consumption of illicit product is being contained, although Revenue remains determined to confront the illegal trade in tobacco products, to optimise levels of seizures of illicit tobacco product and to pursue those found to be involved in this illegal activity.  In this regard, Ireland is party to legally binding agreements between the EU and three major tobacco companies which aim to strengthen anti-smuggling measures. The Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products was agreed at the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) Conference of the Parties in November 2012, and it is anticipated that Ireland will sign and ratify that protocol.<\/p><p>On the issue of standardised packaging, the Deputy will be aware that Government approval was received on 19th   November 2013 for the publication of the General Scheme of a new Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2013 and to proceed with the drafting of the legislation based on this General Scheme.  Australia was the first country in the world to introduce standardised packaging, in December 2012. We are in on-going contact with our Australian colleagues. While it is too soon to fully evaluate the impact of this policy in practice, there is a wealth of evidence on the effects of tobacco packaging in general and on perceptions and reactions to standardised packaging which supports the introduction of the measure. <\/p><p>  Finally, I would like to point out to the Deputy that tobacco consumption is today the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death in Ireland, killing over 5,200 people a year; that smokers die on average 10 years sooner than non-smokers; that one in every two children who experiment with cigarettes goes on to become a smoker, and that one in every two of them will die from a tobacco related disease. In this context, my priority is to reduce the consumption of tobacco across the board, to meet our policy target of making  Ireland tobacco free (i.e. with a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5%) by 2025. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400073#WRF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":441,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400073#WRF03150"},{"type":"question","counter":442,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[52177\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120400073#WRF03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a medical card was recently removed from a person (details supplied) in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":443,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.
