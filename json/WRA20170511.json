However, the Bill is carefully balanced to allow a statutory agency to provide sensitive personal information about a birth parent to an adopted person without consent.  This provision is supported by a suite of measures to ensure that the birth parent's constitutional rights are safeguarded.  From a legal perspective, I am advised that the transfer to non-statutory agencies of the information required to provide a service may not be compatible with the protection of rights that the Bill aims to provide.  For this reason, Tusla will be the sole provider of adoption information and tracing services under the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I should emphasise that legislation will operate on a presumption in favour of disclosing information in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible.  It provides clarity regarding the information that can be provided and the circumstances in which it can be provided.  It provides that an adopted person aged 18 years or over who was adopted before the proposed legislation comes into operation, will be provided with his\/her birth certificate information, as held on record, following a request to Tusla, subject to certain conditions.  An adopted person may request information about his or her  birth parents, the existence of birth relatives, and the adopted person's early life circumstances.  They can also request their own medical information, and medical information regarding a birth relative where this is likely to be of relevance to the maintenance or management of the physical or mental health of the adopted person or his or her relative.  Where this information is held on record, it can be provided to an adopted person without consent.  The Bill also provides that the Adoption Authority  will be responsible for collecting, restoring, preserving and the safekeeping of all adoption records.   <\/p>  <p>  A key concern in this Bill will be to achieve a fair and reasonable balance between the rights of adopted persons and their birth parents.

September&rsquo;s changes will be delivered through existing childcare schemes, pending the introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS), which will come into operation at the earliest possible date.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that up to 70,000 children will benefit from childcare subsidies from September, which would more than double the number of beneficiaries of existing schemes.  I want to stress that these figures &ndash; and also figures on ACS take-up&ndash; are estimates.  The take-up of childcare subsidies depends not just on eligibility, but on parental demand for childcare and on the availability of childcare places.  Given the expected level of parental demand, it was estimated that 79,000 children would benefit from the ACS during its first year of operation.  The estimated difference of 9,000 this September is partly accounted for by children aged 3 and older whose family incomes are above the threshold for a GP Visit Card but below the threshold for the ACS.  The difference is also partly accounted for by children aged 3 and older whose parents may be eligible for a GP Visit Card &ndash; or other eligibility criterion &ndash; but have not taken it up. <\/p>  <p>  An information campaign in the coming weeks will aim to minimise low take up through raising awareness among parents about eligibility.  In such cases, the families we are talking about generally have incomes near the maximum income-threshold for the ACS, and the subsidy payable under the targeted elements of the ACS would therefore be small.  Further, in such cases, when children are aged less than 3, their families will be able to benefit from the universal, non means tested subsidy of up to &euro;80 per month .<\/p>  <p>  We are not anticipating widespread price rises as a result of increased subsidisation of childcare.  Of course, prices are entirely at the discretion of childcare providers.  However, the scope for price increases will be constrained by the fact that some parents with children aged over 3 will not receive a subsidy.

Social workers meet the children in France to assess their needs in terms of education, health, linguistic knowledge, family ties and recent experiences.

Of these 432 (41%) had been allocated an aftercare worker.  Tusla has advised that it does not collate data on the waiting periods before an aftercare worker has been assigned.

The remaining 5% are in other settings, for example a disability setting or supported lodgings.  <\/p><p>I am conscious that the transition to independent adulthood can be challenging for many young people.  This is particularly true for children and young people in care.  Planning for leaving care needs to begin in the years prior to leaving care and continue as part of the care planning process.  This preparatory work is facilitated by a social worker and is based on collaboration with the young person, their carers and partner agencies.  It is specific to the individual young person's needs.  During the preparation for leaving care an aftercare worker is introduced to the young person.  They are involved in the preparation for the leaving care process.<\/p><p>Tusla prioritises children in residential care, and short term foster care, for the early allocation of an aftercare worker.  Children in long term foster care, with an allocated social worker, have their aftercare plan developed with the social worker.  If their plan is to remain living with their foster carers, on a case by case basis, it may be considered best practice that they would be allocated an aftercare worker when they are in their 17th year.  I believe that this is a pragmatic approach which matches needs to available resources.<\/p><p>There are pending amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 which will place a statutory obligation to provide an aftercare plan before the young person leaves care.

Following the signature of the new legislation by the President, a commencement order will be made to commence this legislation on 1 June 2017 along with the commencement of the third payment option itself via the commencement of Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, as amended.  The implementation of the third payment option has involved ongoing collaboration between a number of key stakeholders - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Courts Service, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and my Department - and will be the culmination of a number of years work.  The project has been overseen by the Criminal Justice (Fixed Charge Processing System) Working Group, jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and has been a standing agenda item at the Working Group's meetings. <\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the commencement of the third payment option will lead to a further increase in fixed charge amount payment rates, as a result of the provision of an additional\/third opportunity to pay the fixed charge amount.  In addition, the commencement of Section 38 of the 2010 Act on 1 June 2017 as part of the suite of fixed charge offences\/FCN provisions for commencement under Part 3 of the 2010 Act, will provide that FCN service can be exercised by posting the FCN to the alleged offender.  In addition, certain presumptions have also been provided for, where the matter proceeds before the Courts, allowing for evidence of postage to be provided by An Post (or another post provider) to assist the presiding judge to challenge oral evidence whereby the accused claims not to have received the FCN in the post.  The introduction of the third payment option is also expected to impact on summons service by bringing about a reduction in the volume of road traffic offence cases proceeding to court. <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the third payment option,  I can also inform the Deputy that work is underway in Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to progress the Master Licence Record (MLR) project, which will entail linking the vehicle and driving licence database of the National Vehicle Driver File.  The project will facilitate the application of penalty points to driving licences, thereby improving the effectiveness of road traffic enforcement measures.  To enable the MLR, multiple system and process changes will need to be implemented across a number of organisations, including the Courts Service, which will take some time to design and develop.  The Working Group is also responsible for monitoring and overseeing progress on the MLR project and the provision of a progress report on the Master Licence Record project is a standing agenda item at the Group's meetings. <\/p>  <p>  I have requested a Garda report on the matters referred to in the Deputy's Question 43 and will contact the Deputy directly on receipt of a Garda report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100043#WRA05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service Data","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100043#WRA05150"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[22398\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100043#WRA05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the annual cost of a company's (details supplied) speed vans since the contract was awarded to it;

The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (DAHRRGA) is the lead Department in respect of this commitment.  DAHRRGA undertook a consultation process, engaging with stakeholders and interested parties,\u00a0which finished at the end of March of this year.  As part of this consultation process, meetings were held with Sparkassen, Irish Rural Link and the Public Banking Forum of Ireland. <\/p><p>Officials from my Department are assisting DAHRRGA to prepare a report for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and myself setting out the findings and conclusions of this investigation into the key elements of the Sparkassen model of local public banking as it relates to SMEs.  It is anticipated that this report will be completed by mid-year. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, SMEs can access lower cost, flexible finance from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  To the end of December 2016, the SBCI has lent &euro;544 million to 12,593 SMEs.  The SBCI&rsquo;s goal is to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms than has been available in recent times on the Irish market.  The SBCI uses an on-lending model; this means it does not lend directly to SMEs.  At present, the SBCI has 3 bank and 5 non-bank on-lenders.  The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from a variety of business and economic sectors.  More than 80% of loans are for investment purposes and the average loan size is &euro;43,200.  There is a broad regional spread of the SMEs supported, with 84.8% of them based outside Dublin. <\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that there are already significant Government measures to support the financing needs of SMEs. \u00a0As well as the SBCI, there is the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is a cross-government initiative.  By answering eight simple questions, SMEs will receive a tailored list of available Government supports to suit their needs.\u00a0 The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at<i>www.supportingsmes.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.\u00a0 Further information is available on the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation website. <\/p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit\u00a0that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people.

Credit unions need to maintain sufficient reserves to ensure continuity and to protect members&rsquo; savings.  The regulatory reserve requirement (capital requirement) for credit unions is the amount required to be held in the regulatory reserve of a credit union, expressed as a percentage of the assets of a credit union.  All credit unions are required to maintain a minimum regulatory reserve of at least 10% of the assets of the credit union. \u00a0Credit union reserves\u00a0comprise retained earnings from current and previous years,\u00a0which limits\u00a0their ability to raise reserves as they do not have the ability to raise capital through other means.  Reserves available to a credit union for the purposes of the Regulatory Reserve Requirement must be realised, unrestricted and non-distributable to ensure they are capable of absorbing losses.<\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Commission on Credit Unions, published in April 2012, sets out detailed governance standards for credit unions.  The majority of these governance standards were reflected in the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 which provides a legislative framework to improve governance standards in credit unions with a particular focus on those who exercise significant influence and control in a credit union i.e.\u00a0board of directors and the management team.  The Commission on Credit Unions also made recommendations in relation to the introduction of fitness and probity for credit unions.  In 2013, a tailored version of the Fitness and Probity regime applying to all other regulated financial service providers was introduced for credit unions and is now fully implemented. <\/p>  <p>  Credit union members should have confidence that those individuals holding senior positions in credit unions can demonstrate that they are competent and capable, act honestly, ethically and with integrity and are financially sound.  Under the Fitness and Probity regime for credit unions an individual is required to have and to demonstrate the competence necessary to perform specified functions.  This is normally tested with regard to the relevant experience of the individual and\/or relevant qualifications.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that in the performance of her\u00a0regulatory and supervisory functions, the Registrar of Credit Unions is working in the best interests of individual credit unions,\u00a0their members and the sector as a whole.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in Ireland and the\u00a0Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100045#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100045#WRC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[22472\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100045#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the average income tax paid by PAYE workers on the standard rate of tax and by PAYE workers on the higher rate of tax in the public sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[22473\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100045#WRC01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the average income tax paid by PAYE workers on the standard rate of tax and by PAYE workers on the higher rate of tax in the private sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[22474\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100045#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the average income tax paid by persons in self-employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[22475\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100045#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the average income tax paid by farm households in which the main income is derived from farming; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":157,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 to 68, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I am informed by Revenue that, on the basis of information derived from Income Tax returns filed for the year 2014, the latest year for which data are available, the average Income Tax paid by public sector PAYE workers on the standard and higher rate of tax is &euro;3,727 and &euro;19,578 respectively.

However, due to a pick-up in receipts throughout the remainder of year, income tax finished 2016 ahead of target.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that income tax encompasses a broad range of elements, some of which are not directly impacted by employment or wage developments.  These include Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Life Assurance Exit Tax, Dividend Withholding Tax, Professional Services Withholding Tax and Back Duty.  These payments can be 'lumpy' in nature and the timing of payments can vary from year to year.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the majority of these specific components are having a drag on overall income tax receipts in the first four months of 2017.  In relation to income tax (PAYE), the most significant component of overall income tax, it closed the first third of the year, broadly in-line with profile, down just 0.6% or c. &euro;25 million.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the performance of USC is lower-than-expected, and my Department is currently reviewing the performance of income tax in 2017, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners.  The initial indications are that Revenue is satisfied that the overall estimate of the Budget 2017, Universal Social Charges (USC) changes of &euro;335 million in 2017, were costed accurately.  <\/p>  <p>  At the time of Budget 2017, the apportionment of the total USC package between PAYE and Schedule D was allocated by my Department at &euro;263 million and &euro;72 million respectively, in line with previous norms.  However, subsequent analysis by Revenue, indicates that the allocation of the USC package between PAYE and Schedule D should have been &euro;311 million and &euro;24 million in favour of PAYE and Schedule D respectively, due to the dynamics of the USC package.  While, this is helping to explain the current under-performance against profile, it is important to point out that this reapportionment should have no adverse impact on the overall collection of USC receipts as this should equalise later in the year.   <\/p>  <p>  However, my Department along with the Revenue Commissioners will continue to examine this issue and consider all relevant developments.    <\/p>  <p>  Finally, with regards to State's compliance with EU fiscal obligations, Government policy as outlined in the recently published Stability Programme Update, still remains oriented to achieve our medium term objective of a structural budget balance, which we are projected to achieve in 2018.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100046#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance","counter":169,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100046#WRD00600"},{"type":"question","counter":170,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[22553\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100046#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons that applied on an annual basis to the declined cases agreement for motor insurance since its establishment; the number of applications that proved successful; the average premium per successful application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":171,"content":"<p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that as Minister for Finance, I am not responsible for the operation of the Declined Cases Agreement and therefore do not have direct access to the data that is being requested.  <\/p><p>As you are aware, under the Declined Cases Agreement, the insurance market undertakes not to refuse to provide third party motor insurance to an individual where they have approached at least three insurers.

In a seven to ten year cycle, the FATF organises peer-reviews of its member countries Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) measures.  As part of this process, it conducts an in-depth examination of all legal, regulatory and operational measures recommended by the standards at that particular time. <\/p><p>Ireland was reviewed in 2006 (3rd round evaluation), and was required to take a series of follow-up actions which were signed off by FATF in 2013.  The focus of that review was on technical compliance, i.e. ensuring that our legislation was aligned with FATF standards.<\/p><p>Ireland is now undergoing a new &lsquo;mutual evaluation review&rsquo; (&ldquo;MER&rdquo;) under the FATF&rsquo;s 4<sup>th<\/sup>round.  There is a significant change in emphasis in this round, and much more attention is being paid to the effectiveness of a country&rsquo;s AML\/CFT systems.  The first step in the review process was to prepare both a technical compliance submission and an effectiveness one in order to provide FATF with a good understanding of our system and how it operates. <\/p><p>In addition, a key aspect of the new assessment approach is that countries are required to have a much better understanding of the money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks they face.  Consequently there was a requirement for Ireland to conduct an extensive national risk assessment (&ldquo;NRA&rdquo;) exercise in this area.  The NRA of ML\/TF risks was published in October 2016 and can be found at the following link:<\/p><p>-<i>.  <\/i><\/p><p>The NRA was prepared under the auspices of the Anti-Money Laundering Steering Committee (AMLSC), a multi-agency body chaired by the Department of Finance.  The AMLSC&rsquo;s membership includes the Central Bank, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB), the Officer of the Revenue Commissioners, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), as well as a number of other relevant Departments and bodies. <\/p><p>The Department of Finance, in its capacity as chair of the AMLSC and head of the Irish delegation to the FATF, coordinated and hosted the FATF&rsquo;s two week onsite assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s AML\/CFT framework in November 2016.  During this time the main AMLSC members and representatives from the private sector, met with the FATF assessors in a series of meetings which covered issues such as our understanding of AML\/CFT risk, supervision of the financial and non-financial areas for these risks including preventative actions been taken by &lsquo;designated persons&rsquo; such as credit institutions, the practical application of our AML\/CFT legislation etc. <\/p><p>The FATF&rsquo;s MER, which will be formally signed off in June, seeks therefore to gain a holistic view of the effectiveness of the Irish AML\/CFT regime.

However, while respecting NAMA's independence, I and my officials regularly engage with NAMA regarding its performance and strategy.<\/p><p>I maintain a regular dialogue with the NAMA Chairman and receive appropriate updates regarding NAMA's ongoing progress and future plans.  I also meet on occasion with the NAMA Board, which provides me with an opportunity to share my views and understand the Board's views.<\/p><p>Turning to the specific question, I assume the Deputy is referring to the article published on 16 April 2017 in the Sunday Times, referencing my attendance at a NAMA Board strategy day on 5 February 2014.  That article makes reference to NAMA's memo of the away day, which was released by NAMA under the Freedom of Information Act 2014.  I provide below the text of relevant section of NAMA's memo to which the Deputy refers: <\/p><p><i>&quot;The Minister noted that following Ireland&rsquo;s emergence from the Bailout Programme, one of the Government&rsquo;s key priorities was to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s debt to GDP ratio from the current 120% to the European average of 94%.  The Minister noted the wider implications and impact of NAMA&rsquo;s performance for the country and particularly for the banks.  In this context he noted that the proceeds from a sale of Ireland&rsquo;s bank shares could be used to reduce the national debt and requested that NAMA consider whether it could advance the repayment schedule of Senior Bonds through accelerating asset disposals with a view to making bank assets more saleable.&quot;<\/i><\/p><p>Though this is NAMA's note of the meeting and not my own, I do not disagree with their summary of the sentiment I expressed.<\/p><p>It is important to place these comments in the context of what was happening more broadly at the time.  Ireland's debt to GDP was around 120%, excluding the State's contingent liabilities relating to NAMA and IBRC.  <\/p><p>NAMA had achieved the major milestone of redeeming &euro;7.5bn of its government guaranteed senior debt by YE2013 and had issued an additional &euro;12.9bn of senior debt in support of the IBRC liquidation for which it had been directed to act as a backstop bidder.  <\/p><p>Through concerted efforts across the economy, we had generated positive momentum around Ireland's recovery and recently had exited the EU-IMF Programme of Support in December 2013.  We faced the challenge of sustaining and building upon that momentum in a way that allowed for continued debt reduction and productive investment in Ireland that facilitated not just a recovery of the FDI sector but a real recovery in the broader domestic economy.  At that point we were all making decisions every day that would impact how and at what speed our underlying domestic economy would recover and we had an ongoing responsibility to remain vigilant for opportunities to lay the foundation to accelerate a sustainable recovery of the Irish economy.<\/p><p>NAMA played a key role in various aspects of that sustainable recovery.  NAMA's ability to meet its objectives provided clear signals to the market evidencing Ireland's recovery.  NAMA bonds also remained a significant contingent liability for the State and posed a challenge to the recovery of the banks as holders of significant amounts of NAMA debt.<\/p><p>It was in the context of NAMA's contribution to Ireland's broader recovery - including the recovery of our banking sector - that I would have challenged NAMA to take advantage of the buoyant market dynamics to accelerate bond redemptions without threatening its objectives under the Act.  By achieving its objectives expeditiously, in line wit the NAMA Act, NAMA would assist in the normalisation of the Irish banks and the broader market.<\/p><p>These were entirely appropriate challenges to pose to the NAMA Board during its strategy day.  It is important to note that my comments to the NAMA Board did not constitute an instruction nor a direction.  These were challenges posed to the NAMA Board in the context of their overriding objectives as defined in the NAMA act.<\/p><p>It remained a matter for the Board to assess these challenges  and to determine the most appropriate strategy for fulfilling NAMA's obligations.  <\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware there were clear interdependencies between NAMA, the banks and the wider Irish economy.  In this context, it is not surprising that such linkages were a matter of discussion between the Minister for Finance and the NAMA Board at a crucial period in establishing Ireland&rsquo;s recovery.<\/p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that my officials were concurrently preparing a report under Section 227 of the NAMA Act in the period 2013-14.  The report, published in July 2014, assessed the extent to which NAMA had made progress toward achieving its overall objectives and whether the continuation of NAMA was necessary for the purposes of the Act.  The report concluded that NAMA had made significant progress in achieving its overall objectives, and based on its performance and financial projections in light of the strength of investor interest in Ireland, was well positioned to achieve its overall objectives and so continued to be necessary.<\/p><p>In the context of this report, consideration was given to various strategic alternatives that may facilitate NAMA achieving and ideally surpassing its objectives.  The Section 227 Review is available on the Department of Finance website via the following link: <i>www.finance.gov.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/NAMA_Section_227_Review_web2.pdf.<\/i><\/p><p>Following that review, I fully endorsed the view of the NAMA Board that, like any rational commercial operator, it should take advantage, to the greatest extent possible, of favourable Irish market conditions by increasing the flow of assets to the market while remaining faithful to its purpose and objectives under the NAMA Act.<\/p><p>Finally I would point out that, as this note relates to a meeting from over 3 years ago, I was referring to potential future sales of the State&rsquo;s bank assets generally and not with any specific transaction in mind. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100046#WRD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Development Lending","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100046#WRD03000"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[22656\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100046#WRD03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of lending for development purposes, residential and commercial by regulated financial entities and unregulated entities for each of the years 2014 to 2016 and to date in 2017.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>I have been informed by the Central Bank that the amount of net lending to business for development purposes in respect of residential and commercial property is as follows:<\/p><p><b>Residential<\/b><\/p><p>The amount of net lending for residential purposes was -&euro;739 million in 2014.

The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions and the internal disbursement of funding is then a matter for the individual institution.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HEA has been closely monitoring the financial position of all of the IoTs and in particular are working closely with those Institutes, such as DKIT, that are experiencing financial difficulties in order to ensure appropriate mechanisms are put in place to eliminate any deficit as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  The HEA has a policy framework in place for engaging with vulnerable IoTs\u00a0which requires Institutes to submit a three year plan to return them to a balanced budget situation.  If the Institute is unable to demonstrate how a return to a balanced budget can be achieved within this timeframe, or if actual performance deviates significantly from the plan, then the HEA will seek the appointment of an independent financial expert to work with the Governing Body and Executive Management Team to agree a revised plan and programme of remedial action.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0My Department and the HEA are aware of the financial\u00a0difficulties\u00a0being experienced by a number of the\u00a0IoTs.  The Financial Review of the Institutes, recently undertaken\u00a0by the HEA in order to provide an overview of the financial health of the IoT sector, to consider capacity issues and to examine the challenges for the institutions given their respective plans for the future, makes a number of recommendations on how some of the issues which contribute to\u00a0funding problems in the IoT sector\u00a0can be addressed.  These policy recommendations will feed into the work being undertaken on developing a sustainable funding model for the sector. <\/p>  <p>  In November 2015 it emerged that the draft financial results for year-end 31 August 2015 showed an increasing deficit at DKIT.\u00a0 This gave rise to an urgent request by the HEA for a new 3-year financial plan designed to return DKIT to a break-even position by 31 August 2018 through a combination of income increases and cost reductions in a number of key areas including financial, staffing, research projects and maximising the effectiveness of education provision. \u00a0An external Financial Advisor was appointed to oversee this process.  This new plan was submitted to the HEA in January 2016 and agreed in consultation with my Department.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  DKIT has exceeded its targets set in the financial plan thus far.\u00a0 The Institute has implemented a number of actions and efficiencies from their strategic plan and have identified new approaches to including apprenticeship provision.\u00a0 DKIT has also reviewed its research initiatives and have implemented a number of savings and secured a number of additional projects and funding in this area. \u00a0A revision of the draft strategic plan is currently awaited following appointment of a new Acting Head of School. <\/p>  <p>  The Plan is subject to ongoing monthly reviews by the Executive, the Governing Body and the HEA to monitor progress and mitigate potential issues as they arise.<\/p>  <p>  Funding overall for the higher education sector is a key concern for me particularly in light of the additional pressure that will fall on the system over the next decade or so.\u00a0In seeking\u00a0to address the issue in the short term,\u00a0I have\u00a0for the first time in nine years secured\u00a0as part of Budget 2017, additional funding for the sector. In 2017 additional funding of &euro;36.5m will be made available with &euro;160m additional over the next three years. <\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, published in July 2016, clearly outlines the funding challenges and offers a number of approaches and recommendations for consideration for the medium term.  As committed to in the Programme for Government, the report has been referred to the Oireachtas Education Committee\u00a0and this consultation will form\u00a0part of the process\u00a0of formulating a plan for the future of the sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in Budget 2017 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I, announced a policy review with the aim of designing and implementing a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased Employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018.  The review will be undertaken as part of the overall response to meeting the anticipated skills needs in the economy over the coming years, in line with the policy framework set out in the National Skills Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  It\u00a0will include\u00a0an analysis of the business case for enhanced investment in the higher and further education and training sectors.\u00a0In this context it\u00a0will\u00a0identify key elements of the new funding model\u00a0and of\u00a0the expected impacts including those\u00a0on employers.  The review will include consultation with stakeholders.  The policy review will be published by the end of Q2 2017, and will complement the ongoing work\u00a0by the Oireachtas Committee\u00a0in relation to the Cassells report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100047#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting Applications","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100047#WRE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[22556\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100047#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the person or body to which requests for Garda vetting for transport companies that provide transport for school bus services should be sent, in view of the fact that a person cannot request clearance for themselves; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[22644\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100047#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the person or body that manages Garda vetting requests for companies that provide transport for school bus services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 119 together. <\/p><p>School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.<\/p><p>Currently\u00a0almost\u00a0116,000 children, including\u00a0some 12,000 children with special educational needs, are being transported in over 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually.<\/p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the procurement of suitable contractors to provide school bus services on its behalf.<\/p><p>Drivers nominated to perform services for contractors operating under contract under the School Transport Scheme, and the contractors themselves, are subject to vetting procedures arranged by Bus &Eacute;ireann and conducted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100047#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Redundancy Payments","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100047#WRE01500"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[22630\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100047#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if, under EU regulations, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, EGF can be used only in circumstances in which more than 500 persons are made redundant by a single company, including its suppliers and downstream producers: the reference in the regulations to the criteria that must be met when redundancies occur to draw down funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[22631\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100047#WRE01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the eligibility criteria under EU regulation when a business fails for securing EGF funding for the self-employed who employ not more than ten persons.","asker":"1221","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 87 together.<\/p>  <p>  The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is an EU co-funding instrument to assist workers made redundant as a result of globalisation or due to a global financial and economic crisis.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  To be eligible for assistance there must be at least 500 redundancies in a specific company (including suppliers\/downstream producers) in a 4 month period, or at least 500 redundancies in a specific sector in a 9 month period.\u00a0 Company specific EGF applications can include self-employed persons whose activity has ceased and who employed not more than 10 workers, provided that it can be demonstrated that their activity was dependent on the specific company concerned (i.e. they were a supplier or downstream producer of the company).

The Teachers Conciliation Council is part of the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers and was set up to deal with claims and proposals relating to the Terms and Conditions of employment of teachers.  The Council is composed of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  The Teacher Exchange scheme is open to primary teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council, have completed probation and who wish to exchange their posts for educational purposes.

If confirmed, these actions would amount to serious violations of fundamental human rights.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, senior Departmental officials met the Russian Ambassador at my request to convey my grave concerns, and those of the Irish public, at these reports.  During the meeting, my officials urged the Russian authorities to fully investigate these allegations, to ensure that any such persecution is ended immediately, to provide all affected persons with the assistance they require, and to ensure the safety of activists and journalists investigating the reports of abuse in Chechnya.<\/p>  <p>  In a statement delivered to the Seanad on my behalf by Minister Helen McEntee on 12 April, I joined in the widespread calls for the Russian Government to urgently undertake a full and thorough investigation into these reports and to ensure that any individuals found to have committed crimes be brought to justice.  I also emphasised Russia&rsquo;s international obligations to protect all persons who may be at risk of persecution.  This call was reiterated by the Irish Ambassador to the Council of Europe at a meeting of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers in Strasbourg on 19 April.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union is also pressing the Russian authorities to ensure that the allegations are fully investigated and that those fleeing persecution are given full protection.  The EU High Representative Federica Mogherini raised the matter during a meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on 24 April.

These issues include both the numbers of Palestinian prisoners, some being held under administrative detention without trial, and the conditions in which prisoners are held.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland raised particular concerns about the detention of minors in our intervention at the Universal Periodic Review of Israel at the UN Human Rights Council in 2013.<\/p>  <p>  It is only fair to acknowledge that similar concerns about conditions in prisons could be expressed about many other countries in the region and elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the current situation, I am of course deeply concerned by the hunger strike involving a large number of prisoners, now in its fourth week.  We cannot support the use of hunger strikes as a means of exerting pressure.  There is a real risk of attitudes hardening on either side, leading to tragedy.

A child in care will be allocated a social worker and a regularly reviewed care plan will be put in place.  Children in care who have been diagnosed by a clinical specialist as having a moderate or severe disability may avail of disability services operated by the HSE, or from the private sector.  Foster care placements are monitored by Tusla, for example by regular visits from the child's allocated  social worker and the foster family's  link worker.

Where credible disclosures of welfare or abuse concerns are received, social workers act sensitively to protect the child, taking into account the negative impact that may arise from disrupting the life of the young person, when mitigating the risk to them.  However, this is sometimes unavoidable, particularly where a young person must be moved to a new care setting.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to young persons with special needs or mental health issues, a joint protocol for inter-agency collaboration has been recently published together by Tusla and the HSE, who are committed to implementing it across the country.  The protocol clarifies the separate and distinct roles, responsibilities and legal requirements of both agencies and will ensure joint and effective management of the transition of young people with special needs and\/or complex mental health issues to adult services.

Where a young person with special needs has been in care with Tusla, the young person is supported in the transition to independent living or, where appropriate, transfer to adult services provided by the HSE.  The aftercare planning is a collaborative approach that involves the young person, their families, their carers and relevant State bodies.

These projects also benefit from support under the European Social Fund.<\/p>  <p>  My Department provides funding to the Irish Youth Justice Service for services relating to the Oberstown Children Detention Campus (Oberstown) and the Bail Supervision Scheme which has recently been established on a pilot basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Bail Supervision Scheme provides therapeutic supports in the community for children who are subject to bail conditions.  The service is a &lsquo;wraparound&rsquo; service to the young person and their family with a prescribed reporting system back to the courts through the appropriate statutory bodies; Probation Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Oberstown.<\/p>  <p>  If a child is remanded or sentenced to a period of detention in Oberstown, a range of rehabilitative supports is offered as part of an overall programme, which focuses on the child&rsquo;s individual needs and provides the framework for each child&rsquo;s individual journey through detention.  The focus is on developing supportive relationships with the main emphasis placed on education and rehabilitation.  <\/p>  <p>  The Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS) is a national service provided by Tusla; they provide clinical services to children in the community, children in detention and also in special care facilities.  On admission to Oberstown an individual management plan is put in place for each child which includes a mental health assessment to determine the need for more specialist support provided by ACTS and short term interventions may continue when the child returns to the Community.<\/p>  <p>  Oberstown also have service level agreements with EPIC, the Youth Advocacy Programme (YAP) and Le Ch&eacute;ile - Mentoring and Youth Justice Support Services.  These provide rehabilitative services to children and young people in detention and during their transition back to their home and community by providing mentoring and support to both the young person and their family.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills provides education and training services through the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  These include both primary and secondary level courses as well as a wide range of vocational and Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) accredited awards through the Oberstown Education Centre.<\/p>  <p>  The wide range of rehabilitation, education and support services provided and supported by the Irish Youth Justice Service are detailed in the Tackling Youth Crime: Youth Justice Action Plan 2014 &ndash; 2018, and a progress report covering the period 2014 to 2015, published in December 2016, is available on my Department's website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100064#WRW01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":737,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100064#WRW01450"},{"type":"question","counter":738,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[22629\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100064#WRW01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the aspect of\u00a0youth affairs\u00a0that has generated most concern in the past eight years; the extent to which adequate action was taken; the quality and efficacy of measures put in place to address such issues; if further action is required; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":739,"content":"<p>Prior to the establishment of my Department in 2011, funding for youth services was provided through a number of disparate funding schemes and administered by several Government Departments.  Against this backdrop, my Department has engaged in a reform programme to ensure quality effective, value for money services that are evidence based and designed to secure the best outcomes for young people.  In this regard you will be aware that the targeted schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of the impact youth service provision has on young people&rsquo;s lives.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.  These included the merging the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects into a single youth funding scheme.  The work on the development of this new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work involving approximately 1,400 youth work staff working in youth services and communities throughout the country.  The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to thirty national and major regional youth organisations, the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme which supports youth work activities at a local level and the Youth Information Centre Scheme which funds twenty five Youth Information Centres.<\/p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020, published in 2015 was developed in close consultation with statutory youth interests and the voluntary youth organisations and services that work with young people.  The strategy sets out Government&rsquo;s aims for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, so that they are active and healthy, achieving their full potential in learning and development, safe and protected from harm, have economic security and opportunity and are connected and contributing to their world.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department, along with all government departments, was required to deliver substantial savings on all funding programmes in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012 &ndash; 2014.  My Department sought to ensure that front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people, were protected as far as is possible from the impact of any necessary reductions in funding.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2017 has provided some &euro;57m in current funding to my Department to support the provision of youth services.  The increase of &euro;5.5m, along with increases previously provided in Budget 2016 effectively reverses the cuts endured in recent years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100064#WRW01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":741,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100064#WRW01700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Aircraft","counter":740,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100064#WRW01650"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[22424\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051100064#WRW01700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if an Air Corps plane was prevented from entering Swedish airspace due to a failure to submit the necessary paperwork for clearance to a foreign country; the person or bodies responsible for this error; if there will be an investigation into the events; if the aircraft was low on fuel when making the return trip; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":742,"content":"<p>The Air Corps operates two CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft, which are unarmed aircraft and primarily used for sea fisheries protection and maritime patrolling.
