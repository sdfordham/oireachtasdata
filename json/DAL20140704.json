Countless training sessions and matches are played in various sports in every county and they are a vital part of the fabric of Irish life.  The clubs are the lifeblood of our communities.  They are kept alive and kicking by the volunteer heartbeat that sustains so much of what we take for granted.  Without these men and women willing to give their time, energy and commitment, the clubs would disappear.<\/p><p>  Over the years, thanks to the hard work and enterprise of committed volunteers, these clubs have grown from being just half-grazed fields rented off a friendly local farmer into state-of-the-art sports facilities.  Part of this process has been the establishment of licensed bars to provide a social element to the clubs.  These bars help to raise funds for the club and give members, particularly non-playing and older members, a social focal point.  It is a safe controlled environment for members of a club to come together.  Whether GAA, rugby or soccer, these clubs form the backbone of their communities, and their bars are a part of this.  However, the commercial rates system hits these clubs with deeply unfair bills, and this Bill is a simple measure to help ease the financial pressure on these clubs.<\/p><p>  The existing commercial rates system unfairly penalises clubs with a licensed premises.  The current rules ensure the entire complex, rather than just the bar, is hit with charges, leaving clubs with massive commercial rates costs.  Clubs with a sports hall, dressing rooms, meeting rooms and gyms are hit with commercial rates on the entire premises because they also have a licensed bar.  The Bill aims to ensure clubs only pay rates on the commercial bar and not on the actual sports facility.  Clubs should not be penalised for developing top-class facilities just because they have a bar.<\/p><p>  Rates can, and are, pushing over the edge many clubs struggling to make ends meet.  Bars are generally used for social events and as a fund-raising mechanism, which the hefty commercial rates bill seriously undermines.  Clubs' rates charges form a minuscule part of the &euro;1.7 billion total raised in commercial rates per annum by local authorities.  It is minuscule even as a percentage of the &euro;550 million property tax, &euro;500 million of which is due to go back into local authorities this year, contrary to what happened last year, but that is a debate for another day.  Essentially, the money raised from clubs is a small part of local government finances but a big slice of the costs for hundreds of clubs.<\/p><p>  I call on the Government to fully adopt the Bill on its own, or add it as an amendment to the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 which is before the Seanad.  It cannot, like a number of other pieces of legislation accepted in principle, be allowed to languish on the shelves of a Department going nowhere fast.  The Bill is a simple change that would ensure clubs pay rates only on the licensed bar section of their facilities.  Therefore, no other bar in the locality would be at a competitive disadvantage as a result of the change because rates would still be paid on the club's bar.  On a broader level, it would also help ensure alcohol is consumed in a safe controlled environment rather than through dangerous binge drinking.<\/p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il believes the Valuation Act should be revisited.  In particular, the definition of &quot;community hall &quot; in the Act should be clarified to include sports and recreational facilities provided by registered clubs.  The crux of this short Bill is that only the licensed premises is to be rated and not the entire facility which is used for sporting purposes.  I draw to the attention of the House the specific changes the Bill will introduce if it is accepted by the Government.  The interpretation of &quot;community hall&quot; in Part 1 of the Valuation Act 2001 should be changed to include the facility of a registered club not forming part of the licensed premises of the club.  This would give relief from rates to the non-licensed sports and leisure facilities of clubs.  The legislation would achieve this through making a small change to the definition of &quot;community hall&quot; in the Valuation Act 2001.  At present the Valuation Act states &quot;community hall&quot; means a hall or similar building, other than the premises of a club for the time being registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904 which is not used primarily for profit and gain, and is occupied by a person who ordinarily uses it, or ordinarily permits it to be used, for purposes which involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally and which are recreational or otherwise of a social nature.  The simple change put forward in the Bill to change the interpretation involves the insertion of just one word.  This change would allow clubs to seek a review from the Valuation Office to have the non-licensed section of their premises derated.  The changed definition would state &quot;community hall&quot; means a hall or similar building, other than the licensed premises of a club for the time being registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904.  This minor amendment to the Act would make a major difference to the finances of ordinary clubs run by volunteers the length and breadth of Ireland.<\/p><p>  I wish to clarify an additional point about the Bill in case Deputies have concerns.  The legislation is not about supporting bars; it is about supporting volunteer sports clubs struggling to make ends meet.  Fianna F&aacute;il is fully committed to fighting the disastrous consequences alcohol abuse has wrought on society.  We support minimum alcohol pricing and taxing off-licence sales to discourage binge drinking and ensure people consume alcohol in a controlled environment.  This is an integral part of an holistic strategy to combat alcohol abuse.  Supporting local clubs which provide an active social outlet for all ages and which raise funds are an important part of enabling alcohol to be consumed in a safe, controlled and responsible environment.  These clubs should not be punished for developing a vibrant local organisation with a strong sporting infrastructure.<\/p><p>  The Bill is about supporting voluntary organisations which play a vital role in our community and which are being hit with an unfair tax.  Rates will still be paid on the licensed premises section of the facility.  This will not leave other licensed premises at a competitive disadvantage.  It will help ensure alcohol is consumed in a controlled fashion and not contribute to the dangerous binge drinking we have witnessed in recent years which is scarring younger generations.<\/p><p>  I hope the Government appreciates the role that sports clubs play in our communities.  We can take pride in the volunteer ethos that has built up small fledgling teams into strong active hubs for an entire area, with ordinary men and women coming together for common purpose and transforming their towns and villages and specific parts of our large cities and urban centres.<\/p><p>These clubs form the fabric of Irish community life.  However, the existing commercial rates system unfairly penalises clubs that have worked hard to set up facilities for all their members.  The Bill proposes to help ease the burden on these clubs.  It is a small part of the finances raised by local authorities through commercial rates but a major part of the outgoings of many of these clubs.  This small change to the law will make a vast difference to them.<\/p><p> I hope the Government will take this small but constructive step for clubs across the country.  The Government can either accept the Bill and the amendments it proposes to previous Acts or it may wish to insert the provisions contained in the Bill in the Valuation (Amendment) No. 2 Bill which is going through the Seanad at present.  That would be commendable on the Government's part and would reflect many of the comments that have come to me from many Members opposite who also feel this amendment is necessary in order to alleviate the great strain that has been placed on many clubs which have developed their facilities and services to their members over recent years and which form a vibrant part of the fabric of local communities.<\/p><p> It is also very evident in large urban centres.  I have visited many clubs in Dublin and throughout the country which find themselves in a bind in this regard.  Many of them have had to close facilities and not offer those services to their members, and are not able to generate the revenue to warrant the sort of investment they are making in facilities for the youth and even beyond.  In many city clubs, including Parnell's GAA Club here in Dublin, I have witnessed considerable co-operation with local community centres and organisations whereby they share many of their facilities for use by the elderly, for example.  Any measure that helps to alleviate the strains on those clubs in order to provide such extra facilities and services would be a positive step.  It would be a recognition on the part of the Government of the anomaly in the present system.  I look forward to the Government accepting the Bill or at least giving a commitment to amend the Bill that is before the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400003#A00400","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404468600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for introducing this Private Members' Bill, which proposes a solution to a recurring issue on the valuation of club premises where the club is a registered club under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904 and allowed to sell alcoholic beverages.  This issue mainly relates to sports clubs.  Like the Deputy, I recognise the work sports clubs do throughout the community and the important contribution they make.<\/p><p>  A number of categories of properties are exempted from rates by Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001.  These include educational and health-care institutions that are not operated for profit, art galleries, museums and property used by charitable organisations for charitable purposes.  All land developed for sport is exempted from rates.  This would include the outdoor surfaces of the playing pitches, tennis courts, golf courses etc., but not the club's buildings and structures.  Also exempted is any building used exclusively as a community hall.<\/p><p>  A community hall is defined in the Act and means a hall or similar building which is not used primarily for profit or gain and is ordinarily used for recreational or social purposes involving participation by inhabitants of the general locality.  The definition of a community hall specifically excludes the premises of a club that is registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904.  Registration of a club under this Act allows the club to sell alcoholic beverages.<\/p><p>  I am sympathetic to the intent of the Bill regarding its attempt to address the needs of small, local, voluntary, community sports clubs and will not oppose it at this stage.  It appears unfair that it is not just, the bar, function room or kitchen area of a sports club, that is valued for rates purposes, but also the non-commercial buildings and structures, including changing rooms, meeting rooms and gyms.  If the club had no bar area it might have no rates liability, so the inclusion of a bar brings everything except the outdoor playing surface into the rates net.  Valuing changing facilities or other ancillary buildings that are far removed from the bar could be seen as unfair and resulting in a higher rates bill than might be the case if the valuation were restricted to the bar area.<\/p><p>  The argument is that this higher rates bill puts an undue burden on many sports clubs that are working on small budgets to promote sports and leisure for the benefit of their local community.  I am also aware that there are clubs with premises in more than one location.  Where these clubs are registered they might in practice only operate a bar in one of their locations but the buildings in all of their locations are valued for rates purposes.<\/p><p>  There are, however, many problems with the proposed Bill.  There are technical, practical and competition issues that need to be addressed which I will expand on here.  I would like the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to take submissions on these issues and consider them on Committee Stage.  The Bill as proposed will not achieve what the Deputy intends.  There may be unintended consequences for clubs that do not have a bar facility and there are competition issues to consider.<\/p><p>  I wish to address a technical issue that makes the Bill unworkable in its current state.  The proposed amendment in the Bill to the definition of a community hall is very minor.  It is just the addition of one word &quot;licensed&quot; before &quot;premises&quot; and on the surface it might seem to solve the problem.  It appears to keep clubs with a bar within the rates system, but restricts the valuation for rates purposes to that part of the club's premises that are used for the bar.<\/p><p>  There are, however, a number of reasons this amendment is unworkable.  First, clubs are not licensed, but are registered.  It is their registration under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904 that allows them to have a bar in their facility.  While this may seem to be a very technical point, changing the word to be included in the definition from &quot;licensed&quot; to &quot;registered&quot; will not improve the proposal.  When a club is registered it is registered as an entity.  It is the club in its entirety that is registered rather than different locations or parts of the club.  When a club is registered under the 1904 Act, there is no delineation of what is the bar area or areas where alcohol can be sold.  There are no maps or plans that the Valuation Office could use that describe the area or limits of the bar.  Even where a club has premises in one location it is not possible to say that one set of premises is registered and another set is not registered.<\/p><p>  If the word &quot;registered&quot; was used and the Bill was enacted, all the club's premises would be excluded from the definition of &quot;community hall&quot; and registered clubs would be in exactly the same position as they are now.  If an exemption from valuation were granted on the physical description of the bar part of clubhouse premises how could this distinction be made and sustained in a way that would not be open to possible abuse by seeking to narrowly define the bar or that would blur the lines between truly community-based sports club facilities and those of professional sports clubs and commercial stadiums and other commercial entities.<\/p><p>  Local government funding is dependent on having a sustainable and fair valuation and rating system.  Any widening of the definition of exempted premises, no matter how well motivated, that might lead to others which could afford to pay commercial rates being exempted or partially exempted, would be unfair to genuine community-based clubs and ratepayers generally, and unsustainable as regards local government funding.<\/p><p>  I also want to ensure that our current treatment of sports clubs from a rateability point of view is not endangered in any attempt to improve it a little further.  The existing definition, as interpreted by the Valuation Office, allows many sports clubs, local GAA clubs, etc., to be exempted completely from rates.  As their facilities are often made available for use by people in their locality for social and recreational purposes, the premises of these clubs are deemed to fit within the definition of a community hall.  The current definition therefore works for many sports clubs that do not have a bar.  This contrasts with, for example, the situation in Northern Ireland where the entire club facility, whether licensed or not, is rateable including the outdoor playing surfaces.<\/p><p>The purely sporting parts of the facility can get an 80% reduction.  This regime would not be welcomed by those clubs that do not have a bar facility.  It is important for the sports clubs that enjoy the current exemption that nothing be done that could jeopardise their position.  Were the amendment proposed technically feasible, it would make a mockery of the definition of \"community hall\" as what Members would be trying to exempt as community halls would be the ancillary club facilities, the changing rooms etc.  Where might this leave those clubs that benefit from the interpretation, were its general use challenged?  I would not wish to see endangered the current interpretation, as it is working for the benefit of many sports clubs.<\/p><p> It is worth noting again that the land developed for sport such as playing pitches, tennis courts and golf courses is exempt from valuation regardless of whether the club is registered.  I also understand the manner in which clubs are valued for rates purposes differs from the valuation of licensed premises.  This is based partly on the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, which is more restrictive on who can be served alcohol.  While I am not an expert on valuation, were sports clubs with a bar to be valued in the same way as licensed premises, many then would have a much higher valuation, regardless of whether the non-commercial premises were included in the valuation.  Very few clubs pay more in rates than the bars in their own locality.  The regime that currently is in place favours sports clubs as a rule.  It recognises that voluntary community-based sports clubs, with or without a bar facility, seek to promote and fund social activity on a not-for-profit basis for their members.  It strikes a balance between the needs of community sports clubs and those of commercial sporting facilities and licensed commercial premises, while contributing to a sustainable source of funding for local authorities that must provide essential local services.  Any effort made to improve that position must be considered carefully to ensure it does not have the opposite effect to that intended.  Each club must consider its rates bill from a commercial standpoint.  If a club has a bar, it is aware the bar will not be exempted, as this would clearly be inequitable to licenceholders operating public houses and to other parts of the hospitality sector.  If the business the club transacts in its bar is limited, it may not be worth maintaining a bar when all costs, including rates, are taken into account.  If it reaches this conclusion it can choose not to renew its registration under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act and seek to qualify for an exemption under the definition of a community hall.<\/p><p> The third issue I wish to have addressed on Committee Stage is the impact any change will have on licensed competitors.  The exclusion of clubs that have a bar from the definition of a community hall makes sense, as many clubs run their bar and function facilities in as professional a manner as licensed pubs or hotels.  It would not be fair to licenceholders were these clubs fully exempted from rates.  I note the Private Members' Bill is not proposing that clubs with a bar should get a complete exemption from rates.  I believe the Deputy appreciates that his amendment sits in a middle ground between equity with the licensed trade on the one side and the position of clubs without a bar that are completely exempt on the other.  He is trying to improve marginally the position of those clubs with a bar without upsetting the position of commercial licenceholders.  This is a difficult task that is complicated by the other legislation in this area.  The licensed trade should be given an opportunity to make its position known to the aforementioned committee on any proposed changes.<\/p><p> The argument will be and has been made that the Government should be supporting sports clubs and not penalising them by imposing commercial rates.  However, the Government provides significant support for sport locally and nationally.  Using rates exemptions to support any category of organisation is neither transparent nor targeted and better policy interventions are available and used to support sport.  As outlined above, the Valuation Act 2001 provides a range of exemptions for sport including the exemption of land developed for sport and the exemption that is there for clubs that do not have a bar.  The exemptions that are provided for currently are close to what is desired under the current licensing and club registration laws but I am interested in ascertaining whether alternative workable and sustainable solutions can be brought forward on Committee Stage that would respect the benefits of the current regime and the licensed trade with which many clubs compete.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I wish to inform Members that the Valuation Amendment (No. 2) Bill 2012 will return on Committee Stage to the Seanad shortly, probably after rather than before the summer break.  The Committee Stage amendments have been drafted and at present, there are no proposed Committee Stage changes to the definition of &quot;community hall&quot; in the Bill for the reasons outlined earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400004#B00200","speaker":"1098","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404469200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>While I thank Deputy Cowen for introducing this Bill, the irony is not lost on Members that this is something that should have been included as part of the 2001 Act and that the current position has existed for 14 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400005#C00200","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1404469200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I was not here 14 years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400005#C00300","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1404469200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Nevertheless, I thank the Deputy for bringing it forward.  I also thank my home town club of Ratoath for mounting its campaign a number of weeks ago, together with my county board.  They obviously are passionate about the GAA, sport and its development, as well as the integral role it plays in communities.  Arising from my husband's involvement in my own GAA club, I am aware of the countless hours and the commitment that are involved, as well as the hard work involved in fund-raising to keep alive those clubs.  This is not limited to GAA clubs because this Bill obviously affects other clubs, such as the rugby club located in the village up the road from me.  Money is hard earned and is spent extremely well by an entirely voluntary organisation for the betterment of communities.  The position of my club is that the current valuation system charges rates on its dressing rooms, its gym and what I will loosely call an indoor pitch, that is, an indoor area the club has upstairs above its commercial space.  It is an area the kids use when it is raining and that the more senior members, by which I am talking about the old farts like my husband and his pals, use on Saturday or Wednesday nights to have a kick around.  The club is charged commercial rates for that area, which is wrong.  While I understand there are various technical issues associated with the Bill, the intention of Deputy Cowen, everybody else who is speaking today and all those who have been supporting their own clubs throughout the country, is that the current situation is wrong.  It is unfair and must be changed and while there may be technical difficulties, there are very clever people within Fine Gael and I am quite sure we can get around them.<\/p><p>  I urge the Minister of State to make use of the opportunity afforded by the Valuation Amendment (No. 2) Bill 2012 that is before the Seanad at present.  I agree with Deputy Cowen that Members should not get bogged down in parking this Bill or in discussing the technical issues pertaining to it.  Members should make use of their opportunity with regard to amendments to the current Valuation Amendment (No. 2) Bill 2012 and should find a resolution to this issue.  Long before I ever arrived in this House, Members of my party were raising this issue with the then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister.  The matter either was ignored or perhaps the technical issues were so difficult that it could not be fixed.  However, the time now is right as Members all are in agreement that the current position is unfair and unjust.  People, who are all volunteers who are trying to drive the development of sport, as well as a bit of crack in and the development of communities, should not be penalised.  I genuinely ask the Minister of State to find a way to get around this issue through amendments to the current Valuation Amendment (No. 2) Bill 2012.  The Government, its predecessor and its successors undoubtedly are, were and will be supportive of sporting facilities and their development throughout the country.  Only yesterday, the Government handed out &euro;40 million of taxpayers' funds back to those taxpayers for the development of more than 800 projects throughout the country.  All Members recognise the really good work that is being done by volunteers nationwide.  They all recognise that the current situation is wrong and must be changed and they all recognise that the will exists to do it.  Therefore, let us please do so this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400005#C00400","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1404469200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>First, I commend Deputy Cowen on introducing the Bill in the House.  The Deputy may not believe it but I wish to support him in this regard.  I do so as a former GAA club chairman of six years' standing and as a current member of a club that has a bar and a licensed premises and Deputy Cowen is correct.<\/p><p>My local club is paying an unfair price for having a bar area and the unfair rate it pays is causing great angst among its members.  Sports club complexes, irrespective of which organisation is involved, generally feature dressing rooms, a sports hall, a meeting room and a function room.  The facilities are frequently used by residents' associations, senior citizens, bridge clubs and other groups.  Sports clubs do not operate to make money but because sporting organisations of all codes, whether soccer, rugby or GAA, are the heartbeat and core of communities.  It is, therefore, unfair to impose a higher commercial rate on them.  <\/p><p>I recall my local club treasurer, Jim Collins, bringing the annual bill from Cork City Council to executive committee meetings, which were held on Monday nights, and asking what could be done.  The current approach penalises clubs because it creates and unfair burden and requires them to transfer to local authorities some of the funds they raise.<\/p><p>The technical difficulties the Minister of State outlined can be overcome on Committee Stage.  I hope a way will be found to support clubs because their purpose is not to compete with local bars, hotels or restaurants but to raise revenue for club development and upgrading facilities.  I accept, however, that the scale of activities may differ between clubs.  My local GAA club in Bishopstown has a licensed premises on the complex and uses funds to provide state-of-the-art playing fields, all-weather pitches, astro-turf pitches, dressing rooms, a gym for club use and an indoor sports hall for club members.  We do not seek to make vast profits from the premises for use elsewhere but to raise money for ongoing coaching and games development.  We want to win a county championship and ensure the club makes progress.  Sports clubs must generate revenue to maximise their potential and all such revenue remains within the club.  Their ethos is one of pride, immersion in the community and promoting a sense of unity that binds together a parish or community, whether urban or rural.<\/p><p>Many club bars do not make substantial profits.  Since the recession started, many people have stopped consuming alcohol mid-week and only go out once at the weekend.  Many will not even visit the bar of their local sports club.  While I do not propose to reveal commercially sensitive information, many club bars do not make the profits their competitors believe they are making.  The bar is a social focal point for club members and a means of raising funds.<\/p><p>Sports clubs with a bar on the premises also pay excise duty and tax and PRSI for staff.  While those who argue that people who are involved in sport should not promote alcohol are correct in theory, an amateur organisation that is trying to win a county championship needs money for coaching and games development and the provision of gear in local schools.  There are only so many draw tickets one can sell and fund-raising events one can hold.  My club takes a responsible approach to the sale and use of alcohol on the premises and runs a very good shop.<\/p><p>The technical issues the Minister of State raised can be addressed.  I share the hope expressed by Deputy Regina Doherty that the Bill will not be parked for 14 years.  I was struck by comments made during a debate on a previous Valuation Bill in May 2001, during which the then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Mr. Martin Cullen, stated the following:<blockquote>I am satisfied that the definition of &quot;community hall&quot; in the Bill allows for the exemption from rates of a building comprising dressing rooms, changing rooms used in connection with a playing field... The same would apply to a community recreation facility.  However, if the sporting or recreation complex is licensed, the entire property will be rateable.  I consider that this should be the position.  Consequently, I do not accept that the amendments are necessary.<\/blockquote>I hope the Government will not do as the former Minister of State did and penalise sports clubs of all codes that raise money to fund their activities.  These clubs do not pass on profits to a large entity but use them to develop the sport.   <\/p><p>This legislation has been introduced at an opportune time given the current farce surrounding the Garth Brooks concerts at Croke Park.  Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael, the best sports organisation in the world, is raising money through Croke Park to fund the development of hurling and Gaelic football, the best games in the world.  It is a pity that all those involved, specifically Dublin City Council, local residents and the GAA, are not engaging more.  This episode highlights for all those involved in sport and politics the need for constant engagement and dialogue.  I hope the matter can be resolved.  The demand made by Garth Brooks for five concerts or nothing is wrong.  If, as he says, Ireland is dear to his heart, he should not penalise all those who bought tickets for his concerts or the supporters of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael who will use some of the proceeds to fund games development.  I hope the problem can be resolved and I am sure P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh in Cork, which is a great venue, will be available to host two of his concerts.  <\/p><p>This is an important Bill which addresses issues such as community, fund-raising for clubs, the playing of our native games and the use by sports clubs of all the profits they make.  As Deputy Barry Cowen noted, the Bill does not propose to exclude entire sports complexes from a liability to pay rates.  The bar area will continue to be included but we must not penalise sports clubs.  We must give those who promote sport at local level an incentive to continue doing so, rather than penalising them through high rate bills.  Many clubs do not make the profits people believe they make. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400005#C00500","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404469800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and compliment Deputy Barry Cowen on introducing it in the House.  Having listened to the Minister of State's comments on the technical difficulties and the nuances involved, I hope the Government will accept the legislation and allow it to proceed to the next Stage.  A significant number of representations have been received from sports clubs, especially GAA clubs, requesting cross-party support for the Bill.  Given the value of sports clubs and community organisations, this is a valid request.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Regina Doherty noted, Ireland is fortunate to have so many people making a voluntary contribution to their communities.  All of us will be able to identify people in our local areas, including family members, who do great work in voluntary organisations, including sports clubs.  <\/p><p>  Rates should only be paid on premises and parts of buildings that have a commercial purpose and generate profit.  This is clearly not the case in respect of a large number of community halls and sports premises.  The Bill provides for an exception where such premises also contain a bar selling alcohol.  It is appropriate that parts of premises used as a bar be subject to rates given that bars generate profit, have a commercial purpose and compete with private bars which frequently have a liability for high commercial rates.  We must remember, however, the onerous task facing clubs, including many clubs in County Laois.  Trumra, for example, is an area with only 27 families.<\/p><p> Even larger clubs such as Portlaoise are obliged to shoulder a huge burden each year in the context of trying to raise funds.  Their efforts in this regard include holding lotteries and there is an annual draw run by the county board.  A percentage of the funding from the latter is allocated to local clubs.  The fund-raising in question is onerous and is done on a weekly basis by volunteers.  I lived in both England and Scotland and I am aware that there are no comparable organisations or similar voluntary efforts in those countries.  I do not mean that in a negative but we are lucky that volunteers make an exceptional contribution in carrying out the work to which I refer, be it for the GAA or soccer clubs such as Portlaoise FC, whose grounds are located close to my home.  The volunteers to whom I refer make a huge effort every day and night of the week.<\/p><p> I take this opportunity to recognise the contribution sports clubs and community organisations make to society.  Implementing the legislative changes proposed in the Bill would be a practical recognition to that contribution.  The changes in question would go some way towards redressing the effect of the cuts in funding that have been implemented across the community sector.  Those cuts have obliged many sporting and community organisations to severely curtail their activities.  In addition, the collapse in people's incomes must be taken into consideration.  Many individuals are earning a third or a half of what they earned seven or eight years ago.  This means that they cannot buy a &euro;100 ticket for an annual draw as they did in the past.  This has added to the impact of the cuts made in respect of the community sector.  I acknowledge yesterday's allocation of sports capital grants by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ring.  At first glance, I can see that he looked after a number of clubs and organisations in my county that were in need of funding.  It appears the Minister of State and his officials seemed to take into consideration those clubs which were badly in need of funding and a hand-up rather than a handout.<\/p><p> The cuts resulting from the economic downturn have had a detrimental impact on young people in particular.  On Tuesday evening last, I made a contribution to my party's Private Members' Bill relating to mental health and suicide.  The rate of suicide among young people is alarming.  This is a major issue in rural areas and also in some urban working class ones.  Ireland has the highest rate of suicide rate among young men in the EU.  I wish to highlight the importance of sports clubs in countering suicide and providing young people with both a focus, a connection to their communities and an opportunity to socialise.  Numerous studies have illustrated the beneficial impact of participation in sporting and other activities in the context of social adjustment and mental well-being, especially in the case of young people.  The Bill does not seek to address this matter.  By easing the financial burden imposed, via rates, on community and sporting organisations' premises, however, it would allow the organisations in question to continue to provide services and facilities and to expand their operations in order that more members of communities might be included.<\/p><p> Radical changes in respect of the funding of local organisations and community development groups are to be introduced in January.  Those organisations and groups have created a great deal of employment and provided many services over the years.  The changes the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, proposes to introduce under the so-called realignment will completely alter existing structures and also the way in which the organisations and groups to which I refer operate.  Some of them may even be forced to cease operations.  This is particularly ironic in view of the fact that the European Court of Auditors identified Ireland's way of funding the entities in question through Leader and other programmes as being the best model.<\/p><p> There are other issues relating to rates and many people have highlighted the excessive burden they impose on struggling businesses.  Something of a catch-22 situation exists in this regard.  High rates can force people out of business and when this happens, the income and rate bases of local authorities shrink.  Local authorities need the money they get from rates.  The matter of legacy rates also arises.  I refer to a situation where one business closes down and vacates a premises and where that which replaces it is obliged to pay the same rates.  Perhaps the Minister of State's officials might take note of the fact that this issue must be addressed.  New businesses which move into premises previously occupied by other concerns must pay the same rates and no account is taken of their potential profitability.  This makes little sense.  There is a small window of opportunity in this regard in the context of the new local government legislation, which contains a provision whereby elected council members can make alterations, if they so wish, to try to ease the burden on businesses in their municipal districts.  The Department must make local authorities aware of this provision by means of a circular.  I previously served as a councillor and I am aware that circulars are always issued to management but that they do not always find their way to local authority members.  Councillors might only become aware of the existence of particular circulars when they attend local authority meetings.  It is important that the power to make alterations be made known to local authority members.<\/p><p> In the context of the Bill before us, the issue of profitability must be taken into consideration.  Imposing rates in respect of the total area of the property of GAA and other clubs does not make any sense and is unfair.  Those properties are often used for bingo and other recreational activities, community meetings, etc.  It is important that we should differentiate in this regard.  I recognise that it will be difficult to find a way to deal with this matter and I accept that there are technical difficulties involved.  If, however, the Government has the will, then a way will be found.  Anyone can state that previous Administrations did not take action in respect of this issue but today we are all calling for it to be addressed.  We are also calling for local clubs with bars on their premises to be given fair treatment and only charged for the areas on their properties that are being used for commercial purposes.  We need to relieve the pressure under which such clubs are operating.<\/p><p> I support this very positive Bill put forward by the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies.  I hope the Government will allow it to proceed to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400006#D00200","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404470400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Valuation Bill 2014 and I commend Deputy Cowen on bringing it forward.  As previous speakers indicated, the Bill is designed to amend the Valuation Act 2001 in order that only the licensed premises portion of sporting clubs' properties will be valued for rates purposes.<\/p><p>  The work done by sports clubs throughout the country is well documented, as is their importance and value to local communities.  The operation of a bar on the premises of a sports club is not always with the purpose of generating profit for profits sake.  Rather, it is to generate funds in order to allow such clubs to continue their work in respect of under-age teams and to buy sports equipment and to ease the burden on local communities with regard to maintaining such clubs.  This is an important aspect which must be recognised.<\/p><p>  It is interesting that so many barriers are being placed in front of this Bill, which is seeking to achieve something quite simple.  Reference was made to technical difficulties and unintended consequences.  I wonder whether there is a real will to deal with this issue and amend the Valuation Act in order to allow the Bill to achieve its purpose.  While the Government has indicated it is accepting the Bill, I am obliged to ask how long it will be before it proceeds to Committee Stage and whether the Department will actually facilitate the latter taking place in order that the issues we are highlighting might be teased out and possibly addressed.  It will be interesting to see how long we will be obliged to wait for Committee Stage and how the Government will deal with the issues that have been identified and offer solutions in respect of them.<\/p><p>  I wish to comment on the Valuation Act in general terms.<\/p><p>While there may be many difficulties as has been outlined by the Minister as to how licensed premises are valued in clubhouses, local authorities should be given a greater role in how valuations are administered.  This could be teased out for sporting clubs, as a way of recognising the contribution they make to their counties.  Local authorities could be provided with a legal mechanism whereby they would not have to collect the full valuation rates from the clubs.  This might be a way of overcoming the technical issues as outlined earlier by the Minister of State.  He stated the exemption system which operates in the Six Counties would not be welcomed here but my suggestion could provide a way to overcome these technical and legal difficulties for the Valuation Office.<\/p><p> Once a building is valued, the local authority is legally obliged to collect the amount of the valuation.  There is no legal mechanism to allow it to waive any portion of it.  Even if a business is in difficulty and cannot afford to pay the full amount, it still accrues as a debt against the business.  On a wider basis, local authorities should be able to stimulate business activity in their areas by being allowed to reduce the amounts they can collect while the valuations would not change for businesses that are having difficulties.  It would also enable local authorities to improve their enticements in getting new businesses to open up in their areas.<\/p><p> I support this Bill.  I hope it does not languish on Committee Stage, however, and runs out of time as the Government&rsquo;s tenure comes to an end.  The technical difficulties can be dealt with and teased out on Committee Stage if there is a will within the Department to make that happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400007#E00200","speaker":"1001","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404471000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I am glad to contribute to this Bill and thank Deputy Cowen for bringing it forward.  As a lifelong member of the GAA and a former secretary of my local GAA club, I know this issue has raised its head over many years.  Even though my club did not have a bar, negotiations on rates could be problematic.  Whether it is GAA, soccer or rugby clubs, they provide a wonderful spirit and service to our communities.  Last weekend, I was reminded of the sense of volunteerism at the Connacht GAA Centre of Excellence where the all-Ireland f&eacute;iles were being held with thousands of children and their parents from all over the country participating.  It was inspirational.  Last night, I was reminded of it again, when I was out in Whitehall Colmcille GAA Club where a lifelong Leitrim and Drumkeerin fan, Sean Flynn, was honoured, a fan who never missed a match for the past 40 years.  Two busloads from Drumkeerin attended the event which was full of a sense of community, unity of purpose and a sense of family.  This is the essence and thrust of this Bill.<\/p><p>  Last October, along with some of my colleagues, I raised the issue of the fivefold increase in the rates being sought from Croke Park and the Aviva Stadium.  My main point on that occasion was the threat of a knock-on effect for other club premises across the country which might not be able to meet a similar demand.  Obviously rates need to be paid.  If a club has a bar, it cannot have an unfair advantage over other licensed premises in its area.  However, rates need to be fair and commiserate.  I would hope the problem can be solved by consensus.<\/p><p>  Deputy Buttimer already raised the issue of the danger that all of the five proposed Garth Brooks concerts will be cancelled.  As someone who has been going to Croke Park for 40 years, I have had some of the happiest days of my life, as well as a few sad ones, there.  I was even there the day S&eacute;amus Darby scored the famous goal against Kerry in the 1982 All-Ireland football final.  I appeal that some solution be found to allow for the five concerts to go ahead in Croke Park.  I am not taking any sides on this or the side of the GAA.  I would acknowledge looking in from outside that mistakes have been made on all sides in this but I would hope these concerts would go ahead even if it meant there would be no concerts next year or for a couple of years.  At the function I was at last night, I met a couple whose son and wife are coming home from Australia soon.  As a surprise, this couple have tickets for one of the concerts for their son and daughter-in-law.  I am not concerned about the GAA on this but the 70,000 tickets sold outside of the country, the hit the country will take because of the decision on the concerts, as well as the disappointment and chaos it will cause.  If there is a willingness to find a solution, the concerts should go ahead.  I am speaking also as someone who had an aunt living beside Croke Park for 40 years.  She always looked forward to the country cousins coming up on big match days.  I have had cups of tea in houses on the way down Jones' Road and the banter is magnificent.  I even have tickets for the Garth Brooks concert myself, even though I am not a music buff in any sense.  I am prepared to put my money that there will be no trouble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400008#F00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1404471000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>What about Punchestown?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400008#F00300","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1404471000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>It would be crucial to find a solution to this problem.

We all value the importance of GAA, rugby, golf and other clubs across the country that provide a worthwhile service to their communities.<\/p><p>The existing commercial rates system unfairly penalises clubs that have a licensed premises by charging rates on the entire complex rather than just on the bar area.  I am involved with a club in Enniscorthy that pays rates of approximately &euro;15,000 per year and I am told that in other parts of the country rates can be up to &euro;40,000 for sporting clubs that have a bar licence.  This creates a very unfair burden on clubs that are trying to provide facilities.  During the boom, builders and developers used to pour huge amounts of sponsorship money into GAA clubs in particular and that has dried up.  Clubs are running revenue raising initiatives such as lotteries and bingo to survive.<\/p><p> The Minister mentioned technical difficulties.  Having been in a few Departments when we were in government, I know officials always raise technical difficulties.  However, the Attorney General and senior officials in the Department are well able to overcome the technical difficulties, including those the Minister outlined in his speech, and provide a solution to the issue.  Deputy Cowen has called for an amendment to the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012, which is before the Seanad.  That is the most appropriate place to deal with this in an urgent manner.  The Minister said the Bill will come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  How long will it remain before the committee before a decision is taken?  Clubs cannot wait much longer.<\/p><p> The club with which I have been involved, and of which I have been chairperson at different times over the years, provides a facility for 30 teams from under sixes to seniors, including women playing camogie and ladies' football.  The club is at the heart of the community and hosts other organisations such as clubs for bridge, senior citizens, art, music, men's sheds and the Delightful Dollies women's club, free of charge.  It is becoming more and more expensive to run such a club, and it is unfair that the rates are based on the entire area rather than just the bar and lounge area.  We are not seeking unfair competition with other pubs but requesting a fair and equitable system and for clubs not to have to pay huge amounts of money to local authorities every year in rates.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister and the Government to accept the Bill and move it on to the next Stage.  There is nothing sinister or underhanded in the Bill.  It is a response to GAA and other clubs throughout the country, which have been seeking to have it changed for many years.  As some Deputies have pointed out, it probably should have happened when we were in government.  It did not, and we are where we are.  With the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill before the Seanad, there is an opportunity to make the amendment to implement the change for which Deputy Cowen has called.  If this happens, it will be fully supported by all sides of the House.  More importantly, it will enable struggling clubs to pay their rates and survive into the future.  Although my local club pays its rates on a monthly basis, which the local authority is accepting, the rates are a major burden on clubs.  The Bill is worthwhile and the Government should accept it, move on to the next Stage, get around the technical difficulties, and have it included in the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill that is before the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400008#F00500","speaker":"1096","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404471600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, and I thank Deputy Cowen for bringing it forward.  It has been needed for some time.  While there are technical issues, which the Minister addressed, I agree with the objective of the Bill.  Sports clubs with bar facilities should be liable for rates only on the part of the premises that has the licence to sell alcoholic beverages.  For sports clubs to pay rates on the entire premises, including changing rooms, showers, kitchens, meeting rooms or indoor sports halls, is ridiculous.  I recently met the Meath County Board of the GAA and a number of representative of local clubs, and it was brought to my attention that rates are also charged on signs.  There is not much point in a company contributing to a club in this way it if is going to be charged rates on it.<\/p><p>  A number of years ago I was told a particular club in Meath paid rates of over &euro;20,000.  At the time, I assumed it was just that particular club and I did not realise it was an issue throughout the county.  Only recently has it come to my attention that at least ten clubs in Meath are in arrears.  While it has been an problem for some time, it is only coming to the forefront now because of the economic downturn.  The clubs are run on a voluntary basis and make their money through fund-raising.  While we in Ireland are all very generous and still give something when we have nothing, when one has nothing to give, it is very hard to give.  Fund-raising is not bringing in as much money as previously, and that is why the problem is becoming apparent now.<\/p><p>  The issue was brought before a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister in 2001 and was rejected.  Had it been dealt with then, clubs could have saved 13 years of rates.  For our club in Meath, paying over &euro;20,000 in each of those 13 years, that is a hell of a lot of money.  Clubs are in tens of thousands of euro of debt because of it.  Nobody wants to go to court, and we need to resolve the issue as soon as possible.  While some people would prefer if clubs paid no rates, we must consider the fact that some clubs run their bars on a commercial basis while others open them only when there is a match or an event on.  We must be careful not to create discrimination, for example, in a situation where a club is in a village or next to a local pub which pays rates.<\/p><p>  It is extremely unfair to impose this burden on clubs, where people work on a voluntary basis, to pay rates on premises that are clearly sports facilities.  Local sports clubs are always the life and soul of a community.  I grew up in an extremely dedicated GAA family.  We went to all the matches; my father trained football teams, my uncles played, and all my cousins play.  From an early age I saw the dedication on the part of not just the players, but the committees and volunteers who work around them.  An entire community is involved in the GAA and other sporting facilities.  Athletics, tennis and other clubs are appearing, and they should also benefit from this.  Nobody wants them to disappear.<\/p><p>  The cost to implement the Bill would be small in comparison to other issues.  While I am happy we are allowing the Bill to pass today, notwithstanding the technical issues I do not want it to be passed and then for nothing to happen for a long time.  It must be addressed now and I urge the Minister to see that it is implemented as soon as possible or included by way of amendment to the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill that is with the Department and will, hopefully, come before the Seanad shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400009#G00200","speaker":"1180"},{"type":"speech","time":1404471600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cowen for bringing forward the issue, which many of us have been fighting at local level through our clubs.  When I was secretary of my local rugby club, this issue arose continually.  Other speakers have highlighted the fact that club members work voluntarily to pay a tax on their premises.  A brother of mine runs a pub.  The nature of the two businesses must be classified properly.  While I support the thrust of the Bill, each case, and each clubhouse, is individual.  In some clubhouses, the whole area is used as a function area, while in others the area includes dressing rooms, showers and an indoor training area.<\/p><p>It is difficult to put legislation or regulation in place for such cases, although I have some suggestions in that regard.<\/p><p> It is sad that in 2001, as Deputy McEntee noted, there was an opportunity for us to deal with the issue and Deputy Cowen's party failed to do that.  I welcome his bringing forward the Bill today as a number of us have raised similar issues concerning the rates for Croke Park and the Aviva stadium, as well as the clubs in our communities.  I would like to see a direction from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government about local issues, and perhaps the best way to deal with the matter is locally.  County managers can make decisions about how to collect rates on various premises, for example.  In my county when Intel was refurbishing its building, there was a derogation on rates.  Some places have rates applied when they are occupied but when they are unoccupied, there is no charge, and such an arrangement is allowable within the local remit.  Perhaps something could be done for club premises with a bar facility and a large function area that has multiple purposes, such as use for indoor bowls or training children.  When the function area is used commercially, a specific licence could be purchased instead of rates being paid all the time.  At least in that case, the commercial premises down the road, whether it is a pub or hotel, could see fairness in an application.  When the club is using a facility for a sporting or community project, there would be no charge, but when it is used for a commercial purpose, some licence fee would be paid.<\/p><p> I implore all clubs to actively engage with local county managers so as to formulate some type of solution.  If a clubhouse just has a bar and the premises for training, togging out and showering are in a different building, rates should be applied appropriately.  If clubs engage with local county managers, a solution can be reached.  I support the thrust of the Bill but I would find it very difficult to put something into legislation that could cover all issues on the ground.  Perhaps local council members could have much more input into how this could be done, and it can be difficult for us as the national Parliament to legislate in a way that covers all aspects.<\/p><p> There is an ongoing matter concerning Croke Park and the Garth Brooks concerts.  I have two tickets for one of the days for which no licence was granted.  Punchestown is an exceptional venue that would be available to host all five concerts, should Mr. Brooks decide to pull out of Croke Park.  It is wrong that a person can purchase a ticket for an event subject to a licence.  Many people have planned holidays, flights and hotel accommodation, so if an event is planned, it should be fully licensed before tickets go on sale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400009#G00300","speaker":"1053","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404472200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400010#H00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1404472200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>In this case Croke Park had permission for three concerts per annum and it may have pushed the boundary a little.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400010#H00300","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1404472200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The Deputy is pushing a boundary a little as well.

I am sure we would find many takers to relieve him of his burden and responsibility.  I hope the issue works out well for all concerned.<\/p><p>  Like other speakers I am generally supportive of the principle behind this Bill but the matter is not as easy to solve as it looks.  It is far from easy because there are many issues that will emerge as time goes by.  As we all know, every bar and pub in the country is under financial pressure.  They are competing with a voluntary sector that is also under pressure, which leads to problems.  We must also consider the constitutional aspect of any legislation.  If it is perceived that legislation may disadvantage commercial premises through unfair competition, competition legislation and European law comes into play.  The issue is not as simple as it looks.<\/p><p>  I am very sympathetic to the various clubs throughout the country which are in financial difficulty and because they have a bar on the premises they find the entire premises rated commercially.  Perhaps some concession could be given according to how community facilities are used by an organisation and comparison with total use throughout a year.  The same logic can apply to privately owned commercial premises, as many such premises also provide a certain services for community events.  In many cases, these are free.  In the interest of fairness, it may be possible to examine the Valuation Act with a view to determining whether it is possible to amend the Act in order to meet the requirements of clubs and voluntary bodies throughout the country who provide a valuable community service, keeping community spirit alive.  That is an important aspect in the climate we currently experience.  The degree to which people are prepared to give of their time and energy freely is something we consider from time to time, and recognition should be given to those who make such efforts.  We should also keep in mind the other kinds of relevant premises.  Local hotels are also in the business of providing facilities to the community at a concessionary rate and sometimes free as well.<\/p><p>  This matter is not simple, although I fully understand the motives behind Deputy Cowen's Bill.  I know he means well but this is not an easy issue to resolve.  No matter what is done, if we come down on the side of all the voluntary or community-based groups in the group, a fairly big slice will be taken from the revenue to local authorities.  If all local or community groups are not included as beneficiaries under legislation, there is an element of unfairness.  If we do as proposed in this Bill, there will also be concern from commercial entities such as hotels and bar owners who may feel under pressure because of the economic position which has prevailed over the past number of years.  We must be fair to them as well.<\/p><p>  There are a number of issues that must be brought into focus in considering this Bill and especially if it were accepted by this House.  As I suggested, we must examine aspects of equality, competition and valuations under the appropriate Act.<\/p><p>There is the question of whether we can determine and define the full extent of voluntary contribution, as opposed to the purely commercial contribution made in all the circumstances likely to arise.  I agree with the concept of this Bill but I do not know how it can be put into place because there is nothing easy about it.  I hope that as a result of this discussion it might be possible for the Minister of State, in consultation with the Opposition, to come to some arrangement which would recognise, on the one hand, the commercial and, on the other, the voluntary and community sides of this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400010#H00900","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404472800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>In all my time here I do not think I have seen Deputy Durkan finishing four and a half minutes before his allotted time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400011#J00200","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speech","time":1404472800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>He is going for one of those tickets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400011#J00300","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1404472800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>We should mark the occasion.  I too support and echo Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s sentiments on this Bill.  I have been involved with the GAA all my life, albeit in a club that does not have a bar on its premises.  There are many sporting clubs throughout the country, not only GAA clubs but all sorts of clubs, that have bar facilities which are open, at least some of the time, to the public.  It is reasonable to ask that such clubs not be rated on the full extent of their premises.  There are many aspects of those clubhouses that do not generate an income and it is unfair that rates apply to those aspects.  This Bill seeks to change that rating.<\/p><p>  Deputy Durkan is right to say that if the Bill is accepted as it is, it could have many knock-on effects, including on other commercial entities.  In rural Ireland there are many villages and towns that do not have much in the way of community facilities and quite often the local public house or hotel is the de facto community centre.  We do not want a change in legislation that would have a negative impact on such facilities.  There must be a means by which the valuation legislation could be changed that would allow for a more realistic rating system for voluntary and sporting organisations.<\/p><p>  I know the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is not directly responsible for the licensing laws.  I hold no torch for anybody in the licensed trade but I recognise that throughout the country public houses are important community facilities and that they are under severe pressure.  We have a crazy licensing system under which public houses pay their licences based on turnover, whereas the large multiples pay flat rate fees for beer, spirits and wine, regardless of how much they sell.  I said this to the previous Minister for Justice and Equality but have not yet spoken about it to the new Minister.  If we want to do something useful to protect a crucial part of the fabric of Irish community life, the public house, we have to change the way the licensing laws operate to ensure a level playing field.  I speak as one who does not frequent many public houses.<\/p><p>  I broadly support Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s proposal that there be some recognition of voluntary sporting and community organisations, part of whose buildings generate funds while the rest of the premises do not.  A suitable mechanism should be found to change the valuation laws to ensure these groups are not penalised as they are now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400011#J00400","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speech","time":1404472800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and commend Deputy Cowen on bringing it forward.  Its sentiments are very positive.  We need to reward volunteerism and community involvement and should not put anything in the way of that activity.  We need to tackle anything that would stand in the way of volunteerism and the work of community groups.  If it cannot be done through this Bill, Government needs to make it a priority to try to find a way to get around the problems that exist.  If all sides of the House could work together on it, that would be a positive step.<\/p><p>  Since 2011 I have been calling for reform of rates valuations.  The system of commercial rates calculation is archaic and needs to be updated.  The idea of basing rates for a business on the rental value of a property stands in the way of enterprise and is a barrier to entrepreneurship.  A business might need a large floor area, for example, where someone is fixing bicycles, and may pay a couple of thousand euro in rates per annum, even though it has small margins.  Upstairs, however, there might be an IT company in a small office, which makes profits of more than &euro;1 million per annum but pays a fraction of the commercial rate paid by the bicycle repair shop.  We should consider profitability as distinct from turnover.  Some people think rates should be paid on turnover but there is a huge difference between turnover and profitability.  Many businesses have large turnovers but small margins.  If that was changed, those who could afford to pay more would pay more.  There would have to be a cap on the commercial rates a business would pay but that would be a fairer way to do business.<\/p><p>  In recent years town centres have come under pressure and some are dying.  Many commercial units in town centres are lying empty.  A person considering starting a business would see that commercial rates would have to be paid no matter how the business performed.  That could be the difference between breaking even and making a loss or between being able to survive or not.  In most local authorities there is no flexibility, particularly if it involves an element of displacement.  This contributes to the death of many town centres where units remain empty.  We need to embrace and implement pro-enterprise policies that encourage people to start up and remain in business.  There should be fairness at the heart of the system of commercial rate valuation, which is not there now.<\/p><p>I do not think the current system is something we should continue.  We need to find a replacement system that is based on profitability.  We should be cognisant of the requirement not to undermine the income base.  I think a formula can be struck if the proper research and homework is done.  I commend Deputy Cowen on this legislation.  Surely a common-sense solution can be found in this area.  If we do some research and tweak the Bill a little, we can make a meaningful difference to the clubs in every constituency that are affected by this problem.  The Government needs to address this issue seriously to give these clubs the small bit of help they are looking for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400011#J00500","speaker":"1051","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404473400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Cowen's Bill which results from the frustration of many people about the inflexible and hard regime that the existing rates legislation imposes on many voluntary organisations, clubs and social structures.  During the more than 12 years I spent as a member of a local authority, not a week went by without a debate about how rates were being imposed and dealt with in each of the local areas.  I do not think the experience has been different in any local authority in the country.  I have a particular issue with the manner in which sports clubs are pitted against each other.  Affluent clubs that are involved in commercial activity are able to steal a march on clubs that are not involved in such activity.  In many towns and villages, clubs are competing against businesses that have to pay high rates and view the commercial side of GAA clubs and other sports clubs as a potential and reasonable threat.  Many people are quite willing to go to clubs for different social events and thereby avoid going to commercial facilities that pay rates in villages and towns.  It might be interesting to get the views of the head offices of large sporting organisations like the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU, which gave an interesting presentation to Members of the Oireachtas some time ago, on the imposition of rates on those organisation's larger structures.  It is worth noting how they were dealt with under the rates revaluation process.<\/p><p>  I would like any future legislation in this area to provide for all rates decisions to be referred back to local authorities.  I suggest that this should happen as part of the restructuring of local government.  I am not saying one sector or another should have an exemption from rates, as that is really not the way to go.  There is a reasonable expectation that community groups and businesses will be treated equally, at national or local level, under the rates legislation.  If the members of a local authority want to give some assistance to a particular group in the sporting or community sectors - I refer to a child care facility, for example - on the basis that it deserves some support, rather than giving the group an exemption by means of a behind-the-scenes arrangement under legislation, I would prefer if they were required to argue in favour of such a decision in public at a local authority meeting.  If the members of the local authority had to debate the loss of revenue that might result from such a decision, or indeed the additional revenue that might accrue from it, we would have a far more open process.  I feel much more strongly about this bigger issue.  Fundamentally, I do not like the current system which allows the Valuation Office to dictate the rates infrastructure to businesses and local authorities.  It would be far more transparent and democratic and for more predictable for businesses if each local authority had full decision-making powers regarding how rates are imposed.  If such a system were in place, we could let the cards fall where they may.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400012#K00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1404473400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>A couple of things occurred to me as I was listening to the contributions of Deputies on this legislation while waiting for the debate on the Electoral (Amendment) (Hours of Polling) Bill 2013, in my name, to begin.  Deputy Cowen's Bill, which is very welcome, has opened a discussion that we need to have.  It raises fundamental issues with regard to valuation legislation and licensing legislation.  It is said that there is more than one way to skin a cat.  Maybe we should look at the licensing laws because, in most cases, the licences that apply to clubs are the same as the licences held by the owners of commercial premises whose incomes depend fully on their businesses.  Such people have to pay staff and commercial rates, as everyone has said, whereas clubs generally have voluntary staff and shared overheads.  To be fair, Martin Cullen raised a valid point when he tried to contend with this dilemma on behalf of a previous Government in 2001.<\/p><p>  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The main point I want to make is that we should look at licensing laws in general.  Perhaps an alternative type of limited licence should be given to not-for-profit groups that have facilities that are not designed to be in competition with local licensed premises.  It could be like the system that prevailed when the courts were allowed to grant a limited number of pub licence extensions each year to facilitate late opening during festivals and other events.  I suggest that an amendment could be made to the licensing laws rather than the valuation law to resolve this difficulty.  Valuation law could be examined thereafter, when there would be no suggestion that licences granted to community sporting organisations could be used over time to allow them to compete with local commercial premises.<\/p><p>  I am aware of some clubs that removed the bar licences they used to have in their clubhouses because they were losing money.  This happened some years ago before the serious financial and economic downturn we experienced more recently.  They had to give up their licences, even though they had voluntary staff, because their turnover was not justifying the extra costs on the premises.  I am aware there are arrangements that allow local licensed premises to transfer their licences to clubs occasionally.  I am arguing that we should put as much focus on licensing legislation as on valuation legislation.  Deputy Cowen's Bill has started an interesting debate.  I do not think there is a Member of the House who is unsympathetic to the rationale and the motives behind it.  I think we should re-examine this matter.  Perhaps the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality or the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht or a combined sub-committee could do so.  I thank Deputy Cowen again.  I also thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400012#K00300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1404473400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cowen again for bringing this Bill before the House.  We have had a very useful debate with contributions from all sides.  The agreement we have reached in principle is very welcome.  An outcome like this shows it can be useful to have debates on these issues on a Friday.  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate.  Having attended many matches over the years, I am aware that the comfort of a bar in a community organisation like a GAA, rugby or soccer club can be very helpful, particularly on a cold Sunday afternoon after the voluntary activity outside has concluded.  Many of these places cannot be described as commercial operations in any real sense because they are quite small and are only used during the game and shortly thereafter.<\/p><p> At the heart of this, what people want is to ensure there is no additional financial penalty imposed on a club because it provides the types of facilities we have discussed at certain times.  There is an understanding that whatever goes on in these clubs does not compete with the full-time and entirely separate service delivered by a commercial operation.  The issues that have been raised will be teased out on Committee Stage and, no doubt, a wise, sensible and fair result will be found.  We look forward to that engagement.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, outlined, we hope the difficulties will be teased out in a practical and realistic manner to ensure no unfair burden is placed on clubs in the voluntary sector, which we agree are not commercial operations in the true sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400012#K00400","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404474000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Government's support for the thrust of the Bill and its willingness to let it go to Committee Stage for further discussion.  However, that must be set against the statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, that based on the advice from his officials, what is contained in the Bill cannot be done.  More accurately, of course, it will not be done.  His contribution reminded me of some of the commentary I have heard from members of Government outside the House in recent weeks in response to the local and European elections.  The problem, they tell us, is that their communications system is broken and their message is not getting across.  I agree there is an issue with the Government's communications system, but it is really to do with its ability to receive the messages coming from the Opposition and some of its own backbenchers.<\/p><p>  Were the Government to have more regard for those avenues of communication, there might be greater success awaiting it.  Ministers should, for their own sake, be mindful of what they are being told.  Issues arising from the so-called review and scoping exercise in regard to medical cards, for example, were flagged two years before a solution was proposed, and the warnings in that regard did not come only from this side of the House.  The Ministers for Health and Finance should bear collective responsibility for initiating that exercise rather than fingers being pointed at one person in particular, who might well be made the fall guy next week.  However, that is for another day.<\/p><p>  I will now respond to the specific points made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, in his response.  He said that because of the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904, it would be very difficult to subdivide clubs in terms of the different activities taking place within their facilities.  Where the premises is licensed to sell alcohol, for instance, he claimed there would have to be a mapping exercise, limits would supply and so forth.  In fact, all of that is catered for in the licensing legislation, which is under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality and applies where an application is made to the courts for a licence or renewal of a licence.<\/p><p>  It comes down to the question of whether or not there is a willingness and commitment on the part of those with responsibility to amend existing legislation based on evolving circumstances in our communities.  The Government either wants to do make those changes or it does not.  Ministers either want to instruct their officials or they do not.  They either want to take heed of representations from fellow Members on behalf of constituents or they do not.  As I often say, we in this House have the privilege of exercising the rights of citizens on their behalf.  To hide behind legislation is just not acceptable.  Deputy Bernard Durkan, in what Deputy John Paul Phelan observed was an uncharacteristically limited contribution, said that we must come to some sort of solution while being careful not to offend such and such a group.  In fact, it is up to Government to take its responsibilities at face value, either enact amendments or not and suffer or enjoy the consequences thereafter.  Deputy Anthony Lawlor spoke about how there must be local solutions and advised that clubs and organisations should sit down with county managers to reach an agreement based on local knowledge and whatnot.  He emphasised, however, that legislation cannot be amended.  That is gobbledegook.  A county manager or whomever is charged with responsibility to act on behalf of a Department or the State must be guided by enabling legislation.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, claimed that these proposals would have a grave impact on local authority funding.  Many Deputies have alluded to the problems that exist in regard to the rates system as we know it.  We all accept it is archaic, suited to a different era and must be overhauled radically and completely, being cognisant, as Deputy Brendan Griffin said, of the  role the current system has played in damaging the vibrancy of towns and villages throughout the country.  It goes without saying that all of this must be addressed.  Local government revenues have been destroyed in recent times in large part as a consequence of the lack of income coming into local authorities by way of rates.  The system must be overhauled in such a way that less will give us more, and my party and I have made recommendations to the relevant Departments in this regard.<\/p><p>  Again, the Government must take responsibility to address this issue or not address it.  If it does not want to do so, it should be honest about it.  However, members of this Government made certain commitments in this regard and in respect of upward-only rent reviews when they were in opposition and in the mouth of the last election.  The Taoiseach told us this week that, unfortunately, the legal advice precludes him from carrying out those duties.  I ask again what legal advice was available to him before the election that is not available to him after it?  Has the advice changed?  The bottom line is that rates will have to be altered to take account of turnover and, by extension, profitability.  They will have to be better aligned to commercial reality and commercial rents than they currently are.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, also referred to the remaining part of the facilities, premises and services offered by clubs and the potential for exemptions being put under threat where a section of a premises is exempt.  I cannot comprehend the point he is trying to make here.  If the issue is addressed in the first part of the Bill, it is automatically catered for in the latter part.  Again, we are back to the point that where there is a will there is a way.<\/p><p>  Several Deputies referred to the competition element and the impact on licensed premises in towns, villages and rural areas.  Nobody knows better than I do the difficulties that exist for the licensed trade.  I was reared in a pub and was glad to have the opportunities I had by virtue of the income that derived from it.  What we are proposing can be done while insulating local pubs from any impact on their trade.  It is not about poaching business; it is about freeing up local sports clubs.  There is a separate and more serious issue in regard to the pub trade.  If Government Deputies wish to address that issue in the way it should be done, they must examine the problems with the licensing laws and the below-cost selling taking place in multiples throughout the country which is leading to a spate of binge drinking and the social problems deriving from it.  The Government must examine the issue of the controlled and managed environment in which alcohol can be consumed in a licensed premises.  It must separate the revenue it is deriving from liquor sales from its social obligation to prevent the abuse of alcohol in our society from running out of control, which it is doing in many instances.<\/p><p> Deputy Durkan and others expressed concerns about the impact of what is proposed on that trade.  If he and others are serious about helping or assisting that trade, they are the issues they need to address.  As regards clubs and sporting organisations which have licensed premises attached to their facilities, it is mainly in large urban centres and mainly over the past 20 years that these have sprung up but the legislation on the registration of clubs was enacted in 1904.  It was never envisaged that those same clubs could be as vibrant and as important, from a commercial perspective, in providing the services and the facilities to their communities which are needed.  That is the point and to hide behind that Act is an abdication of responsibility.  <\/p><p> Deputies from Meath, Kildare, areas surrounding Dublin, Cork and elsewhere talked of support for the thrust of this legislation.  If they really support the thrust of it, they need to insist on the Government possessing a will to change.  I take with a pinch of salt the cheap jibes about the legislation in 2001 and the failure of the previous governments.  I do not carry a candle for previous governments, ten, 15 or 30 years ago.  I do not carry a candle for those who had the wherewithal to bring in a 1904 Act.  We all have a responsibility to be cognisant of the changing situation in our communities.  <\/p><p> As I said in my initial statement, I would ask that this Bill is not put on the shelf, that is it brought to committee and that the Minister with responsibility in this area engages with his officials with a will to amend the existing Act to accommodate the thrust of this proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400013#L00200","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1404474600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1404474600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>As this is a Private Members' Bill, it must, under Standing Orders 82A and 118, be referred to a select or special committee.

The Electoral (Amendment) (Hours of Polling) Bill 2013 sets down, in statute, fixed hours for voting in all elections and referenda at polling stations between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.  Given that the desire for political reform has never been stronger and the fact we have Friday sittings, which allow us to introduce legislation such as that just introduced by Deputy Cowen, I decided to avail of the opportunity to take an initial step to clarify some aspects of Irish electoral law.<\/p><p>The Title of this Bill is:<blockquote>An Act to set voting hours for D&aacute;il Elections, D&aacute;il Bye-Elections, Presidential Elections, European Parliament Elections, Local Government Elections and Referenda as being 7.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m. and for that purpose to amend the Electoral Act 1992, Presidential Elections Act 1993, Referendum Act 1994, European Parliament Elections Act 1997 and the Local Government Act 2001 and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote>Under the current law, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government sets the hours of polling at elections and referenda within certain parameters, that is, that it must be for at least 12 hours.  The existing law requires that voting be conducted between 7 a.m. and 10.30 p.m., for a period of not less than 12 hours.  <\/p><p>Increasing and maintaining voting hours would have a positive influence on a sizable section of the electorate who are sometimes described as &quot;circumstantial abstainers&quot;.  They have been estimated to make up two out of every three non-voters.  Some 15 hours of polling, a recently established trend, would certainly have a positive impact on the level of turnout among this section of the population, in particular in commuter counties.  Voter participation in all aspects of the democratic process is important for our democracy.  <\/p><p>I have seen instances where people who have been inadvertently or wrongly struck off the electoral register have turned up to vote, where people have been moved from one polling station to another one but there is not enough time to get to it and where people have found the polling hours have been curtailed.  I have seen how upset they get, and rightly so.  Increasing and maintaining voting hours will have a positive influence on the electorate on polling days.<\/p><p>Under the current law, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government sets out the hours at his or her discretion, subject to electoral law.  There is no provision for set or fixed hours of polling at Irish elections or referendums, which is not the norm in EU member states.  An inherent problem with the electoral process in Ireland is that there are 31 different Acts and more than 70 statutory instruments covering election law.  This makes it very difficult to follow.  Such a multiplicity of legislation is not desirable and, as such, there is a reasonable case to be made for legislative consolidation in this area to clarify the rules and to make the voting process more open, understandable and accessible for citizens and voters.<\/p><p>Increasing and maintaining voting hours would have a positive impact among that section of voters to whom I referred to earlier, in particular in commuter counties.  In recent years, in particular since 2008, a common trend has been established under different governments where the hours of polling have been 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on one day.  However, the current Government, in the 2012 children's rights referendum and in the 2013 Meath East by-election reduced the hours from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., respectively, which led to a certain amount of confusion.  As someone who was involved in the Meath East by-election, I remember people being very surprised they did not have that extra hour in which to vote.  It does not benefit any party or give any section of the electorate an advantage but the people who commute are generally the ones to lose out.  <\/p><p>Some counties have very high commuter populations, in particular counties Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and Louth which surround the capital.  For many citizens living in these areas, the most convenient time to vote is early in the morning on their way to work in the greater Dublin area or late in the evening on their way home from work.  When the hours of polling are cut at either end, this has a disproportionate negative effect on people living in these areas, thus hampering their ability to vote.<\/p><p>Voter turnout on recent days of polling has reached lows where hours of polling were cut.<\/p><p>In Donegal South-West during the children's referendum in 2012, turnout barely reached 24% while in Galway East it reached 28%.  I accept that other factors may have been responsible for the low turnout but the result of the election was more marginal than expected.  For that particular referendum, just over one third of eligible voters cast their votes nationally.  In the Meath East by-election in 2013, when the polling hours were reduced, the turnout did not even reach 40%.  Given the considerable focus on the by-election, the turnout was surprising.<\/p><p> The hours of polling as they stand are at the sole discretion of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government of the day.  When a Minister signs a polling order for an election or referendum, he or she can decide which hours to choose within the parameters of current electoral law.  Changing hours of polling from election to election, as is currently permitted, creates voter confusion and probably results in lower turnouts.  As such, there are inherent problems with our current system.<\/p><p> I will outline the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 seeks to amend section 96(1)(b) of the Electoral Act 1992 by replacing the existing text of the provision with the new text that provides that voting in a D&aacute;il election, including a D&aacute;il by-election, must be conducted between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.  Section 2 seeks to amend section 7(b) of the Presidential Elections Act 1993 by replacing the existing text of the provision with a new text which provides that voting in a presidential election must be conducted between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.  Section 3 seeks to amend section 13(b) of the Referendum Act 1994, by replacing the existing text of the provision with a new text which provides that voting must be conducted between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.  Section 4 seeks to amend section 10(1)(b) of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 by replacing the existing text of the provision with a new text which provides that voting in the European Parliament election must be conducted between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.  Section 5 seeks to amend section 26(2) of the Local Government Act 2001 by replacing the existing text of the provision with a new text which provides that voting in local government elections must be conducted between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.  Section 6(1) sets out the Short Title and section 6(2) provides that the collective citation of each Bill will be with the relevant collection of Acts.<\/p><p> The provisions in the Bill aim to consolidate all elections and referenda into a single governing piece of legislation dictating the hours of polling.  I would love to have been able to say we would dictate the day but I understand that is not reasonable, in so far as we cannot always be sure.  However, other countries do so.  Some countries even hold elections over two days.  That is something we could consider.  We seek to harmonise European law in many ways and in many European countries Saturday and Sunday are the chosen days for holding elections.  However, a few schools might be disappointed if we did that.<\/p><p> The Bill seeks to remove the confusion that currently arises by providing in law set hours as I outlined.  The Bill removes the Minister's discretion and places the hours of polling on a statutory footing.  We have parameters but we do not have definite hours.  As of May 2013, a total of 31 Acts concerned with electoral matters are in force and 77 related statutory instruments.  The franchise section of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which manages elections in the country, has no current plans to consolidate such complex legislation.  Such a move to consolidate this area would be warmly welcomed by the general public for reasons of access and transparency in the Irish electoral system.<\/p><p> I am very appreciative of the research carried out by the library and research service, providing details of the voting hours for elections across Europe.  The information is based on a survey of EU member states conducted through the European Centre for Parliamentary Research and Documentation, ECPRD, in September 2013.  The purpose of the Bill is a voter facilitation measure and will provide in statute for fixed hours of polling between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.<\/p><p> The Government has taken numerous steps to reform and improve the political system.  I believe the Bill I have published will positively contribute to the agenda of political reform.  The Bill is both important and timely.  The measures it contains are needed, and will make a very positive contribution to electoral turnout and participation, cut down on confusion and keep us in line with polling mechanisms across Europe.  I look forward to hearing the views of Members and to having positive discussions on the proposals and amendments contained in the Bill.  I am not sure whether it is allowed, but I thank Graham Butler and Brian Hunt for all their help in drafting the legislation.  I commend the Bill to the House <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400014#M00800","speaker":"1103","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404475200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I welcome the debate.  Voter participation continues to be a major challenge for everyone involved in the democratic process and any recommendations as to how we can stimulate greater participation is very much worthy of consideration.  This Private Members' Bill is part of the debate and, accordingly, the Government does not propose to oppose it.  The stated purpose of the Bill is to promote greater voter participation.  I agree with the view expressed in the explanatory memorandum that voter participation is a core part of our democracy but we are not necessarily convinced that fixing the polling hours only, as proposed in the Bill, will deliver the increased voter participation we all wish to see.<\/p><p>  The electoral code already provides for a fixed period of polling on all occasions.  A period of at least 12 hours between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10.30 p.m. must be provided.  Apart from that, it is then at the discretion of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government of the day to decide what additional hours, if any, are required.  For most elections in recent years, polling stations have been open for 15 hours between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.  We must consider whether we wish to lock ourselves into that arrangement for all future elections or if we wish to continue with the existing arrangements, which embrace a degree of flexibility around a minimum 12-hour polling period.<\/p><p>  Voter participation is a complex issue.  Undoubtedly, polling hours play a part, in particular for voters who, as Deputy Doyle outlined, live in the commuter belt, as I do.  I acknowledge his point.  There are other variables that influence people.  The issue is deeper than just one of polling hours alone.  Other factors that may come into play include possible alienation from the political system and the value people place on playing their part in the democratic process.  Of relevance also are the issues at stake in the particular election or referendum and people's interest in and understanding of those issues.  The reality is that voter participation is very likely to be influenced by a combination of factors.<\/p><p>  When we look at turnout figures at elections and referenda in recent years, there is no discernible positive correlation between polling hours and turnout.  I will outline a couple of examples.  Turnout at the Meath East by-election in March 2013 was 38.29% when polling stations were open for 13 hours.  Turnout in the autumn 2013 referendums was only marginally higher, at 39.17% and 39.15%, when polling stations were open for 15 hours.  Turnout at the most recent poll in the local election in the Ballybay-Clones local electoral area in County Monaghan was 58.49% when polling stations were open for 14 hours on a Saturday.  Turnout at the recent European Parliament elections was lower at 52.44%, when polling stations were open for 15 hours on a Friday.  When comparisons are made between the turnout at referendums in recent years, where polling stations were open for 15 hours from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., the turnout figures vary and considerably so in some cases.  For example, turnout at the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty in 2009 was 59% while turnout for the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad in October 2013 was 39.17%.<\/p><p>Turnout at the most recent general election was 69.9%, when polling stations were also open for 15 hours.<\/p><p> These examples suggest that factors other than polling hours are at play in determining the turnout.  One of these must be the interest of people in the issue at stake.  The highest turnout at any election or referendum since 2008 was the 69.9% turnout at the 2011 general election, which clearly captured the people's imagination.  The relative importance or significance of the issue was also reflected in the turnout figures at the two Lisbon treaty referendums.  The turnout at the referendum in June 2008 was 53.13%, when the people rejected the proposal, and it was 59% in October 2009 when the people accepted the proposal.  Both polls were for a period of 15 hours, so factors wider than hours alone influenced voter participation.<\/p><p> It is interesting to note the post-campaign research on voter turnout undertaken by successive referendum commissions.  According to the research undertaken following the autumn 2013 referendums, asked why they had not voted, 32% of those surveyed in the case of the abolition of the Seanad, and 30% in the case of the Court of Appeal, stated they had no interest in the issues and &quot;weren't bothered to vote&quot;.  The same research revealed that 25% of those surveyed were too busy to vote and 35% to 37% felt uninformed on the issues on which they were being asked to vote.  The post-campaign research undertaken after the children's referendum revealed that 19% of those surveyed had no interest, 26% were too busy and 34% felt uninformed.<\/p><p> While focussed on referendum issues, the post-referendum research highlights the wider issues at play when voter participation is being considered.  Successive Governments have been concerned to stimulate greater voter participation.  The referendum commission has the function of promoting awareness of referendums and encouraging citizens to vote.  Other measures include the display of a large print copy of ballot papers at polling stations to assist the visually impaired; provisions for photographs and party emblems on ballot papers; companion voting for persons with literacy difficulties; and support for election candidates posting election literature to voters.<\/p><p> The register of electors also has a role to play.  Clearly, one cannot vote if one is not on the register.  Over the years, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and registration authorities have taken initiatives to encourage more people to register.  Initiatives have been to make it easier for people to exercise their right to be on the register when election times come around.  Information leaflets on the registration process are available in 17 different languages on the Department's website.  Multilingual prompt cards are available to assist local authority staff and the various nationalities living in Ireland who wish to register to vote.  When an election or referendum takes place, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government places advertisements in the national newspapers.  These advise anyone who is not on the register to apply for inclusion in the supplement to the register so that they can vote at the impending election or referendum.<\/p><p> The current flexibility to decide what additional hours, if any, should be allowed for polling at elections and referendums has other benefits.  Polling stations were open for a period of 13 hours at the children's referendum in 2012.  The poll was taken on a Saturday between the hours of 9 a.m. and 10 p.m.  It was felt that the later start of 9 a.m. was appropriate to a Saturday when most people were not at work.  This approach generated savings of approximately &euro;640,000 on staff costs compared to the previous referendum, where the poll was taken between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.  In the Meath East by-election in March 2013, the poll was taken between the hours of 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. and savings of an estimated &euro;14,000 on staff costs were generated.  The scope to generate savings where the circumstances are appropriate to do so provides a further argument for retaining the current flexibility to fix polling hours on each occasion.<\/p><p> We need to continually examine and remove any unnecessary impediments to greater voter participation and to explore new ways of encouraging people to exercise their mandate.  The explanatory memorandum to Deputy Doyle's Bill suggests that the desire for political reform has never been more in demand.  I concur with this view.  Over the past three years, the Government has spearheaded much-needed electoral reform.  This has included a complete overhaul of the political funding and donations regime, provision for a reduction in the number of Deputies to be elected to the next D&aacute;il, revised rules for calling by-elections and reviews of electoral boundaries at all levels.  More recently, legislation to repeal the prohibition on people who are bankrupt from standing for election was enacted.  In total, seven separate pieces of electoral legislation have been enacted since the Government took office in 2011 and further reforms are planned.<\/p><p> The establishment of an electoral commission is a further significant reform to which the Government is committed.  The Constitutional Convention recommended that an electoral commission should be established and this has been accepted by the Government.  The chairman of the referendum commissions for the autumn 2013 referendums also suggested that an electoral commission could be tasked with examining the area of low voter turnout.  Establishing an electoral commission will involve detailed and considerable work.  The necessary policy analysis and preparatory work for the presentation of options is planned for advancement later this year.  I look forward to the debate on the Bill which, as I stated, the Government is not opposing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400015#N00200","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404475800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Like others, I compliment and commend Deputy Doyle on bringing forward the Electoral (Amendment) (Hours of Polling) Bill and acknowledge his contribution to the Government's commitments in this area, although it has not necessarily done what it said it would do.  The previous speaker outlined some minor amendments it has made and pointed to them as huge success.  I seek to differ.<\/p><p>  We support the Bill.  Standardising voting hours for all elections will help encourage easier access to the polls for voters.  The Minister of State alluded to the fact that much more needs to be done to engage the electorate.  He stated the Government is committed to establishing an independent electoral commission.  It should be established to oversee all elections and commit to increasing participation levels.<\/p><p>  The cynical broken promises on political reform by the Government have only deepened political disillusionment with the political process.  For our part we have published comprehensive proposals to reform the political system from local government up and fundamentally empower citizens.  While the proposition on polling hours is commendable, it is only a minor part of what must be a far bigger effort.  The 15 hour period is significantly above the European average, but this does not mean it is wrong.  It definitely needs to be set in stone.  The Bill could go further and set out a standard voting day, such as at the weekend, to encourage greater numbers of younger voters to participate.  This could and should be addressed by the Government on Committee Stage, having accepted the Bill this morning.  Polling hours go only a small way towards explaining the broader decline in voter participation.  Rising political disillusionment was evident not only in the by-election and some of the referendums, but also in the local and European elections in May.  This continues to reflect the broader malaise which exists in politics.<\/p><p>  The Government must move forward on the establishment of an independent electoral commission, having committed to it and recommitted to it again today, to oversee elections and drive on public engagement.  This is not the first time I have heard a Minister of State say the Government is committed to it, but it needs to be backed up with action.  In the immediate aftermath of the local and European elections, the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, spoke about this, and now that he is in Cabinet I am sure he will drive it.<\/p><p>  The series of broken promises by the Government on the so-called democratic revolution which was promised has further compounded the worrying trends in disengagement.  Based on being the constructive opposition we believe ourselves to be, we have tabled comprehensive proposals to seek to ensure politics is revamped from the bottom up, with citizens at the heart of the process.  The Government's failings on political reform need to be highlighted in this forum and many others.  I will not miss the opportunity on this occasion.<\/p><p>Fine Gael together with Labour promised a democratic revolution, but their record has been disappointing with a series of broken promises.  The voters entrusted the Government parties with the task of restoring the political system, as they promised to do, but they have been bitterly disappointed.  It has proved a disillusioning experience for them, as borne out in recent elections.<\/p><p> The Government launched a failed power grab in trying to abolish the Seanad and it fatally undermined its own banking inquiry by parachuting Government Members on to it when it did not get the majority it so wished.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400016#O00200","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404476400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>If Fianna F&aacute;il had not wrecked the economy, we would not need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400017#P00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1404476400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>That has fatally undermined that inquiry.

The Minister of State is not on his own in the little comment he just made in adding to people's impression on that.  That has come from the top down I am afraid and I cannot be surprised by any comments he might make in response to the accusation, which is not just my opinion but that of the vast majority of people.

I was under the impression that the polling stations for all recent elections had been open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.  However, I did not realise that the hours were changed for the children's rights referendum and the Meath East by-election.  It is a small but important point to bring certainty and avoid confusion.  It will enable people to do the most precious thing that democracy brings, which is to cast their votes.  As Deputy Doyle pointed out, it allows people in commuter areas and so on to get to the polling booths to vote.<\/p><p>I agree with some other speakers that considerably more needs to be done.  For a number of years since I got involved actively in politics, I have supported the idea of weekend elections.  I cannot see any reason for not holding elections on Saturdays.  One of the referendums was held on a Saturday to test the waters.  However, the only way really to test the waters is by holding a general election on a Saturday.  Referendums do not do that because the patterns in referendums are totally different from those in general or local elections.  Changes are also needed in how we deal with electoral registers and postal voting.  I was not present in the Chamber when Deputy Tony McLoughlin raised issues about things that happened with the electoral register in Sligo-Leitrim in the recent local elections and people who voted and did not vote.  I was amazed to read about it the following week in the <i>Leitrim Observer<\/i>.  It needs to be fully investigated because democracy is very precious and everything should be done to ensure it is carried out in a transparent and accountable way.  Some countries even have compulsory voting.<\/p><p>I very much support the Bill and I suggest that many other things should also be done.  I nearly fell off my chair listening to Deputy Cowen, for whom I have good respect, talking about the Government's lack of reform.  I was only elected in 2007, but I have followed events during all those years and I have doubts about the credibility of his party.  It has a Bill to build democracy from the bottom up.  In the past 20 years it destroyed it from the top down.  The son of the late Tom Gilmartin appeared on a recent &quot;Late Late Show&quot;.  Based on the picture that painted of how the country was run over those years, it was not political reform that was being practised in those years, but political corruption.  I will leave it at that, but I was absolutely astounded.<\/p><p>It is a pity to raise that in a debate like this.  We are here on a Friday because of some political reform that has been carried out.  We can argue that all sides make mistakes and may not do enough or whatever it is.

The Bill would remove that uncertainty.<\/p><p>It is a sensible proposal whereby people would know that for all elections, polling hours would be between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.  This undoubtedly would have an effect on people, would give them greater certainty and would ensure that those who live in commuting counties in particular would have an opportunity to vote.  The proposal in this Bill is to have 15 hours of voting, which would undoubtedly have a positive effect.<\/p><p> If one considers the position in other countries around Europe, the actual day of the week on which voting will take place and the hours thereof are established in law.  The issue of postal voting also must be considered, as the provisions in Ireland are extremely strict and rigid.  However, if one examines how postal voting operates in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe, an opportunity should be there for people who, through no fault of their own are unable to be present on the day of an election to vote.  Advance voting is another tool used by other countries and may be something the Minister of State could consider.<\/p><p> If one considers the issue of voting and turnout, the 50% participation rate achieved in the most recent local and European elections is not exactly great.  It is not a ringing endorsement of people's opinion on politics that they have not engaged fully in the political process.  There are problems and difficulties in this respect and this is why the Bill states that at present, Ireland lacks an independent electoral commission.  This obviously is a major oversight that must be addressed by the Government.  If one seeks to improve democratic participation, a full-time and adequately resourced electoral commission will educate and explain to people how important it is to vote.  It will explain that the voters have the ultimate say as to what type of government they want and that they should engage adequately in that process.  In his opening remarks, Deputy Doyle mentioned that the turnout in the Meath East by-election, for which the voting hours were reduced, did not even reach 40%, which obviously is quite worrying.  Were an electoral commission to be set up in the immediate future, perhaps it should examine the issue of voting over weekends.  Were elections to be held over Saturday and Sunday, people would have full opportunity to exercise their vote and this might help matters.  However, the proposed hours, from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., are very sensible.<\/p><p> An electoral commission obviously would examine the issue of voter registration and the personal public service, PPS, number system appears to be the best way to deal with it.   Were the political will there, the Minister would deal with the already-existing privacy concerns regarding the Department of Social Protection in this area, in order that information that already is being captured on one system could be used on the other system.  All Members have encountered constituents who have been extremely disappointed by not being able to vote at election time.  Such people have approached Members and basically could not understand why they were not on the electoral register.  I believe that having one's personal vote linked to a PPS number would help the situation.<\/p><p> If the Government is serious about political reform, it must give consideration to same-day elections for the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to give real legitimacy to the Upper House.  The referendum on the Seanad was held recently and the people have decided on that.  However, every member of the public quite properly should have a say in the Seanad election, which should be taken a lot more seriously than is the case at present.  The Minister could easily initiate an order to the effect that this election take place over the same period as the general election to the D&aacute;il.  An electoral commission also should be charged with sending out to voters one item of communication that would outline the ballot papers on which the voters actually will be voting.  This perhaps also might include a small biography of each of the candidates because people are very unsure.  Recently, during the local and European elections, voters did not know which candidates were taking part in which elections.  There is complete duplication and waste of money at present in respect of the litir um thoghch&aacute;n.  While I am glad that only one such letter is going to each household from each candidate, there is a series of communications from each candidate to each household.  This is extremely costly and as my colleagues in the Reform Alliance have suggested, there is an opportunity to achieve economies of scale in this regard.  This is a matter that must be considered by an electoral commission.<\/p><p> I also wish to raise the practice of postering, which is a huge health and safety issue.  As a candidate, one dreads being obliged to organise and supervise this practice.  No doubt all Members will have heard stories of near-misses involving people on ladders seeking to erect posters in the most difficult of locations.  This is another issue that an electoral commission could examine and perhaps it could put into place what happens in other countries, such as France or Spain, where there are designated billboards on which a poster is put up for each candidate and that, more or less, is it.  Such a practice would make more sense and the public probably would accept it because the waste of money that is involved here is very annoying for the public.  It is a concern because some people are of the opinion that the State is subsidising and paying for postering for candidates, which is not fully the case.<\/p><p> The largest six political parties received almost &euro;13 million in taxpayers' money last year.  Most of the political parties - certainly the two largest - have made a commitment that their political party accounts will be made available online and that the public will be able to view the income, expenditure and balance sheets of each political party.  Unfortunately, this has not happened, as the political will is not or has not been there in this case.  This is another bone of contention the public has, as does the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  It appeared recently in the media that despite legislation being enacted to the effect that political parties would publish their audited accounts for 2014, the current Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has refused to sign the guidelines regarding the implementation, as set out by SIPO, regarding the publication of annual accounts by parties.<\/p><p> People seek transparency and accountability and one must ask the question continuously as to why people are not engaging in the political system.  They are concerned that there is too much privacy and too much concealing of information as to what is going on within politics in general.  There is another issue whereby political parties are accepting moneys for Members who are no longer members of those political parties.  Although a series of amendments were put to the Minister in that regard, sadly he did not accept them.  At the end of each calendar year, political party funding and leader's allowance funding should be based on the members of each party who are present at the end of each calendar year.  That is a fairer way of doing business, rather than the current position.<\/p><p> Overall, I accept and support this sensible Bill introduced by Deputy Doyle.  As the Deputy mentions that his proposed legislation contains measures affecting five different Acts, the Bills Office or those involved in drafting might give consideration to creating consolidated legislation in the future regarding the electoral Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400017#P01500","speaker":"1182","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404477000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill and commend Deputy Doyle on it.  The democratic process is very important and voter participation in our democracy is of paramount importance.<\/p><p>I support the idea of having fixed polling and a fixed polling day, for example, a Saturday or Sunday or perhaps even a Friday.  This issue should be discussed and Deputy Andrew Doyle is to be commended on providing Deputies with an opportunity to do so. <\/p><p> Previous speakers discussed the process of registering electors.  I recall walking in New York one Saturday and being struck by how engaged people were with a registration drive being held by the Democratic Party on a city street.  Perhaps we could hold such registration drives as a way of engaging with people and ensuring the electoral system is open and transparent.  The Bill offers us an opportunity to discuss these issues. <\/p><p> I am disappointed by the tenor of the remarks made by Deputy Cowen on political reform.  This Government has introduced more political reform than Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administrations introduced in a decade and a half.  I challenge the Deputy to debate political reform with me in any forum.<\/p><p> I hope the debate on this Bill will include a discussion on the location of polling stations.  I will pose a question on which I do not have a fixed opinion.  Should we use schools as polling stations or would it be preferable to use other premises for that purpose?  <\/p><p> The day that is set for polling is important.  The holding of by-elections on a Saturday was cited and the Minister of State noted the high turnout in a recent election in the Ballybay-Clones electoral district where the polls were open for 15 hours.  From speaking to many polling clerks and presiding officers, I am aware that election days are long.  Nevertheless, we must ensure that polling hours are sufficiently flexible to accommodate those living in the commuter belt, urban centres and rural areas as well as those who are working.  We must also address the fact that people who are on holidays on polling day or travelling abroad for work reasons cannot vote.  <\/p><p> The Constitutional Convention, in its meetings in 2013, discussed the D&aacute;il electoral system.  The convention was an important element of political reform, to which Deputy Cowen did not refer, which increased citizens' engagement with the democratic process.  The Government has an obligation to respond to its reports and has already done so in some cases.  A proposal to establish an independent electoral commission received 97% support at the convention, while the option of extending polling hours and increasing the number of polling days received 89% support.  It is interesting that the majority of citizens in attendance wanted to have longer polling days and an independent electoral commission.  The Government's political reforms include its proposal to establish an electoral commission, the introduction of gender quotas, a reduction in the number of Deputies and the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad, which was defeated by the electorate.  The introduction of Friday sittings gives Deputies an opportunity to discuss legislation proposed by individual Deputies, including this Bill on the electoral system.<\/p><p> I support the Bill and hope the Government will go further by reviewing the days and times of polling.  Before it proceeds to the next Stage, I ask the Government to consult presiding officers and polling clerks to ascertain their views on how to reform and improve the polling system.  Many of these men and women have sat at desks in polling stations over a number of electoral cycles and will have views on the issue.  The Bill is worthy of support and I commend Deputy Doyle on its introduction.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400018#Q00200","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404477600,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I welcome this important Bill and thank Deputy Andrew Doyle for the work he has done in preparing it.  The purpose of the legislation is to try to connect people to various aspects of the electoral system.  People are turning off elections.  In the past, people took a great interest in politics and knew who their local politicians were.  Politics has become much more controversial and assumed \"X-Factor\" characteristics in recent years.  The Government and all politicians must try to ensure that everyone aged 18 years and over - some argue the voting age should be reduced - gets out and votes.<\/p><p>  I used to be a member of a traders' organisation in my home town.  We tried to hold meetings at times that allowed traders to attend.  For example, we used to hold breakfast meetings and sometimes met at 6 p.m. on week days or 8.30 a.m. on Sundays.  Regardless of what time we set, it never suited some people.  I always made the point that if we offered the people who never came an incentive of &euro;1,000 to attend, they would show up at 3 p.m. on Christmas Day if necessary.  This ambivalence applies also to elections.  Polling hours of 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. or extending polling to two days would still not suit some people.  An incentive is required.  In some countries, people are penalised for not exercising the right to vote.  We must examine all options.  <\/p><p>  The electoral register has been skewed throughout the 15 year period I have been in politics.  Many of the names on the register should not be on it and many people are not on it who should be on it.  I do not have a solution to the problem.  I am often asked why a person is not on the electoral register given that he or she has been living in the same house since birth.  When I ask whether the person has received a letter about the electoral register, I am told that he or she did not respond to it.  We all have a responsibility to check whether our name features on the electoral register.  Before the most recent election, I had to check whether my own name was on it because I had been telling everyone else to do so and would have been embarrassed if my name was not on it. <\/p><p>  Having represented two counties, I am aware that it was much easier to obtain a postal vote in one county than in the other.  This issue has not been addressed.  People who are on holidays on election day should not be entitled to a postal vote.  If an election is called, people should be able to work around their holidays.  While I have not considered the issue at any great length, I fear that people would simply apply for a postal vote and go on holiday.  <\/p><p>   It is cheap to argue that the Government has not introduced electoral reform.  My home town of Boyle had the only town council in my constituency.  The Government has abolished town and urban councils and decided, in the interests of fairness to areas with larger populations, to reduce the number of seats on Roscommon County Council from 28 to 18 seats.  The number of seats on the country council in Leitrim, which I also represented, has been reduced from 22 to 18 and across the border in County Sligo the number of seats on the council has been cut from 25 to 18.  These changes affected the number of councillors from my party who were elected as some councillors with a rural base did not secure a sufficient number of votes to get elected. <\/p><p>  The Government has introduced significant electoral reform and lost a large number of councillors as a result.  For example, the Fine Gael Party holds only ten council seats in three county councils in which it previously held 30 seats.  While I accept that the electorate voted against the Government parties, the reforms we introduced did not help the re-election prospects of many councillors.<\/p><p>The number of Deputies in the D&aacute;il will be reduced from 166 to 158 following the next election.  In order to reduce the number further, a referendum will be required.  I currently represent the constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim.  After the next general election, it will be the Roscommon-East Galway constituency.  I am looking forward to meeting the lovely people in east Galway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400019#R00200","speaker":"1085","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404478200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Tuam.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400020#S00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1404478200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>As I tell everyone, I am now a great Galway hurling supporter.

It is the first step in reforming how we run elections and I congratulate him on it.<\/p><p>  I am of the view that a 15-hour working day is very long.  While I tend to agree with the point Deputy Buttimer made regarding how we, as practising politicians, are used to dealing with presiding officers and clerks at polling stations at general elections, local elections, presidential elections, European elections and referendums, we must ensure that the hours during which polling stations remain open are uniform and standardised in order that people might have an expectation as to the period during which they might cast their votes.  I agree with other speakers in the context of having a set day for polling.  I have always supported the idea of polling at weekends.  It may perhaps be the case that Friday is the best day for polling but in continental Europe elections often take place over two days, namely, Saturday and Sunday.  The practice of holding elections on Tuesdays or Thursdays disenfranchises people and it should not continue.<\/p><p>  I wholeheartedly support the commitment in the programme for Government in respect of establishing an electoral commission.  The electoral register in my area - I am sure the position is the same elsewhere - is in pretty poor condition.  The official turnout in recent elections was between 50% and 60% but I believe the real figure is much higher than that.  The names of quite a number of people on electoral registers should not be because those individuals may be deceased or they may have moved.  In addition, people's names are on registers in several locations.  In the past, rate collectors who knew the streets in their parishes and neighbourhoods very well would ensure that the names of people who turned 18 were placed on the electoral register.  That system worked very well.  The current state of the register is a symptom of the way in which society has changed.  It is often the case that we do not know our neighbours as well as we would have in the past.  The position of local authority rate collector is now dormant and, as a result, electoral registers in many areas are no longer fit for purpose.<\/p><p>  We often refer to the need for joined-up thinking in government.  Everybody's official information is known by one or other arm of the State.  It should not, therefore, be beyond the bounds of possibility that when a person turns 18 years of age, his or her name should be placed on the electoral register.  I do not understand why that cannot happen.  When people move location, obviously there is an onus on them to inform the authorities that they have done so.  If individuals make the effort to place their names on the electoral register at their new location, they are often placed on a supplemental register.  When the next election or referendum is held, upon arriving at their local polling stations they discover that their names are no longer on the register.  Some of them may still be listed on the register in the areas in which they previously lived but, worst of all, others have discovered that they are not listed anywhere and, as a result, they do not have a vote at all.  I have come across quite a few cases of this on recent polling days.<\/p><p>  Deputy Terence Flanagan referred to extending postal voting.  He is absolutely correct.  As is often the case, a family may have booked a holiday months in advance and then a polling day, which clashes with their trip, is announced at only three or four weeks' notice.  Through no real fault of their own, that family will be disenfranchised.  It should not be beyond the bounds of possibility that people who are abroad, whether for work or a holiday, should be able to vote by post.  I wish to recount an anecdote that is strange but true.  The annual pilgrimage from the Diocese of Ossory to Lourdes clashed with the two most recent general elections.  I have never taken part in this trip-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400020#S00400","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speech","time":1404478200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>The Deputy should go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400020#S00500","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1404478200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>-----but perhaps I will do so in advance of the next election.  Over 100 people, whether it was those with illnesses and disabilities, their supporters or the volunteers accompanying them, were disenfranchised on both occasions because the two events coincided.  Deputy Feighan made an interesting comment regarding the difference between local authorities.  In that context, I am puzzled as to why people in Kilkenny who volunteer to work on the pilgrimage to which I refer are not designated in the same category as other workers and are not, therefore, entitled to a postal vote.  No leeway has been granted in this regard in the past two general elections, which is wrong.  It is for the reasons I have outlined that I believe postal voting should be extended.<\/p><p>  I wish to reflect on some of the comments made by Deputy Cowen.  I found it somewhat more than ironic when the Deputy, who is a member of Fianna F&aacute;il, treated us to a lecture on political reform.  There is no one from the party in the Chamber at present to respond to what I have to say but I will proceed in any event.  Anyone with even a vague knowledge of Irish history, not just in the past 15 years but since the foundation of the State, will realise that Fianna F&aacute;il's only significant effort at political reform was to try to abolish proportional representation.  It tried to do this on two occasions and failed on both.  There might be some merit in changing the system of proportional representation but Fianna F&aacute;il wanted to introduce a first-past-the-post system for parliamentary elections such as those which exist in Britain and north of the Border.  This was an attempt by that party to rig the system in order to ensure that it would remain in office in perpetuity.  I am not prepared to listen to lectures on political reform from Deputy Cowen or anyone else in his party.<\/p><p>  Deputy Cowen or someone from the Fianna F&aacute;il press office may be watching these proceedings.  If so, perhaps they might respond to what I am about to say.  The Deputy made a very interesting comment and I am seeking to establish whether he made it in a personal capacity or as his party's spokesperson.  He said the banking inquiry is now fatally flawed as a result of the Government adding two additional members to it.  That is certainly not the impression being given by Fianna F&aacute;il's representatives on the inquiry.  We would all agree with the pious platitudes expressed by other members of that party to the effect that said inquiry should take place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400020#S00600","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speech","time":1404478200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>The Deputy is straying slightly from the topic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400020#S00700","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1404478200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I am just replying to the very serious political point - in fact it went beyond politics - Deputy Cowen made about the banking inquiry being fatally flawed.<\/p><p>He might avail of the opportunity at some stage to explain whether this is a personal view or that of his party&rsquo;s on the workings of the banking inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400020#S00800","speaker":"966","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404478800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Andrew Doyle for bringing forward this legislation which would make it statutory for polling for all elections in the State to take place between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes it should go further, however, with voting on weekends which would provide people who wish to vote with a longer timeframe within which to exercise their democratic right.  It means that people can vote before going to work and there is no longer the same pressure on people to get to polling stations.<\/p><p>  One argument in favour of extended opening hours for polling stations is that it would increase turnout.  That has not actually been the case, however.  Turnout in the 1997 general election was 76.5% while turnout in the last general election when polling stations opened at 7 a.m. was 70%.  However, this should not be the determining factor in whether there should be longer hours.  It is more to do with facilitating people in exercising their franchise.  Whether they choose to do so or not is up to themselves, but voting ought to be made as user-friendly as possible.<\/p><p>  Several other issues might be considered to widen the democratic nature of elections.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the extension of the franchise to all citizens over the age of 16.  People of that age are already fully participating citizens through the education system - some are even working - and have a valid right to be consulted through the democratic process by being allowed to vote in local, European, general and presidential elections, as well as in referenda.  We would also like to see people living in the Six Counties being allowed to vote in presidential and Seanad elections.  After all, we had a President from Belfast, Mary McAleese, who it is generally agreed did a good job.  My party nominated Martin McGuinness as our candidate in the last presidential election.  It should be noted that successive Presidents, including Michael D. Higgins, have said they are Presidents for all of the Irish people.<\/p><p>  There is also a strong case to be made for providing emigrants with some means of exercising their franchise.  Up to 115 states, including nearly all developed democracies, do so.  Indeed, we are all familiar with seeing news reports of American citizens and citizens of other states who are living here going to their embassy in Dublin to cast their ballot.  Surely, some similar mechanism to allow enfranchised emigrants to vote could be introduced.<\/p><p>  The electoral register is totally inaccurate.  I noted I could only get the register 95% accurate on the streets on which I lived as a councillor previously and as a Deputy.  Many adults are not on it or are on it at the wrong address while other individuals are on it twice and three times.  Local representatives will bring it to the attention of officials when they note someone on the register three times.  However, it can take some time to rectify it.<\/p><p>  The only feasible way of registering voters is through the use of PPS, personal public service, numbers.  While I accept data protection issues come into play, there must be some way technically of placing the electoral roll number next to the PPS number without compromising data protection regulations.  Such a system would also ensure people automatically come on to the register when they reach their eighteenth birthday.  I noted during the recent local elections cases of people who were registered to vote for years, who have not moved house or out of the country but were taken off the register.  Introducing a PPS-based system would ensure that people did not have to register proactively themselves and would encourage more young people to vote.  The use of PPS numbers would also help to safeguard against electoral fraud by ensuring each person on the register had a unique identification number and was only on the register once.<\/p><p>  We need to establish an independent electoral commission to be responsible for voter registration and voter education.  That could be improved by making the electoral and overall political system an integral part of the existing CPSE, civic, social and political education, course in second level schools.  That depends on individual teachers as some have an interest in it and others do not.  The commission would have the task of maximising voter turnout and numbers contesting seats at all tiers of representation including the development of programmes for proactive enfranchisement of and increased participation by traditionally under-represented groups.<\/p><p>  Such a commission could also take on responsibilities held by the Constituency Commission, the Standards in Public Office body, SIPO, and the Referendum Commission.  The original function which required the Referendum Commission to set out the pros and cons of a referendum proposal should be restored.  We have all seen the contentious issues that have been put to referendum in recent years and are familiar with the claims, justified in my view with regards to some of the European referenda, that the allegedly unbiased information provided to citizens was anything but unbiased.<\/p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in also supports the introduction of larger seven-seat constituencies while keeping the same number of Deputies.  It would ensure smaller parties and independent candidates were provided with a better opportunity to win seats.  Indeed, the Labour Party would have performed far worse than it did in the recent local elections had there not been such multiple-seat wards.  Alongside larger constituencies, there might also be consideration given to the introduction of a partial list system based on proportional representation.  List systems are common in other Europe states.  We are fond of saying we should do things the European way.  Here is one thing we could do the European way.  Such constituencies allow party support to be measured simply on the basis of party preference rather than being totally influenced by the individual candidate.  That might go some way in reducing the so-called &ldquo;parish pump&rdquo; influence which many people criticise as a factor in Irish politics.<\/p><p>  I repeat my support for this Bill which, given its author, I assume will have the support of the Government and that the recent practice of opening polling stations between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. will be placed on a statutory basis.  We should go further and have voting on weekends to facilitate students and those working away from home.  A simple system could be put in place to allow people on holiday to vote too.  In the case of local elections, the election year is known in advance.<\/p><p>For example, if one had booked holidays for 23 May this year and was not here to vote, one should have been able to visit one's council offices several weeks beforehand and present one's identification to a franchise officer.  The officer should have been able to check that one was on the register and then remove one's name from the register that goes to the polling stations, indicating that one had already voted.  It should not be beyond our abilities to do it.  I am sure everybody here met people who could not vote in the recent election because they were away on the day.  If such a person is a supporter and would have voted for one, it is terrible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400021#T00200","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404479400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank the author of today's Bill.  It is a good debate in which we are all interested because it is so important to us, to democracy and to our communities.  If we are serious about people participating in politics, it is vital we get it right.  The Minister mentioned greater voter participation, with which we all agree.  The different parties have all tried to enhance the process by getting more people involved and encouraging more people to register.  I commend the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, which does much outreach work with marginalised groups, trying to get them on the register and encourage them to vote.  In my constituency it has reached out to the new Irish, brought them along, had guards there and got people registered.  It makes people feel part of the process and explains issues to them.  Sometimes candidates are brought in and debates held.  It has helped create interest among those groups.<\/p><p>  Some speakers raised the issue of locating polling stations in schools.  Depending on one's generation, for many people school was not a very happy period in their lives.  I have met people on the doorsteps who are not happy, particularly those who have literacy problems.  There used to be a garda on the door.  Voters have to go in and present identification, and for people who have never voted, it is not very welcoming.  It would be more welcoming to have polling stations in the community centres where people probably go more regularly rather than the schools.  We need to open up the debate on the best location.<\/p><p>  During the last election, the Holy Rosary School in Ballycragh was a polling station, but on the day of the election the school was a building site.  People who had difficulty walking or who were in wheelchairs could not access the polling station.  Another school in D&uacute;n Laoghaire had similar access problems.  Eventually, local residents put together a home-made ramp, while the staff said they could not get involved for health and safety reasons.  There was no way to access the Holy Rosary School in Ballycragh.  A sign pointed through a hedge, which led to a gravel footpath.  It sounds like something from &quot;Father Ted&quot; but I have photographs of it.  After dark, there was no lighting on this long path.  As a result, some people could not vote.  I tried to telephone the sheriff's office but could not get through.  I sent an e-mail and he sent an apologetic reply.  He should not have apologised to me but to the people who did not have a vote.  I said in future the venue should have been inspected the day before the election.  Although it had been promised that the work would have been carried out, it was not.  It is a scandal and should never happen, and we need to put in structures.<\/p><p>  The Minister talked about alienation from the political system and mentioned the Lisbon treaty.  There were other factors in this issue.  Because of the &quot;No&quot; vote there was a lot of media coverage and everybody was coming out.  It was like &quot;Chicken Little&quot;, with people predicting that the sky would fall.  There was a larger turnout, and many people who voted the first time did not vote the second time because they questioned how often one had to say &quot;No&quot; to the proposal.  Such matters affect people.  There is a disconnect between society and politics.<\/p><p>  Speakers mentioned the electoral register.  In the 2007 election in which I lost my seat, in west Tallaght alone, 4,500 people, including whole estates, were removed from the register.  Many of us who were active in the election went to the council to ask who it had removed from the register, but were told it could not tell us.  We went to the Minister of the day, there was a discussion in the House, and he was instructed that we were to get a list.  While 2,000 people were put back on the register, 2,500 were left off.  The register is supposed to be updated, not have people removed from it.  This is still a problem.  If someone knocks on a door and nobody is there, in some cases the person or household can be removed from the register.  We all know of cases of families being removed from the register, and they usually find out on polling day.<\/p><p>  I recently had a bizarre case of a Traveller woman who was to vote for the first time in her life.  Her name was Elizabeth Ann, but because her identification gave her name as Ann Elizabeth, the presiding officer did not allow her to vote.  It was crazy.  In another case, a young man's polling card went to the wrong address and, again, there was a problem because the identification did not match the address on the register.  One can go to the presiding officer and argue with him or her, but these are simple issues.  We want to encourage more people to get involved.<\/p><p>  At the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA, people from the British jurisdictions told me how important the postal vote was to their system.  We have gone the opposite way, and it is more and more difficult to get a postal vote.  People talked about holidays and so on.  They have much more flexibility in their system, and people can vote by proxy.  They have tried to adapt their system to make it more voter friendly, and we need to do the same.  Others spoke about the importance of the diaspora vote, which was highlighted by the Constitutional Convention.  The figures on establishing an electoral commission were interesting.  If we had an electoral commission, it would instruct each local authority to inspect each polling site to be used in the next election and, if it were found to be unsuitable, arrange an alternative.  There are many halls and centres and we could be flexible.<\/p><p>  I thank the Deputy for moving the Bill.  While I agree with the Minister that there needs to be greater time flexibility, a fixed time and day would be helpful.  In past elections it has been difficult for students or workers to return to their constituencies.<\/p><p>Most presiding officers reckon the 7 a.m. starting time is not really much use to shift workers and it would be more helpful if polls opened at 6.30 a.m.  That would provide some leeway, although it would lead to longer days.  Some say that 10.30 p.m. should be the closing time and I would prefer the polling day to be earlier rather than later.  It is just my opinion but the 7 a.m. start does not really help matters.<\/p><p> I thank Deputy Doyle for his Bill and this should be the start of a debate rather than the end.  We must keep working to refine this process.  I am glad we are having a debate on this for the first time, and I say &quot;well done&quot; to the Bill's proposer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400022#U00200","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404480000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Andrew Doyle and commend him on putting forward this Bill on polling times, as giving certainty to voters on the issue is very important.

For example, those in the farming sector essentially work from dawn to dusk and may not know if a polling station will open at 8 a.m., 8.30 a.m., 9 a.m. or 7 a.m., and they may not know if it is closing at 9 p.m. or 10 p.m.  Giving absolute certainty on the opening and closing times of polling stations in all elections would be particularly helpful for those who work the land, especially in summer, but also for some of the communities I represent, including the fishing communities.  Those working times are dictated by issues such as tides, and they would welcome greater certainty about polling times.<\/p><p>This may bring a very long day for polling staff but my experience, having spoken to polling clerks and presiding officers, is they are quite happy to work the long hours the day presents.  What makes their job difficult are the problems described by many previous speakers, and unfortunately in every election I have participated or been a part of over a number of years, we have always got phone calls, texts and Facebook updates from people who on going to vote discovered they were not on the electoral register.  With one unfortunate case in my area, a person moved but the entire family of eligible voters was struck from the electoral register, causing major distress for a family that never failed to vote.  The idea that the responsibility is on individual electors to check the register is valid but the operation of the electoral register leaves much to be desired.<\/p><p>There is an opportunity with the new regime for water charges to change this process.  We have not had a database of households in this country since 1977 but we now have one from the household charge, the non-principal private residence and properties charges, as well as the introduction of water charges.  Not only do we have a database of households but we also have a record of people aged over or under 18 in those households.  It beggars belief that with every engagement that the citizen has with the State, through the health services or other agencies, there is no part of the application process or a box to tick so that we could cross-reference the engagement with the franchised offices of the various local authorities or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We could include or exclude people on an ongoing basis if we had such a process rather than having to spend so much time and resources in the approach to elections advertising that if people are not on the register, they cannot vote.  We can act on this through social media and other avenues but cross-referencing State agencies and Departments with the franchise offices must be improved.  We should be able to achieve this through the new local authority charge processes that will be fleshed out over a number of months.<\/p><p>The alignment of European elections with local elections must continue, and I shudder to think what would be the turnout for European elections if they were not aligned to local elections.  Perhaps we could go further in securing greater participation in European elections.<\/p><p>I feel strongly about how polling cards are distributed.  They arrive when literature from every candidate is coming through the letterbox, along with publicity post circulars about hearing aids and methods of discarding clothes.  The polling card is indistinguishable from such junk mail, so there would be greater engagement if the polling card arrived in an envelope addressed to a particular voter.  Far too often, the polling card is put in the same filing cabinet as all the other junk mail coming through the letter box, so when people are looking for them, they may be unsure if they were received and, as a result, whether they are on the register.  This is also an issue for those who are visually impaired.  How do those who are visually impaired or totally blind know they have a voting card?  Could we not do something to help them, like send an embossed envelope?  That would help them to know that what is in their hand is not a request to dispose of old clothes or a great offer for new hearing aids but rather a polling card.<\/p><p>A Minister of State, Deputy Ring, yesterday announced the allocations of the sports capital grant, making the point that each area received the money on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis.  Although it may seem facetious, if the likes of the sports capital grant were allocated on the basis of voter turnout, I wonder if it would open a better discussion about the disadvantages of poor voter participation.  Other countries have different methods, including mandatory voting or the imposition of financial penalties on those who cannot give a reasonable justification for not showing up at a polling station.  Relatively speaking, we do not have poor voter turnout but it is always heartening and it provides a greater mandate if there is strong voter participation.  Anything that can be done in that regard should be considered.<\/p><p>I was disappointed to note the tenor of Deputy Cowen's contribution, and as his party's spokesperson for the environment, he could have been a bit more proactive about his thoughts for electoral reform, especially if he had given a minute to addressing the Bill introduced by Deputy Doyle.  One could easily argue that Deputy Cowen's party has been the least transparent, and it put a bulldozer through freedom of information legislation in recent years.  It decimated local authorities when it abolished household rates in 1977, and it will take 75 years for local authorities to catch up and provide modern services.  Does Deputy Cowen believe his party has a greater claim to democracy than the current Government?<\/p><p>I echo the sentiments of Deputy John Paul Phelan.  A senior Opposition spokesperson for the environment has stated in the D&aacute;il that the banking inquiry is fatally flawed and such a contribution needs further clarification.<\/p><p>What is Fianna F&aacute;il's policy and what is its position on the banking inquiry?  I am quite content for it to reflect the make-up of this D&aacute;il.  If the Deputy has a different idea he needs to elaborate on that and not further damage the democratic process which he has railed against here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400023#V00200","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404480600,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Andrew Doyle, on bringing it before the House.  It gives us an opportunity to focus on a very important part of our democratic system, voting.  There is merit in setting out opening and closing times of polling stations because it will give people advance warning of the time when they should be there to cast their vote.  I am not certain there should be provision made for people who arrive late or just in time and have to queue.  That happens within the polling station.  If a person is waiting to vote and the station has not closed I wonder whether provision should be made to accommodate them in those circumstances.  We have all seen people turn up when the door has closed or as it closes.  Presiding officers will generally make allowances and accommodate the person but not always.<\/p><p>  I do not call for the simplification of voting systems.  Democracy is sacred and there is a certain ceremony attached to it, as there should be.  A basic tenet of democracy is that people vote.  They do so after careful consideration.  There has been a tendency recently for people to say it should be an open door and people should only vote if they see fit or feel fit to do so.  That is nonsense.  The voter has a responsibility to make a decision seriously and not cynically.  Cynicism is dangerous in any democracy.  European history demonstrates that being cynical does not solve any problems.  Every time we cast a vote we must think about its consequences because we are choosing the people who will represent us in our legislative assembly for the foreseeable future.  People can and do dismiss that, saying it is too complicated, it should be simpler and so on.  The only simple thing about democracy is that if it fails the consequences are serious.  We should recognise the importance of ensuring that people are registered to vote.<\/p><p>  I cannot understand how with modern technology and scientific advances it is not possible to have an accurate electoral register.  People have made suggestions such as the use of PPS numbers.  An Post is the one organisation that has daily access to almost every house in the country.  It is in a better position to monitor the electoral register than anybody else.  Some interventions made in the registers have made them worse.  In some cases, swathes of people have been taken off the register, in others, people who voted a year ago no longer have a vote.  Somebody will say a random sample was taken but because the person was on holidays he or she has been taken off the register.  That is ridiculous.<\/p><p>  People have mentioned the introduction of a list system.  I am profoundly opposed to such a ridiculous system.  The fact that it is used across Europe is no recommendation whatsoever.  On the list system people who could not get elected would be elected to public office on the basis of a party's or another person's performance.  The system has no merit at all.  There is only one system, the one where an individual votes for an individual, whether that individual is in a party or not.  The system for replacement, such as that in the European Parliament, is daft.  It is ridiculous that somebody on the list automatically takes up a position without being elected at all.  It is crazy.<\/p><p>  By minimising the importance of voting we diminish the importance of democracy.  We should never do that.  Consider some of the countries that do not have democracy, where the United Nations and others have sent many of us to monitor elections.  There we can see the importance that so many who had no democracy attach to the act of voting.  They will queue up all morning for hours before the polling station opens at 7 a.m. and remain there until 12 o'clock the following day in order to cast their votes because they regard it as very important to participate in the act of nominating the person to represent them.  It may well be that the person elected does not represent the people to the best of his or her ability, or as he or she should, or does not act not in the best interests of the nation but the people can change that decision at the next opportunity.  We should always allow for the opportunity to change.<\/p><p>  We need to ensure that access to polling stations is dealt with in a meaningful way.  During the most recent election I visited a polling station in my constituency.  The polling booth was in the porch of the school with no lighting or proper facilities for privacy.  It was ridiculous.<\/p><p>  I again thank my colleague for giving me the opportunity to speak on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400024#W00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1404480600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I listened with great interest to the debate today.  Apart from one or two contributions it was a very positive and constructive engagement which is how this D&aacute;il works.  We all share the same commitment to the democratic process and the desire to increase voter participation.  Many different views and interesting points have been raised here today.  All of these will have to be considered on the next Stage of the Bill.  We were debating the proposal that a fixed polling period of 15 hours between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. would lead to increased voter participation.  We heard all the arguments about that from both sides.  It is important to continue to be open to new ideas to promote greater voter participation.<\/p><p>  The Government has been very active in the area of electoral reform and plans to continue in that vein.  The establishment of the electoral commission is a further significant reform to which this Government is fully committed.  I have no doubt that the work involved in developing the electoral commission will widen the debate on electoral matters, including voter participation.<\/p><p>  In respect of electoral reform we have abandoned the acceptance of corporate donations over &euro;200, unless that body has registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission and the donor has declared to the recipient that the donation has been authorised by a general meeting of the members of the body concerned; we have reduced the limits on political donation by a political party from some &euro;6,300 to &euro;2,500 and by an individual from &euro;2,500 to &euro;1,000; reduced the thresholds at which donations must be reported by a political party from &euro;5,000 to &euro;1,500 and by an individual from &euro;634 to &euro;600; and reduced the threshold from &euro;5,078 to &euro;200 above which companies, trade unions, societies and building societies must report on political donations in their annual accounts.  In the recent European Parliament elections we saved &euro;3.8 million on the Litir Um Thoghchan by changing its basis from one letter to every person in a household entitled to vote to one letter per household.<\/p><p>Finally, I want to congratulate Deputy Doyle and his staff on the excellent work they have done.  The significance of it all is that we have had an excellent, constructive and positive debate on this Bill, which will now advance to Committee Stage for further development.  I welcome today's discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400024#W00300","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404481200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and all my colleagues in the House for their generally positive contributions to this debate.  As I said at the outset, I am introducing this Bill in the context of the Government's commitment to D&aacute;il reform and to political reform in general.  With the exception of Deputy Cowen, who unfortunately decided to go on a tangent by bringing in other issues, all of those who spoke showed that Friday sittings allow for better discussion and more rational debate.  Perhaps the absence of media focus on the set pieces that take place on other sitting days lends itself to a committee-type atmosphere.<\/p><p>  I anticipated that something as fundamental to politicians as how people vote would generate some interest.  It is in all of our interests to show an interest in this matter.  When I was considering this legislation, I was tempted to include a provision requiring people to vote on Saturdays, which is something I would favour.  I decided to focus the Bill precisely on the issue of voting hours.  It was argued that the hours I am proposing, which are the most common, are very long.  Like all Deputies, on election day I try to get to as many polling booths as possible and talk to every presiding officer.  I am aware that the turnout, rather than the hours of polling, is the biggest issue for the presiding officer and the staff who work on polling day.  They will tell one that it is a long day if no one is turning up.  They understand the ebbs and flows of voting patterns during the day.  They will always say they are hoping for a good turnout in the evening because it keeps everybody active.  By the time polling ends, perhaps at 10 p.m., they feel it has been a good day for democracy.<\/p><p>  I am reminded of two things that are somewhat humorous.  Winston Churchill, who is credited with many things, is supposed to have said once that even though democracy is a terrible way to run a country, nobody has figured out a better way.  In the 1980s, when Lech Walesa led the Solidarity movement in an industrial protest that was specifically aimed at allowing the people of Poland to have the right to vote, the father of a current Fine Gael member in Arklow was elected to represent a town or city of 75,000 people.  The man in question suffered as a result but was subsequently elected after political reform had taken place and the right to suffrage had been gained and exercised.  The turnout in Poland, in the initial stages at least, was over 90% because people valued the right to vote.  I agree with Deputy Durkan's statement that &quot;by minimising the importance of voting we diminish the importance of democracy&quot;.  We should always hold on to that view.<\/p><p>  Deputy Crowe spoke about the access to, and the suitability of, particular polling stations.  This is something that needs to be addressed.  The issue of the register of electors has come up time and time again.  I welcome the fact that everybody has something constructive to say.  The general theme was that the register of electors needs to be maintained and an electoral commission needs to be established.  I welcome the fact that the Minister said in his concluding remarks that &quot;the establishment of the electoral commission&quot; was in the programme for Government and is something &quot;to which this Government is absolutely committed&quot;.  The explanatory memorandum that accompanies this Bill makes it clear that &quot;Ireland at present has no independent Electoral Commission, has no fixed hours of polling for elections or referenda, and no consolidated electoral acts&quot;.<\/p><p>  I hope the introduction of this Bill and the debate we have had today will start a wider discussion on the issue of the electoral system.  All politicians and members and supporters of political parties get phone calls from people who have turned up at the polling station only to find they are unable to vote.  In 2011, I dealt with the case of a 93 year old woman who was disenfranchised even though she had never moved house and had voted in every election almost since the foundation of the State.  I do not know who she was going to vote for, but I know she was not impressed about not being allowed to vote.  Members of her family had been involved in the struggle to allow this country to have a vote.  Those are the cases we all hear about.  We need a body to focus on them.<\/p><p>  We have all sorts of organisations, including the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Commission for Communications Regulation and the Office of the Ombudsman.  Given that the citizens' franchise to vote is a fundamental piece of democracy, I think an electoral commission should be established on a statutory footing as a dedicated entity.  It should make recommendations to the Oireachtas, regardless of who is in government or in this House.  It was interesting to hear what Deputy Buttimer had to say about the Constitutional Convention.  He indicated that &quot;the option of extending polling hours... received 89% support&quot; and that the proposal to &quot;establish an independent electoral commission received 97% support&quot;.  If we accept that the Constitutional Convention was reflective of society, it can be argued that we have the imprimatur of society to debate this matter further.  I thank the Minister of State and the other Members of the House for their comments.  I consider this to be the start, rather than the end, of the discussion and debate of the hours of polling and on voting in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014070400025#X00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1404481200,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1404481200,"counter":99,"content":"<p>As this is a Private Members' Bill, it must, under Standing Orders 82A and 118, be referred to a select or special committee.
