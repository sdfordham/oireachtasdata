The best way to find out information is for parents to go on the website<i>www.affordablechildcare.ie,<\/i>The benefits are set out there in a way which is accessible and easy to follow. <\/p><p>Deputies we must get this message out so that the estimated 70,000 children eligible for supports will benefit from September.  Can I encourage you when on local radio or in your local newspaper to please draw attention to the website.  In addition to the website we have posted out information packs to over 4,000 childcare providers and my officials have been on the road holding special information events &ndash; each booked to capacity. <\/p><p>There is understandably a lot of interest from parents in the first instance but also from providers. From September a number of administrative measures will take place.  We are enhancing existing targeted childcare supports by as much as 50%.  There will be better access to subsidies for providers &ndash; with the traditional Community Childcare Scheme being extended to both community and private providers. <\/p><p>In order to encourage involvement in the schemes I have secured an extra &euro;3.5m for providers for non-contact time &ndash; this is on top of the &euro;14.5m secured in Budget 2017.  As I have outlined the technical, legal and technical work is also continuing to achieve the goal of genuine affordable accessible quality childcare.  There are a lot of figures to take in during the limited time today.  But the bottom line for families is the benefits available from September.  Some families will qualify for as much as &euro;145 per week, per child, in childcare subsidies, totalling approximately &euro;7,500 per child, per year. <\/p><p>Examples of the impact we will have: <\/p><p>-  A working family in receipt of Family Income Supplement and with a Medical Card, who currently benefit from a full-time CCS childcare subsidy of &euro;95 per week, will from September benefit from a subsidy of &euro;145 per week.  This represents an increase in childcare subsidy of up to &euro;2600 per child, per annum, or, for families who have not received the subsidy before, an annual saving on childcare, per child, of up to &euro;7540. <\/p><p>-  A family in receipt of One Parent Family Payment, with a Medical Card, working part-time, who currently benefit from a part-time CCS childcare subsidy of &euro;47.50 per week, will from September benefit from a subsidy of &euro;80 per week.  This represents an annual increase of  up to &euro;1,690 per child, or for single parents who have not benefitted from this subsidy in the past, a reduction of up to &euro;4,160  per child in their annual childcare costs. <\/p><p>There are many more examples which we are always happy to share. <\/p><p>I hope this information is useful for Deputies when explaining the changes to constituents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Question No. 27 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Accommodation Provision","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA01000"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[30783\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she has held discussions with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government regarding the family hubs that are planned to replace the use of hotels for families in emergency accommodation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[31023\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will consult with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government as to the suitability of accommodating children in hubs as a response to the housing crisis; if she will make recommendations to ensure the safety and well-being of children being housed in those circumstances; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[30852\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to support homeless families that will be moved into hubs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[31216\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on whether hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation is suitable for homeless families; her further views on whether the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is delivering on its responsibility to these families; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[30853\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the work she is undertaking with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to support homeless families with young children remaining in emergency accommodation, hubs and so on; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[31163\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of families in emergency accommodation being supported by community child care subvention; the status of free travel and other measures for families in emergency accommodation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[31215\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her Department has determined the number of homeless children here; the measures being taken to protect their welfare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

They are a temporary solution as we, as a government get to grips with the devastating plight of homelessness in our country.  The hubs are a better temporary solution than hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation which I do not believe are suitable accommodation for homeless families.  <\/p>  <p>  I know Minister Murphy has as his target that any new family presenting as homeless will be accommodated in a hub and not in a hotel or bed and breakfast.  His other target is to move families that are currently homeless and living in hotels, out of those hotels.<\/p>  <p>  Hubs provide shared facilities and important supports that are difficult to organise in hotels.  They allow families to lead their lives in a way that is better for children and better for their parents.  They have additional space in hubs.  In a hotel setting, families are often cramped into one bedroom.  They have no privacy.  It is difficult for  children trying to do their homework.  It is restricted in terms of preparing meals.  In general it leads to untold amounts of stress.<\/p>  <p>  The hubs are custom developed to facilitate much better responses to the needs of homeless families.  They allow for on-site access to necessary services such as health, housing, cooking, and laundry facilities.  The hubs provide a better setting for supports such as homework clubs, meeting with support workers and activities that are being organised for children and parents. Importantly, while far from ideal, they have play areas, which allow children to be children, and parents some peace of mind.<\/p>  <p>  When I met with Advocacy groups a year ago, these were among the issues that they highlighted.  They also pressed me to provide free childcare for families that are homeless, which I have done. Initially this  was available in Dublin.  Many other counties have since signed up.  It is currently available in Limerick, Cork, Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Offaly, Westmeath and Wicklow. We will make arrangements also to support any cases that are brought to our attention outside of these counties.<\/p>  <p>  I have a budget of &euro;4m for this.  In my opinion it is a well- targeted and much needed support for families that are homeless.  It is good for children and good for parents.  At the moment the parents of 94 children are availing of this.  112 providers have signed up to be part of the scheme.  Child care providers get a  grant of &euro;110 per week to cover 25 hours of childcare.  Families with children aged 0-5 years inclusive are identified by Focus Ireland and encouraged to participate.  I will continue to support children and families with free childcare that move from hotels and B&amp;B accommodation into hubs.  <\/p>  <p>  These children will also continue to be prioritised in terms of the school completion programme.  The School Completion Programme identifies and supports children at risk of not reaching their potential in the educational system.  It does this through initiatives such as afterschool supports, homework clubs, mentoring programmes, therapeutic interventions and breakfast clubs.  <\/p>  <p>  Sadly, I am aware that families become homeless during the course of the year and may not be on the target list drawn up by the SCP at the start of the school year.   For this reason all SCP programmes are now engaging with their schools on an ongoing basis, and not just at the start of the year,  to ensure that children receive the appropriate supports.  The Education Welfare Office also prioritise the sourcing of an appropriate school placement for children who are homeless.  In DEIS schools where there is a Home School Community Liaison the Co-ordinator proactively engages with parents who are experiencing homelessness.  The HSCL also supports families to access any other services that can be of assistance to the family.  The Tusla Homeless Liaison officer will continue to work with these families until such time as they are moved to permanent housing. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla will offer &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; assessments at the hubs.  The agency will participate in respect of child protection and welfare services, educational welfare, and Domestic, Sexual and gender based violence services.  With the help of the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, Tusla has arranged an awareness and training session for homeless service providers on Domestic, sexual and gender based violence.  We will continue to offer services through the Family Resource Centres.  Families living in hubs can continue to avail of the services such as family fun days, play therapy and transport services.<\/p>  <p>  When developing the Government&rsquo;s response to our Homeless Crisis I advocated strongly for the plan Rebuilding Ireland to include a commitment to provide children in emergency accommodation with LEAP cards for school journeys.  While this did not happen as quickly as I would have liked, it did happen.  In my meeting with Minister Murphy this week I emphasised the need to continue providing these to children who are in hubs and need to use public transport to travel to school.  In addition five separate 24 hour family LEAP cards were provided to all homeless families in hotels during 2016.  I know that people found these helpful in terms of giving them family days out.  I wish to see this repeated this year.<\/p>  <p>  Children and Young People Service Committees have been established in each of the 17 Tusla areas with relevant coordinators in place.  They will contribute to greater interagency working and help to ensure that there is a coordinated approach on homelessness.  The Tusla Homeless Liaison Officer has contacted the 5 CYPSC coordinators in Dublin and attended briefing sessions with them.  They must each now consider the best approach and response within their specific area to homeless related matters.  This will include working with families living in hubs.  This briefing session is scheduled to take place in each of the 17 areas.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of May, there were 1,312 families homeless.  There are 2,777 children in these homeless families.  647 homeless families are being accommodated in hotels and B&amp;Bs in Dublin. These are shocking figures.  In my role as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have concentrated my efforts around minimising the impact where and when possible.  I will continue to do this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":21,"content":"<p>Question No. 29 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":22,"content":"<p>Question No. 30 answered with Question No. 28.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":23,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 31 to 34, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Data","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA02300"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[30782\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of unaccompanied minors that had been in the migrant camp in Calais that have come here; if work is ongoing to expand Tusla's capacity for this purpose; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":26,"content":"<p>I am happy to report to the Deputy that 22 children have arrived from France under the Calais Special Project.

The criteria for the programme, developed as a result of an all-party motion in November 2016, requires that separated children seeking asylum in Ireland were unaccompanied, living in a camp in or near Calais, were under 18 years of age and had an expressed wish to come to Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Social workers from the Tusla Social Work Team for Separated Children and members of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na travelled to the locations where the children were accommodated, to conduct initial needs assessments and security checks.  The children were then engaged in orientation activities in France and were accompanied to Ireland by staff from the International Organisation for Migration.<\/p>  <p>  On arrival the children  were granted refugee status by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Full intake assessments were completed by Tusla at this stage.  All of the children were allocated a social worker, and were placed in residential settings while their care, educational and medical needs were assessed.  To co-ordinate Tusla's role in this effort, Tusla established the Calais Special Project which is led by their Separated Children's Team.  Additional resources were allocated for the assessment and care needs of the young people.  The Team has expanded to include additional social workers, aftercare workers and administrative support.  Tusla have opened three new residential units specifically for separated children, which means there are now a total of 7 units available to separated children.

Indeed one of the great successes of AIM has been the huge interest in a newly developed Higher Education Programme in Leadership for Inclusion in Early Years Settings &ndash; known as LINC.

The project worker will engage with all aspects of the young the person's needs including bringing them to meetings and other appointments, making contact, as appropriate, with their family and keeping in contact with the social work team from the child's home area. The aim of the services  is to ensure the young person's stay  in the emergency residential centre is for as short a period as possible.

This figure is amongst the highest internationally and something about which we should be proud.  I do not take this for granted and am aware that Tusla services must constantly be alert to the need for improvements, especially as children with increasing complexity are placed with foster carers.  When a child is received into care there is a full assessment of their identified needs and this includes a medical assessment.  A medical card is provided in respect of the child in foster care. <\/p>  <p>  Following this assessment, the child's statutory care plan should identify outstanding medical, emotional, psychological and educational supports required.  The Deputy will be aware that the HSE is responsible for the provision of medical and psychology services and children are referred to these services as needed.

It is the role of Tusla, and other State services, to ensure that foster carers are supported in providing that care.  <\/p>  <p>  I am alert to the  National Review Panel whose reports have drawn attention to the heroic work of foster carers who care for babies with serious life limiting disabilities, and the need, in these and other situations for appropriate and timely supports. Foster carers also provide ongoing care for children with serious disabilities, and need all the supports available.   <\/p>  <p>  Following  recent concerns regarding children in care and leaving care with life long serious disabilities, I engaged  with both the  Minister for Health and the Minister for Disability.

The provision of improved centre-based childcare services is very important, but I will not lose sight of the needs of children who do not attend them.  In this regard, <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People<\/i>contains a commitment to produce Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever National Early Years Strategy.  The intention is to deliver a cross-cutting strategy which will take a joined-up, whole of Government approach to the issue of supporting children and their families during the early years (0-6 years).  The drafting of the National Early Years Strategy is being advanced by my Department.  In December of last year I hosted an Open Policy Debate on the Strategy with a view to completion of the Strategy later this year. My officials will be engaging further with key Government Departments and other stakeholders in the coming months to bring it to a conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Completion Programme","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA03900"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[31175\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA04000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the rationale behind the decision to cut all funding for counselling services in the school completion programme; her views on whether this could have serious negative consequences for the children and young persons currently availing of these services; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>I have not ceased all funding for counselling services under the School Completion Programme.

The measures are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  A new universal subsidy will be available for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years of age (or until they are eligible for ECCE e.g 3 years and 3 months) in Tusla registered childcare.

To illustrate the effect of this increase, the highest subsidy provided under the CCS scheme for full time childcare in 2016 was &euro;95 per week.  This will increase to &euro;145 per week from September. This should decrease the co-payment required by families who qualify and therefore make childcare more accessible and affordable to these families; assisting parents in their return to training or employment and lifting families out of poverty. <\/p>  <p>  These subsidies, both universal and targeted, will be available through childcare services who contract with my Department to deliver the schemes.  The schemes are open to 4,500 community (not-for-profit) and private providers across the country.<\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that parents and childcare providers are aware of the changes to the schemes this September, a comprehensive information campaign is underway.

However, it is unlikely that 1,520 WTE social workers will be sufficient to execute Tusla&rsquo;s current and future responsibilities without changes to the composition of Tusla social work teams.  Accordingly, Tusla is evaluating management and staff skills mix with a view to service enhancement, including reviewing the roles of family support workers; social care workers in the community; and administrative structures to support the delivery of more efficient and cost effective services.  Part of the evaluation also includes looking at enhanced job roles, increasing multidisciplinary team-working in an effort to alleviate pressure; redesigning tasks; and promoting greater efficiency in working.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has also appointed a dedicated Workforce Planner to work closely with Tusla services \/ operations with a view to identifying the areas&rsquo; required resource mix reflecting the on-going challenge of  recruiting social workers and the potential for more social care workers and family support workers. <\/p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to the current and future issues with social worker supply in Ireland, and the challenges this poses for Tusla, and discussions are ongoing between my Department and the Higher Education Authority to examine how this might be addressed.  <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the Exchequer funding of &euro;713m in 2017 will provide Tusla with significantly increased capacity to respond to areas of identified risk and anticipated demand and to progress a number of key service developments which will ensure better outcomes for vulnerable children, and families, who need our services and support. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400059#WRA06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":69,"content":"<p>Question No. 52 answered with Question No. 29.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Affordable Childcare Scheme Implementation","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400060#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[31177\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400060#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the way in which parents will be able to access the subsidies offered under the affordable childcare scheme in September 2017 in view of the fact that there is no onus on childcare providers to offer the scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[31176\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400060#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the way in which she envisages the affordable childcare scheme being rolled out in September 2017; the guarantees there are that childcare providers will take up the scheme in order to ensure access to it to all parents that are eligible for subsidies; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 55 together.<\/p>  <p>  On 11 April, I made an announcement that the Affordable Childcare Scheme would not commence this September but that a range of measures will be introduced by my Department to make childcare more affordable for thousands of families throughout Ireland.  This honours a key commitment in the Programme for Government.  I can confirm that these measures, which will benefit the families of tens of thousands of children, will commence this September. <\/p>  <p>  These measures are being put in place to ensure that parents of up to 70,000 children due to benefit under the Affordable Childcare Scheme will be given the opportunity to avail of increased childcare subsidies from September.  This will be achieved by significantly increasing the subsidy rates for the Community Childcare Subvention and the Training and Employment Childcare Schemes, in some instance by as much as 50%.  There will also be a new universal, non-means tested childcare subsidy that will benefit parents with children aged between 6 months and 36 months.    <\/p>  <p>  These measures mean that the families of up to 70,000 children can look forward to benefitting from increased childcare subsidies starting from this September. <\/p>  <p>  Following on from a coordinated online and postal information campaign targeting both childcare providers and parents with key information about the measures, my Department along with Pobal and the City\/County Childcare Committees are currently hosting public information &ldquo;roadshows&rdquo; to build awareness and encourage providers to sign up the September measures.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have recently announced a payment for non-contact time to services who sign up to the September measures.  The payment to providers is intended to make a contribution towards the administration and non-contact costs involved in providing my Department&rsquo;s childcare programmes.  In particular, the new funding recognises the time providers need to spend familiarising themselves with the new affordable childcare measures, signing contracts, meeting regulatory and compliance requirements and assisting parents with understanding how they can most benefit from the various childcare programmes available.<\/p>  <p>  The measure provides for a payment equivalent to an additional seven days&rsquo; funding for services. &euro;3.5m has been allocated for this purpose.<\/p>  <p>  I am very aware that delivering these enhanced childcare supports is only possible because of the commitment and co-operation of more than 4,000 childcare providers throughout the country.

Implementation of the Programme for a Partnership Government requires a new relationship between the Government and Oireachtas.  This is reflected in significant D&aacute;il reforms which are being implemented, providing a significantly greater role for members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  <\/p>  <p>  In the last few weeks two Private Members Bills have been passed by the Oireachtas.  The Competition (Amendment) Act 2017 was originally published by Senator Ivana Bacik in January 2016 and the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Prohibition of Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing) Act 2017 was originally published by Deputy Tony McLoughlin in June 2016. <\/p>  <p>  These arrangements require greater collaboration and sharing of information by the Government with the Oireachtas .  <\/p>  <p>  Central to our approach for delivering on this ambitious programme is the concept of &lsquo;good faith and no surprises&rsquo;.  <\/p>  <p>  This Government, and the previous Government, played a crucial role in the process of D&aacute;il Reform including the first election of a Ceann Comhairle by secret ballot and the selection of Oireachtas Committee Chairs under a D'Hondt system among others.  Following the General Election in 2016, the D&aacute;il established an All Party D&aacute;il Reform Committee.  The Committee issued a Report in May 2016 and a number of the recommendations it made have since been introduced.  The new structures are now in place a year and the Government along with the other Parties and Groups in the D&aacute;il are currently reviewing the changes and making a number of proposals including reform of the way Private Members Bills are dealt with, the proportionality of speaking time in the D&aacute;il and the amount of D&aacute;il time provided to debate Government legislation among other issues.<\/p>  <p>  Within my Department, there is an expanded role for the Chief Whip's Office, alongside the new Parliamentary Liaison Unit, to support these arrangements including supporting good communication between Departments and the Oireachtas, particularly in relation to progressing Government legislation through the Oireachtas.  <\/p>  <p>  The new arrangements include more pro-active communication between Ministers and their Departments and Opposition spokespeople and Oireachtas Committee Chairpersons and Members.  It requires greater sharing of information with the Oireachtas to inform its deliberations, for example through the new Budgetary procedures, use of pre-legislative scrutiny by Committees, and more briefing on significant developments or issues.<\/p>  <p>  There is a new D&aacute;il Business Management Committee established to discuss and agree on the D&aacute;il Schedule, more time for Private Members Business, new arrangements for Topical Motions and reformed structures for Parliamentary Questions.  These all require a new approach from Ministers and their Departments and this Government is committed to ensuring it works effectively.  <\/p>  <p>  As regards Seanad Reform, in the Programme for a Partnership Government the Government restated its intention to reform Seanad Eireann and committed to pursuing implementation of the Report of the Working Group on Seanad Reform (the Manning Report).  That Report was published in 2015 and it is available on my Department's website.   <\/p>  <p>  One of the recommendations of the Report was the establishment of an Implementation Group to oversee implementation of the reforms contained in the Report.  The former Taoiseach agreed with a suggestion made in the D&aacute;il some time ago by Deputy Martin that this Group should be based in the Oireachtas and should comprise members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad from all parties and groups, with access to independent expert advice as required.

Consequently\u00a0the sale of any shareholding in AIB\u00a0does not count as general government revenue.  Thus\u00a0there will not be an\u00a0increased capacity to spend on capital projects as a result of the sale of shares in AIB without affecting the general government balance.<\/p>  <p>  While not improving the deficit, the cash proceeds arising from the sale of AIB shares, which have been transferred to the Exchequer, reduce the\u00a0Exchequer borrowing requirement and\u00a0result\u00a0in lower general government net debt initially and gross debt in time.  A lower level of\u00a0debt is not only beneficial in terms of the fiscal sustainability of the State but will also result in reduced interest payments in future years.  The strategy of reducing the national debt is consistent with the Government policy of repaying the borrowing previously undertaken to finance the recapitalisation\u00a0of the banking sector during the financial crisis.\u00a0 As previously stated, it the Government's position that the proceeds from the\u00a0sale\u00a0of the State's shareholdings in Irish banks, including AIB, will be used to reduce the outstanding level of public debt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have previously acknowledged the need for increased public investment.  The current Capital Plan sets a baseline from which this Government intends to increase investment in critical infrastructure, and in areas such as housing\u00a0and health, as the Deputy has identified\u00a0into the future. As outlined in the 2017 Estimates, gross voted capital expenditure will increase to &euro;4.5 billion in 2017.  This represents an increase of &euro;325 million in comparison to the 2016 outturn. By 2021 it is envisaged that Gross Voted Capital Expenditure will reach &euro;7.3 billion, an increase of over 100 per cent in comparison to its level in 2014. \u00a0These increases in investment over the coming years will be allocated to identified priorities on the basis of the outcome of the review of the Capital Plan currently under way.<\/p>  <p>  I would also point out that it is not just because of\u00a0the fiscal rules that\u00a0the Government is using the proceeds to reduce debt - as the Taoiseach has\u00a0stated, it is the right thing to do.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be further noted that the SGP also includes flexibilities that are designed to promote\u00a0capital investment.  For instance, within the expenditure benchmark, capital formation increases are smoothed over four years with the result that only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the\u00a0fiscal space.  This provision, which means increases in capital spending for housing and other purposes can be front-loaded within the EU rules, has been utilised in Ireland's budgetary plans.\u00a0 With regard to Brexit and other external risks to the outlook, the best way to deal with such risks is through competitiveness oriented policies and prudent management of the public finances.  That is what this Government will continue to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400061#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Data","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400061#WRC03600"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[30835\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400061#WRC03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the name of the legal advisers, solicitors and barristers employed by a bank (details supplied) in respect of its appeal of a Financial Services Ombudsman ruling which was eventually withdrawn; the fees paid to each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":157,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is not held in the Department of Finance.

DJEI made contact with my Department and the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General (\"C&amp;AG\") regarding the implementation of statutory audit obligations in the 2014 revised EU Audit Directive and Regulations prior to their transposition into Irish law via SI 312 of 2016 and the Companies Act 2014. <\/p>  <p>  My Department engaged over a number of months with DJEI, the Office of the C&amp;AG and NAMA on this matter.  My Department also sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General regarding this Directive.  The Directive requires that certain companies, including NAMA, must be audited by a Statutory Auditor within the meaning of the Directive.  This audit requirement is separate from and in addition to the audit requirements set out in the NAMA Act which remain in effect.  It was also confirmed that the C&amp;AG  was not a Statutory Auditor within the meaning of the Directive.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand that both NAMA and the Office of the C&amp;AG each obtained separate legal advice which concurs with this position.  Hence, the C&amp;AG's audit of the statutory financial statements of the NAMA Group entities from the financial year ended 31 December 2016 onwards does not fulfil the requirements of the Directive. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the C&amp;AG believes that, at a minimum,  a change in legislation would be required in order to become a 'statutory auditor'.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, cognisance would also need to be given to the particular features of the Constitution which safeguard the independence of the role.<\/p>  <p>  As a consequence, the NAMA Group entities were required to appoint a Statutory Auditor to satisfy the Directors&rsquo; obligations under Section 333 of the Companies Act 2014 for the year ended 31 December 2016 and all years thereafter.  NAMA launched a tender for the services of a statutory auditor and, arising from this, Mazars were appointed by the NAMA Board in May 2017. I am advised that the tender documentation for this appointment are publicly available on the e-tenders website, should the Deputy wish to review them in detail.<\/p>  <p>  The appointment of a statutory auditor does not override, nor breach, the C&amp;AG's obligation to audit NAMA and NAMA Group Entities for each year end in accordance with Section 57 of the NAMA Act.  However, it does mean that there will be a dual audit of NAMA&rsquo;s accounts &ndash;by both its statutory auditor, Mazars, and separately by the C&amp;AG. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Deputy will note that NAMA&rsquo;s tender document requests that tenderers &ldquo;should seek to maximise audit efficiency for NAMA and in this regard consideration should be given to making use of the working papers of the C&amp;AG (if available) and similarly the Statutory Auditor should consider the provision of their working papers to the C&amp;AG for their audit&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that NAMA and the C&amp;AG have worked constructively together to address these changing audit requirements while remaining faithful to their respective obligations under various pieces of legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Compliance","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[31195\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to the meeting with the Committee of Public Accounts and the commitment to deal expediently with a matter (details supplied), the progress to date; when he expects the committee to report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[31196\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when a case (details supplied) will be heard; the reason the Revenue Commissioners are contesting the proposed test appellant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[31197\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners are objecting to persons taking the test case in respect of a matter (details supplied); if so, the reason therefor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 to 100, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I am assuming that the reference to the meeting with the Public Accounts Committee is in fact the meeting on Wednesday 7 December 2016 with the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach where Revenue participants discussed matters pertaining to the issue with that committee.

The forum to have these appeals resolved is the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC), an independent body tasked with hearing tax appeals.   <\/p>  <p>  I am advised it is proposed by the TAC to take a test case.

As provided for in the Regulations, in order for approval to be granted an applicant credit union must demonstrate that the granting of such approval is consistent with the adequate protection of the savings of members and effective and proportionate having regard to the nature, scale and complexity of the credit union.  The submission deadline for applications to retain savings in excess of &euro;100,000 was 27 June 2016.  The application form to increase savings in excess of &euro;100,000 does not have a submission deadline and will be accepted on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>Under the process, applications to retain individual members&rsquo; savings in excess of &euro;100,000, which were held at commencement of the Regulations, were assessed primarily by reference to objective financial criteria related to the excess reserves and liquid assets held by the credit union.  In addition, applicant credit unions were required to outline a rationale for seeking to retain such savings.<\/p><p>At commencement of the Regulations, there were 196 credit unions reporting on the Prudential Return (PR) that they held individual members&rsquo; savings in excess of &euro;100,000 and the total amount of such savings held was c.&euro;165 million.  Just over one third of these credit unions applied for permission to retain the individual members&rsquo; savings in excess of &euro;100,000.  The Central Bank informs me that the majority of these applicants met the financial criteria (on reserves and liquidity levels set out in the application process) and have been approved to retain such savings.<\/p><p>For those credit unions not approved to retain individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000, transitional arrangements set out in the Regulations apply, meaning that all individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held by these credit unions had to be returned to individual members by 1 January 2017.<\/p><p><b>3. Asking the Central Bank of Ireland to instigate a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit within a year of the formation of the new Partnership Government.<\/b><\/p><p>The Central Bank committed to a review of the savings limit, three years from commencement of the regulations (1 January 2016).  A letter issued to the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank from the Minister for Finance on 25 November 2016 requesting the Central Bank of Ireland to instigate a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit on credit union members.<\/p><p><b>4. Working with the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank to gradually lift current lending restrictions as appropriate, including for housing.<\/b><\/p><p>In February 2015 the Central Bank commenced a lending restriction review initiative, whereby credit unions that are subject to a lending restriction, but are satisfied that they have made the necessary improvements and have embedded these improvements in robust risk sensitive lending practices, could apply for a review of their lending restriction.  The closing date for receipt of applications under this initiative was 30 September 2015.  This review has reduced the number of credit unions with lending restrictions. Currently 60 credit unions, approximately 22% of credit unions by number, have a lending restriction compared with 52% of credit unions at the start of the review process.  The Central Bank has informed the Department that there is ongoing engagement with credit unions to lift lending restrictions. The Department will continue to monitor the situation.<\/p><p><b>5. Credit unions' move towards more electronic and online services, including the rollout of debit cards and enhanced online banking services.<\/b><\/p><p>We continue to support credit union initiatives to develop services while protecting members&rsquo; savings. In certain circumstances, the provision of new services must be approved by the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank prior to their introduction. <\/p><p>The Central Bank informs me that in October 2016, a number of credit unions were approved for a new service Members Personal Current Account Services (MPCAS) which provides for a current account and a range of services which includes payment instruments such as debit cards.  Approval was granted under additional services provisions (sections 48 to 52) within the Credit Union Act 1997 (as amended).  There has been strong interest in this service and the Central Bank is currently processing a significant number of applications, which are at different stages of assessment with the majority currently at an advanced stage.  Details and applications forms for the MPCAS service are available on the Central Bank website.<\/p><p>The Central Bank has also indicated that it is open to applications for alternative debit card proposals and recommends the MPCAS framework as a template for such alternative proposals.<\/p><p>Separately, an Implementation Group consisting of members from the four main credit union representative bodies, the Central Bank and a CUAC member, chaired by the Department of Finance was established earlier this year to implement all recommendations in CUAC&rsquo;s 2016 Report.

The Government has initiated a number of important and practical initiatives which have the potential to improve the position of mortgage holders, including variable rate mortgage holders. Firstly the Government wishes to maintain and promote the level of competition in the supply of mortgage finance.  To that end, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) was asked to set out options to improve the degree of competition and consumer protection in the mortgage market.  As the Deputy will be aware, the CCPC has recently produced its report and set out a number of short, medium and long term action points for consideration. My Department will now liaise closely with CCPC, the Central Bank and other relevant Departments\/agencies as appropriate on these action points to further consider their practical potential to enhance competition.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, the Government considers that measures to encourage and promote a greater level of switching in the mortgage market would also boost the level of competition in the market for existing mortgages.  This point was also recognised by the CCPC report and the Central Bank has also carried out work in this area.  For example, last April the Central Bank published research on the experience of consumers in switching mortgage providers.  That research found that many consumers who have switched had a positive experience.  However, it also found that lenders could do more to facilitate mortgage switching. Dedicated mortgage switching staff, the ability to better compare mortgage products, a less time consuming process and clarity around timelines were highlighted as potential stimulants to mortgage switching.  <\/p>  <p>  Following on from this research, the Central Bank will publish a consultation paper in Q3 2017 proposing additional measures to facilitate mortgage switching for those consumers minded to switch.  Specific proposals to be explored will include:<\/p>  <p>  - lenders providing greater clarity to consumers on the switching process itself, including as to timeframes and potential costs of switching;<\/p>  <p>  - the benefits of lenders having dedicated switching contact points;<\/p>  <p>  - further disclosure rules at trigger points in the mortgage life cycle (e.g. end of a fixed interest-rate term); and<\/p>  <p>  - the scope for increased co-operation amongst lenders during the mortgage switching process.<\/p>  <p>  This will be an important development as previous Central Bank research had show that borrowers could make savings by switching their mortgage.  It should be noted that there has been some downward adjustment in mortgage rates.  Recently published Central Bank data on retail interest rates indicated that, in respect of new standard variable rate PDH mortgage business, rates had declined by 19 basis points to 3.38 per cent over the year to March 2017.  Fixed rate PDH mortgage rates also declined, with rates fixed for 1-3 years falling by 26 basis points over the same period.<\/p>  <p>  In overall terms, therefore, the Government is of the opinion that increased competition rather than administrative controls is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole and to that end it will continue to advance measures which encourage greater competition and switching in the mortgage market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":202,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[31257\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on the commitments made in the confidence and supply arrangement to develop a strategy for the growth and development of the credit union sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":203,"content":"<p>Credit unions have a key role to play in providing access to credit and other important services in local communities throughout the country.  The sector has undergone fundamental change since 2011, managing many complex and challenging issues.  For example, following the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo), there have been 82 mergers involving 156 credit unions resulting in an overall reduction of credit unions from 406 at September 2011 to 277 now.  Over the same period loan arrears have fallen from 18% to 9% and the number of credit unions with reserves less than 10% has fallen from 51 in September 2011 to 5 at September 2016.  Average reserves now stand at 17%.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to review individual cases nor to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in particular cases. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will note that the Cost of Insurance Working Group looked at this issue in the context of its work on motor insurance and made a recommendation about the need for insurers to inform consumers of the reasons for large increases in quotations.  Notwithstanding that this will apply only to motor insurance business, it may also have an impact on other lines of business.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the cost of home insurance, the Central Statistics Office reports on price movements in relation to insurance connected with dwellings as part of their Consumer Prices Monthly Series.  According to the official data from the Central Statistics Office, the cost of insurance connected with dwellings has remained largely stable over the last five years increasing and decreasing at various times.  At the beginning of this year it was 6.2% higher than it had been at the beginning of 2012.  February 2017 saw increases month-on-month of 2.5% and this has been followed by three months without a price movement. Comparably, for the same period the cost of motor insurance was 48% higher in January 2017 than it had been in January 2012, and at times early last year had been close to 60% higher.  There is also anecdotal evidence that the cost of employer liability insurance and public liability insurance has risen at a significantly higher rate than that of home insurance.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, therefore, on the basis that there is a need to prioritise the implementation of the cost of insurance motor report and also complete the public liability and employer liability review, I do not propose to look at the issue of the cost of home insurance at this point in time within the context of the Cost of Insurance Working Group's work.  <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department will continue to monitor the cost of home insurance as part of its general oversight of the insurance sector.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD04400"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[31357\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether the increase in poor condition and short-term contracts and general insecurities in modern employment are contributing factors in the increase in employment figures and the stagnation of the tax base; and his plans to tackle this situation.","asker":"1291","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":219,"content":"<p>We are currently seeing very positive signs in the labour market.  Total employment, which has passed the two million mark, is at its highest level since 2008.<\/p>  <p>  Encouragingly, the labour market recovery remains broad based with gains recorded in all sectors and at all levels of occupational status last year.  The composition of growth also remains strong driven by gains in full-time positions.  In fact, according to the latest employment data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), annual increases in full-time employment of 5.5 per cent were seen in the first quarter of 2017, while over the same time period, part-time employment fell by 3.4 per cent. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) release, the CSO publishes a measurement of underemployment.  The following criteria are used to derive underemployment:<\/p>  <p>  1. Working part-time<\/p>  <p>  2. Willing to work additional hours<\/p>  <p>  3. Available to work additional hours<\/p>  <p>  Using these criteria, the CSO data show that part-time underemployment has fallen by 6.4 per cent over the year to Q1 2017, representing less than 5 per cent of all employees while over three-quarters of people who work part-time do so by choice. <\/p>  <p>  In parallel to these significant employment gains, unemployment continues to fall.  The unemployment rate stood at 6.4 per cent in May, the lowest rate of unemployment since mid-2008.  Crucially, the fall in unemployment is broad-based with substantial declines recorded in short-term, long-term and youth unemployment.<\/p>  <p>  Both average hourly and average weekly earnings have also increased in the year to Q1 2017.  Importantly, these increases are broad-based.  In the first quarter of 2017, average hourly earnings increased in 9 of the 13 sectors reported by the CSO, year on year, while average weekly earnings increased in 11 of the 13 sectors. <\/p>  <p>  The average number of hours worked over the same period also increased.  Like earnings, the increase in the average number of hours worked is broad-based with increases in 9 of the 13 sectors.  Importantly, the average number of hours worked increased in sectors such as the Accommodation and Food Services sector, which has a high concentration of part-time employment.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the tax base, I assume the Deputy is referring to income tax.  Income tax has performed steadily in the first six months of 2017, up 3.1 per cent or &euro;274 million on the same period last year.  However, income tax receipts of &euro;9,045 million were slightly behind profile, down 2.3 per cent or &euro;214 million.  This shortfall against target is across a range of income tax components. <\/p>  <p>  Income tax encompasses a broad range of elements, some of which are not directly impacted by employment or wage developments.  These include Deposit Interest Retention Tax, Life Assurance Exit Tax, Dividend Withholding Tax and Back Duty.  Some of these components are having a drag on overall income tax receipts in the first half of 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  However, it is worth pointing out that the key component, i.e. income tax (PAYE), which accounts for around &euro;13 billion or 65 per cent of total income tax receipts is broadly in line with profile at end-June.  This is consistent with the increases in employment and earnings in the labour market which we have witnessed in the year to date. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, the continued momentum in the labour market of late is underlined by broad-based, full-time employment gains coupled with significant reductions in short-term, long-term and youth unemployment.  The solid performance of PAYE receipts in the year to date is indicative of these positive trends. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD04700"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[31359\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400062#WRD04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the rate of duty on tobacco in each of the past ten years; the duty collected for each of those years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":222,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that the rate of duty on tobacco products in each of the past ten years is provided in a table:<table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>Cigarettes<\/th><th>Cigars<\/th><th>Roll your own tobacco<\/th><th>Other smoking tobacco<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>&euro;151.37 per 1000 cigarettes plus 17.78% of the retail price.<\/td><td>&euro;217.388 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;183.443 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;150.815 per kilogram<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>&euro;160.57 per 1000 cigarettes plus 17.92% of the retail price.<\/td><td>&euro;229.917 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;194.016 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;159.507 per kilogram<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>&euro;175.30 per 1000 cigarettes plus 18.28% of the retail price.<\/td><td>&euro;250.729 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;211.578 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;173.946 per kilogram<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009  (supp.)<\/td><td>&euro;183.42 per 1000 cigarettes plus 18.25% of the retail price.<\/td><td>&euro;261.066 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;220.301 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;181.117 per kilogram<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>&euro;183.42 per 1000 cigarettes plus 18.25% of the retail price.<\/td><td>&euro;261.066 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;220.301 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;181.117 per kilogram<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>&euro;183.42 per 1000 cigarettes plus 18.25% of the retail price.<\/td><td>&euro;261.066 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;220.301 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;181.117 per kilogram<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>&euro;192.44 per 1000 cigarettes plus 18.03% of the retail price.<br \/><br \/>Rebalanced from 1st May 2012 to &euro;233.11 per 1000 cigarettes plus 9.04% of the retail price, subject to a minimum of  &euro;268.14<\/td><td>&euro;271.337 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;228.968 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;188.243 per kilogram<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>&euro;237.69 per 1000 cigarettes plus 8.83% of the retail price, subject to a minimum of &euro;268.14<\/td><td>&euro;275.342 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;248.608 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;191.022 per kilogram<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>&euro;241.83 per 1000 cigarettes plus 8.72% of the retail price subject to a minimum of &euro;275.62<\/td><td>&euro;279.345 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;252.222 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;193.799 per kilogram<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>&euro;255.69 per 1000 cigarettes plus 8.85% of the retail price subject to a minimum of &euro;289.98<\/td><td>&euro;295.350 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;273.177 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;204.902 per kilogram<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>&euro;271.96 per 1000 cigarettes plus 9.20% of the retail price subject to a minimum of &euro;307.61<\/td><td>&euro;315.359 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;291.683 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;218.783 per kilogram<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>&euro;288.22  per 1000 cigarettes plus 9.52% of the retail price or a minimum tax of  &euro;325.11<\/td><td>&euro;335.368 per kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;310.189 per  kilogram<\/td><td>&euro;232.664 per kilogram<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The total duty collected from tobacco products for each of the last ten years is provided in a table:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Excise (&euro; millions)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>&euro;1,192<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>&euro;1,171<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>&euro;1,216<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>&euro;1,160<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>&euro;1,126<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>&euro;1,072<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>&euro;1,064<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>&euro;984<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>&euro;1,082<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>&euro;1,098<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The deputy may note Revenue publishes statistical information on the tax receipts collected and the volume of product released across a range of Excise commodities.

This basis of taxation makes no distinction between rental income from property let for residential occupation and property let for commercial occupation.<\/p><p>While the same computational rules to calculate taxable rental income are generally applied to both individuals and companies, income earned by individuals from the letting of residential or commercial property situated in Ireland is taxable under self-assessment income tax, while rental income earned by companies is assessable for corporation tax.<\/p><p>Each property must have a separate tax computation in which the rental expenses for each property are deducted from the related rental income for the same property in order to arrive at a surplus (i.e. income greater than expenses) or a deficiency (i.e. expenses greater than income) of taxable rental income in respect of the property.  The total of surpluses and deficiencies are then aggregated to arrive at Case V profits or gains arising in the year.<\/p><p><b>Rates of income tax<\/b><\/p><p>Rental income forms part of the landlord&rsquo;s total taxable income for the relevant tax year and is liable to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax &ndash; the standard rate of 20% if total income is below the standard rate band and the higher rate of 40% if above.

However, profits from any other activities are subject to corporation tax in the normal way.  A REIT is subject to strict conditions including an annual requirement to distribute 85% of its property income by way of property income dividend.

This decision was based on the application of the public interest assessment (PIA), which concluded that neither of these banks provide critical functions, and that their failure is not expected to have significant adverse impact on financial stability.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, the winding up of both banks is taking place under national insolvency proceedings launched by the Italian authorities.  This is in line with the principles of the BRRD.<\/p>  <p>  Outside the BRRD, EU rules foresee the possibility for governments to seek EU Commission approval for the use of national funds to facilitate liquidation by mitigating negative regional economic effects.  In this case as the two aided banks will exit the market the EU Commission found that there should be no distortion of competition in European banking markets.  Liquidation is largely a national competence and powers and procedures can vary by EU Member State.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, the Italian Government received approval from the EU Commission to provide support to facilitate the liquidation or these two banks, part of which involved the sale of certain assets to Intesa Sanpaolo.  The measures enable the sale of parts of the two banks' activities to Intesa, including the transfer of employees.  The measures will also enable the wind-down of the remaining liquidation entity, financed by loans provided by Intesa.  The Italian State will grant the following measures:<\/p>  <p>  - Cash injections of &euro;4.78bn; and<\/p>  <p>  - State guarantees of a maximum of &euro;12bn, notably on Intesa's financing of the liquidation process.  The State guarantees would be called upon\u00a0if the liquidated estate were insufficient to pay back Intesa for its financing of the liquidation process.<\/p>  <p>  In both banks, shareholders and junior creditors have fully contributed, reducing the costs to the Italian Government, whilst depositors were protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400063#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Banking Sector","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400063#WRE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[31495\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400063#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to sell additional stakes in a bank (details supplied); his further plans to fast-track the sale of the stake; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the State last week sold 25% of AIB's ordinary share capital at a price of &euro;4.40 per share for consideration of almost &euro;3 billion.

Specifically these provisions allow for temporary deviations from\u00a0the required structural\u00a0budgetary adjustment, subject to strict conditions.<\/p>  <p>  The harmonised methodology for calculating the economic cycle\u00a0used in the\u00a0implementation of the SGP remains an area with limitations within the fiscal rules.  My Department has secured useful changes to this methodology over the years by consistently raising concerns and objections at European level.  These changes have partially compensated for the reality that the harmonised methodology is not suitable for small open economies.  My Department continues to advocate for improvements in the harmonised methodology and will continue to engage constructively on this and other relevant technical issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has repeatedly acknowledged the need for increased public investment.  The current Capital Plan sets a baseline from which this Government intends to increase investment in critical infrastructure, and in areas such as housing\u00a0and health, as the Deputy has identified\u00a0into the future.  As outlined in the 2017 Estimates, gross voted capital expenditure will increase to &euro;4.5 billion in 2017.  This represents an increase of &euro;325 million in comparison to the 2016 outturn.  By 2021 it is envisaged that Gross Voted Capital Expenditure will reach &euro;7.29 billion, an increase of over 100 per cent in comparison to its level in 2014. \u00a0These increases in investment over the coming years will be allocated to identified priorities on the basis of the outcome of the review of the Capital Plan currently underway.<\/p>  <p>  It should be further noted that the SGP has a feature designed to promote\u00a0capital investment in the expenditure benchmark.\u00a0 Capital formation increases are smoothed over four years with the result that only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the\u00a0fiscal space.

Furthermore, given Ireland's relatively young population, adjusting for the demographic profile of the population\u00a0also impacts on\u00a0comparisons with other European countries.  This\u00a0is illustrated on page 14 of the Mid-Year Expenditure Report 2016 which shows adjusted public expenditure in Ireland in 2014 (as a % of GNI) being\u00a0above the EU average when account is taken of defence and age-related expenditure.<\/p>  <p>3. Analysis of public spending on a per-capita basis can also provide a different perspective. \u00a0A recent\u00a0analysis by the Nevin Economic Research Institute found\u00a0that Ireland ranks 10th amongst 11 high-income EU countries\u00a0when public expenditure, excluding interest,\u00a0is ranked on a per capita basis.  This analysis placed Ireland's public expenditure\u00a0per capita ahead of per-capita expenditure in the UK.\u00a0 A comparison\u00a0based on expenditure as a percentage of GDP\u00a0would place Ireland's spending below the UK.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 marked the\u00a0third year in succession that gross voted expenditure has been increased.

The operation of the Expenditure Benchmark is set out very clearly in the Vade Mecum of the Stability and Growth Pact, published by the European Commission. <\/p>  <p>  As set out in the Vade Mecum, the only means by which to increase expenditure beyond the limits set out in the Expenditure Benchmark is through the introduction of a Discretionary Revenue Measure (DRM), which would cause revenues to permanently increase.\u00a0 The use of a fund surplus does not count as a DRM and cannot therefore be used to fund additional expenditure over and above the limits set out in the Expenditure Benchmark. <\/p>  <p>  However, the introduction of an increased employer PRSI contribution to go directly towards the NTF would constitute\u00a0a DRM, as this is a policy decision to permanently increase revenue flows into the fund.

The Education Act 1998, subject to the provisions of that Act, provides that there is made available to each person resident in the State a level and quality of education which is appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person. <\/p><p>My Department's policy is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided, unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or in the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated, as is provided for under Section 2 of the Education of Persons with Special Needs Act 2004. <\/p><p>Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and\/or care supports.  Some children may be supported in mainstream with additional supports or in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  Students in a special class\u00a0have the option, where appropriate, of full\/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios.  My Department, therefore, provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools, which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, s\/he will have access to an appropriate education. \u00a0<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is an independent statutory agency, is responsible, through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports as required.  The NCSE operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support, as set out in various Departmental circulars. <\/p><p>Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are provided to assist recognised schools to cater for pupils with disabilities, who have additional and significant care needs, in an educational context and where the nature of these care needs have been outlined in medical and other professional reports as being so significant that a pupil will require additional adult assistance in order to be able to attend school and to participate in education.<\/p><p>The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie,\u00a0in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support. <\/p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools, as a school based resource.  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually, taking into account the care needs of all of the qualifying children enrolled in the school, and on the basis of the assessed care needs of all of the children concerned, rather than solely by reference to a pupil&rsquo;s disability categorisation.<\/p><p>The provision of a quantum of support to schools gives schools the autonomy and flexibility to manage their allocation of SNA support in order to utilise this support to the best possible effect.  It allows schools to target support to those pupils who have the greatest degree of need at any given time, recognising that the level of need that a child may have may be variable over time.  The school is in a position to use their educational experience and expertise to manage the level of support which has been allocated to them to provide for the care needs of identified children as and when those needs arise and to provide access to SNA support for all children who have been granted assess to support.<\/p><p>Where a school or parent wishes to appeal the SNA support allocation which has been made, they may do so through the NCSE appeal process, details of which are set out at www.ncse.ie.<\/p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO and parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<\/p><p>From September 2017, a new Special Education Teaching allocation process will be introduced, replacing the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.<\/p><p>The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p><p>No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year. <\/p><p>DES Circular 0013\/2017 for primary schools and 0014\/2017 for post primary schools were published and allocations based on the school profiles were issued to all schools on 7th March 2017.  Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.<\/p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special educational needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. <\/p><p>The total profiled allocation which is being made to each school is designed to ensure that all schools have a set level of special education teaching support in order to provide additional teaching support for all pupils in their school, including those who may enrol in future, who have identified needs. <\/p><p>Pupils under the new allocation model will be identified by schools for additional teaching support in accordance with the Continuum of Support Guidelines, and the Guidelines which accompany the Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017.  Teachers and School Principals will use their professional judgement in applying the principles and practices set out in the Continuum of Support Guidelines: .<\/p><p>In circumstances where a parent is dissatisfied as to the extent of additional support teaching time which has been allocated to their child from within a schools allocation, the normal course of action open to a parent would be to raise this matter with the school Principal in the first instance, and to request that additional teaching be provided to their child.<\/p><p>In the event that a parent raised an issue in relation to the allocation of additional support for their child with the school Principal, and remains dissatisfied with the manner in which the school Principal addressed their complaint, the next course of action open to the parent would be to raise this matter directly with the Board of Management of the School, who are the body which has responsibility for the management of the school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400065#WRG01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Boards Staff","counter":370,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400065#WRG01450"},{"type":"question","counter":371,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[30889\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400065#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the case of a person (detail supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":372,"content":"<p>The person referred to by the Deputy is, I understand an employee of Waterford Wexford Education and Training Board (WWETB).<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0ETBs are statutory authorities which have responsibility for education and training, youth work and a range of other statutory functions.

There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons\/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.<\/p>  <p>  Each ETB will prepare a report for my Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.\u00a0 In the subsequent and separate implementation phase, where the level of demand for multi-denominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.  There will be a role for the existing patron\/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests, including parents and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.\u00a0 It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.<\/p>  <p>  This new process for supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and cooperation.  Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body. \u00a0In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered.\u00a0In the final instance, an application for a formal transfer of patronage will have to be made by the existing patron under the Education Act 1989, which will require Ministerial approval.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the voluntary nature of these transfers, given that the current patron is in most cases the owner of the land on which the school stands.\u00a0 My Department will develop protocols on patronage transfer with existing patrons to ensure that school and local communities and prospective patrons are fully consulted before a decision is made.\u00a0 I am confident that this process will respect the views of all parties - parents, local schools and communities and patrons.<\/p>  <p>  While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified, in 2017 and beyond.\u00a0 I would point out that the previous model of divestment yielded only a very limited number of schools for transfer to multi-denominational patrons (10 since 2013).\u00a0 I believe that the new schools reconfiguration for diversity process has the potential to significantly increase patron diversity in our school system with a target of\u00a0reaching 400 multi-denominational and non-denominational schools by 2030. \u00a0In addition to progressing the reconfiguration of existing school provision to provide greater choice to parents in areas of stable population, the Government is committed to ensuring that parental preferences will continue to be key to patronage decisions on new schools established in areas of demographic growth.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to working constructively with all education stakeholders and patron bodies in this important endeavour and I would ask all parties to put aside sectional or self interest in pursuing the national objective of providing greater diversity of school provision in line with the choices of parents, families and school communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400066#WRH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":431,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400066#WRH01700"},{"type":"question","counter":432,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[31044\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400066#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of primary and post-primary schools that lack broadband services, by county.","asker":"1225","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":433,"content":"<p>Through the Schools Broadband Access Programme, the Department provides for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised primary, post-primary and special schools.

In schools, the Croke Park hours are additional hours worked by teachers (33 additional hours a year at post-primary and 36 hours at primary).  They are a valuable resource within the school system which allow certain essential activities involving the entire teaching staff or groups of teachers to take place.  These include staff meetings, parent-teacher meetings, school planning, subject planning and mandated Continuous Professional Development.<\/p>  <p>  Before the Croke Park hours were introduced, these activities ate into tuition time.  This meant that schools closed for full days or half days in order to carry them out, causing interruption to tuition and significant inconvenience for parents, as well as child care costs &ndash; particularly for primary parents.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that many public servants committed significantly more hours than this under the public service agreements.  Across the public services &ndash; education, health, local authorities, civil service etc. - the additional time being provided represents about 450,000 additional hours per annum or the equivalent of between 12,000 and 13,000 public service posts.  That is a serious productivity benefit for the Exchequer. Replacing those hours would cost hundreds of millions of euro.<\/p>  <p>  In response to concerns expressed by teacher trade unions regarding the use of the Croke Park hours, my Department agreed to carry out a review of their usage under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  This review, which also involves the school management bodies, is\u00a0under way and will have regard to teacher professional judgement, system and school requirements and experience to date of best practice in the use of the hours.<\/p>  <p>  The review provides for an up-front increase in the quantum of time allowed for planning and development work on other than a whole-school basis.

These included<\/p>  <p>  - a 10% reduction in the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades with effect from 1 January 2011;<\/p>  <p>  - that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale; and<\/p>  <p>  - a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide allowances review, qualification allowances for new teachers were withdrawn.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. <\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for new teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  <\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher (2012 entrant) from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  The comparable starting salary for a pre-2011 entrant post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 (i.e. if full equalisation to pre-2011 pay rates for teachers was achieved) would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.<\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.  It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.<\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectorial issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded draft Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post-January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400067#WRJ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Patronage","counter":499,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400067#WRJ03000"},{"type":"question","counter":500,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[31123\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400067#WRJ03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the location of all schools under religious patronage that he expects to be divested in 2017 and 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":501,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to progressing the development of a dynamic and innovative education system that reflects the diversity of twenty-first Century Ireland.\u00a0 The Programme for a Partnership Government reflects the Government&rsquo;s objective of strengthening parental choice and further expanding diversity in our school system.\u00a0 The desire of parents for diversity in education is primarily being pursued by increasing the number of non-denominational and multi-denominational schools with a view to reaching 400 by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that on 30 January, 2017, I\u00a0 announced\u00a0new plans aimed at providing more multi-denominational and non-denominational schools across the country, in line with the choices of families and school communities and the Programme for Government commitment in this area.<\/p>  <p>  This will involve the Education and Training Boards in the initial phase, as the State&rsquo;s local education authorities, identifying areas where there is likely to be demand for greater diversity and they will work with pre-school services to establish evidence of this demand among the cohort of pre-school parents.

The central vision of the Plan is that the Irish Education and Training System should become the best in Europe over the next decade.  The Plan&rsquo;s high-level goals are based on the five policy areas which I believe will help us to achieve this ambition. The goals are:<\/p>  <p>  1. Improve the learning\u00a0experience and the success of learners<\/p>  <p>  2. Improve the progress of\u00a0learners at risk of educational\u00a0disadvantage or learners with special\u00a0educational needs<\/p>  <p>  3. Help those delivering\u00a0education services to continuously improve<\/p>  <p>  4. Build stronger bridges\u00a0between education and wider community<\/p>  <p>  5. Improve national planning and\u00a0support services<\/p>  <p>  The basic aim of this Government is to sustain our economic progress and use it to build a fair and compassionate society.  Education is the best means of delivering a fairer society, breaking down cycles of disadvantage and ensuring that all our people, in particular those with special educational needs, are able to participate in that progress and fulfil their potential.  Excellent and innovative education and training are the pivot around which personal fulfilment, a fair society and a successful nation should revolve.\u00a0 It is central to sustaining economic success and in converting economic success into building a strong community.  Having the best education and training service in Europe will allow us to provide better opportunities for more people from disadvantaged groups, as well as ensuring that we create more sustainable well-paying jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Our approach to special education has undergone a huge transformation with a growing proportion of children with special educational needs being educated with their peers in mainstream schools.\u00a0\u00a0The participation and progress of learners with special educational needs across the whole education system remains a key focus with an emphasis on improving whole-school and whole system approaches.  The Action Plan 2017 sets out a range of measures which will be undertaken during this year.  These include allocating teachers to schools under the new allocation model to support children with special educational needs, publishing the outcomes of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme, and consult with partners on the implementation of sections of the EPSEN Act and on the provision of services to children with Down Syndrome. <\/p>  <p>  Quality of provision is the cornerstone to the success of the education and training system.\u00a0 We recognise the fundamental roles that leaders, teachers and support staff play and we want to strengthen the system&rsquo;s capacity to continuously improve and to deliver the highest quality education and training services for learners.  The Action Plan 2017 details actions which will ensure that leadership, management, quality frameworks, teaching methods, and initial and continuing training are all operating to the highest standards across the continuum of education and training provision.  These actions include expanding the range of supports available through the Centre for School Leadership, providing dedicated professional support to teachers to support the implementation of curricular and policy change, and developing and introducing a new postgraduate qualification for aspiring school leaders.  Work is also under way on developing a model of supply of both primary and post-primary teachers, following the launch of a report on the subject last month. In the medium- to long- term, this will support schools through helping to match teacher supply with demand. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To become an innovation leader and to build a strong talent base, we as a nation must effectively engage with enterprise.  We must work to address identified skills needs in critical areas, and recognise the shifting global economic and political climate in which services are delivered and jobs are created.\u00a0 Successful enterprise engagement is the foundation of much of the planned activity detailed in the Action Plan 2017.  This includes driving the growth of traineeships and apprenticeships, ensuring the relevance of work placements and work-based projects, and increasing the diversity of opportunity in learning beyond school.\u00a0 To advance this agenda, together with Minister Halligan, I recently launched the National Skills Council and the Regional Skills Fora.  The Council&rsquo;s members are from senior levels within the public and private sectors, and they will oversee research, advise on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and on addressing those needs, and have a key role in promoting and reporting on the responses of education and training providers to the identified needs.\u00a0 The nine Regional Skills Fora will provide a cohesive education-led structure for employers and the further and higher education system to work together in addressing the skills needs of their regions, help employers to better understand and access the full range of services available across the system, enhance links between education and training providers in planning and delivering programmes, reduce duplication and inform national funding decisions.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, Minister Halligan and I also announced the provision of over 6,400 free higher education places under Springboard+ 2017.  This programme is specifically aimed at getting people back to work in areas of identified skills needs.  To that end, courses will be available in the following areas:<\/p>  <p>  1. ICT<\/p>  <p>  2. Manufacturing which includes the Biopharma\/Med tech sector<\/p>  <p>  3. Entrepreneurship,<\/p>  <p>  4. Hospitality<\/p>  <p>  5. Financial Services<\/p>  <p>  There will also be some courses in Marketing (including digital marketing), specialist management courses (Food Business, Aviation and Technology Management), Animation and specialist Construction related courses.<\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that progress is made in all of these areas, updated annual Action Plans will be published each year, detailing the actions that will be implemented during that year.  As part of this process, actions will be monitored against published timelines and progress reports will be published on a quarterly basis.  Recently, the 2016 End of Year Review and the 2017 Quarter 1 Progress Report were published.  They are both available on the Department&rsquo;s website (www.education.ie), with full details of the actions already achieved in these three important areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400067#WRJ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Technological Universities","counter":509,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400067#WRJ04000"},{"type":"question","counter":510,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[31127\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400067#WRJ04100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the Technological Universities Bill2015; the timeframe for it to return to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; his planned changes to the draft legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":511,"content":"<p>I intend bringing\u00a0proposals to Government shortly seeking\u00a0approval for the\u00a0drafting of amendments to the Technological Universities Bill 2015 arising from the consultation process with stakeholders.

The 1978 and 1979 schemes are being phased out and have been superseded by a more extensive capitation grant scheme. <\/p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive capitation grant assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services.

Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.  Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary or caretaker, such staff are employees of individual schools.  My Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.

This document sets out the approach of the Government to the EU-UK negotiations, which began formally on 19 June, following the successful campaign to have key Irish issues recognised in the EU negotiation position.<\/p><p>Following on from this publication, the Government is currently preparing a further paper on economic implications of the Brexit challenge.  This will draw on the work to date across Departments, which will be developed to mitigate emerging sectoral challenges.  These plans will build on ongoing cross-Government research, analysis and consultations with stakeholders, especially through the government&rsquo;s All-Island Civic Dialogue process, and will be important in informing Ireland&rsquo;s domestic response as well as our approach to the EU-UK negotiations.<\/p><p>Accounting for 17% of Ireland&rsquo;s total exports, the UK is one of our most important trading partners.  The potential impacts of Brexit are therefore profound, with specific sectors such as agrifood particularly challenged.  The Government has consistently made it clear that Ireland wishes to achieve the closest possible trading relationship with the UK.  This is that a number of our EU partners also share, as does the UK itself. <\/p><p>Future tariff arrangements will be a key focus, as will the need to minimise any burdens of customs or transit costs.  Our hope is that a largely or wholly tariff-free arrangement will be possible. <\/p><p>In the longer term, we are also conscious of the risk posed by potential regulatory divergence between the UK and EU standards and another priority will be to ensure that the future agreement or agreements on the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK ensure a level playing field. <\/p><p>In its contacts with the EU Taskforce and EU partners, the Government has consistently stressed the unique impacts that the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal will have on Ireland.  In this context, the strong acknowledgement in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating directives of the need to also <i>&ldquo;address issues arising from Ireland&rsquo;s unique geographic situation, including transit of goods (to and from Ireland via the United Kingdom)&rdquo; <\/i>in the first phase of negotiations is most welcome. <\/p><p>The Government has made it equally clear that Ireland&rsquo;s overall economic interests lie firmly in a strong and well-functioning EU with continued membership of the Single Market and the Customs Union.

This will be vital in ensuring that the parallel discussions on the future EU-UK relationship, including in relation to trade, can begin as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400068#WRK05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"United Nations","counter":586,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400068#WRK05300"},{"type":"question","counter":587,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[30880\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400068#WRK05400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on Ireland's position with regard to the proposed United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, UNPA; the stage the movement is at to create an UNPA; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":588,"content":"<p>Ireland is steadfastly committed to the United Nations and the principles and values of the UN Charter.<\/p>  <p>  As a strong supporter of the UN, Ireland continues to advocate, through a range of fora, for reform of the UN&rsquo;s structures and systems to ensure that it is better equipped to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century.

In the context of Brexit, the Government has made clear its determination to ensure respect for all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, including those relating to a possible change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status within the EU.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of intensive political and diplomatic engagement by the Government, our EU partners are fully aware and supportive of the importance of respecting the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and protecting the gains of the peace process.  On 29 April, the European Council adopted Guidelines for the EU-UK negotiations which include a strong acknowledgment of the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland and explicitly recognize the importance of preserving the achievements, benefits and commitments of the Good Friday Agreement.  This is further strengthened by the statement agreed by the European Council on the same day, acknowledging that the Good Friday Agreement provides for an agreed mechanism whereby a united Ireland may be brought about and that, in accordance with international law, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would thus be part of the European Union.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400068#WRK05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Policy","counter":592,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400068#WRK05900"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[30899\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400068#WRK06000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the most recent development in relations between the USA and Cuba following the statement from President Trump; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":594,"content":"<p>I am aware of the recent statement by President Trump on certain planned changes to United States policy towards Cuba.

EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Syria at their April Council meeting.  <\/p>  <p>  They adopted a new EU Strategy for Syria which sets out the EU&rsquo;s main lines of action in Syria including continued support for and direct assistance to the UN-brokered talks in Geneva, the next round of which is due to resume on 10 July.  This includes, in particular, an EU-led initiative, in coordination with the UN, to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground for the end-state in Syria and the conditions for the reconciliation and reconstruction process.  Named the EU Syria Peace Process Support Initiative, it aims to develop a concrete platform to support the peace process and ceasefire, strengthen the opposition parties and civil society, and support for the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Syria to include civil society in his work through the Civil Society Support Room and the Women&rsquo;s Advisory Board.<\/p>  <p>  It also includes support for transitional justice initiatives to help ensure accountability for war crimes, human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law and restrictive measures against Syrian individuals and entities supporting the regime as long as the repression of civilians continues.  The sanctions currently in place include notably an oil embargo, restrictions on certain investments, a freeze of the assets of the Syrian central bank within the EU, export restrictions on equipment and technology that might be used for internal repression as well as on equipment and technology for monitoring or interception of internet or telephone communications.  In addition, over 200 persons and 70 entities are targeted by a travel ban and an asset freeze over the violent repression against the civilian population in Syria.  In March, the EU added four high-ranking Syrian military officials to the sanctions list for their role in the use of chemical weapons against civilians.  The EU keeps the sanctions regime under constant review and will expand and adjust it as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The EU and its Member States are also playing a leading role in the humanitarian response to the crisis.  More than &euro;9.4 billion has already been mobilised for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance to support Syrians inside the country and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort. At the Brussels conference in April 2017 which was co-hosted by the EU, a further &euro;3.7 billion for 2017 was pledged by the EU and its Member States, representing nearly 67% of the pledges. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the EU assistance to the UN-led peace talks in Geneva, the EU&rsquo;s focus on justice and accountability, and the EU sanctions regime.  We have also made a significant contribution to the humanitarian effort.  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed &euro;78.6 million to the humanitarian effort in response to the conflict in Syria.  This is Irish Aid&rsquo;s largest response to a single crisis in recent years.  At the Syria conference in Brussels in March, Ireland pledged to provide at least &euro;25 million in humanitarian assistance to the region during 2017.  &euro;11.1 million of this pledge has already been fulfilled so far this year.  Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, from which &euro;445 million was contributed in 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400069#WRL00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Issues","counter":609,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400069#WRL00650"},{"type":"question","counter":610,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[31026\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400069#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding the situation in Hungary; the efforts being made at EU level to address issues such as the curtailment of the media and violations of democratic norms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":611,"content":"<p>The European Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.<\/p>  <p>  The foundations of the Rule of Law process are contained in the Treaties and these foundations have been strengthened successively with the establishment of the EU Rule of Law Framework in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The current situation in Hungary was extensively discussed in a debate in the European Parliament on 26 April last, at which time both Prime Minister Orb&aacute;n and First Vice-President of the European Commission Timmermans made extensive contributions to the debate. <\/p>  <p>  Fundamental values and the rule of law are a shared EU interest and call for a common approach.

Migration has featured on the agenda of almost every European Council in the same period, including the recent June European Council.<\/p><p>The EU has responded to the crisis by adopting a range of measures to deal with this mass movement of people.  These have included engaging with countries of origin and transit to address the root causes of migration including through the Migration Partnership Framework; agreeing a plan to relocate migrants from Italy and Greece across the Union; the launching of Operation Sophia to disrupt people smuggling in the Mediterranean; and substantial financial assistance to countries hosting large numbers of migrants.  EU Heads of State and Government concluded a landmark migration deal with Turkey in March 2016, which has resulted in a very substantial reduction in the number of migrants risking their lives at sea to enter the EU from Turkey.<\/p><p>In the past year or so the migration focus has shifted from Turkey to the so-called Central Mediterranean Route, with more than 70,000 migrants crossing from Libya to Italy so far this year.  In March 2017, EU leaders issued the Malta Declaration, which sets out the EU&rsquo;s commitment to assist Libya, with a strong focus on capacity building.  <\/p><p>The June European Council made clear that continuing migratory flows on the Central Mediterranean route leading to an ongoing loss of life remains an issue of urgent concern.  It agreed that the EU and its member states had to step up coordination and delivery on all the elements contained in the Malta Declaration, the Partnership Framework and the Joint Valletta Action Plan, underpinned by sufficient financial resources.  Training and equipping the Libyan Coast Guard is a key component of the EU approach and the Council agreed that it should be speeded up.  Cooperation with countries of origin and transit is to be reinforced in order to stem the migratory pressure on Libya&rsquo;s and other neighbouring countries' land borders.  The European Council underlined in this context the importance of supporting the G5 Sahel Joint force (recently established to address the threat of terrorism, as well as the serious challenges posed by transnational organized crime in the region and made up of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger).  There, as elsewhere, the disruption of the business models of human smugglers and traffickers remains a key objective, including by better controlling the trade in equipment used by them.<\/p><p>At the international level, last September's UN Summit in New York on large movements of migrants and refugees marked an important step in the global response to the crisis.

At the UN level, Ireland condemned the continuing violence at Human Rights Council in March 2017, and called for an immediate end to the conflict. <\/p>  <p>  We also continue to support the efforts of international and regional actors such as the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD), the African Union, and the United Nations, including the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), to bring an immediate end to the conflict.  The recent IGAD Summit held on 12 June was a welcome engagement of regional neighbours in renewing efforts to seek peace in South Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is providing substantial humanitarian assistance to the South Sudan crisis, for work in the country and to assist South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.  Since 2012, we have provided some &euro;48 million for victims of the crisis.  To date in 2017, we have provided &euro;9.2 million to our UN and NGO partners working on the ground to address the humanitarian needs, and in particular to address issues relating to food insecurity.  We will continue to monitor this ongoing crisis closely and to provide additional life-saving humanitarian assistance to those most in need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400069#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Prisoners Abroad","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400069#WRL01650"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[31097\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400069#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the difference in approach that the Government is taking following the Taoiseach's comments in regard to a person (details supplied); his proposed changes in approach in securing the release of the person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1311","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":626,"content":"<p>I identified this citizen&rsquo;s case as an absolute priority when I was appointed to my new role, and I am determined to do everything I can to ensure that he is back in Ireland as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I have met in recent days with senior officials, including Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to Egypt, to discuss this case, and we have received comprehensive briefing on all of the aspects involved.<\/p>  <p>  The first Ambassador of a foreign country with whom I met following my appointment was the Ambassador of Egypt, Soha Gendi.

The most recent NSMC Plenary meetings on 4 July 2016 in Dublin Castle and on 18 November 2016 in Armagh saw the Government and the Executive agree on a number of important common principles for dealing with Brexit on an all-island basis, scoping out the sectoral implications of Brexit for Ireland, North and South, and agreeing to work together to optimise North-South planning in the phases preceding and following Brexit.  It was agreed that this work would be taken forward through continuing bilateral discussions within the NSMC at sectoral level, as well as through a high-level working group comprising senior officials from the Government and from the Northern Ireland Executive Office.<\/p>  <p>  At the Plenary meeting of the NSMC on 18 November 2016 in Armagh the Council considered an update by a group of Senior Officials from relevant Departments, North and South, on the progress being made on implementing the commitments set out in Section E of the Fresh Start Agreement, to provide support and funding for North-South infrastructure projects.  The review is ongoing and a further report will be presented at a future Plenary meeting.  The Senior Officials have since met in February 2017 and again in early June to consider progress on all of the Section E commitments. <\/p>  <p>  The Council also received an update in relation to the North West Gateway Initiative.  Ministers welcomed the establishment by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership which will aim to work with central government North and South to ensure the North West region can reach its full potential.   <\/p>  <p>  The NSMC Plenary meeting was advised that Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council had finalised the necessary arrangements for oversight and delivery of the North West Strategic Growth Plan and the associated &euro;5m North West Development Fund which was established under the Fresh Start Agreement.  I am pleased that the Irish Government has played a leading role in this regard &ndash; contributing &euro;2.5 million to the Fund.  The Inaugural meeting of the North West Strategic Partnership was subsequently held on 7 December 2016 and attended by senior officials from Departments, North and South, and I welcome that the second meeting of the Partnership was held last week.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government remains engaged with the political parties in Northern Ireland.

The Agreements, and the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.  I am currently representing the Government at the ongoing talks&rsquo; process in Belfast to support the formation of an Executive.  I believe that an agreement is within reach &ndash; an agreement that would allow a power-sharing Executive to be formed on a sustainable basis.  All parties are committed to the successful operation of all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and everyone agrees that devolution is the best way to deliver for all of the people of Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of outstanding commitments, respect for linguistic diversity and the Irish language are important elements of the Good Friday Agreement.  An Irish Language Act in Northern Ireland, to be enacted by the British Government, was provided for in the St Andrews Agreement in 2006.  While to date there had been no agreement within the Executive to take this, now devolved, matter forward it is one of the issues currently under discussion at the talks in Belfast.  In that context I have made clear the Government&rsquo;s continued and clear support for a statutory basis for the Irish Language in Northern Ireland, as envisaged under the St Andrews Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  As reflected in the Programme for Partnership Government, the Government remains supportive of and continues to advocate for the advancement of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.  Indeed, the continued value of a Bill of Rights in the context of Brexit was one of the themes which emerged from the All Island Civic Dialogue sectoral on Human Rights under the Good Friday Agreement which took place in February.<\/p>  <p>  A North South Consultative Forum is a further important outstanding element envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement.  In 2008, the then Government sent proposals for such a Forum to the Northern Ireland Executive, but there has been no substantive response.  Between 2009 and 2011, three consultative conferences were hosted in Dublin to support the establishment of the Forum.  While the issue remains on the agenda of the North South Ministerial Council, the Northern Ireland Executive has not been able to give its assent to the establishment of the Forum.<\/p>  <p>  The Government views as a solemn responsibility our role and mandate as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  We will spare no effort to fulfil our duty as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and this includes working to ensure the effective operation of its institutions and the implementation of outstanding commitments.

The European Union Division contains a dedicated team focused exclusively on the EU-UK negotiations, led by a senior officer at Counsellor level.

For some years Hamas has charged customers in Gaza for electricity supplied from Israel, but refused to pass these revenues to the Palestinian Authority, which pays Israel to supply the electricity.  No government can be expected to tolerate this situation indefinitely.<\/p>  <p>  The Palestinian Authority has decided to reduce the amount of electricity it pays Israel to supply to Gaza, and the reduction of supply by Israel to Gaza, which commenced on 19 June, is a consequence of that.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the basis for the problem, the humanitarian consequences for Gaza are potentially very severe.  The consequences not just for household supply, but for pumping of water and sewage, and supplies to hospitals, schools and other utilities, are obvious.  Mains electricity supply was already averaging only four hours per day following the shutdown in April of the only power plant in Gaza due to a dispute between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas over fuel supplies. <\/p>  <p>  Some additional power is being provided to key facilities by generators, but these are not designed to run full time and fuel is in any case short.  In recent days however, it is reported that the power plant in Gaza has been able to resume operations with fuel supplied by Egypt, thus allowing for an increase in supply to users.  It is not clear at this time how sustainable this arrangement is likely to be.<\/p>  <p>  I repeat the call of my predecessor for all sides who have a part in this issue &ndash; the Palestinian Authority, Hamas and Israel &ndash; to act promptly and realistically to resolve this dispute, in the interests of the people of Gaza.

That review was undertaken with the objective of identifying opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within the organisation.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This plan is progressing well.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.  <\/p><p>The strength of the Garda Reserve on 30 April 2016 and 31 May 2017 (the latest date for which figures are readily available) was 883 and 638 respectively.<\/p><p>It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013.  The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways - firstly some 200 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointment Service have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years.  With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track it was possible for the Commissioner and the Public Appointments Service to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves.

For operational and capacity reasons, each person committed to prison for non-payment of fines is considered for temporary release (TR) in line with the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended.  Factors considered in relation to this TR include the nature of the crime giving rise to the committal, the person&rsquo;s criminal history (if any) and the accommodation capacity of individual prisons on the day. <\/p>  <p>  For approximately 30 years prior to its cessation in 2010, it was a practice that persons committed to prison for non-payment of a fine could be released early upon payment of a portion of that fine.  Broadly speaking, the matter of who was recommended to the Minister for temporary release in these circumstances was subject to the discretion of the Governor concerned and on the particular circumstances of the case.  There was no standard approach to the operation of the system. The legislative basis relied upon for this was the Criminal Justice Act 1951, which allowed the Minister to mitigate punitive elements of a sentence handed down by the Courts.  In 2010, the Irish Prison Service ended the practice of the granting of TR based on the payment or part payment of a fine imposed by the Courts based solely on the individual discretion of the prison Governor concerned. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2010, persons sentenced to prison for non-payment of fines have had a number of options open to them, viz: (i) pay the fine in full; (ii) serve the sentence in full; (iii) be granted release only when the fine has been paid in full, through a combination of part payment of the fine and serving of the sentence imposed or (iv) be granted TR for operational reasons as outlined earlier - for example accomodation capacity in the prison.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to option (iii), the IPS has standardised the system whereby a prisoner can be released early through a combination of part serving of the sentence and payment of a portion of the fine.  The system is now estate-wide, automated and based on a standardised sliding scale.  For example, setting aside the issue of remission, in circumstances where two days into a four-day sentence a prisoner seeks to pay a fine, he will be advised that as 50% of the sentence has been served, only 50% of the fine remains to be paid.  The 'sliding scale' methodology used to determine how much of a fine can be considered 'paid' when a portion of the sentence has been served operates uniformly throughout the entire prison system and dispenses with the element of individual governor discretion practised prior to 2010.  All monies collected as a result of fines paid by prisoners is lodged into an Imprest Account, is properly accounted for and then transferred to the Courts Service.  In 2016 the amount involved was &euro;29,864.72. <\/p>  <p>  Needless to say. the extent of the original fine imposed is entirely a matter for the Courts and cannot be altered by the IPS.  The IPS informs me that it is not aware that any prisoner or ex-prisoner is seeking a refund on the basis that the amount they paid on the sliding scale system explained above exceeded the fine determined by a Court.  The issue of refunds therefore does not arise. <\/p>  <p>  The IPS advise that, regardless of the fact that no-one has sought a refund, it has no information itself that any prisoner was overcharged on the system described above.  This could only be definitively established if the individual file of every prisoner ever committed to prison on a fine was manually checked to establish the amount of the fine imposed, the portion paid and the length of sentence served, in order to check whether any calculation error had ever occurred.

The Commissioner is independent in the performance of his functions and the statute does not accord me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, any role in this regard.  Revaluation is a process where all rateable properties in a Local Authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date.  Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area are then carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001). <\/p><p>The revaluation provisions in the Valuation Acts 2001 - 2015 provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as changes in the business environment or infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property.  The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis.  Revaluation is an important instrument in redressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates.  The general outcome of revaluations finalised to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced<i><\/i>following a revaluation and about 40% had an increase, a pattern which is most welcome and is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the programme advances. <\/p><p>The national revaluation programme currently underway is the first general revaluation of all commercial property in the State since the middle of the 19th century, involving the valuation of some 150,000 commercial rateable properties.  Completing the first revaluation and getting properties in every local authority area onto the 5-10 year cycle of revaluations provided for in the legislation represents a sea-change for the rateable valuation system.  All rateable properties in the Dublin, Waterford and Limerick local authority areas are now re-valued.  In addition, 13 public utilities representing some of the largest ratepayers in the State have been revalued on a global basis.  This represents approximately 57% of the national rateable valuation base in monetary value terms or 33% in numerical terms.  Significant progress is being made and the programme has established a momentum which is now being built upon as the current phase of work known as &ldquo;REVAL 2017&rdquo; is nearing a conclusion and which covers the following nine counties - Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Kildare, Offaly, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny.  A second revaluation of the commercial properties in the South Dublin county council area is also underway.  <\/p><p>The Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect on 8 June 2015 has as its primary purpose, the acceleration of the national revaluation programme and it contains a number of measures in this regard.  The Act provided for the Commissioner to conduct a revaluation with the assistance of the occupiers of property using elements of self-assessment.  This provision &ndash; known as &ldquo;Occupier Assisted Valuation&rdquo; - is one of the express provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme.  I understand that the Commissioner intends running a pilot project involving the revaluation of the approximately 2,280 commercial properties in County Laois rating authority area using &rdquo;Occupier Assisted Valuation&rdquo;.  The Valuation Office has conducted the necessary statutory consultations with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and with Laois County Council and is now embarking on development of appropriate technical and statutory systems of valuation to underpin the pilot project and allow for its initiation later this year.  Draft regulations are currently under preparation which when finalised will give effect to these new procedures set out in the 2015 Act. <\/p><p>The Occupier Assisted participative approach also involves the development and implementation of extensive information and communications technology facilities.  The provision of a wide range of on-line supports will be essential to the success of the pilot project, including use of video and audio technology to assist ratepayers in carrying out their elements of the process.  There will be extensive engagement with the ratepayers through an information campaign which will be undertaken to ensure maximum participation during the pilot.  Accordingly, at this stage the Commissioner cannot be precise about the date on which he will sign the statutory Valuation Order to formally commence the revaluation in County Laois.  However, I am informed that he expects to do so later this year.  Following the signing of the order, the Valuation Office intends to undertake a publicity and information campaign during which each individual ratepayer will be written to informing them of the commencement of the project and requesting information in relation to their property.  There will also be a programme of engagement with the various trade bodies and representative associations with the purpose of keeping them abreast of developments.  Regarding the allocated budget for the County Laois pilot, the costs for development work on information and communication technology and on-line supports and ancillary work are estimated to be in the region of &euro;60,000.<\/p><p>Similarly, the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 included an amendment which enables the Valuation Office to enter into contractual arrangements with external parties to outsource work in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Office.  This is another of the provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme.  During the early months of 2016, the Office conducted an extensive procurement exercise, conducted in accordance with EU Public Procurement requirements, which resulted in an award of contract to CBRE, <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Connaught House, Burlington Road, Dublin 4<\/font>to carry out the revaluation of the Carlow County Council and Kilkenny County Council rating authority areas on its behalf.  This contractual work is still underway in these two counties and the new valuations will be published in September 2018. It is anticipated that appeals from these valuations will continue into 2018.  The total value of the contract awarded for this pilot project, as advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union is &euro;1.945 Million (excl. VAT). <\/p><p>Regarding plans to evaluate the performance of the revaluation pilots conducted by the external partner in Carlow\/Kilkenny and by the occupier assisted valuation method in Laois, the position is that because of the independence of the Commissioner under the valuation legislation, I, as Minister, have no direct role in reviewing the work done as part of the revaluation programme, whether by direct assessment, external partners or by using the occupier-assisted method of valuation. I am informed by the Commissioner that such performance evaluations are undertaken as a matter of course following the completion of a revaluation project and evaluations of this nature will be conducted by the Commissioner and his senior officers following the conclusion of the pilots in Laois and in Carlow\/Kilkenny.  It is intended that a review of the Carlow-Kilkenny pilot project will be conducted during the first quarter of 2018, in accordance with the Valuation Office&rsquo;s published Strategic Plan.  The timeframe for an evaluation of the County Laois pilot has not been determined as the project is currently at the advanced planning stage with the substantive work due to commence later this year following the signing of the valuation order which will signal the formal commencement of the project.  I have been informed that there are no plans at present to extend the pilot projects to other revaluations, pending the reviews outlined above.<\/p><p>Following the conclusion of the current phase of revaluation programme, i.e. REVAL 2017, attention will turn to the next two phases of the programme. I understand that the Commissioner intends to include seven rating authority areas in the next phase &ndash; known as REVAL 2019 - which will formally commence later in 2017 and will culminate in 2019 with the publication of a new valuation list for these areas.  The next and final phase of the programme - REVAL 2021 - will include 8 rating authority areas and will conclude in 2021 with the publication of new valuation lists for these areas.

Between 2001 and 2012, 63 Golden Eagles were released in Glenveagh National Park, Donegal.<\/p>  <p>  Between 2007 and 2011, a total of 100 White-tailed Eagle were released in Killarney National Park, Kerry and during the same period 160 young Red Kites were released near Avoca, Wicklow and two locations in north Co. Dublin.  At present, there are 5 territorial pairs of golden eagles, 85 territorial pairs of Red Kites and 10 territorial pairs of White-tailed Eagles being monitored.<\/p>  <p>  The Golden Eagles are the most difficult species to re-introduce, and fledged 12 wild bred chicks between 2007 and 2016; the red kites have fledged 192 chicks since 2010; and the white tailed eagles have fledged 14 chicks in the wild since 2013.  It is hoped that chicks of each species currently being monitored will fledge successfully this year.  Poisoning has hampered the success of the eagle projects and continues to be a threat.<\/p>  <p>  The geographical distribution of the reintroduced birds differs for the three species involved.  Golden Eagles have only been recorded as breeding in County Donegal though, in 2016, there has been some nesting activity recorded in Northern Ireland.  Individuals have been recorded as far afield as Co. Kerry and Scotland.  White-tailed Eagles have bred in County Kerry, where they were first reintroduced, and also in counties Clare, Cork and Galway.  A young territorial pair of White-tailed Eagles has also been recorded this year in County Longford.  The Red Kites have bred mostly in Wicklow, but also in counties Dublin, Meath and Wexford.  There are now territorial eagles in each of the four provinces and the red kite has established a strong presence along several areas on the eastern seaboard.<\/p>  <p>  Clare County Council reported that, in 2015, over 10,000 visitors came to view the pair of nesting white-tailed eagles in east Clare bringing important tourism revenue to the area.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.  The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:<\/p>  <p>  -  Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;<\/p>  <p>  -  Price(s) previously charged;<\/p>  <p>  -  Local market price; and<\/p>  <p>  -  Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.<\/p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. A number of issues have been identified for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:<\/p>  <p>  -  Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;<\/p>  <p>  -  Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and<\/p>  <p>  -  Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities.  This Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the NTPF, and work in this area is ongoing and well advanced.  This pricing review is a significant element of the overall Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, and as such it is important that sufficient time is given to the review to ensure that all relevant aspects of the current pricing mechanism can be considered and examined fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400073#WRP03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Health Policy","counter":881,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400073#WRP03200"},{"type":"question","counter":882,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[30901\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400073#WRP03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide alcohol consumption statistics here and across EU member states since 2005, including those from the World Health Organization; if he will cite the source of each in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":883,"content":"<p>The data requested by the Deputy is provided in the table. <\/p><p>Ireland's level and pattern of harmful drinking has a huge impact on our nation&rsquo;s physical and mental health.

One of these reforms will see legislation brought forward which will support a culture of open disclosure within the health services.  This builds on the current HSE policy which has been in place since 2013, under which all employees, including medical staff, are required to disclose and report incidents in line with the HSE's Safety Incident Management Policy.  Provisions to support open disclosure to patients have been included in the Department of Justice and Equality's Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017.  As the Deputy may be aware, this Bill is currently making its way through the Oireachtas, and was considered at Committee stage on 30 June last. <\/p>  <p>  Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making systems safer.  Open Disclosure is defined as 'an open consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event'.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that when error or harm is experienced by a patient, the trust and confidence of that patient and their family are compromised.  That is why honest, open disclosure and communication, which demonstrate empathy and sensitivity, are so essential.  The intent of the legislation currently under consideration is to provide certain legal protections for healthcare staff for open disclosure.  This will give further support to those staff in their communications with patients and family members if an adverse event occurs.  The Ethical Code of Practice set out by the Medical Council also makes clear the responsibilities of doctors in relation to open disclosure, to support and promote a culture of candour, within which open disclosure can take place.<\/p>  <p>  Reporting of adverse events is also part of a strong patient safety culture.  The Department of Health and the HSE are working to strengthen the reporting of incidents when they occur, to ensure that the needs of patients who have been affected are catered for and to allow for the system as a whole to learn from the particular episode.  The Health Information and Patient Safety Bill, which is at an advanced stage, will contain provisions on mandatory reporting of a prescribed list of very significant adverse events in the public and private healthcare sector.<\/p>  <p>  The open disclosure provisions form part of a number of initiatives to improve the management of patient safety incidents.  HIQA and the Mental Health Commission have recently finalised new Standards on the Conduct of Reviews of Patient Safety Incidents which expand on the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare.  This set of standards along with the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events provided for in the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill and the provisions intended for open disclosure will provide a comprehensive patient-centred approach to preventing, managing and learning from incidents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400075#WRR00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Organ Donation","counter":987,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400075#WRR00350"},{"type":"question","counter":988,"qnumday":381,"qnumall":"[31083\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400075#WRR00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the proposed opt-out system for organ donation which he stated in early\u00a0May 2017 was to be brought\u00a0before Cabinet; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":989,"content":"<p>I propose to seek Government approval to prepare the General Scheme of a Human Tissue Bill in advance of the summer recess.

In his review of cardiology services at UHW, Dr Niall Herity recommended additional investment to increase capacity at the hospital.

A tender was issued in June for the provision of a temporary mobile cath lab which will contribute, on an interim basis, to the further reduction in elective cardiology waiting lists at UHW.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400075#WRR01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Patient Deaths","counter":1000,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400075#WRR01250"},{"type":"question","counter":1001,"qnumday":386,"qnumall":"[31107\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400075#WRR01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if data exists on the number of persons in the south-east that have died from cardiac arrest in each of the years 2007 to 2016 and to date in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1002,"content":"<p>The CSO has provided the following data regarding the number of deaths caused by Acute Myocardial Infarction (International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code I21) for counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford and Waterford for 2007 to 2016:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Carlow<\/th><th>Kilkenny<\/th><th>Wexford<\/th><th>Waterford<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>62<\/td><td>92<\/td><td>58<\/td><td>241<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>64<\/td><td>104<\/td><td>57<\/td><td>260<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>36<\/td><td>37<\/td><td>92<\/td><td>58<\/td><td>223<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>60<\/td><td>86<\/td><td>61<\/td><td>240<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>98<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>225<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>47<\/td><td>60<\/td><td>79<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>225<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>42<\/td><td>96<\/td><td>44<\/td><td>208<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>70<\/td><td>38<\/td><td>164<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015*<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>48<\/td><td>83<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>203<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016*<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>77<\/td><td>37<\/td><td>167<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>* Data for 2015 and 2016 is by year of registration and as such could still be subject to change.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website www.hpsc.ie\/a-z\/vectorborne\/lymedisease\/. <\/p>  <p>  Lyme borelliosis was made been statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment Regulations) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).  The notifiable entity is Lyme neuroborreliosis, the more severe neurological form of Lyme borelliosis.  The HPSC of the HSE collects and collates surveillance data on notifiable infectious diseases.  The number of annual neuroborreliosis notifications over the last few years is as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - 2012 - 08 cases;<\/p>  <p>  - 2013 - 13 cases;<\/p>  <p>  - 2014 - 18 cases;<\/p>  <p>  - 2015 - 12 cases;<\/p>  <p>  - 2016 - 21 cases (provisional).<\/p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the Irish Society of Clinical Microbiologists, the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and the Irish College of General Practitioners agreed a Consensus Statement on the Clinical Management of Lyme Borreliosis, which endorsed the previously referenced, internationally recognised set of guidelines (those of the IDSA) to Medical Practitioners to ensure a standardised approach to the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other similar bacteria, and certain other viral infections, including glandular fever.  In addition, blood samples from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving positive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme. All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics. <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2006.  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.<\/p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer and, very importantly, a representative from Tick Talk Ireland, the primary Support Group for Lyme disease in Ireland.  The Sub-Committee first met on 6 May 2015 and it is expected to report in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  There is significant support and extensive information for health professionals and the public on the HPSC website.  These supports include a fact sheet on tick borne diseases, including Lyme Disease.  This fact sheet gives information on clinical features, the disease, transmission routes, prevention measures, diagnosis, and management and treatment.  There is also an erythema migrans (EM) diagnostic tool to aid health professionals in the diagnosis of EM, which is frequently the earliest clinical manifestation of Lyme borreliosis.  Information for the public includes: <\/p>  <p>  - Lyme Disease Frequently Asked Questions; <\/p>  <p>  - Laboratory testing for Lyme Disease: FAQs for general public; <\/p>  <p>  - Lyme Disease Illustrations; and <\/p>  <p>  - CDC's instructions on how to remove a tick.<\/p>  <p>  Testing for Lyme borrelliosis is currently undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.

The Group noted current challenges in respect of staffing of particular consultant-level posts and the onerous out-of-hours commitment and demanding rotas in some smaller hospitals.  The Group considered that the reconfiguration of services in the context of the Hospital Groups provided an opportunity to address this issue.  The establishment of Hospital Groups is a key enabler for reorganisation of services across hospitals.  Significant progress has been made in the implementation of Hospital Groups, with more co-ordinated approaches to the planning and delivery of services across all the hospitals within a Group.  Hospitals are now working together to support each other, providing a stronger role for smaller hospitals in delivering less complex care and ensuring that patients who require true emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in larger hospitals.  The potential for improved workforce organisation, as part of addressing the staffing challenges in some hospitals, is a key aspect of the continued development of Hospital Groups. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services, especially in remote rural areas and also in disadvantaged urban areas, and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.  I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly qualified GPs.  Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years.  These include increases in the number of GP training places, which have risen from 120 places in 2009 to 171 places being formally accepted for the 2017 training intake as of 13 June, representing an increase of 43% in the last 8 years.  Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible\/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme.<\/p>  <p>  An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced in May 2016.  The new Rural Practice Support Framework includes improved qualifying criteria for rural support and an increase in the financial allowance from &euro;16,216 to &euro;20,000 per annum. Over 300 GPs now benefit from rural practice supports under this Framework.  This is a significant increase on the 167 GPs who received the Rural Practice Allowance prior to the introduction of the new Framework last year.  In addition, the GP contracts review process which is currently underway will seek to arrive at contractual arrangements which will ensure that general practice is an attractive, fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400076#WRS02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services Provision","counter":1072,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400076#WRS02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1073,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[31295\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400076#WRS02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to replace the 11 general practitioners who will be retiring in west Limerick over the next five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1267","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1074,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400076#WRS02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Contracts","counter":1075,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400076#WRS02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1076,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[31296\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400076#WRS02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to review the contracts of GMS general practitioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1267","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1077,"content":"<p>The development of primary care is central to the Government's objective to deliver a high-quality, integrated and cost effective health service.

This independent clinical review was completed by Dr. Niall Herity, one of the foremost cardiologists on these islands and a doctor of international repute.  Dr Herity concluded that the needs of the effective UHW catchment population could be accommodated from a single cath lab.  However, he recommended investment to enhance cardiac services at the hospital to address waiting times and to provide improved access for patients.  Accordingly, an additional &euro;500,000 has been allocated to the hospital for 2017 to provide two additional cath lab sessions per week.  This entails an additional eight hours provision per week or a 20% expansion in operating hours.  It is expected that this capacity will facilitate the provision of an increased volume of scheduled cardiology care at the hospital.  I have asked the HSE to maximise the benefit for patients from that funding, in respect of both additional sessions at the existing cath lab and the temporary use of a mobile cath lab for a specific period.  The mobile cath lab is currently being procured in line with the normal HSE procurement process.<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Herity further recommended that the UHW cath lab should operate as an elective lab which provides all specialised cardiac services except interventional treatment for patients who are having heart attacks (PPCI), and that the current 9 to 5 provision of these services should cease in order to allow the hospital to focus on the much larger volume of planned cath lab work.  This is because highly specialised services such as primary PCI need to be carried out in a small number of hospitals where the volume of patients supports the provision of a safe service.<\/p>  <p>  However, as Minister for Health, I want to be sure that any service changes that are implemented will result in improved services for patients.  Therefore, I have asked my Department to address the implications of Dr. Herity's recommendations by undertaking a national review of all PPCI services, with the aim of ensuring that as many patients as possible have access, on a 24\/7 basis, to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400079#WRV01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1245,"content":"<p>Question No. 473 answered with Question No. 472.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Levy","counter":1246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400079#WRV01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1247,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[31531\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400079#WRV01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Government levy imposed on health insurance policies means the charge accounts for more than a third of the cost of annual premiums for some persons, such as a case (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This overall reduction in emissions from agriculture has also been influenced by measures such as the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme, Agriculture Environmental Options Scheme, Green Low Carbon Agri Environmental Scheme, Organic Scheme, supports for manure management in line with the EU Nitrates Directive, and through development of renewable energy resources.  It is also of note that improvements in sustainable intensification, such as improved fertiliser use and grassland management, have occurred alongside the afforestation of 300,000 hectares\u00a0of agricultural land since 1990, which has helped to maintain agricultural output.<\/p>  <p>  Over the period 2021 to 2030, afforestation since 1990 (i.e. all new forests planted since 1990 and up to 2020) will remove an estimated net 4.5 million tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere per annum based on the current method of accounting in EU Decision 529\/2013.<\/p>  <p> \u00a0As the Deputy will be aware from my previous reply, my Department and its agencies have been strongly focussed on improving the efficiency of Irish farming which is fundamental to reducing emissions.<\/p>  <p> \u00a0Current analysis suggests that the emissions intensity per kcal of food output in 2013 is reduced approximately 14% relative to 2005 and early estimates project that the BAU 2030 emission intensity will be a quarter below the emission intensity in 2005.

The reflection paper\u00a0points to the need to ensure that European Union budget adds value.  That is a principle to which Ireland can subscribe. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The CAP is a policy which has adapted over time to the needs of citizens and contributes to development\u00a0in rural areas, employment creation, environmental sustainability and the provision of safe food that meets the high standards that EU consumers have come to expect.\u00a0\u00a0It also plays a central role in delivering the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth sought under the Europe 2020 strategy. \u00a0It is important that the CAP continues to evolve in a way that supports the achievements of European priorities, particularly in the context of securing a strong CAP budget for the post-2020 period.\u00a0 This can only be achieved by reinforcing the relevance and effectiveness of the policy in helping to achieve broader societal goals.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  For now, it is worth noting that the amount of CAP funding per Member State for pillar 1, direct payments, and pillar 2, rural development, is fixed until 2020 in Regulations of the Council and European Parliament.\u00a0 Any change to these figures will require a co-decided amendment to these Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  While formal discussions on the Multi Annual Financial Framework have not yet commenced, Ireland supports the retention of a strong and well funded CAP and its position on this matter has been articulated\u00a0at official and political level and is well understood in other member States and in the Commission.  I will be working hard with my European counterparts to ensure that the CAP budget post 2020 provides a solid and effective foundation for the development of the sector into the future, when discussions do commence.\u00a0 In addition officials in my Department are also working closely\u00a0with the Department of Finance on the next\u00a0MFF.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400079#WRV04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Horse Sport Ireland","counter":1286,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400079#WRV04150"},{"type":"question","counter":1287,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[31552\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400079#WRV04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he will take following the publication of a report (details supplied) on an organisation.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1288,"content":"<p>The report by Indecon International Consultants, &lsquo;Review of Certain Matters relating to Horse Sport Ireland&rsquo; was published by my Department\u00a0on 27 June 2017.

People living in rented accommodation are twice as likely to live in a home that is E, F or G rated on the Building Energy Rating (BER) scale.  Households living in relatively energy inefficient properties spend &euro;160-&euro;419 per annum more on energy than households in a home rated with a BER of B.  This leaves those living in rented accommodation more vulnerable to energy poverty.<\/p>  <p>  That is why the Government&rsquo;s Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty commits to piloting an initiative to allow landlords participating in the Local Authority led Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) schemes to receive free energy efficiency upgrades.<\/p>  <p>  My officials are currently working with Local Authorities to agree the terms and conditions for this pilot.  This would be trialled initially with a small number of Local Authorities and the findings from this would inform consideration of a wider roll-out.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding minimum energy efficiency standards for\u00a0rented properties, the Government is\u00a0considering such regulations\u00a0as the typical residential tenancy in Ireland is short and hence tenants do not tend to invest significant sums in the property they are living in.  At the same time, landlords under-invest in energy efficiency works as the tenants are the ones who benefit from the consequent energy bill savings and in a constrained rental market there appears to be little value placed on the energy efficiency of a rented property.  These diverging incentives mean that energy efficiency investment is much lower in the private rented sector than among homeowners, even though Government grant schemes such as the Better Energy Homes scheme are open to landlords.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has worked with external consultants to examine the impact of introducing minimum energy efficiency standards to counteract this market failure but this must be balanced against the impact such regulations would have on the price and availability of rented properties.<\/p>  <p>  With the publication of the 2017 Census, my Department is working to update the research findings and incorporate this new data.

Meeting this specification will be challenging but the lessons learned will play a crucial role in determining how the State can effectively support homeowners who want to upgrade their homes to this standard on a wider basis.<\/p>  <p>  Undertaking a retrofit on this scale is a complex, demanding task and householders without any background or experience in energy issues would find it extremely difficult to undertake such an upgrade without support.  SEAI is not resourced to provide this degree of engagement to individual homeowners.  Therefore, requiring a counter-agent to co-ordinate and act on behalf of a householder ensures that a source of expert support and advice on deep retrofit is available to them throughout the upgrade process.  As the Deep Retrofit scheme develops and as undertaking these deep retrofits becomes more commonplace it may be that the need for this advice and support requirement is lessened and it may be appropriate to widen the eligibility to include individual homeowners.  This matter will be kept under review by my Department and SEAI.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the rate of subvention, I believe that the current rates, 50% for homeowners and 95% for those in energy poverty, are appropriate.  This rate of subvention is considerably higher than the average grant paid under the Better Energy Homes scheme and reflects the reality that the scheme is trying to build and develop a market for deep retrofit in Ireland.  However, increasing the average support level above these levels would push it into a rate that is not sustainable in the long run, which in turn introduces regulatory uncertainty for scheme co-ordinators and contractors and would not represent good value for money for the taxpayers who are funding the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0&euro;5 million has been allocated to the scheme for 2017.  It is my intention that the deep retrofit scheme will run for several years and will test a variety of new and innovative ways of promoting deeper retrofits.  These learnings will then be incorporated into the design of future nationwide support schemes.  The budget for the programme will be reviewed by my Department on an annual basis and will reflect the anticipated level of demand for the scheme and the resources available to support energy efficiency support schemes generally.  As I noted in my speech to the recent SEAI conference on deep retrofit, the future of this scheme is in the hands of counter-party's, be they Local Authorities, community groups or private ventures.  I have made funds available for the scheme, the SEAI has published the scheme&rsquo;s principles and now we need to\u00a0persuade homeowners to make the commitment to undertake\u00a0deep retrofits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":1321,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1322,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[30856\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW03100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans for fibre optic broadband at Tullycross, County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1323,"qnumday":502,"qnumall":"[30982\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if there is a plan in place for broadband in an area (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1324,"qnumday":503,"qnumall":"[31041\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW03300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will expedite the roll-out of fibre broadband to an area (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1325,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[31235\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW03400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the timeframe for the roll-out of at least 30 Mb broadband speeds to a location (details supplied) in County Donegal as part of the national broadband plan; if such areas with poor or no broadband coverage will be prioritised during the roll-out phase as part of the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1326,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 499, 502, 503 and 509 together.<\/p><p>The\u00a0Government's National Broadband Plan will provide high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that to date approximately 1.4 million or 61% of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second and this footprint is expanding.<\/p><p>In\u00a0April,\u00a0eir\u00a0signed a\u00a0agreement with me committing them to follow through on\u00a0their commercial plans to provide new high speed broadband infrastructure to 300,000 premises in rural areas.  eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over\u00a0a 90 week period with an average of 500 premises passed per day.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department's website .  The decision by eir to invest in infrastructure to deploy high speed broadband services to an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland was taken\u00a0by eir\u00a0on commercial grounds.  Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard.<\/p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300,000 roll-out will be published on the Departments website.  The Q1 figures have been verified by my Department and the eir roll-out\u00a0is in line with the Commitment Agreement.<\/p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie.<\/i>This map finalises the\u00a0State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process.  The Map\u00a0shows the extent of \u00a0the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.<\/p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process.<\/p><p>The map shows that 21% of Tullycross in the townland of Gorteenannaglogh, Co Galway and the Eircode in Co Donegal referred to by the Deputy falls within an AMBER area and will be part of the State led Intervention under the NBP.  The remaining 79% of the townland of Gorteenannaglogh, Co Galway including the company referred to by the Deputy in Co Cavan falls within eir's plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and\u00a0end\u00a02018 (Light BLUE on map).  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <i><\/i>.  Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.<\/p><p>With the finalisation of the map and following extensive dialogue with bidders, the procurement is progressing to the next stage.  On 20 June 2017 my Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their &quot;Detailed Solutions&quot; by 26 September 2017.  The &quot;Detailed Solutions&quot; stage is the last stage of the procurement process before Final Tenders.<\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP, once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.<\/p><p>The rate of demand for data services has increased\u00a0exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites.<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I established an Implementation Group\u00a0to drive and monitor the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.  I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13 June 2017, which is available on my Department's website at <i><\/i>and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017.<\/p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation Targets","counter":1327,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1328,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[30916\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW03700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his Department's objectives for the roll-out of solar farms in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1329,"qnumday":501,"qnumall":"[30923\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW03750","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his Department's targets regarding the provision of energy through solar power to the national grid; the number of applications to join the national grid from potential supplies of solar power in County Tipperary from solar farms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1330,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 500 and 501 together.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a02009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.  Good progress has been made to date, but the\u00a0target remains challenging, particularly in light of economic growth and a growing demand for energy.  Latest figures by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)\u00a0indicate that over 27% of our electricity came from renewable sources in 2016.  This progress, while welcome, will need to accelerate in pace in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The 2016 Programme for Government and 2015 Energy White Paper recognise that solar has the potential to provide a community dividend, thereby also enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future and it is increasingly recognised that Solar PV has the potential to contribute to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy and climate change objectives.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030.  The design of the new scheme is underway, and includes an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This appraisal involves comparing the cost of supporting Solar Photovoltaics (PV) - both rooftop and ground mounted, offshore wind, onshore wind and a range of other commercial renewable technologies, to ensure that\u00a0the\u00a0new scheme\u00a0delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.  The assessment also includes analysis of the optimum financial support mechanisms for renewable technologies, in line with the 2014 EU State Aid Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will publish shortly\u00a0a final public consultation on the design principles of the new RESS.  Following the outcome of this\u00a0public consultation, and before any new scheme is introduced, it will need to secure Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission.  Subject to this, it is expected that the new scheme will become operational in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the level of interest in the solar PV sector in Ireland.  I am advised\u00a0that nationally there have been over 600 applications, amounting to about 4,290 Megawatts of solar capacity, seeking a connection to the electricity grid in the last 24 months.  Within Tipperary, there have been 41 solar grid connection applications to date, with a combined capacity of 284 MW.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the level of solar applicants seeking connection to the grid, my stated position is that while solar has a role to play in Ireland's energy future, we cannot have a situation where a new support scheme leads to a disproportionate increase in people&rsquo;s electricity bills through the Public Service Obligation levy.  In designing the new RESS, the cost implications for people and businesses will, therefore be a high priority and I will ensure that the new scheme is designed in a cost efficient manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1331,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 502 and 503 answered with Question No. 499.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Incentives","counter":1332,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1333,"qnumday":504,"qnumall":"[31043\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW04500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if the consultation process has concluded on the renewable heating incentive; the timeframe from conclusion to implementation for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1334,"content":"<p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is a commitment in the Programme for Government.

The outcome of this review was a decision to develop a new air quality monitoring programme which aims to enhance and build on the current arrangements.  The new national Ambient Air Monitoring Programme (AAMP) is being developed under Section 65 of the EPA Act, 1992 as amended.  Placing the programme on this statutory footing emphasises the importance that the EPA places on the monitoring of air quality in Ireland.<\/p><p>The AAMP covers the years 2017 to 2022, with the enhancement and expansion of the monitoring network to be prioritised in the first phases of the programme.

This Directive aims to provide &ldquo;a common framework to avoid, prevent or reduce, on a prioritised basis, the harmful effects of exposure to environmental noise&rdquo;.  A key source of noise covered under the END is road traffic noise.<\/p><p>The Environmental Noise Regulations 2006 transpose the END into Irish law.  The Regulations designate noise-mapping bodies and action planning authorities for the production of strategic noise maps and action plans.  Primary responsibility for both noise mapping and action planning is assigned to local authorities.  A number of other bodies also have noise mapping functions which are carried out on behalf of the local authorities concerned.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII - formerly the NRA &ndash; National Roads Authority) is a designated noise mapping body under the 2006 regulations.<\/p><p>The Regulations also designate the Environmental Protection Agency as the National Authority for the purposes of the Regulations.  The Agency's role includes supervisory, advisory and coordination functions in relation to both noise mapping and action planning, as well as the reporting requirements for the purpose of the Directive.<\/p><p>The Regulations set out a two-stage process for addressing environmental noise.  Firstly, noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps every 5 years for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria, e.g. large urban areas (referred to as agglomerations), major roads, railways and airports.  The current third round of Noise maps are due to be updated this month and officials from my department have been actively involved in this process with the EPA and other national bodies.<\/p><p>Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned.

The scheme provides energy efficiency upgrades free of charge to people who meet the eligibility criteria.  Typical measures available under the scheme include attic and cavity wall insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets and low energy light bulbs.  To date the scheme has provided energy efficiency upgrades to 120,000 homes.<\/p>  <p>  Since the scheme is 100% Exchequer funded it is designed to be available only to those in most need of Government assistance.  To determine this with complete accuracy SEAI would need to know the condition of a person's home, including its energy efficiency level and heating system, that person's family circumstances and their household income level.  However, it would not be practical or efficient for SEAI to perform this assessment for each applicant to the Warmer Homes scheme.  Therefore eligibility for the scheme is determined through the use of proxy indicators, principally the National Fuel Allowance.  These proxy indicators provide an acceptable approximation that allows SEAI to find and identify people in energy poverty without having to resort to a cumbersome, expensive and intrusive administrative regime.<\/p>  <p>  Eligibility for the National Fuel Allowance is determined by the Department of Social Protection through use of a means tested income assessment. Everyone in receipt of a non-contributory state payment is accepted as satisfying the means test.  In addition, if a person is on an employment support scheme or getting a Back to Education Allowance they are entitled to the Fuel Allowance.  Any household with a combined weekly income of up to &euro;100 above the maximum State Pension (Contributory) is also eligible for the Fuel Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Fuel Allowance, anyone in receipt of the Family Income Supplement, Job Seekers Allowance for over six months (and with children under 7 years of age) or anyone in receipt of the One Parent Family Payment is also eligible for the Warmer Homes scheme.<\/p>  <p>  These additional eligibility criteria were selected as there are health and well-being consequences to living in a cold and damp home and children can often be particularly vulnerable to these conditions.  In addition, lone parent families suffer from a particularly high deprivation rate in Ireland.  In the Government's Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty, I have committed to ensuring that the eligibility criteria for the Warmer Homes scheme remain consistent with the latest findings on deprivation in Ireland.  This is consistent with the aim of ensuring that the limited resources available to the scheme are targeted at those in most need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1343,"content":"<p>Question No. 509 answered with Question No. 499.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Data","counter":1344,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1345,"qnumday":510,"qnumall":"[31269\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400080#WRW05700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if there is a senior official with designated responsibility for Brexit matters in his Department; if so, the grade of the designated official; the funding allocated to the said Brexit unit; the cost to date in 2017; the anticipated cost; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1346,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s Brexit Contingency Framework set out that all Departments identify a senior official to oversee Brexit matters and to create a Top Management sub-committee to deal specifically with the implications of Brexit for their areas of work.

In this regard, my\u00a0Department\u00a0recently completed a public consultation process as an initial step in producing the first ever National Clean Air Strategy. This Strategy will provide the framework for a set of cross-Government policies and actions to reduce harmful emissions and improve air quality and public health to meet current and future EU and international obligations.  A document entitled &lsquo;Cleaning Our Air&rsquo; was published as part of this process which explored the impact of a number of sectors, including agriculture. The purpose of the document was to initiate discussion and ascertain the views of the various stakeholders while providing a background to the numerous approaches to improving air quality. To facilitate a structured response, a series of questions were set out at the end of each chapter. At the end of the chapter on the agricultural sector the question was posed &lsquo;Should a future end date on the use of splash plate slurry spreading be considered following the completion of schemes to incentivise low emission alternatives?&rsquo;  This question should not \u00a0be construed as a &lsquo;suggestion&rsquo; or indeed a policy intent either by myself or my\u00a0Department.

Whilst my Department is not an employer of childcare workers, we are a significant funder. I am committed to the development of high quality services in this country and it has been proven that high quality care is dependent on a workforce that feels valued.  My Department is working with the sector to explore how we can improve retention rates.  The Programme for Government contains 14 commitments to improving access to high quality, affordable childcare.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme, which is currently under development, will provide an important infrastructure for future investment in the Early Years sector.<\/p><p>  It is clear that we need to focus collaboratively on how best to make the early years sector a more attractive and personally rewarding place in which to work. \u00a0I think that pay is only one issue, although, clearly an important one. \u00a0The fact that we are investing considerably increased resources in the sector will also be important. \u00a0In Budget 2017 I secured a 35% increase in childcare funding, up by &euro;120m to &euro;466m. \u00a0This was on top of a 35% increase in Budget 2016 also. <\/p><p>  These increases reflect the emphasis I am placing on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff. \u00a0In this regard, the City &amp;amp; County Childcare Committees are assisting services who experience difficulties in recruiting or retaining staff, and the Learner Funds are in place to support staff in achieving minimum qualification requirements, both regulatory and contractual. <\/p><p>  The existing workforce are a significant resource and substantial investment in upskilling and CPD opportunities for early years practitioners has been put in to the sector by my Department, e.g. through the Learner Fund, the National S&iacute;olta Aistear Initiative and the Leadership for Inclusion in Early Years Settings, known as LINC under the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM).  The Department of Education and Skills (DES) are undertaking a review of education programmes in Early Childhood Education and Care to ensure that the quality and content of further and higher education programmes prepare early years professionals for practice in the sector.  My Department welcomes this work including the recent establishment of a Working Group chaired by DES that has been tasked with the development of a draft set of Criteria and Guidelines for higher education programmes that offer Initial Professional Education for early years professionals, that will be available for wider consultation with the sector before the end of the year.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  Childcare workers are part of a growing sector, which the Government is strongly supporting. \u00a0I believe that by working together we can ensure that it is a viable and strong sector which makes a significant contribution to the care and personal development of our children. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400082#WRY01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visiting Teacher Service","counter":1436,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400082#WRY01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1437,"qnumday":541,"qnumall":"[30941\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400082#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on whether it was the correct decision to abolish the visiting teacher service for children from the Traveller community; if education outcomes for Traveller children have improved since it was abolished; and her further views on whether this should be restored or a replacement education programme is required.","asker":"1225","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1438,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware,<b><\/b>the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers was discontinued with effect from September 2011, in line with Department of Education and Skills policy on the phasing out of segregated Traveller provision. <\/p><p>The Child and Family Agency, established in 2014 under the aegis of my Department, has statutory responsibility in relation to school attendance and supports for young people at risk of educational disadvantage, including traveller children.  Through its Educational Welfare Service, the Agency responds to instances where children, including children from the Traveller community, are not attending school regularly, leading to concerns for their educational welfare. <\/p><p>I am advised that the Department of Education policy in relation to Traveller Education is informed by the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy which was launched in 2006 following wide ranging consultation with Traveller representative groups and other relevant stakeholders.  The principle of inclusion is at the core of the Strategy.  The focus of both current and future provision is on the development of an inclusive school environment through the whole school planning process, teaching practice, admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation.  In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system for children are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need.  This includes Traveller children who require additional resources based on need and not on their identity as Travellers.  Segregated Traveller specific programmes such as the Visiting Teacher for Travellers were phased out in line with the principle of inclusion.<\/p><p>I am further advised by the Department of Education and Skills that funding for special education in provision in 2017 will amount to some &euro;1.68 billion, which is equivalent to approximately 19% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training and represents an increase in spending in this area of 12% over the last two years.

The schemes support the provision of youth services for young people who are at risk of drugs, alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people&rsquo;s lives.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people and should be considered for on-going public funding.  The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead to ensure an evidence-based and outcomes focussed programme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people. <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the recommendations in the review have commenced over the course of 2015, 2016 and this year.  The National Youth Strategy Lead Team, established in July 2016, has a specific sub-group to support implementation of the VFMPR.  My Department has initiated a detailed consultation at national and regional level with the youth sector and providers of youth services about the review's findings and recommendations.  Consultations have taken place with the national youth organisation, local youth services and youth officers of the Education and Training Boards that administer funding on behalf of my Department, and with other youth interests.  A youth consultation process is also underway to inform the development of the VFMPR implementation.<\/p>  <p>  To facilitate the review&rsquo;s recommendations regarding the future development of a single targeted youth funding programme to replace the current schemes, I have given approval for funding to be provided for the establishment of several sample projects in 2016 and 2017.  These sample projects will provide youth services in areas of need as identified by the Education and Training Boards with responsibility for those regions.<\/p>  <p>  In implementing another of the review&rsquo;s recommendations, my Department embarked on an exercise, in conjunction with Pobal and each Education and Training Board Youth Officer, to map youth service provision across the State.

Facilitating parental choice of childcare provider is a key objective of the ACS, and the equal inclusion of childminders is therefore a central feature.  For this reason it is incorrect to say that the ACS favours day care over other childcare choices. <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the number of Tusla-registered childminders is still small.  However, I established a working group to make recommendations on how to support the development of childminding in the short, medium and long term, and I hope to build on that group's work in supporting a larger number of childminders to become registered and to participate in the ACS over the years ahead. <\/p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme provides financial supports for paid childcare rather than care by parents or relatives.  However, the specific purpose of the ACS is to reduce the cost of childcare to parents, and it must be seen in the wider context of other policy measures that are aimed at supporting parents who choose to care for their children at home. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard it should be noted that, according to the European Commission, childcare costs in Ireland are currently the highest in the EU for lone parents and the second highest for couples, and the European Commission has, for several years, been recommending action by the Irish Government to address the high cost of childcare, both to support labour market participation of parents and to help reduce child poverty. <\/p>  <p>  Supports for parents who choose to care for their children at home include the Home Carer Tax Credit, which was increased in the last Budget, as well as provisions for maternity benefit, parental leave and the recently introduced paternity leave.  It should be noted that the Programme for Government commits to extending paid leave for parents in the first year of a child's life, which will be a key financial support enabling parents to care for their children at home in the critical first year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400082#WRY02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Provision","counter":1453,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400082#WRY02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1454,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[31019\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400082#WRY02600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the need for youth facilities and programmes in the Newcastle, County Dublin area; her plans to put funding and resources in place to address these growing needs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1455,"content":"<p>In 2017 I was delighted to approve funding of &euro;800,000 for the establishment of new youth projects and for the augmentation of a small number of existing youth services to meet new challenges arising from population increases.

Recipients of this payment qualify for credits where they have at least one paid contribution in the two years prior to commencement of caring or have had credited contributions in that period.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid carer&rsquo;s leave from work.  <\/p>  <p>  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record, where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods spent caring.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits can assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes such as the State pension contributory (SPC).  In the latter case, once someone has 520 paid contributions over the course of their working life &ndash; the first condition for eligibility for the SPC, credits have the same value as paid contributions when the calculation to determine the yearly average number of contributions paid or credited.  The year average determines the rate of pension payable. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, all carers, including those who are not on a welfare payment or who do not qualify for credits, may qualify for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for the SPC and applies to homemaking periods since 6 April 1994.  It equally applies to both men and women.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme provides that years spent working in the home while caring on a full-time basis for a child up to 12 years of age or an incapacitated person age 12 or over will be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions. <\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to cost, even on a tentative basis, the granting of contributions for periods spent on carer&rsquo;s allowance or on other homemaking periods as the impact on the rate of State pension which would be payable (and associated costs) would be largely dependent on periods spent in the paid workforce in the past and potential future periods in similar employment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400085#WRBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Census of Population Data","counter":1616,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400085#WRBB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1617,"qnumday":608,"qnumall":"[31407\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400085#WRBB01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the policy response which occurs further to the publication of the census of population; the section or sections of her Department involved; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

While it is open to any Clerical Officer in my Department to apply for a transfer to a location outside Dublin in another Department, details of the number of staff seeking such transfers are not available within the Department.<\/p>  <p>  As you may be aware, Action 15 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan has a commitment to develop a new transfer\/mobility scheme within the Civil Service.  Work on this scheme is ongoing with the Civil Service Management Board, Departments and staff interests. <\/p>  <p>  It is hoped that Phase 1 of the new scheme which will cater for the Clerical and Executive Officer grades will be launched later in the year.  Phase 2 of the scheme will be developed following implementation of Phase 1 and will include the general service grades of Higher Executive Officer, Administrative Officer and Assistant Principal Officer.<\/p>  <p>  The new scheme will be centralised and will have the facility to report on numbers on lists per Department and location following its successful launch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400085#WRBB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","counter":1635,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400085#WRBB02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Guidelines","counter":1634,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400085#WRBB02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1635,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[30833\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400085#WRBB02600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has taken account of recent cases with regard to future policy on wind turbine construction in view of the settlements made in recent court cases in regard to wind turbine construction and the effects of noise and shadow flicker; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1232","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1636,"content":"<p>My predecessor as Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment recently announced a &quot;preferred draft approach&quot; to the review of the 2006 <i>Wind Energy Development Guidelines<\/i>.

All applications, regardless of whether by an individual or a company, are\u00a0assessed in accordance with the provisions of the Act and any environmental legislation in force at the given time.\u00a0 In regulating this activity\u00a0there is a need to ensure, in so far as possible, that the resource is managed appropriately with the twin aims of protecting the marine environment and allowing for a sustainable\u00a0level of\u00a0harvesting of\u00a0seaweed. <\/p><p>The Deputy's questions relate to a specific license granted to an\u00a0indigenous Irish company .\u00a0In 2008, the company\u00a0submitted a foreshore license application to harvest in Kenmare Bay.  No licence issued in respect of the Kenmare Bay application.  However, the Marine Licence Vetting Committee, a group of marine experts who advise the Minister of the day on the technical and environmental aspects of foreshore applications,\u00a0recommended that any future application by the company, should focus on an area outside of a Special Area of Conservation and include a commitment to conduct a detailed programme of monitoring. <\/p><p>The license to harvest in Bantry Bay, originally received in June 2009, met with these and other criteria and was processed in the same thorough way as other foreshore lease and license applications received at that time.  Normal public consultation procedures were followed\u00a0with the application being advertised in a local newspaper (The Southern Star) and it was also made available for inspection at a local Garda Station (Bantry) for a period of 21 days.  No submissions were received from members of the public during the consultation period. <\/p><p>In line with the\u00a0usual procedures, the application was also circulated to various bodies for their views and input. \u00a0Submissions were received from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Underwater Archaeology Unit of the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Marine Survey Office, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute.  The Marine Licence Vetting Committee considered all material pertaining to the application and concluded that subject to compliance with specific conditions the proposed harvesting was not likely to have a significant negative impact on the marine environment.  This would\u00a0include no significant impact on\u00a0juvenile fish, lobster and other species. <\/p><p>The Marine Licence Vetting Committee recommended that a licence should issue and approval in principle was given by the then Minister\u00a0in 2011. The final legal papers, the licence between the State and the company\u00a0giving effect to the decision were completed by the\u00a0then\u00a0Minister\u00a0in 2014.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive applies to a wide range of public and private projects.  It is a mandatory requirement for project types listed in Annex I of the Directive.  For project types listed in Annex II, it is up to the consenting authority to determine if an EIS is required by carrying out EIA screening based on criteria set out in the Directive.\u00a0 An EIA may also be required where the thresholds set out in the Directive are not met (sub-threshold EIA) or where the project or activity is proposed to be carried out in a Natura 2000 site.\u00a0 <\/p><p>If the consenting authority determines that the EIA Directive applies to a project, it requires that an applicant must prepare and submit an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), following which, the consent authority would carry out an EIA.\u00a0 In this case, the proposed project was\u00a0not within a Natura 2000 site, was\u00a0not of a class set out in Annex I of the Directive nor does it fall into Annex II. \u00a0An EIS\u00a0was not required and while it was open to the Minister at the time to carry out an EIA, it was not considered necessary.<\/p><p>The licence allows the company\u00a0to harvest specific quantities of specific species of kelp seaweed on a rotational basis in Bantry Bay.  The licenced area is split into five distinct harvesting zones and not all of the seaweed in the bay will be harvested.  The total area licenced is 750 hectares (roughly 1,850 acres).  The licence provides for a four year rotation of zones with a stand by zone only to be harvested if weather is adverse (99 hectares\/240 acres). On average, some 175 hectares\/432 acres will be subject to harvest annually, less than 1% of the area of the bay. <\/p><p>The rotational harvesting plan,\u00a0ensures that only a portion of the bay is harvested each year. \u00a0To strengthen the sustainability of the harvesting plan for the licenced area within the bay, the harvesting is also subject to a strict monitoring programme,\u00a0and requires approval of a baseline study prior to commencement of operations.

This increase is in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of supporting an additional 15,000 households to be supported by HAP in 2017.  The HAP scheme is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies. <\/p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector.  The\u00a0tenancy is between the tenant and the\u00a0landlord and is governed by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While eligible homeless\u00a0households may source accommodation for themselves, a dedicated placement team, the\u00a0Place Finder Service, assists homeless households in areas\u00a0where there is a\u00a0high demand for properties but low levels of supply\u00a0making the rental market very challenging, and where the provision of such a service is justified.  Currently, a Homeless Placefinder Service is operated in the Dublin region\u00a0by\u00a0the Dublin\u00a0Regional Homeless Executive,\u00a0and in Cork City Council area.<\/p>  <p>  The Place Finder Service seeks out potential properties suitable for households currently identified as homeless.\u00a0 The service liaises with individual households to establish their specific needs and to ensure that any additional supports which may be needed are put in place, it establishes relationships with local property agents and landlords and it assists the household in securing the tenancy.  Additional discretion of up to 50% above HAP rent limits is available to the Dublin local authorities to assist in housing homeless households in the Dublin Region.\u00a0 The\u00a0Place Finder Services can also pay a deposit and rent in advance on behalf of the tenant, meaning that that homeless households are provided with the best chance of finding a new home with the security that HAP provides.<\/p>  <p>  In cases\u00a0where\u00a0a tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area, I have directed local authorities to provide that HAP tenants continue to be dealt with by their originating local authority.  However, the rent limits will be those that apply in the local authority where the property is situated. \u00a0The originating local authority will engage with the relevant new local authority to facilitate eligible requests for inter-authority movement.  Where homeless households have sourced or been assisted by the\u00a0Place Finder Service\u00a0in sourcing accommodation outside the Dublin area, the relevant rate of support is based on the rent limits that apply in the local authority where the property is situated.  The DRHE have been advised to consult with the new local authority in relation to the appropriate level of support that should be provided.

Residential construction output reached unsustainably high\u00a0levels, with peak output of 93,000\u00a0new homes in 2006, and \u00a0then dropped to 8,300 in 2013, including a large proportion of single houses.\u00a0 As a result,\u00a0the construction of starter and affordable homes at scale came\u00a0to a virtual standstill. <\/p><p>The Government has made housing a top priority,\u00a0bringing forward the range of measures\u00a0under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness in July 2016.  The overarching objective of Rebuilding Ireland is to increase overall housing supply to a more sustainable 25,000 homes per year by 2021.  The 25,000 target was the ESRI estimate of the housing requirement based on demographic change, household formation and a level of obsolescence of existing stock. The longer-term objective is to create a functioning and sustainable housing system, where supply more closely meets housing demand over time. \u00a0<\/p><p>In order to directly influence and generate\u00a0supply of new homes, Rebuilding Ireland contains a suite of actions that will increase housing construction and refurbishment, bringing forward the supply of thousands of extra homes.  Under Pillar\u00a02 of the Action Plan, 47,000 new social housing units will be delivered by 2021, supported by &euro;5.35 billion in Exchequer funding. In terms of direct construction and refurbishment,\u00a026,000 will be provided as part of the 2021 target.\u00a0 So far, good progress has been made and there are now over 10,000 new homes\u00a0in the social housing construction pipeline, details of which are available at the following link; .<\/p><p>Pillar\u00a03\u00a0contains a set of actions targeted at increasing private housing supply.  The &euro;226m Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund has now been fully allocated and will fund key enabling infrastructure to open up 34 sites across 15 local authorities.  The LIHAF funding has the capacity to encourage the supply of 23,000 new homes by 2021. <\/p><p>Also under this Pillar, the State land bank is being actively targeted for the provision of new homes in the immediate term.  In April, the Rebuilding Ireland Map was published, containing details of over 2,000 hectares of land in\u00a0public ownership, with the potential to deliver up to 50,000 new homes nationally.  As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, the commitment to bring forward an affordable rental scheme is being progressed through kick-starting\u00a0 supply on such lands held by local authorities. <\/p><p>In practical terms, the development of these\u00a0public lands will\u00a0mean accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points.  Where local authorities have large sites in their ownership,\u00a0there is a real opportunity to bring them forward for mixed tenure housing, at much more affordable price points, where the Council can directly influence the housing provision through the procurement process and development agreements.  All local authorities have been requested to prepare Strategic Development and Management Plans for residential lands in their ownership to ensure they are brought forward for development at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p>A key factor in terms of housing supply at scale, of both houses and apartments, is the cost of construction and the associated issue of viability.  In this regard,\u00a0a Working Group on housing delivery costs was established, led by my Department,\u00a0to carry out a detailed analysis of housing delivery input costs with a view to identifying economies across a range of constituent areas such as finance, planning, design, land costs and levies.  The Group comprises representation from all key public sector and industry stakeholders and is scheduled to complete its Report in the coming weeks. <\/p><p>Recent housing activity reports, available on www.rebuildingireland.ie, show that strong supply-side measures under Rebuilding Ireland are beginning to have a positive impact with all output indicators showing steep upward trends.  However, it is crucial that we continue to focus on supply and particularly the supply of social and affordable homes at scale. <\/p><p>To this end, the Taoiseach signalled the Government&rsquo;s intention to carry out a focused review of Rebuilding Ireland,\u00a0as we approach the completion of the first year\u00a0of its implementation.\u00a0 This work is now under way, with an emphasis on strengthening the measures already in place\u00a0 and identifying new initiatives that add value and raise ambition.  As part of the review process,\u00a0my Department will focus in particular on the broad issues of housing supply and affordability for different market segments, building on the measures already being advanced. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400087#WRDD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Safety","counter":1741,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400087#WRDD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1742,"qnumday":656,"qnumall":"[31087\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400087#WRDD03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the way in which fire safety certificates can be awarded on developments, such as a development (details supplied) in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown in view of the fact these buildings were in breach of fire regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1311","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1743,"content":"<p>My Department has overall responsibility for the statutory regulatory framework governing Building Regulations, Building Control and Fire Services.

Neither I nor my Department has any direct role in relation to enforcement matters and cannot interfere in individual cases.<\/p>  <p>  In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved: the homeowner, the builder, the developer and\/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.

No. 9 of 2014), which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.<\/p>  <p>  A Certificate of Compliance on Completion is jointly signed by the builder and the assigned certifier.

The Unit is the primary point of contact between the Department and the CSO and as such is regularly in contact with that Office in relation to a variety of different issues, including assisting with queries of a statistical nature and developments such as the National Data Infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  Census results are of interest right across the Department but particularly inform policy considerations in respect of planning, housing, water, local government and franchise functions.  Census data is centrally relevant to much of the planning arena both in relation to strategic planning such as for the National Planning Framework (NPF),but also in preparing for the forthcoming Regional, Spatial and Economic Strategies to be prepared by the three Regional Assemblies.  As part of the formulation of the NPF, the finalised Census 2016 results are under review to ensure the most recent and accurate data is considered and reflected in any evidence-based proposals that may form part of the draft NPF and subsequent Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to housing, up-to-date Census information is utilised across all areas of policy development. In April and May of this year for example, the CSO released two major Census 2016 publications of relevance to the housing area.  These were Census 2016 Profile 1 - Housing In Ireland and Census 2016 Profile 2 - Population Distribution and Movements both of which can be accessed via the following weblink: www.cso.ie\/en\/census\/census2016reports\/census2016publicationschedule.  These reports contain important data in terms of the context in which housing policy is formulated and they will be a key data source to inform the recently announced review of Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  My Department collaborates actively with the CSO and, by way of example, engaged extensively with the Office prior to Census 2016 being conducted, in view of the CSO&rsquo;s intention to publish a specific Homeless Persons report.  The Department is represented on the CSO's Housing Data Group and the CSO in turn participates in the Department's Housing Data Analytics Group.<\/p>  <p>  Census data also informs policy considerations in the franchise area.  The publication of preliminary census results triggers the establishment of a Constituency Commission under the Electoral Act 1997 and the Commission is required to present its report on D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies within three months of publication of final census results.  Other franchise considerations informed by Census data include, for example, voting age and citizenship requirements for voter registration and voting rights.<\/p>  <p>  Census information also informs the preparation of terms of reference for any review of local electoral areas to be undertaken and provides a basis for the work of any Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee established by the Minister or any other local government review committee which may be established from time to time.  Population changes are also one of a range factors that my Department considers in the context of Local Property Tax allocations, which are kept under review to ensure equitable treatment of all local authorities, recognising also that the resource requirements of local authorities vary significantly across the State. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, regarding the water function in my Department, the Census results provide statistics on the number of households connected to different types of piped water supplies and to different types of sewerage facilities.  This data is vital in relation to policy on public water and wastewater services, the group water sector, private wells and small private supplies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400088#WREE03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Adaptation Grant Data","counter":1814,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400088#WREE03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1815,"qnumday":682,"qnumall":"[31428\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017070400088#WREE03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the annual allocation under the housing adaption scheme made by his Department to each local authority in each of the years from 2002 to 2016, and to date in 201, in tabular form.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1816,"content":"<p>The Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability were introduced on 1 November 2007.
