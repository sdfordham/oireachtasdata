This has wide-ranging ramifications in terms of future security policy and our capacity to withstand many types of violation of our security system.  This is a wake-up call given the ease with which people could enter the country with the connivance of people working at the airport, either with carriers or in any other capacity.  It seems an extraordinary gap in our system that could facilitate such illegal activity organised by global crime gangs targeting Dublin and Ireland generally as an easy route.<\/p>  <p>  As the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has indicated, while evidence has not emerged yet it may not just be people being smuggled in this manner or by other routes.  There could be firearms, drugs or large sums of cash coming in through similar systems to bypass controls.  Tom Clonan, a well respected security analyst, made the point that Ireland through no fault of the Garda would be Europe's weakest link.  He is quoted as saying in response to this revelation that we do not know who is here.<\/p>  <p>  Are we wide open for terrorists?  I know that is a different paradigm from smuggling people but if they can bypass us so easily on that front it seems we need to review our national security to make sure we rid ourselves of any complacency in the system about terrorists exploiting such gaps and lapses in security for their nefarious purposes.  Brexit is coming down the track with potentially very significant immigration issues arising, and issues pertaining to controls.  It is alleged that the British security system has notified Dublin of its concerns about weaknesses in our national security.  Will the Taoiseach ensure, and is the Minister for Justice and Equality committed to, a comprehensive national security review to ensure these types of lapses in security do not occur again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400003#A00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1485266400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I agree with that.  This appears to have been quite a sophisticated operation.  Somewhere between disembarking from an aircraft and going through passport control some people were apparently diverted and exited the airport and this seems to have been going on for quite some time.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, a Garda operation targeting illegal immigration led to the arrests of three people, including two employees of Aer Lingus, at Dublin Airport on Sunday night.  As there is an ongoing criminal investigation, I cannot say too much at this time.  I understand this matter is the subject of a Topical Issue matter allowed by the Ceann Comhairle later today.  There will probably be an opportunity for a discussion of a greater length at that time.<\/p> <p> We should commend the Garda on its work in this regard.  The smuggling of people, by definition, crosses international boundaries.  The Garda is working with other police forces.  It has a close connection with Europol and Interpol on various strands of its investigations.  It is worth pointing out that immigration officers in Dublin Airport process approximately 15 million passengers per annum.  Approximately 3,500 passengers were refused permission to land at Dublin Airport last year, with more than 4,000 passengers being refused permission to land across all points of entry.  Constant vigilance is required.  Cases like this are uncovered and investigated on foot of such vigilance.  Responsibility for the security of the airport itself is a matter for the airport authorities.<\/p> <p> Significant resources are being invested to secure our borders, for example, through the increased use of technology.  The sharing of data with other jurisdictions is very important.  We have a particularly close operational relationship with the UK authorities in managing the security of the common travel area between Ireland and the UK, which is so important for the future.  The gathering and sharing of relevant information is an important aspect of this co-operation.  The immigration and security information sharing arrangements in place between Ireland and the UK are strong and are evolving constantly.  That is as it should be.  Ireland introduced new regulations last year to enable the UK to collect advance passenger information from Irish carriers in respect of passengers entering the UK from Ireland.  The Government is committed to providing the Garda with the necessary resources to enhance its connectivity to a range of EU and other international resources.  A great deal of work is going on in this regard.  This includes connecting to the Schengen information system and to other EU and Europol information sharing resources that are relevant to countering the terrorist threat.  A series of measures is being rolled out at EU level to build on the current framework.  Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority are co-operating fully with the Garda in this investigation.  When further details become available, the Government will see to it that an overall security assessment of the airports of Ireland - the regional airports and our main airports - is carried out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400003#A00300","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485266700,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I am surprised that a national security review has not been initiated already.

The Taoiseach said in his reply that \"the security of the airport itself is a matter for the airport authorities\".  He might clarify that for me because I think it needs to be looked at fundamentally in the context of national security and when it violates national policy.  In Britain, MI5 and the intelligence networks are involved in protecting the integrity of the nation's security and borders.  We do not know how long this went on.  The Taoiseach has said that 15 million passengers are processed each year.  The passengers in this case were not processed and never wanted to be processed.  The whole objective of the exercise was to bypass being processed.  Given the ease with which this seems to have happened, I think it is a wake-up call for our system.  The Garda needs to be involved in this.  The proper guardians of the State - the intelligence system within the State - need to take this over.  There needs to be an overview of what is happening.  There needs to be a rigorous review of security at our ports and airports.

It has also been clear that if this is allowed to happen, the land frontier between the European Union and British state will be on the island of Ireland.  It will run from Derry to Dundalk, and that has also been obvious.<\/p><p>What has been the Government's response to this?  Generally speaking, it has been to wait and see what the British might say next.  It has been to watch their game instead of concentrating on our own game.  The Taoiseach and the Fianna F&aacute;il leader have bored us to tears - they have certainly bored me - with their idle speculation about what the British might do next, accompanied by lamentations that Britain is leaving the European Union.  In fairness, the Taoiseach set up the civic dialogue after initially dismissing the idea when Sinn F&eacute;in first proposed it.  I know the Taoiseach has said the priorities are trade, the economy, the common travel area, the peace process and the future of the European Union.  That is fair enough but it does not match the significance or historical importance of what is happening.<\/p><p>Last week the British Prime Minister made a significant speech in which she reiterated her position.  She also repeated her intention to withdraw form the European Court of Justice and she has already committed to scrapping the Human Rights Act and withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights.  These are fundamental parts of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Taoiseach's response has been disappointing and dismal.  Clearly, we need to protect, as best we can, our trading relationship with Britain.  That is taken as a given.  We also need to resist the effects of Brexit on this island and State.  All of the remaining 27 EU member states will decide the conditions of Britain's exit.  I will quote the Taoiseach's former colleague, EU agriculture Commissioner Mr. Phil Hogan, who has stated:<\/p><blockquote>There is a risk that Ireland could allow our relationship with Europe to be defined by our relationship with the UK.  Instead, we should have the confidence to recognise that post-Brexit Ireland will need to have in place different relationships with our EU partners.<\/blockquote><p>I suggest to the Taoiseach that the starting point for the Government must be to actively seek special designated status for the North within the European Union.  That will uphold the democratic rights and vote of the citizens there.  It will also ensure that the frontier between the European Union and Britain will not be on the island of Ireland.  That is crucial for both parts of this island.  It is also in our national strategic interests that the Government takes an all-island view of the future.  I again ask the Taoiseach to assert this approach by embracing the proposition that the North should be given a special designated status within the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400005#C00200","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1485267000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I do not accept the Deputy's starting premise.  For the past 18 months, Ireland had been preparing for the possibility that there might be a Brexit vote.  On the day after the vote, we published a comprehensive document setting out the main priorities, in so far as we saw them, arising from that decision of the UK people.  On 9 September 2016, I delivered a detailed paper at the Oxford Union setting out the priorities that we see as important.  The Deputy's party was represented at that conference.<\/p><p>I also set out the need for deeper analysis of the key issues, challenges, risks and opportunities for Ireland.  I referred to the need for greater levels of public consultation and engagement around those issues.  I outlined the need for deeper interaction with all our EU partners, the EU institutions and, increasingly, with the Barnier task force in order to ensure that our concerns were fully understood and respected.  In addition, I highlighted the need to consider the economic implications for economic policy more generally and, where appropriate, specific measures to deal with the Brexit-related developments.  Some of these were contained in the budget 2017 measures and others can be found in the action programme of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which assesses the implications involved.<\/p> <p> Other parties have detailed papers in respect of the issues that will arise in the agri-sector - with particular reference not only to the economy of the North and South but also to that of the east and west - in respect of which we have a trade surplus of over &euro;1.3 billion.  Obviously, by setting out all of that long before the UK Prime Minister was even elected, we committed to maintaining our place as one of the 27 member states of the European Union.  As I said, our collective goals remain the same.  In her speech last week, the Prime Minister referred to the current uncertainty relating to the Northern Ireland political situation.  She reinforced the view that I have already outlined for Deputy Adams.<\/p> <p> The Deputy makes a point about special designated status.  When he gets the opportunity, I would like him to explain what he means by that.  We have particular circumstances that are recognised in Northern Ireland arising from the Good Friday Agreement.  Northern Ireland is the only location in the European Union where they apply.  The rights of the citizens both North and South - which they voted for - are enshrined in that internationally-binding agreement.

Let us follow the Taoiseach's rationale.  The people also voted to stay within the European Union.  There are numerous precedents for the special designated status that we are advocating, including, for example, the case of Denmark and Greenland.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach lauded the Good Friday Agreement.  The British Government is in default and this Government is in default in respect of many grounds and elements of the Good Friday Agreement.  What I am trying to focus in on is that the Government is accepting that the land frontier between the European Union and the British state will be on the island of Ireland.  That is implicit in what the Taoiseach says.  He should not accept that.<\/p>  <p>  If the Government accepted our proposition, for which there is precedent, it would not affect the constitutional issue and the Government would ensure that the land frontier would not be not on the island of Ireland.  There are technical, strategic and national interests to support the logic and common sense behind that.  The Taoiseach refrained from embracing the proposition but I want to give him another opportunity to do so.  Why does the Taoiseach not make it clear that his Government will accept the case for a special designated status within the European Union?  He should make it a central plank of the Government's negotiating strategy and policy.

I read today that the Taoiseach is about to commence a commission of investigation into certain Garda matters following the O'Neill report.  Yesterday, the Garda Commissioner was on the airwaves telling us how wonderful everything is and how wonderful she is herself, bombing us with doublespeak.  Meanwhile, the harassment of whistleblowers continues.<\/p>  <p>  Last December, in reply to a question of mine, the T&aacute;naiste said, \"the Garda Commissioner is entitled to her good name - as, indeed, are people making allegations entitled to theirs - unless facts properly established prove otherwise\".  Mr. David Taylor was interviewed for 21 hours.  A file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions in September 2015 with no decision yet.  Nothing has been proved against him.  Is the Garda Commissioner allowed to ride roughshod over fair procedure in this area?  The Commissioner said yesterday, \"I've absolutely no knowledge nor was I privy to any campaign to undermine any individual in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\".  Mr. Keith Harrison wrote to her 14 times detailing his harassment and bullying.  He has been out sick since May 2014.  He is on &euro;188 per week and has three kids at home.  Mr. Nick Keogh has got nothing but grief since he reported malpractice.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner was boasting yesterday about taking part in the fight against heroin.  However, she has protected the chief superintendent who has been involved in the heroin case in Athlone.  Last year, she placed a superintendent on the promotion list who has been accused on numerous occasions of harassing a whistleblower.  In June 2015, the Garda Commissioner appointed an assistant commissioner to carry out an investigation into the allegations surrounding the chief superintendent and the garda from the drug squad in Athlone.  It was the same assistant commissioner who had been accused of earlier leaking information back to the superintendent who was the subject of the complaint.  In October 2015, the Commissioner stated that she had commenced an investigation into this alleged conflict of interests.  There has not been a word of that since.  I wonder where it is.<\/p>  <p>  Following its investigation into the matter, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, asked for disciplinary procedures to be taken against them.  Who did N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan appoint to look after it?  Yes, the very same assistant commissioner, who also happens to be retiring in April, will probably will not even get to the end of the process and will delay it all even further.  This month, GSOC asked to oversee the disciplinary procedure.  Its request was refused.  When is the Taoiseach going to publish the report?  Will he include the protected disclosures of all whistleblowers in the investigation?  If he does not, it is only a case of kicking the can down the road, because we will eventually have to do it.  Does the Taoiseach intend to leave the Commissioner in place while the investigation goes on?  It would make a mockery of it if he does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400007#E01100","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1485267900,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I have confidence in the Garda Commissioner.  There has been significant change to the procedures for members of the Garda who wish to report allegations of wrongdoing.  The Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which came into operation on 15 July 2014, was part of the then Government's comprehensive approach to enhancing the protection available to whistleblowers, including members of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Under that Act, GSOC is now the prescribed body authorised to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.  Accordingly, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer, if they so choose, or may make a disclosure to GSOC.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC, the Act provides that GSOC may investigate the disclosure, if it appears to GSOC desirable in the public interest to do so.  People are protected under that Act and cannot be bullied, sacked or dismissed.<\/p><p>It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all of the protections for whistleblowers in the Act.  These include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from being dismissed and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.  In light of the public interest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having robust policies and procedures in place to support and protect whistleblowers, and to ensure that their complaints and allegations are fully investigated, the T&aacute;naiste asked the Policing Authority on 2 June last year to examine and report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers and whistleblowing.  The T&aacute;naiste also asked that it make any recommendations it considered appropriate in order to ensure that the policies and procedures in place are protected.  The Policing Authority completed its review and reported to the T&aacute;naiste on 11 November 2016.  The report was published on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality and has since been laid before both Houses in accordance with the Act.  On 7 December 2016 the T&aacute;naiste received from Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill the report of his review relating to the two protected disclosures cases which were made to the T&aacute;naiste by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in early October.  Mr Justice O'Neill was asked to review the allegations of wrongdoing and to include any recommendations which he considered appropriate.  The report, I understand, sets out in detail the allegations contained in the protected disclosures.  I am sure that the House will appreciate that in the view of the nature of the allegations and the fact that third parties are mentioned the T&aacute;naiste referred this to the Attorney General for advice on how to proceed, including the question of what material may properly be put in the public domain having regard to the rights of all concerned.  The Attorney General has given some response to that but has some further matters to conclude on.  The specific proposals will come to Government shortly including putting the conclusions and recommendations of Mr. Justice O'Neill into the public domain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400007#E01200","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485268500,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Before Deputy Wallace comes back in I want to make a point to him please.

The background to the assault case related to the planting of drugs by a garda.  I ask the Taoiseach again when he intends to publish the report.  Does the Taoiseach intend to leave the Commissioner in place?  It will be laughable if he does.  If all is so well, as the Commissioner likes to tell us, can the Taoiseach or the Commissioner explain to me why so many whistleblowers are out sick and why they are not at work?  Why does N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan not ring the whistleblowers?  How is it that she has never even rung them?  She has not rung any of them.  Would the Taoiseach consider asking the Commissioner to ring the whistleblowers who she says she cares so much about?  It is a bit scary that what she says in public is one thing but the reality on the ground could not be much different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400008#F00500","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1485268500,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The Act protects garda&iacute; - if they make a report to GSOC or to the Commissioner - from having their identity revealed.

The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union is the most pressing political, economic and social issue to be confronted and managed by Ireland in the next decade.  Ireland is intimately linked to the UK in many ways, most particularly in respect of agriculture, which is the lifeblood of rural Ireland.  Without a sustainable agricultural sector, the action plan for rural development will not succeed.<\/p>  <p>  The comprehensive plan, with its 276 recommendations, is very welcome.  It is a compendium reference document against which actions and implementations will be judged in the coming years.  In the Taoiseach's words, there is something in the plan for everybody.  It refers to rural-proofing Government decisions but does not address Brexit-proofing the agrifood industry.  Our absolute proximity to and substantial dependence on the UK make Ireland very vulnerable to decisions that country will make solely with its own interests in mind.  The requirements of the EU and Ireland are very far apart on this matter.  Both the EU and the UK want a hard Brexit, but we want a soft Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Even before the UK triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, we in Ireland are feeling the effects of the uncertainty Brexit is causing, with a weakening sterling making the agrifood sector less profitable.  It is envisaged that exports to Britain will fall by 30%, unemployment will rise and there will be a deepening regional inequality and a decline in economic growth.  The agrifood industry will be the worst hit.  Already, Irish food exports have dropped in value by &euro;575 million since the Brexit vote.  The mushroom industry has all but collapsed, and beef, pigmeat and poultry exports will follow as the UK seeks cheaper imports from Brazil and Argentina.  Our beef exports are 50% dependent on the UK market.  Meanwhile, &euro;10 billion of UK contributions to the Union's agriculture budget will be withdrawn, resulting in cuts to single farm payments to Irish farmers.  Will the Taoiseach indicate the particular measures he intends to take to protect Ireland and the rural agriculture industry from Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400009#G00100","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1485269100,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Yesterday's publication of a comprehensive document to achieve the potential of rural Ireland, covering 600 towns and villages throughout the country, speaks for itself.  The question is how that plan will be impacted when the shape of the new relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union is eventually decided.  All of the analysis carried out in economic studies by bodies and individuals, ranging from the ESRI, to IBEC, Teagasc and Professor Alan Matthews, indicates an adverse impact on the agri-economy in Ireland.  The Deputy referred specifically to the mushroom industry and commodity pricing, the latter being of great concern to the Minister, Deputy Creed.  In the short term, the immediate concerns for agrifood exporters centre on exchange rates and the significant drop in the value of sterling against the euro, which have created particular difficulties for sectors such as the mushroom sector that are relatively more exposed to the UK market.  The Minister has made &euro;150 million available in the form of low interest, long-term credit.  Specific measures were included in the 2017 budget for implementation in 2018.  In addition, Bord Bia has activated a four pillar strategy to deal with many of these issues.<\/p><p>There is a particular dependence on the UK market for sectors like horticulture and forestry and in respect of the sizeable quantity of product, such as butter, cheese and seafood, that is sent to the UK for further processing or packaging and returned for finishing, the ingredients that are sourced in the UK for incorporation into Irish products, the products transiting through the UK <i>en route<\/i>to European Union markets, the transnational producer organisations, the transport of horses for racing and sale, and the very significant Northern Ireland dimension.<\/p><p>These areas are all the focus of a forum set up by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine dealing with beef, pork, dairy and all these other sectors where there is a constant engagement.  This is of exceptional interest to us here in Ireland given that we have a trade surplus in the agrisector of &euro;1.3 billion with the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p> The British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, having clarified some of the issues here, such as removing Britain from the Single Market, the question of the customs union and trading relationships is one that we will have to negotiate hard about and imaginatively in respect of our objectives.  In that regard, from speaking to the Irish Farmers Association the other night, it recognises price commodity is an issue, as are many of the issues I have raised here.

However, what is happening within Bus &Eacute;ireann flies in the face of that commitment.  Last week, the Taoiseach gave an assurance to Deputy Troy that there would be no reductions or cuts in services or routes across the regions of rural Ireland.

I also thank my colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, for co-sponsoring the Bill and for his help in its preparation.  The Bill is drawn from legislation which he drafted and which passed Second Stage in the Seanad in 2015.<\/p><p>Small and medium-sized enterprises play a vital role in our economy, driving on growth and employing some 900,000 people across the island.  However, many of these enterprises face significant administrative and legal barriers in competing for State contracts.  The purpose of this legislation is to address the absence in our procurement guidelines of a social value clause, which other European countries have included in their procurement legislation.<\/p><p>Section 3 which deals with the community benefits requirements sets out how a social value clause would work.  It would require any State body, local authority or Department issuing a tender to take into account the benefits of awarding the contract to the local and national economy when assessing bids.  My colleague, Deputy O'Brien, and I have met representatives of printing companies in Kildare, Dublin and Sligo, which have effectively been excluded from tenders for libraries due to contractual procurement requirements.  This is a story repeated for much of the &euro;8.5 billion the State spends each year on goods and services.  Ireland ranks high in Europe in respect of the proportion of public goods and services procured outside the State.  While it is a small open economy committed to the European Union, EU, it is not always possible to award contracts and tenders to Irish companies.  The objective of this Bill is to achieve a level playing pitch.  This will enable Irish companies to compete fairly alongside European businesses in line with the rules of the Single Market.  The full adherence to EU regulations is an important point in light of the rise of protectionism which we have seen recently.  The Bill follows EU precedent.  Denmark has successfully introduced social value clauses, as have the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium.  I look forward to engaging with the Government and other parties to strengthen the legislation, address any issues with it and help to ensure it can deliver its objectives of empowering the Irish small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, to compete fairly and fully in future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400016#O00900","speaker":"1324","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485272700,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400017#P00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485272700,"counter":112,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400017#P00300","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485272700,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1485272700,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400017#P00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1485272700,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400017#P00600","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1485272700,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u2013 Questions","time":1485272700,"counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400017#P00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committee Meetings","time":1485272700,"counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400017#P01000"},{"type":"question","time":1485272700,"counter":119,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[40127\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400017#P01100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform took place on 12 December 2016.

What precisely does that mean in terms of publication?<\/p>  <p>  I welcome media reports that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality brought a memorandum to Cabinet this morning to include within the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill a definition in law of sexual consent and, subject to seeing the detail, I hope it will fill a serious gap in the law because it is almost 30 years since the Law Reform Commission recommended changes in this regard.  Can the Taoiseach tell Members when the amendments will be published and perhaps tell them whether it includes creating new criminal offences targeting online sexual predators?  In light of all this, can he indicate when he expects the Istanbul Convention to be finally ratified? <\/p>  <p>  I am advised, from the Garda Inspectorate report of 2014, that there is a deficit in the recording of incidences of domestic violence.  The Central Statistics Office has said no specific assessment of the quality of domestic violence incident reporting has been conducted.

I expect to have a report on this tomorrow.  As I understand it, the security of the airport premises is a matter for the Dublin Airport Authority.  Deputy Howlin is well aware that garda&iacute; are always in attendance in the airport area because of their connection with Interpol and Europol and so on.

We will bring that before the House so that everybody understands it. <\/p>  <p>  The domestic violence Bill will be published this week.  This morning the Cabinet approved the recommendation from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality in respect of the statutory definition of consent to a sexual act.  The draft heads of that will mean that a person consents to a sexual act if he or she freely and voluntarily agrees to engage in that act.  The person does not consent to such an act if he or she allows the act to take place or submits to it because of the application of force to him or her or some other person or because of the threat of the application of force to him or her or to some other person or because of a well-founded fear that force may be applied to him or her or to some other person; if he or she is asleep or unconscious; if he or she is incapable of consenting because of the effect of intoxication or of having consumed some other substance; if he or she is suffering from a physical disability which prevents him or her from communicating whether he or she agrees to the act; if he or she is mistaken as to the nature and purpose of the act in question; if he or she is mistaken as to the identity of any other person involved in the act; and if he or she is unlawfully detained at the time at which the act takes place and if the only expression or indication of consent or agreement to the act comes from somebody other than the person him or herself.  That section does not limit the circumstances in which it may be established that a person did not consent to a sexual act.  These and other matters were approved by Cabinet this morning.  I expect the T&aacute;naiste will bring the amendment forward as soon as possible.

I am very much aware of the public concern highlighted by the recent publicity surrounding defined benefit schemes.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of occupational pensions in this country is on a voluntary basis and depends on the willingness of employers and employees to contribute to, and maintain schemes for their members.  Traditionally, many such schemes were organised on a defined benefit basis.  This is now much less common.  In recent decades, defined benefit provision has been under pressure because of volatility in the stock markets and increasing liabilities arising from demographic pressures, longer life expectancy, lower interest rates and regulatory requirements.  Accountancy standards, which make pensions liabilities very apparent on a company's balance sheet, also contribute to the pressures under which defined benefit schemes are operating.  During the financial crisis, the decline of defined benefit pension schemes accelerated to the extent that the whole pension sector was possibly at risk.<\/p>  <p>  As a consequence of all these factors, the movement from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes has become a feature of the pensions landscape, even in cases where firms are very profitable.  Almost all defined benefit schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease contributions, usually after a notice period.  There is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease.  Where changes to these schemes are being sought by employers, I am strongly of the opinion that they should first engage in discussions with the trustees and employee representatives or unions.  The introduction of a debt on employer - as proposed by some - would raise a range of issues including possible negative consequences for defined benefit schemes, some of which may not be beneficial for members or the employees in the companies concerned.  Neither the Minister for Social Protection nor the Pensions Authority has the power under legislation to intervene to freeze the winding-up of a scheme or to compel the employer to make contributions to a scheme.  In recent years, however, the Government has amended pension legislation to protect the pension sector and to ensure fairer and more equitable outcomes for all scheme members.  These changes make more resources of the scheme available in the initial distribution of assets to active and deferred scheme members.  At this stage, further regulation may only serve to add to the pressures on defined provision and could be counterproductive.<\/p>  <p>  While there are strong arguments in favour of the introduction of greater employer obligations, it is also important that we consider the less desirable side effects.  These could include: prompting well-funded schemes to wind up to avoid future new obligations; threatening a company&rsquo;s financial stability; rendering some employers insolvent; or giving a competitive advantage to employers that never provided a pension or put defined contribution schemes in place.<\/p>  <p>  While I have no immediate plans to bring forward amending legislation to enhance the provisions in the Pensions Act regarding defined benefit schemes, I assure Deputies that the issues in respect of defined benefit schemes are continually scrutinised by my Department, especially in the current environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400022#U00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1485275700,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I take the Minister's point about these being voluntary and depending on the willingness of the employer to engage in them, but everything the Minister has said applies equally to the defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom.  The UK has introduced legislation to prevent a solvent company from winding up a defined benefit scheme until such time as it makes up the deficit that is owed to the scheme.  Why is Ireland different to the UK?  If the UK can do it, surely Ireland can follow suit.  If it is right and fair and proper that it should be done by our neighbouring jurisdiction, what is the insurmountable barrier that is preventing us from doing it here?  Has the Minister taken any cognisance of how the system has worked in the UK?  What has he learned from that?  Does he not think that such a system could be used here, with the appropriate adjustments for the particular circumstances in Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400022#U00900","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1485275700,"counter":226,"content":"<p>There are two points.  First, it is important to point out that the law in the United Kingdom has been different for a very long time.  When employers established those defined benefit schemes decades ago, they knew they would have a liability in terms of making up any deficit.  We know, unfortunately, that even though the law in the United Kingdom is different, employers there have found any number of ways to get out of that obligation.  This was seen in a number of scandals in the United Kingdom where companies used mechanisms to avoid their obligations.  Even though the law is very different, it is not necessarily successful.  In this State, we must consider what the impact would be if we were to change the rules, effectively retrospectively, and impose a liability on employers for past liabilities accrued.  Consider a situation where, for example, a company is solvent but where the pension fund associated with it is not.  One could turn the company insolvent and the consequences would be that the employees would lose their jobs, receive only the statutory redundancy and, potentially, lose their pensions also.  Consider the consequences for a company that plans on expanding.  Having that liability added to its balance sheet would mean it could not expand any more.  Consider the difference between two companies, let us say, for example, two airlines.  Perhaps I should not use airlines as an example because I do not mean what people may think I mean.  Consider one factory next door to another.  One is a good employer that traditionally has a defined benefit pension scheme and the other does not and never did.  If one imposes an employer liability on the factory that had the defined benefit scheme, it would be placed at an enormous disadvantage against the factory next door that never provided anything for its employees' pensions.  Thus, the good employer would be punished and the bad employer rewarded.  All those issues must be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400022#U01000","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1485275700,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Solvent employers can legally walk away from their liability to fund defined benefit pension schemes, as required under the employment contracts with current or former employees, simply by deciding to wind up the scheme.  It is possible because most defined benefit scheme trustees and rules allow an employer to wind up a pension scheme and cease contributions while ignoring any deficit in funding of the scheme and its inability to pay the benefits promised.  It is most unsatisfactory that an employer's liability to fund the deficit of a scheme on wind-up is determined solely by the trustees rather than by legislation.  Ireland is one of the few countries that does not underpin this right with legislation.  My pensions amendment Bill will deal with this.  I put it to the Minister that accountancy standards require employers to recognise the liabilities of pension schemes either on their financial statements or balance sheets.<\/p><p>Removing those liabilities from the balance sheet has a major transformative effect for the employer, as we saw in a recent case.  That malaise is spreading across the country, which Deputy O'Dea knows from events in his constituency.  These companies are running amok because there is an incentive to walk away from a defined benefit pension scheme.  My Bill includes a provision to end that incentive and allow for the crystallisation of the debt there and then, which would enable the trustees to sue the company for the debt.  Does the Minister agree this is a simple way to deal with the matter once and for all?  Deputy O'Dea is right that we are no different from the UK or anybody else.  The companies that are running away from these schemes are profitable.  They are skidallying out the door and leaving their unfortunate workers behind.

The Minister's position seems to be that we should do nothing because there were technical difficulties with the UK legislation which allowed people to get around it.  Surely, with the knowledge of those technical difficulties, we can draft proper legislation which addresses the issues?  I take the Minister's point about driving companies into insolvency.  There has been a great deal of discussion around the UK legislation, including a detailed review by a parliamentary select committee, and the possible consequences of its provisions.  The UK Government has indicated it will introduce legislation to provide the necessary modifications to the existing legislation and ensure the threat is greatly reduced.

Meanwhile, where there is double insolvency, that is, an insolvent fund and an insolvent company, the State has to ride to the rescue.  That anomaly must be remedied and the only way to do so is through the legislation Deputy O'Dea and I are bringing forward.  The Minister could have his input and we could resolve the matter in the Chamber.  I am astounded the Minister, above all people, is becoming a prisoner of the bureaucrats in his Department.  I never thought I would say that about him because he generally takes a great independent stance.  I ask him to throw off the shackles of the Department and work with us to deal with this matter.  We will co-operate with him to resolve it.  It needs to be done within the next month because there is a cascade coming.  These companies are running for the hills and they are not troubled firms.

This commitment is recognised in both the programme for Government and the national carers strategy.  Carer's allowance is a means-tested payment, made to people who are providing full-time care and attention to elderly people or people with disabilities and whose income falls below certain limits.<\/p>  <p>  The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied.  The means test is one of the least onerous in the social protection system.  For a single person, &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means.  The equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.  A married couple with two children could have weekly earnings of &euro;1,135 net of PRSI, union and superannuation contributions and still qualify for the lowest rate of carer's allowance.  In other words, a family earning &euro;59,000 per annum would meet the eligibility criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable improvements have been introduced for carers in recent years.  In budget 2016, the carer's support grant, which is payable without a means test, was increased to &euro;1,700.  Other measures benefitting carers include extending the period when carer's allowance can be paid following the death of a care recipient from six to 12 weeks.  In addition to the Christmas bonus and the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate, budget 2017 introduced a measure that extends payment of carer's allowance for 12 weeks where the care recipient enters permanent residential care.

Therefore, it is my intention to bring forward proposals for an auto-enrolment retirement savings system.

However, we have not reduced the budget for the LES or reduced the number of case officers.

Moreover, they need it because the people who are still unemployed are those who are most distant from the labour market and require far more one-to-one attention.

For example, the Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy prioritises long-term unemployed people.  It does this most notably through the roll-out of JobPath to engage more systematically with this group, targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus and reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on employment and training programmes.  Under the Youth Guarantee there is monthly engagement by case officers with unemployed young people to assist them to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment.

There are two State pensions.  First, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Second, the State pension contributory, which is not means-tested and is paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  Accordingly, it is important to ensure those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension. <\/p>  <p>  The marriage bar describes a rule that existed in most of the public service, and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage.  It never applied to self-employment and the practice was abolished in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC.  As it was a rule rather than law, married women could either return to work or take up other work, and many did.  It is worth remembering that public servants recruited prior to 1995 paid and still pay a reduced PRSI rate of 0.9% with no contribution from the employer.  Accordingly, they are not entitled to the State pension, regardless of gender and marital status.  In these cases of public servants recruited prior to 1995, had they not got married, they still would not be entitled to a State pension.  This also applies to men.  In such cases, therefore, the marriage bar would not generally have impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment.  Instead, by impacting upon their continuing public service employment, the marriage bar&rsquo;s pension implications, where they exist, more generally relate to a person&rsquo;s eventual entitlement to a public service pension.  Any questions regarding this issue are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.<\/p>  <p>  I have confirmed my intention to develop, publish and commence the implementation of an action plan for the reform of pensions.  This action plan will include a roadmap for the reform of the State pension.  It is planned that a total contributions approach will replace the yearly average approach from around 2020.  The position of homemakers will be carefully considered in the context of that reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400027#Z01150","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1485278700,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  There are several issues which slipped through the net but which we have discussed in the past.  There is a question about the methodology of the calculation of an entitlement to a contributory pension.  It is meant to be over the years within which a person worked, starting from the beginning to the conclusion.  Take the case of people who may have worked for five years at the beginning of their working life, took a gap of 15 years and went back to work afterwards.  Often, they may have actually worked longer than some of those who qualify for a full pension.  However, by virtue of the methodology in the calculation, they find themselves having a reduced pension or, in some cases, a very much reduced pension, depending on the extent to which they have had contributions.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue relates to the business sector.  Take the case of a shopkeeper.  Under the 1998 Act, the shopkeeper would have been eligible to make contributions and entitlement would have followed to a contributory pension.  However, the partner in the business, say the spouse, in many cases is refused on the basis that he or she could not prove a partnership.<\/p><p>There are two categories that need to be looked at very carefully.<br\/><br\/>The final point relates to the marriage bar.  We know the situation in respect of people affected by the latter.  It should be noted that many of those public servants got refunds of contributions when they married and withdrew the public service and that this ended their entitlement to anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400027#Z01200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485279300,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I will give the example of a constituent who started working in 1966 and has an average of 25 contributions, which means she is on a reduced rate of &euro;196 per week.  She was self-employed for a number of years which means she does not have the maximum contributions and believes this is unfair in view of the fact that others who did not work for as long are in receipt of pensions at a higher rate.  I will touch on a point that was made previously.  One can argue that she was disadvantaged in a way that is true for many cases with which I deal.  Somebody who worked for a couple of years early in life and then went on to raise a family would probably have ended up much better off if those first three or four years had not been worked because the average would have only been based on the time after the family was reared and the person when into employment.  Those first few years, in the cases I have come across, tended to involve quite low-paying jobs but the person went out at 17, 18, 19 or 20 to get into the workforce and it ended up costing them a great deal in terms of their pensions.  That makes averaging a particularly harsh and unfair mechanism.<\/p>  <p>  I will look at some elements.  Farming families are impacted upon here, as are small businesses.

If someone was a partner in a business, it should be easy enough to establish whether that person paid PRSI.  If an individual did not pay PRSI, he or she is not entitled to a contributory pension.  People do not get contributory pensions unless they pay PRSI.  That is how a contributory pension works.  It should be easy enough to establish their record if they paid PRSI.  We have very good records in that regard.  Once one has been paying PRSI for ten years, one is entitled to a contributory pension.  If one did not pay, one is not entitled.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of the marriage bar, any public servant, male or female, recruited before 1995 is not entitled to a contributory State pension.  Whether they are male, female, married or single, they are not entitled to it.  A person might be entitled to a pension from the Department of Education and Skills - if he or she was a teacher or - the HSE or the Civil Service.  However, a public servant recruited before 1995 is not entitled to a contributory State pension, whether they are a man or woman, married or single.  The system was totally different then.  They did not pay PRSI at the full rate.  Therefore, they are not entitled to a contributory State pension.<\/p>  <p>  Most contributory pensions work over a period of 40 years.  If one worked two years, one gets two fortieths; if one worked ten years, one gets ten fortieths; and if one worked 40 years, one gets the full pension.  The contributory State pension is very odd.  One can get a full State pension after ten years, if one worked the right ten years, which is too little time.  That is one anomaly.  Conversely, one can lose out very badly if one started working very young, worked for a number of years and then had a big gap before going back to work again for a number of years.  One might, having worked 20 years, get a lower pension than somebody who worked ten.  Those are two anomalies and we will have to address them at the same time.

At the beginning of the downturn in the economy, changes were made that mean it is virtually impossible to establish it even though both partners worked in the business.  It should have been taken into account - and previously was taken into account - in the determination of an individual pension for each partner on the basis that there was a partnership.  The problem was to prove that the partnership existed.  With regard to those women who do not qualify for a pension at all, it can be said that the non-contributory pension is available.

Since PRSI was introduced 30 or 40 years ago, people have had to make contributions in order to get contributory pensions.  If one did not make PRSI contributions, one does not get a contributory pension.  That is the way it has always worked.  PRSI is paid into the social insurance fund and out of that comes the State contributory pension.  The test is whether a person can establish that he or she made PRSI contributions.  If a person was not making PRSI contributions and was not paying tax, it is difficult to see how that individual would be entitled to a contributory pension.

To this end, CE also provides training and development to participants.  I am very conscious of the valuable role that CE schemes play in the provision of services to individuals and communities across the county.  The current eligibility criteria for the programme have been expanded and changed over the years and are designed to ensure the maximum availability and utilisation of places.  The basic eligibility requirement is that a person is currently in receipt of a CE-qualifying payment from my Department for the requisite period.  Recent changes to the eligibility criteria for CE include the reduction in the entry age for participants working directly with service users in the child care and social health care sectors to 21 years of age.   The standard minimum entry age for CE is 25.  The eligibility criteria for participants aged 62 and over have been eased in terms of the maximum duration they can remain on the programme.<\/p>  <p>  With the ongoing welcome reductions in the number of people unemployed, the Deputy will understand that issues such as the appropriate level of expenditure, the number of places and the criteria for participation on employment schemes all need to be considered and reviewed given the changes in the economy.

Very good and qualified people were often available during the recession but they are no longer available as they have gone back to work.

This has been one of my key priorities since becoming Minister in this Department.<\/p>  <p>  On budget day I was pleased to announce important measures which will directly benefit the self-employed.  From March 2017, the self-employed will have access to the treatment benefit scheme, which includes free eye and dental examinations, and contributions towards the cost of hearing aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended from October 2017 to provide further dental and optical benefits.  More significantly, self-employed contributors will be eligible to apply for the invalidity pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability, without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  I plan to continue extending cover for the self-employed to other benefits on a phased basis in future budgets.  Throughout 2017 my Department will examine the extension of social insurance to cover other risks and contingencies, including, crucially, developing proposals on a form of jobseeker's benefit where a person's business fails or where they can no longer continue working in their profession or trade.

They are great people who keep this country going.  They are also tax collectors but they get no benefit from that, although they have to pay accountants and everybody else.  Nobody does more, and nobody did more during the recession, to keep this country going than the self-employed.  However, nobody was more disdainfully treated within the social welfare system than the self-employed.  They were treated like beggars in their first encounter with the social welfare system, when they were asked to account for their income for the last year.  It was like being asked where was the snow that came last January.  It was a nonsense.  The former Minister, Deputy Burton, eventually changed that.

This is a real priority for me, having been self-employed myself.  My dad and my grandad were too.  I always said if I was ever in this position, I would try to do something about it.  Sometimes, though, self-employed people are unaware of what they are entitled to.  I hear self-employed people all the time saying they pay class S PRSI and get nothing.  To put on the record what self-employed people do get, they get the contributory State pension, in addition to any other pensions they may have, with no means test.  If one had to raise that money oneself, one would need a pension fund of &euro;350,000.  They also get maternity benefit and, since last September, paternity benefit.  If they die before they retire, the widow, widower or survivor gets a non-means-tested pension too.  Therefore, they already get quite a lot.  I am adding to this the treatment benefits and long-term illness benefits, which is the invalidity pension this year.  That only leaves two payments, namely, short-term illness benefit and jobseeker's benefit, and we need to do a bit of work on them, quite frankly.  It is very straightforward when an employee loses his or her job: he or she gets a P45.  It is less clear when this happens in the case of somebody who is self-employed.  Similarly, when it comes to illness, when one is paid on an hourly basis, it is pretty easy to work out these things.

The review was completed by my Department in advance of discussions for budget 2017.  Budget 2017 fully reverses the previous cuts to the farm assist means test.  The changes mean that 70% of farm income will now be assessed as means, down from 100%, which is equivalent to a 30% income disregard, and an additional annual means disregard will be applied at &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and subsequent children.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of additional income disregards for farmers with children further ensures that farm families with children will benefit.

This action plan will include a roadmap for the reform of the State pension, rationalisation and reform of the defined benefit pension landscape, transposition of the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision, IORP2, Directive and the introduction of auto-enrolment defined contribution pensions for all working people which I discussed earlier.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of interactions with my British counterparts, I had one bilateral meeting in Brussels some weeks ago with one of my counterparts and will travel to London in the first week of February to meet the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Damian Green.  Among the issues being discussed are pension rights as there are 35,000 people in this country and 135,000 people in the other jurisdictions who receive part of their pension from the United Kingdom.  I am determined to ensure those pensions rights are protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400031#DD00100","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1485281100,"counter":332,"content":"<p>That is good to hear.

The new rules would apply to future pensions.  If we were to apply the new rules to people already retired, we would be cutting some pensions too.  That is not something I want to do to anyone.

This was not done for the recent U2 concert and is generally not done.<\/p>  <p>  It appears that Ticketmaster, which owns the leading secondary selling website, Seatwave, and other primary sellers, is very comfortable with as many tickets as possible going on to Seatwave and does not restrict the primary sales of tickets in a reasonable way.

The consultation paper sets out a range of possible measures that might be taken to ensure fans do not have to pay exorbitant prices to attend major entertainment or sporting events.  Some of these measures would be the responsibility of the parties involved in the organisation of events or in the primary and secondary ticket markets.  Other measures would be the responsibility of the Government.  I encourage all interested parties, including Members of this House, to respond to our consultation paper.  The possible options for future action, including legislation to regulate the resale of tickets, will be fully assessed following the consultation process.  The consultation paper clarifies that such legislation could take a number of forms.  It is important that any such legislation does not cause ticket resale to be driven underground and away from the established marketplaces which at least offer guarantees to ticket buyers.  The online market for tickets to major events is essentially borderless in nature.  Most EU member states do not ban or regulate the resale of tickets.  Irish consumers will not be better off if legislation here causes ticket resale to be diverted to countries that permit it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400031#DD00900","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485281700,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her response.

Are those who are involved on a professional basis or otherwise in ticket touting in Ireland paying tax on their exorbitant profits?

I understand the reasons they and the public are anxious to see action on this issue.  If legislation is to be introduced to regulate ticket resale, an established procedure must be followed.  This includes the preparation of a regulatory impact analysis.  In Ireland, as in other countries, public consultation is an integral part of the impact analysis process.  It is relatively easy to enact legislation, but it is more difficult to ensure that legislation will be effective.<\/p>  <p>  Anyone who takes the time to read the consultation paper will see that the issues around ticket resale are neither simple not straightforward, as the Deputies have mentioned.  The organisation of major events, and the sale or resale of tickets to those events, involves a number of parties with different interests.  The record of legislative efforts to regulate ticket resale in other countries is mixed at best.  Expert reviews on this issue in a number of countries, including the UK, have concluded that legislative regulation is not warranted or is unlikely to be effective.  We cannot ignore these considerations in the clamour for action.  My aim is to ensure whatever action is ultimately taken will make a material contribution to ensuring fairer access to tickets for consumers.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that a number of popular solutions were proposed in the document I published.  Reference has been made to the possibility of making greater use of personalised and paperless tickets.  It has been suggested that event organisers and primary ticket sellers could provide a facility for ticket buyers to return tickets they are unable to use and, if those tickets are resold, to be refunded at face value.  Perhaps there is a need for greater readiness on the part of ticket buyers to resell tickets at face value.  Greater co-operation from the secondary marketplace would help event organisers to identify people who are reselling tickets in breach of contractual prohibitions on resale and on multiple purchases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400032#EE00500","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Airport Security","time":1485281700,"counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400032#EE00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1485281700,"counter":347,"content":"<p>We learned yesterday that a number of arrests were made at Dublin Airport at the weekend in respect of an alleged illegal immigrant smuggling network that may have been operating in the airport for a considerable period.

The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste, who is present, must order a high-level review into the current security systems in use at the airport.  At the very least, those systems appear to be quite porous and will cause major concern among the tens of millions of people travelling through the airport every year.  We cannot underestimate just how many jobs are dependent on Dublin Airport, which is a key engine of the Irish economy.  To have any doubt cast on the airport's security status is deeply worrying.  It is very welcome that the Garda National Immigration Bureau has upped its surveillance with regard to people trafficking in the past year and a half but we must consider the totality of security, including at other airports and points of entry throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  We know people-smuggling is widespread throughout the world.  It is an evil and lucrative trade, often involving women and young people who are forced into what is effectively sexual slavery and prostitution.  Very often families and the people themselves run up enormous debts to traffickers.  When I was T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, I introduced legislation to give enhanced powers to social welfare officials and officers present at airports and ports to identify people entering and leaving Ireland in a bid to clamp down on benefit tourism.  That initiative was very successful and we must send out a message that Ireland is not a soft touch on security.

As T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, maintaining the security of our borders is always an absolute priority for me.  I assure the Deputies that this matter is being taken very seriously by the Government and I thank them for providing me with the opportunity to update the House on it.  Security at our airports and ports is always kept under review and rates very well by international standards but a breach of this nature is clearly unacceptable and, in this instance, is of very serious public concern.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware and Deputy O'Callaghan noted, there is an ongoing Garda investigation targeted at illegal immigration and people-smuggling through Dublin Airport.  A number of people are before the courts with regard to this matter so it would not be appropriate in those circumstances to comment in detail on the particular case.  However, like Deputy O'Callaghan, I commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, on their work.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na considers this to be a smuggling operation rather than being terrorism or human trafficking-related.  The issue remains very serious and we all know the enormous challenge, at national and European level, of trafficking of persons.  It matches the drug trade in many ways in terms of criminal activity.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has kept in close contact with the Department of Transport and both Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority are co-operating fully with the Garda investigation.  The national civil aviation security committee, chaired by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and comprising representatives from other Departments, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, airports and airlines, reviews and recommends effective security measures with a view to advising Government on aviation security policy.  The national civil aviation security committee is reviewing all issues relevant to aviation security at Dublin Airport, particularly any issue relating to the access arrangements at the airport.  We need to know how this happened and why.  Therefore, in light of the seriousness of the issue, I will work with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to review the procedures in place so the public can have full confidence in the security of our borders.<\/p>  <p>  I will put a couple of facts on the record.  Immigration officers at Dublin Airport process approximately 15 million passengers per annum and approximately 3,300 were refused leave to land last year, with over 4,000 being refused across all ports of entry.  Constant vigilance is required and it is by such vigilance that a case like this is uncovered and investigated.  It is clear that this case has an international dimension and garda&iacute; are co-operating with other police authorities, including Interpol and Europol, as we do all the time, with the investigation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other independent analysts have pointed out that this is not a matter unique to Dublin Airport and that other international airports face the same risks, challenges and threats of illegal immigration.  When it comes to border security, we must remain vigilant at all times.  Where breaches are discovered, they must be thoroughly investigated and feed into a wider review of port security generally to identify where any improvements can be made.<\/p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, we are not aware of any other related matters and none have been brought to our attention.  Significant resources are put into policing our borders, including increased use of technology and the area of data sharing with other jurisdictions.  Since becoming Minister I have put much emphasis on the interoperability of data systems so our security can be maintained and the Government has put in increased funding again this year into that issue.  Last November, we took a major step forward in launching an automated connection to Interpol's lost and stolen travel documents database.  In the first eight weeks of operating systematic checks against this database at Dublin Airport, over 700,000 documents were searched and a number of people were refused entry to Ireland on the basis of an alert on the system being triggered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400033#FF00300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1485282300,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for her reply.

I note the T&aacute;naiste's statement that it is the view of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the allegations regarding the airport on this occasion relate to smuggling.  Irrespective of that, if we have a porous border it sends out a very negative message to the international community from Ireland.  It is important we ensure our borders are adequately secure.  It may just have been a smuggling operation in this case but who is to know whether in the past there may have been misuse or abuse of procedure for something more serious.

The idea is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our airport authorities have the most relevant and up-to-date data-checking systems that operate an international level.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has further work to do, but the project is under way.<\/p>  <p>  There is a particularly close operational relationship with the UK authorities in managing the security of the common travel area between Ireland and the UK.  The gathering and sharing of relevant information is an important aspect of this co-operation.  There are robust and constantly-evolving security information sharing arrangements in place between Ireland and the UK.  For example, last year Ireland introduced new regulations to enable the UK to collect advanced passenger information from Irish carriers in respect of passengers entering the UK from Ireland.  In the first half of this year, we will begin to process advance passenger information on flights.<\/p>  <p>  It was rather difficult to get agreement on this issue in the European Parliament.  Ministers with responsibility for justice issues fought to have advance passenger information shared between countries and I supported the proposal.  We will have this arrangement in place on flights from outside the EU.  Preparations are also under way to implement the EU directive on passenger name records, a plan I have just referenced.  These systems will provide further protection for our borders against crime, terrorism and illegal immigration threats.  The information technology resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are an important aspect of this.

It is high time there was a far broader review of the rental limits in all local authority areas, especially large urban areas and those areas around the fringes of the major cities.  The previous occasion on which limits were set was in 2011.  Let us set out the context.  Following everything that has happened since then, more and more young families, many of whom are known to the Minister and me, are trapped in the rental sector or in the homes of their parents and have few options given that they cannot get onto social housing lists.  For those above the income limits by small or marginal amounts, the options are especially limited.  Those affected are largely confined to the rental sector or family homes.  For those who may have a desire to work towards a mortgage, the 10% deposit required is singularly difficult for them to put together.  In large urban areas, such as Cork, a deposit could be in the amount of &euro;20,000 or &euro;25,000.  Frankly, this Government has done nothing for this category of people.  They are only marginally above the income limits.  Many of them are still on low incomes.<\/p>  <p>  There is a particular context to the problem in respect of Cork, namely, the boundaries relating to Cork City Council that are completely out of date.  Large urban areas of Cork city are essentially in the Cork County Council bailiwick, such as parts of Togher, Douglas, Rochestown, Grange and Frankfield.  There is 80 m between the Greenwood and Westside estates in Togher, but a difference of &euro;5,000 in the income threshold applicable.  A distance of 180 m separates Willow Park in Douglas and Douglas West Street in the village, but the income threshold is the same or even &euro;6,000, depending on the size of the family.  It is a particular issue and a serious anomaly for those areas.<\/p>  <p>  In general, the thresholds are far too low.  This reflects a failure on the part of the Government to recognise that this category of individuals exists and is growing.  These people have few options and the Government is doing nothing for them.  I imagine the Minister will say a change would result in an increase in the housing lists, and I appreciate that point.  However, I would not criticise the Government for an increase on that basis.  While those affected might not be to the front of the queue - I would not expect them to be to the front of the queue - eligibility is vital for their ability to draw down payments, such as the housing assistance payment.  Currently, that payment is closed off to them.  Their ability to build up time credit, which is more and more important in social housing allocation, is inhibited.<\/p>  <p>  There is a serious need to do something for this category of low and middle-income families for whom mortgages are out of the question.  They are under severe pressure because of the rental market.  Social housing is supposed to provide security and rent stability.  These people deserve the benefits to which I refer but are denied access to them.  That is wrong and it needs to be reviewed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400034#GG00600","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1485282900,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I apologise that the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government cannot be here to take this matter, which I thank the Deputy for raising.<\/p>  <p>  On 1 April 2011, the social housing assessment regulations introduced a new standard procedure for assessing applicants for social housing in every housing authority.  The aim of the new system is to move closer to a transparent, consistent and fairer approach to eligibility for social housing.  The regulations include maximum net income limits for each housing authority in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard household means policy.  Before the new scheme was put in place, there was considerable inconsistency in the various local authorities.  Some authorities had income limits for social housing while others had none.  The way income was assessed for limits varied widely, with different disregards and policies in various housing authorities.  This meant that applicants for support who were on similar incomes could be treated differently because of where they happened to live.  This approach was neither efficient nor fair.  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of income needed to provide for a household's basic need plus a comprehensive analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation throughout the country.  As a result, higher limits generally apply in urban areas than in surrounding areas, such as in Cork.  The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced before the new scheme came into operation.  The purpose was to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote support for sustainable communities.<\/p>  <p>  Under the household means policy, which applies in all housing authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  Most payments received from the Department of Social Protection are assessable.  The policy provides for a range of income disregards.  Housing authorities can disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this aim.  However, I welcome the opportunity to hear the views of the Deputy on these issues.  They will be considered in the context of the ongoing review of social housing assessment procedures as part of the broader social housing reform agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400034#GG00700","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1485283500,"counter":360,"content":"<p>What caught my eye in the Minister of State's response was the following:<\/p><blockquote>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  I am satisfied that the current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this.<\/blockquote><p>What that says is that for families that are essentially in Cork city, in some of the most of the competitive and expensive markets such as Rochestown, Togher, Douglas, Grange or even Carrigaline or Ballincollig, it is acceptable or reasonable to expect that a family of two adults and three children would be responsible for organising their own accommodation and would be obliged to find a mortgage out of an income above a mere &euro;33,750.  That is for a two-adult family.  The other options are to spend the rest of their lives in the rental market or be cast back on their families.  That is utterly unfair and unreasonable.<\/p><p>I again urge the Minister to consider a review of the income limits for social housing.  The limits are absolutely unreasonable.  If that is not possible, the alternative models that have been talked about to some extent are way behind track, such as the cost rental model.  There is a review due to come back at the end of this year.  That is quite some time before there will be any real action.<\/p><p>I also urge the Minister to consider some flexibility in the boundaries of local authority areas.  There are about 50,000 people in and around the fringes of Cork city that are essentially part of the Cork city housing market.  The boundaries have not been revised since the 1960s and that is another day's problem.  For those people, they are living in the second most competitive housing market in the State.  Yet, they are dealing with income limits that are &euro;5,000 to &euro;6,000 below estates that are just up the road.  It is impossible for them to secure any kind of long-term accommodation on those rental limits.  Some kind of flexibility absolutely has to be considered for that southern division of Cork County Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400035#HH00100","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1485283500,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy's concerns and have noted many points he has raised, which I will bring back to the Minister.  I am satisfied that the current income limit generally provides for a fair and equal system of identifying those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.  These limits generally provide that a household in receipt of social welfare will not breach the threshold.  I refer to the fact that the 2016 summary of social housing assessment reported that, of households on waiting lists nationally, slightly more than two thirds or 67% were entirely dependent on social welfare.  I am also satisfied that these income bands and the authority area assigned to each band are based on the true access of income needed to provide for a household base, as well as on the comprehensive analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.<\/p>  <p>  However, as the Minister has indicated, the issues raised today will be examined as part of the ongoing review of the social housing assessment process that is under way, which will consider whether there are disparities across local authority housing that discriminate unfairly against certain classes of household.

However, the Minister is precluded from becoming involved in a specified application for housing to a local authority.<\/p>  <p>  I also express my concern to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  I myself have met many young people in a predicament in which they may be a little over the threshold at which social housing is provided and find that they cannot be included on the list.

I do not know whether she will be happy with the answer.  I will set out the position as I understand it and I believe it to be correct.  Third-level institutions are autonomous bodies and they have the responsibility for making decisions of this nature on their own authority, including in particular matters relating to recruitment and selection procedures.  That rests with the governing body of the institution involved.  NUIG, in this instance, is exercising the authority that it has, as it is entitled to do.<\/p>  <p>  I know that the vacancy is arising and that they have put in place a procedure for the appointment to the position.  I understand that they had a meeting of &uacute;dar&aacute;s na hollscoile and decided on a consensus basis not to continue with the requirement for the post-holder to have a proficiency in the Irish language.  I can appreciate that Deputy Connolly feels strongly about this but the legislative authority is very clear.  Neither the Universities Act nor the University College Galway (Amendment) Act require the proficiency in the Irish language.  It is a matter for the governing authority itself to make that decision.<\/p><p>The rationale appears to be that NUIG wants a full national and international opportunity for candidates to come forward to lead the university.

It is also fair to say that the university has not in any way flinched from its commitment to the Irish language.<\/p> <p> I took the trouble to get a briefing on NUIG's strategic plan.  At the heart of that plan is a huge commitment to the Irish language and an ambition to become even more effective in using the university's infrastructure to support the growth and spread of the language, particularly in the context of introducing integrated language.  This is where language is integrated into the teaching of other subjects, which I find highly attractive as a means of kindling a wider interest in the Irish language by using it in a more practical way.  NUIG also has the activities of Acadamh na hOllscola&iacute;ochta, which plays a leading role nationally and in the university.  It has a coherent leadership in the Irish-speaking community and is responsible for the delivery of programmes, research and other services through the medium of Irish that have been extremely effective and upon which we depend.  There are Gaeltacht centres in An Cheathr&uacute; Rua, Carna and Gaoth Dobhair and NUIG has its own school, Scoil na dTeangacha, by means of which it is seeking to develop an exemplary bilingual campus.  To be fair, NUIG is truly committed to its role as the fountainhead of knowledge research capability in the Irish language.  It is fully committed to that but it has taken a decision - as is its entitlement - on the recruitment process relating to its president and I am not going to interfere with that decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400035#HH00500","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485284100,"counter":366,"content":"<p>Cuireann s&eacute; f&iacute;ordh&iacute;om&aacute; orm &eacute; sin a chloiste&aacute;il.

It is a relatively short and technical Bill but it is also important.  The Bill's primary purpose is to address Mr. Justice Moriarty&rsquo;s High Court judgment of 19 April last which found certain provisions of section 99 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 to be unconstitutional.  That section provides for the suspension and subsequent revocation of prison sentences.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill was initiated in the Seanad and completed its passage through that House on 30 November.  I am pleased to say that it received general support there with the need to remedy the legislative deficiency broadly recognised by Senators.  Suspended sentences are an integral part of the judicial sentencing regime, indeed of the criminal justice system in general.   They can be used as an alternative to the imposition of a custodial sentence where the court considers that the person might benefit from a second chance and that justice might be better served with the imposition of a suspended sentence.  Suspended sentences are a valuable sentencing mechanism for the courts.  They are a deterrent to the commission of further offences since the threat of the original prison sentence remains.  A suspended sentence is imposed for a certain time period and is subject to a number of conditions.  The primary condition is that the person must keep the peace and be of good behaviour.  A breach of this condition can result in automatic revocation of the suspended sentence.<\/p>  <p>  The statutory regime for the imposition and revocation - essentially, the activation of suspended sentences - is provided for in section 99 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  The High Court has, however, found certain provisions of section 99 - subsections (9) and (10) - to be unconstitutional and these provisions have been struck down.  These subsections provide that a person who is subject to a suspended sentence and subsequently convicted of another offence is, before sentencing for that subsequent offence, automatically returned to the court which made the order imposing the suspended sentence for revocation of that order.  The difficulty identified by the High Court Is that the person concerned does not have the opportunity to appeal the second triggering offence before the case is referred back to the revocation court, resulting in differing treatment so far as the rights of appeal are concerned.  This means that a person could serve some or all of a revoked suspended sentence because of a second offence, the conviction for which may be quashed on appeal.  It is necessary, therefore, to amend the legislation to provide that an appeal may be taken in relation to a second, triggering offence, before revocation of the suspended sentence is considered by the revocation court.<\/p><p>An alternative mechanism provided for by subsections (13) and (14) of the 2006 Act is currently being used on a case-by-case basis, pending enactment of this amending legislation, which will restore the automatic court-driven revocation process.  These alternative provisions allow a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the governor of a prison or a probation officer to apply to the court for a hearing to revoke a suspended sentence where a breach of its terms has occurred.  While this alternative mechanism ensures that suspended sentences may still be revoked, it is important from a procedural point of view that the provisions which have been found to be unconstitutional should be revised and replaced so that the system of automatic revocation of suspended sentences can be restored.  The implications of the High Court judgment were considered in consultation with the Attorney General and this amending legislation was prepared in order to address the particular difficulty identified so that procedures relating to suspended sentences can operate as efficiently and effectively as possible.  The Bill also deals with a number of related matters.<br\/><br\/>I will now outline the different sections of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for amendments to section 99, dealing with the power to suspend sentences, of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Section 2(c) provides for the insertion of various subsections to replace the subsections that were struck down.  The new subsection (8A) provides that where a person commits an offence, referred to as a &quot;triggering offence&quot;, during the period of a suspended sentence and is subsequently convicted of that offence, the court concerned will, after imposing sentence for the triggering offence, remand the person in custody or on bail to a sitting of the court that imposed the suspended sentence no later than 15 days after the remand, or where there is no silting of that court within the 15-day period, to the next sitting of that court.  If, for whatever reason, the court to which the remand is made does not sit on the date of remand, the person will be remanded to the next sitting of the court held after that day.  This provision ensures that a person will be remanded as soon as possible, once sentence for the triggering offence has been imposed, to the revocation court to have the matter of the suspended sentence dealt with.  Subsection (8B) clarifies that the remand process provided for in subsection (8A) applies following conviction for a triggering offence once proceedings are instituted against the person concerned within a reasonable timeframe following commission of the offence.<br\/><br\/>I take this opportunity to outline the most significant differences between subsection 99(9) of the 2006 Act and the revised subsections (8A) and (8B), as inserted by section 2(c).  First, the requirement that the conviction for a triggering offence be handed down during the period of the suspended sentence has been removed.  A second key difference between subsection 99(9) and the new amending subsections is the bringing together of conviction and sentence for the subsequent offence.  This will allow a person to lodge an appeal against a conviction or sentence for a triggering offence prior to determination of the revocation issue.  It also means that the court, in considering revocation of the previously suspended sentence, will be aware of the sentence imposed for the triggering offence and will, therefore, be in a better position to assess the gravity of the breach.  A third important difference relates to providing a more workable and realistic timeframe for consideration of revocation of a suspended sentence, as I have outlined.<br\/><br\/>The notable difference between subsection (8C) and the original subsection 99(10) which it replaces is that the revocation proceedings will be adjourned pending determination of any appeal process.  The adjournment of the proceedings to consider revocation of the suspended sentence ensures the procedural difficulty identified by the High Court is effectively dealt with by allowing a person to appeal conviction or sentence for a triggering offence before returning to the revocation court to have the matter of the suspended sentence dealt with.  Revocation of the suspended sentence will not be considered until such time as the appeals process in respect of conviction or sentence for the triggering offence is complete.<br\/><br\/>Subsection (8E) sets out what is to happen when an appeal against conviction or sentence is withdrawn or abandoned.  Subsection (8F) sets out what is to happen when the appeals process is final.  Where the appeal is allowed, the revocation proceedings will be dismissed, but in all other cases, the revocation court will proceed to consider revocation of the suspended sentence.  Subsection (8G) places an obligation on the person concerned to appear before the revocation court whenever required to do so by that court.<br\/><br\/> Section 2(e) substitutes subsection 99(11) and deals with the sequence in which the revoked suspended sentence and the sentence imposed for the triggering offence are to be served.  I have clarified why this needs to be done.<br\/><br\/> Section 2(g) inserts a new subsection (13A) in the 2006 Act giving the Director of Public Prosecutions a power, similar to that of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the prison governor and the probation and welfare service under subsections (13) and (14), to make an application to a court to consider revocation of a suspended sentence where a condition under subsection (3) has been breached.  This provision will strengthen section 99 by providing for an additional subsection (13) or (14)-type referral in order to ensure any breach of a condition of a suspended sentence is captured by the section, as is the policy intention.<br\/><br\/> Section 2(j) provides for a new subsection (18A) which sets out the procedure in regard to the remaining part of a suspended sentence when only part of the sentence is revoked.  In this case, a further order may be made suspending the balance of that sentence.  In this way, the section 99 procedure in respect of revocation of a suspended sentence will also apply to the part of a suspended sentence which has not been revoked.<br\/><br\/>Section 2(k) inserts two new subsections after subsection (19).  Subsection (19A) takes account of the situation where a person has committed a number of offences and is subject to several sentences that are to be served consecutively.  Subsection (19B) ensures District Court sentencing provisions are maintained and that the maximum term of imprisonment which can be imposed by the District Court in respect of sentences passed at the same time cannot exceed two years.<br\/><br\/>Section 2(l) provides for the inclusion of three new subsections after subsection (20).  Subsection (21) clarifies that a consecutive sentence which is to be served following a part-revoked sentence should commence immediately following the expiry of the custodial period of the part-revoked sentence.  Subsection (22) deals with sentences on appeal and provides that where a suspended sentence is imposed by a court on appeal from another court, the lower court from which the appeal was taken is the court to which the person will be remanded in order to have revocation of the suspended sentence dealt with.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 makes clear that where subsections 99(9) and (10) are referred to elsewhere in legislation, they are replaced by subsections (8A), (8B) and (8C), as inserted by this Bill.<br\/><br\/>Section 4 is a standard provision citing the Short Title of the Bill and providing for its commencement.<br\/><br\/> As I have outlined, this amending legislation is a necessary response to the High Court finding of unconstitutionality in respect of some of the suspended sentencing provisions in the 2006 Act.  The Bill addresses the difficulty highlighted by the court and revises the procedure in order to ensure the suspended sentencing system can operate efficiently and effectively.  I am sure Deputies appreciate the need to bring forward this amending legislation.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400036#JJ00500","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485284700,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Fianna F&aacute;il supported the Bill in its passage through the Seanad and will also support it in this House. When dealing with criminal justice legislation, we tend to concentrate on the offences outlined in the Bill in question.  Our laws are full of detailed definitions of serious and less serious criminal offences.  For example, there is legislation to define how organised crime, firearms offences and misuse of drugs are prescribed and criminalised, including detailed descriptions of the nature of the criminal behaviour.  Similarly, even in the case of minor offences such as minor road traffic offences, our laws outline the nature of the offence in detail.<\/p>  <p>  This is the first opportunity I have had to deal with legislation focusing exclusively on sentencing.  It is important that we acknowledge the importance of sentencing.  We spend a lot of our time drafting legislation that criminalises certain types of human behaviour and includes, at the end, a section stating what will be the penalties.  We must become more mature and advanced in our approach to the types of penalties and sentencing that are available to the courts.  As things stand, the sentences imposed are largely the same sentences that were imposed in Victorian times, namely, fines and imprisonment.  Part 10 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for different types of sentencing.  Section 99, which we are dealing with today, is concerned with the imposition of suspended sentences.  Other sentences are provided for under the legislation, such as the power to impose a fine, defer a sentence, restrict a person's movement and monitor the movement of an individual who has been found guilty of an offence.<\/p><p>We need to move beyond the standard fine and imprisonment and make available to the courts greater types of penalties to impose, particularly in respect of offences that do not involve violence or a threat to the safety of others.<br\/><br\/>What we are talking about this evening are suspended sentences.  As the T&aacute;naiste stated, such sentences play an important part in the criminal justice armoury.  They are generally used in situations where a court thinks that an individual should be subjected to a custodial sentence but where there may be some exceptional circumstances giving rise to that sentence being suspended.  Sometimes that applies when an individual has been convicted of an offence for the first time or where there are exceptional circumstances - for example, where the person convicted has young children to look after.  It is important to recognise that suspended sentences should continue to play an important part in the criminal justice system.<br\/><br\/>The reason for this legislation arose out of section 99 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which deals with the power of the courts to impose suspended sentences.  For many years after the enactment of that legislation, there was considerable difficulty with criminal practitioners in the courts as to how it should be applied.  I suppose we should be grateful to Mr. Justice Moriarty, who clarified the matter and who brought a definitive conclusion to it in his decision given on 19 April last year in the case of Moore <i>v<\/i>. DPP.  There were five other related proceedings with which the judge dealt in that judgment.  Mr. Justice Moriarty was not the first judge to identify that there were failings and faults within section 99.  The late Mr. Justice Hardiman commented upon it on 5 March 2015 in the Supreme Court decision in DPP <i>v<\/i>. Carter and DPP <i>v<\/i>. Kenny.  It should be noted that when he was giving judgment in that case, the late Mr. Justice Hardiman referred to the fact that, as Mr. Justice O'Donnell had noted, section 99 had given rise to innumerable practical difficulties and problems of interpretation only some of which were illustrated by the present cases.  He then went on to agree with the sentiments expressed by Mr. Justice O'Donnell, who had said that it was clear and beyond dispute that section 99 was in need of urgent and comprehensive review.  I am pleased that this legislation, which has been brought before the Oireachtas in recent times, provides for that comprehensive review.<br\/><br\/>It should also be noted that the late Mr. Justice Hardiman also referred to the fact that some of the difficulties with section 99 would not have arisen if there had been any proper effort to consult the judges who implement the procedures for the activation of suspended sentences.  There can be difficulties in trying to ask judges to review or consider legislation as it is going through this House because that would come close to interfering with the separation of powers.  It is important, however, that when we are putting together sentencing legislation, we seek - in some general sense and without getting into the area of policy - indications and recommendations from those who have been judges as to how the legislation will be implemented and whether it can be implemented coherently and credibly by those operating in the courts each day.<br\/><br\/>The T&aacute;naiste set out the difficulties in respect of section 99.  If an individual is convicted of an offence and if the judge imposed a suspended sentence, there should be no difficulty provided the individual in question remains of good behaviour and that suspended sentence is not invoked or reactivated.  In circumstances where the person commits and is convicted of a subsequent offence, however, problems arise.  The reason for this is that the triggering of the second offence automatically reactivates the suspended sentence.  The problem Mr. Justice Moriarty and other judges identified was that the individual, when convicted of the second offence and returned to prison on foot of it, had no opportunity to appeal because the suspended sentence had already been activated.  If he or she appealed successfully, he or she had would have been sent to prison when that should not have happened because he or she would not have been guilty of the offence.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the legislation.  I do not propose to go through it section by section since the T&aacute;naiste has done that already.  It will be a useful addition to the body of law relating to criminal justice.  It will help judges in seeking to impose suspended sentences.  It will help individuals who are given suspended sentences and who then find themselves in a situation where they are convicted of another offence that they wish to appeal.<br\/><br\/>I also welcome that the legislation takes into account that consecutive sentences can, and in certain circumstances should, apply if an individual is convicted of another offence.  All too often there is no downside to an individual being convicted of an offence while he or she is already convicted of an offence because sometimes it does not result in an increased sentence - the person can serve his or her sentences concurrently.  It is important that this provision provides for consecutive sentences.<br\/><br\/>I also note that at the time this judgment was delivered, some efforts were made to make Mr. Justice Moriarty stop short of striking down the relevant subsections on the basis that revocation arrangements could be put in place in respect of the individual cases.  Mr. Justice Moriarty was correct when he stated he had considerable reservations about the appropriateness and fairness of such a course.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the legislation.  In many respects, it is unfortunate that the only time we have discussed sentencing legislation in the life of this D&aacute;il is as a result of a decision of the High Court.  The latter has forced us to draft legislation and to get it through the House in order to rectify the deficiencies in section 99.  It is important that the Oireachtas considers further advancements in respect of the area of sentencing.  This is an area to which we do not devote sufficient attention.  We need to consult broadly.  We may need a commission in respect of sentencing.  We must mature our attitude to sentencing.  Generally, unless the convicted are guilty of violent offences or offences, such as those involving drugs, which give rise to a threat to the safety of others, we should be slow about putting those individuals in jail.  That may create difficulties in circumstances where persons are involved in and convicted of criminal offences which result in significant property crimes, but I think we need a more sophisticated attitude.  We cannot merely keep putting those convicted into jail because that does not seem to work.  We need a more mature attitude to sentencing.  Suspending sentences is an important part of our repertoire.  However, we need to look at more and different types of sentences that can be made available to judges who have to deal with the different variety of criminal offences that exist in the criminal justice system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400037#KK00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485285300,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I give notice to the Deputy due to speak after me that I will not be taking the full 20 minutes.  Like previous speakers, I will probably take ten minutes.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome this Bill.  As the T&aacute;naiste stated, it passed through the Seanad and received considerable support.  I was not aware that anyone had opposed it.  I understand that it went through with the full support of the Seanad.  I hope that will be replicated in this House.  My party certainly will be supporting the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Like the T&aacute;naiste and the previous speaker, Deputy O'Callaghan, my party believes that the option of suspended sentences is an important part of the criminal justice system.  In circumstances where individuals commit and are convicted of particular offences and where judges have the option of handing down suspended sentences, my party would encourage them to exercise that power wherever applicable.<\/p>  <p>  The conditions attaching to a suspended sentence should in all cases be preventative in nature.  In other words, somebody who does not commit another offence should be given that second chance.  The conditions should also be restorative.  Somebody who receives a suspended sentence must acknowledge that he or she has committed a crime - he or she has been convicted after all - that he or she is under an obligation to either the victim or the wider community and that it is not just a case of staying out of trouble for six or 12 months or whatever.  It should be built into the conditions attaching to suspended sentences that such individuals should give something back to the community.  That would be beneficial for everyone involved.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy O'Callaghan that we do not get the opportunity to discuss sentencing very often in the House.  We usually deal with legislation related to imposing convictions or providing for offences for breaches of the law.  Sentencing is probably one of the most important parts of the criminal justice system.  It is supposed to be the deterrent to prevent somebody from committing another crime.  It is well established, and the Law Reform Commission and the Irish Penal Reform Trust have published reports in this regard, that simply jailing people is not the answer in many cases.  One sends somebody to prison where it is warranted, but even within the prison system it is not a case of punishing them but of trying to rehabilitate them.  In many cases it is very unpopular for politicians to say that, but the reality is that this is what the prison system is supposed to do.  It is supposed to rehabilitate people and give them the skills and education they may have been lacking prior to being sentenced.  Perhaps it is time to have that grown-up debate about sentencing guidelines.  Perhaps we must even examine certain guidelines for sentencing.  It is certainly not popular to say that somebody who goes to prison should get access to education or training, which somebody who is not in prison might struggle to access because of their circumstances, but it is the right thing to do.  It would benefit society in general if we had an open debate on the sentencing issue.<\/p> <p> With regard to the legislation, the Minister outlined in detail the differences between what is being proposed and what is in the old legislation that was struck down by Mr. Justice Moriarty's judgment in the High Court in April last year.  I am not fully certain about one element, although this might not be the place to ask the question as it might be more appropriate to Committee Stage.  However, let us say somebody receives a custodial sentence and part of it is suspended.  Does this legislation cover the situation where they serve their custodial sentence, and two or three years are suspended as part of the sentence, and when they are out in that period of time they commit another triggering offence?  I presume it does, but perhaps the Minister would clarify that.<\/p> <p> One of the areas which we should debate is mandatory sentencing, and I am taking the opportunity to raise this while we are discussing legislation on sentencing.  Some people are very much in favour of it, but I oppose it.  We have provided for mandatory sentences for certain types of drug convictions.  All of the evidence suggests that mandatory sentencing is counterproductive.  That might be a piece of work for the Oireachtas committee on justice.  The committee is finalising its work programme tomorrow and it is probably too late to include a piece of work on sentencing, but it is something that perhaps I and Deputy O'Callaghan could encourage the committee to examine in the near future.  It is an important piece of work because, as I said, we must have that grown-up, mature debate on sentencing.  On many occasions when we are discussing criminal justice issues in the Chamber, Members tend to go off on tangents to talk about local Garda stations being closed or other areas of policing and justice that are not really relevant to the legislation under discussion.  That is not to say they are not important, but the one area we do not discuss or to which we do not give any consideration is sentencing and, as I and the previous speaker have said, that is probably the most important part.  It is the sentencing element of our criminal justice legislation that is the deterrent and the part that could change somebody's life.<\/p> <p> Suspended sentences are an integral part of our criminal justice system and judges should be encouraged to use them where appropriate.  Again, in the conditions imposed with a suspended sentence obviously the priority is to prevent somebody from committing another offence, but there must be a restorative element built into it as well.  We welcome the legislation and we support it.  I hope all sides of the House will support it and that it can be enacted as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017012400038#LL00300","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1485285900,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their response to the legislation.  I am pleased they have accepted the Bill and that it can proceed to Committee Stage.  It is a short and technical Bill, but it is significant.  I thank the Deputies for their support and I welcome their comments.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan made thoughtful comments on sentencing.  Deputy O'Brien raised the question of mandatory sentencing, an issue that arises quite often.  The expert reports I have received in recent times do not suggest further mandatory sentencing but, as the Deputy said, people in the public domain often think it is the way forward.  However, when detailed consideration has been given to it, it has not been recommended to me in the reports and is not seen as the most effective way to proceed.  That does not stop public demand for it at times, which is quite understandable.  When people see horrific crimes being committed they think a mandatory sentence is the best way to deal with them, but that is not the recommendation I have received.<\/p>  <p>  On the particular point Deputy O'Brien raised, section 2(j) provides for a new subsection (18)(A) which sets out the procedure relating to the remaining portion of a suspended sentence when part only of a sentence is revoked under the subsection.  Where a court revokes a suspended sentence in part, a further order may be made suspending the balance of the sentence and the order will be regarded as if it were an order to suspend a sentence under subsection (1).  In this way the section 99 procedure relating to a revocation of a suspended sentence will apply to the remaining part of a suspended sentence.  This reflects what currently happens in practice.<\/p>  <p>  Section 99 of the 2006 Act was a significant legislative development in the context of sentencing.  It enshrined in statute the power to suspend a sentence but provided for revocation of the suspended sentence in the event of the commission of another triggering offence.  It was very important when it was introduced.  Prior to its introduction in legislation in 2006, suspended sentences were handed down under common law but were seldom activated and did not therefore act as a meaningful deterrent to repeat offending.  Section 99 was designed to ensure that persons did not get away with breaching conditions of their suspended sentences.  However, it gave rise to operational difficulties, as Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned, mainly in respect of the sequencing of court hearings for the triggering offence, the revocation of the suspended sentence and with regard to the appeals mechanism.  This resulted in a number of legal challenges which culminated in the High Court hearing last April.<\/p>  <p>  We are correcting the deficiencies that were identified by the High Court.  I have already given the details of the changes and how they will operate in making necessary and desirable improvements to the suspending sentence regime, which is such an integral part of the judicial sentencing system.
