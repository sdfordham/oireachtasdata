The purpose of the reform of the one parent family payment is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into and increase employment.

One of the component measures of consistent poverty is at-risk-of-poverty. This fell from 16.5% in 2012 to 15.2% in 2013.  A key reason for this fall is the enhanced impact of social transfers in reducing income poverty.

The right to marry is a basic right and marriage, as an institution, has particular protection under the Constitution.  The State&rsquo;s duty is to protect the institution of marriage in legislation.  EU citizens and their families have the right to move and reside freely within the territories of the Member States.  These rights also apply to non-EU national spouses of EU nationals following the ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Metock case in 2008.  The Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 includes provisions aimed at making it more difficult to broker a marriage of convenience in the State.  The Act defines &lsquo;marriage of convenience&rsquo; as 'a marriage where at least one of the parties to the marriage&mdash; (a) at the time of entry into the marriage is a foreign national, and (b) enters into the marriage solely for the purpose of securing an immigration advantage for at least one of the parties to the marriage'.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation which was enacted in December 2014 has not yet been commenced.  The provisions of the Act will be put into operation by an implementation plan involving both procedural and system changes.  It is intended that these will be finalised as soon as possible.  Discussions with the Department of Justice and Equality with regard to the cross-Departmental co-operation required to ensure that this issue is addressed effectively have been taking place, as part of the implementation plan.<\/p>  <p>  Entitlement to certain social assistance payments and child benefit is conditional on a residence requirement, independent of nationality, which ensures a genuine connection between the applicant for or recipient of such schemes and the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Habitual Residence Condition (HRC) was first introduced in Ireland in 2004 and amended in subsequent years, most recently in 2014.  The HRC is provided for in Irish legislation, in accordance with EU legislation and with European Court of Justice jurisprudence. <\/p>  <p>  Deciding Officers and Designated Persons, when determining whether a person is habitually resident in the State for social welfare purposes, will take into consideration all of the person&rsquo;s circumstances including the person's length and continuity of residence in Ireland or in any other particular country, length and purpose of any absence from Ireland, nature and pattern of employment, main centre of interest and future intentions as they appear from all the circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The emphasis in the Department&rsquo;s Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy is on preventing fraud and error from entering the system in the first place.  In the context of persons coming into the country and falsely claiming benefit, the Department is continuing to develop and enhance cross-border and transnational structures and liaison to ensure that there is effective co-operation to prevent and detect social security fraud across national boundaries.  The Department also has an ongoing relationship with the Irish National Immigration Service (INIS) and Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  Two Departmental inspectors are assigned to the GNIB on a full-time basis.  Case by case information exchanges and data-matching takes places between INIS\/GNIB and DSP on a systematic basis.  <\/p>  <p>  A number of other measures should also be noted. The Social Welfare Act 2012 made provision for social welfare inspectors to undertake power of enquiry at airports where social welfare fraud is suspected.  In addition, from the beginning of December 2014, 20 Garda&iacute; have been seconded to the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit.  These officers will ensure a greater presence on the ground and will increase the investigative capacity of the Department to prevent, detect and deter social welfare fraud. <\/p>  <p>  Where fraud is discovered it is important that there are appropriate sanctions in place.

The report culminated in recommendations which involve measures to introduce clarity and consistency across the various pension products, increase consumer understanding and provide a better result for the consumer.<\/p>  <p>  Since publication, a range of measures have been taken to deliver on the report&rsquo;s recommendations and work is ongoing in this regard.  For example, in line with the recommendation that the implementation of the Consumer Protection Code should be monitored, the Central Bank has undertaken a number of themed reviews aimed at ensuring this is the case.  This includes a review of new requirements for annual pension statements introduced in 2012 which requires that information on charges be provided in a way that seeks to inform the customer.  The review found that the vast majority of firms were in compliance with the code.  Where the Bank identified a small number of firms where the format of annual statements was not as required, those concerned were required to submit implementation timelines for full compliance. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of support to trustees of occupational pension schemes, the Pension&rsquo;s Authority is in the process of enhancing its e-learning website for trustee training which will include material on pension charges.  It is also updating the Trustee Handbook and expects to publish the new handbook, which will contain a chapter on pension charges, in the near future. <\/p>  <p>  The pension charges report refers to the broader pensions policy debate on the introduction of a universal pension system.  It indicates the introduction of such a scheme may be the most effective way to introduce change in this area.  International experience has shown that this type of scheme is extremely successful in providing a simplified and lower cost charging structure and a consistent application across employers.  This type of arrangement could assist in resolving the difficulties inherent in the current structure of a proliferation of small schemes paying considerably higher charges than larger schemes, ultimately eroding the value of the pension received by the member.  In this regard and in line with the Statement of Government Priorities, the Government recently decided to proceed with work to develop a roadmap for the introduction of a new, universal, supplementary workplace retirement saving scheme.  The Universal Retirement Savings Group (URSG) has been established to consider the constituent factors involved in constructing an efficient and effective universal retirement savings system and to bring forward a recommendation in the form of a roadmap and estimated timeline for introduction.   <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the role of the new Pensions Council is to provide advice on pensions and to give a much stronger prominence to consumer concerns.  I have previously highlighted that there a number of specific matters which I want the Council to focus on and this includes the area of pension charges which, following its recent establishment, the Council has now begun to consider. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400070#WRC02100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Levy","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400070#WRC02150"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[24581\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400070#WRC02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she expects any call on the additional funds raised from the increased pension fund levy in 2014 and 2015, which in her budget statement she said, were required to make provision for potential State liabilities, which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties; the circumstances in which such a call would arise; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>The Minister for Finance stated previously in the House that an additional levy on pension funds was introduced for 2014 and 2015 to help fund the Jobs Initiative and to make provision for potential State liabilities emerging from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties, and that the yield from the additional levy in these years forms part of general tax revenue of the Central Fund and is not directed to any particular or specific item of expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013 amended the Pensions Act 1990 to address double insolvencies occurring after the 25th December 2013.

The post office is seen as a key piece of financial and social infrastructure for both urban and rural areas.  Part of the strength of the post office brand, and one of its chief selling points, is that it reaches all parts of the country and can be accessed by anyone.  It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focussed network of post offices in the community.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s continuing support for An Post is apparent, both in terms of the cost of postage services and the value of the contract for welfare payments.  In this regard, we anticipate this year that we will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for cash payment services to welfare customers.  This contract is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.  <\/p>  <p>  As Deputies are aware my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, formally launched the Post Office Network Business Development Group under the independent Chairmanship of Mr Bobby Kerr in February, 2015 to explore potential commercial opportunities available to the post office network. <\/p>  <p>  I understand An Post is anxious to grow its existing levels of services in the light of emerging market pressures which extend beyond the delivery of welfare payments.  In this context I am pleased to note An Post has tendered for the provision of a new payment and transaction account.  I look forward to that becoming available in the not too distant future as it will provide alternative payment opportunities for my Department&rsquo;s customers.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to recognise the general societal trend to electronic payments the Department has been changing some of its application forms.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the amendments do not remove the option to be paid at the post office. This option will remain on the forms.  Therefore, customers are free to opt to receive their payment at the post office if they wish. I also want to emphasise that the department continuously reviews its forms to ensure that they are amenable and relevant to all customers. In order to ensure that the department&rsquo;s forms present payment options equally, I have asked the department to update them to ensure that a neutral wording in relation to payment options is provided and to also ensure that one payment option is not favoured over another.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is conscious of the important role of the post office around the country, not only in respect of social welfare payments but also in offering other financial services such as paying bills and carrying out a range of banking services.  The Government has consistently stated its commitment to maintaining the post office network as set out in the Programme for Government.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400071#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":129,"content":"<p>Question No. 50 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Data","counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400071#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":131,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[25199\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400071#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons currently on a community employment scheme; the comparable figures in June 2012, June 2013 and June 2014; the associated costs to her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

It is in this context, and mindful of the importance of maintaining the adequacy of the rate of the State pension, that a number of reforms have been introduced, in order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life. <\/p>  <p>  State pension age is being increased in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66 by the abolition of the State pension (transition).  The pension age will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  It is anticipated that this rate of increase in pension age will be no faster than the rate of increased longevity.

I welcome the considerable debate that has been generated by this reform, which commenced in 2012.  My priority is to ensure that we, as a society, arrive at a situation where lone parents have the same opportunities to access employment, training and education.  Despite committing extensive funding to lone parent payments since the 1970s, lone parents remain the most at-risk-of-poverty, and their children are at a high risk of poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The final phase of the one-parent family payment age reforms are due to take place on 2 July 2015 when approximately 29,400 one-parent family payment recipients will be transitioning out of the one-parent family payment scheme.  Approximately 19,800 are expected to transition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, 4,100 to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and 5,500 to a re-rated family income supplement.<\/p>  <p>  The 5,500 customers already on family income supplement will have their payment automatically increased to take account of the loss of 60% of their one-parent family payment income and have received letters to that effect.  These individuals will also qualify for the back to work family dividend (BTWFD), which allows them to retain their increase for a qualified child when they transition off the one parent family payment.  The Dividend is worth &euro;1,550 per child in the first year and reducing to 50% entitlement worth &euro;775 per child in the second year.<\/p>  <p>  All remaining customers were invited to attend information sessions in their local Intreo offices where they were advised of the different options available to them when they transition from the one-parent family payment scheme.  At these information sessions, staff of the Department informed lone parents that the most financially advantageous option available to them was to work a minimum of 19 hours per week and claim family income supplement. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of these information sessions, estimates suggest that to date over 1,250 of these lone parents have become first time family income supplement recipients.  These individuals are now financially better off than when they were claiming the one-parent family payment.  These customers will also qualify for the BTWFD from 2 July 2015.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of customers who will move to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment will have no change in their weekly income.  However, individuals who are earning above &euro;60 per week may incur a loss as the jobseeker&rsquo;s means test is less generous than the equivalent one-parent family payment means test. <\/p>  <p>  Lone parents who transition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment will be supported by the Department to produce a personal development plan with the help of a case officer on a one to one basis.  My Department will continue work with lone parents to provide them with enhanced access to the Department's supports and services.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to examining the various supports available to all families with children, including single parent families, in the next Budget.  In particular, I will look at the scope for improvements in the child benefit, as well as other supports for families in part-time or full-time employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400072#WRE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[25381\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400072#WRE01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of women previously in receipt of the one-parent family payment, who have experienced a net reduction in their weekly income arising from the changes that have taken place; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

However, earlier this year I introduced an extension to the entitlement of the one-parent family payment so that from May of this year these customers can re-apply for one-parent family payment and provided they satisfy the conditions they will be able to retain one-parent family payment and half rate carer&rsquo;s allowance until their youngest child is 16 years of age.<\/p>  <p>  The remaining lone parents transitioned from one-parent family payment to a wide range of other payments or to education, training or employment programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400072#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":171,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[25382\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400072#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of applicants for the one-parent family payment refused on whatever grounds, on a monthly basis, over the past 12 months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":172,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is detailed in the following tabular statement.<div><\/p><p><b>One-Parent Family Payment Claims Disallowed June 2014 to May 2015<\/b><\/div><table><tr><th>June 2014<\/th><th><div>80<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>July 2014<\/td><td><div>114<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August 2014<\/td><td><div>77<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September 2014<\/td><td><div>86<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>October 2014<\/td><td><div>86<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>November 2014 <\/td><td><div>83<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>December 2014<\/td><td><div>71<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>January 2015<\/td><td><div>89<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>February 2015<\/td><td><div>61<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>March 2015<\/td><td><div>58<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>April 2015<\/td><td><div>62<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>May 2015<\/td><td><div>71<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400072#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":173,"content":"<p>Question No. 66 answered with Question No. 63.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Schemes","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400072#WRE02050"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[25384\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400072#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the applications for various social welfare payments which are most commonly refused on application, and referred to appeal and-or an oral hearing; the number of cases subsequently rejected or approved, on appeal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":176,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[25391\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400072#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of applications for carer&rsquo;s allowance, ophthalmic benefit, dental benefit, invalidity pension, and disability allowance received in the past six months; the number approved, refused, or pending; the way the figures compare with the previous 12 month period; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[25394\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400072#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which backlogs continue to be addressed in respect of various headings and payments operated by her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 74 and 77 together.<\/p><p>The specific information requested by the Deputy is in tabular form as follows.<\/p><p>Scheme areas continuously monitor and review procedures, practices and communication to ensure that clients are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.

However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by unemployed jobseekers and, in accordance with the EU Council recommendation for a Youth Guarantee by young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government's Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee plan. <\/p>  <p>  As, under services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes, and JobBridge, Ireland already had many of the recommended component parts of a Youth Guarantee, the main plank in Ireland is to prioritise access to these existing supports for young people, who become unemployed, with the objective of ensuring that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months as per the EU council recommendation.  <\/p>  <p>  In this regard our first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.

The survey indicated that 39% of young participants progressed into employment immediately on completion of the internship and that the proportion in employment rose to about 60% five months after completion.  Analysis of administrative data on those under 25 who have completed a JobBridge internship more recently shows a similar progression rate to employment immediately on completion of the internship, at 37%. <\/p>  <p>  - JobsPlus provides subsidies to employers for the full-time employment of those formerly long-term unemployed on the Live Register.  Currently there are 4,901 participants benefitting from JobsPlus, 664 (13.5%) of whom are under 25.  It is too early to know what might be the employment outcomes once the JobsPlus subsidy expires.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has initiated on an extensive impact evaluation programme which will assess, using counterfactual econometric methods, the impacts of programmes and processes on employment outcomes.

There are approximately 68,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The overall cost of rent supplement per tenancy has increased nominally by approximately 1.5% over the last six months.  This increase is explained for the most part by the operation of the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework and the Tenancy Sustainment Protocol operated in conjunction with Threshold in Dublin and Cork.  Under these measures, rent payments are being made in excess of the rent limits to over 2,100 rent supplement households to ensure they retain their rented accommodation in view of the current difficulties in securing suitable and affordable accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of housing is a key priority for Government which is being addressed through the Construction 2020 Strategy and the Social Housing Strategy 2020.  It would be expected that the cost of the rent supplement scheme would be reduced following the implementation of a comprehensive local authority house building programme as those customers with long term housing needs would have their housing needs addressed.  The savings accruing to rent supplement would depend on the location of the housing and family types accommodated.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department's strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  HAP is currently in operation in nine local authority areas in which there are approximately 2,300 HAP tenancies already in place.  The financial provision for rent supplement for 2015 represents a transfer of funding in excess of &euro;20 million to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to support the HAP.  There are plans to roll out HAP to 10 further local authorities during 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400073#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":196,"content":"<p>Question No. 74 answered with Question No. 67.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400073#WRF01800"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[25392\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400073#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which she may continue to improve the time taken to process appeals in respect of various social protection payments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":199,"content":"<p>The average appeal processing time for 2014 and to date in 2015 broken down by all social welfare scheme types is outlined in the following tables. <\/p><p>Appeal processing times peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.

The impetus to reduce use of 1 and 2 cent coins by rounding total bills to the nearest 5 cent at the till arises from:<\/p><p>-The reluctance of consumers to use 1 and 2 cent coinsthese coins tend to be lost or hoarded<\/p><p>-The related cost\/inconvenience to retailers of dealing with these coins<\/p><p>-The disproportionate cost to the Central Bank to produce new 1 and 2 cent coins for circulation<\/p><p>The Wexford Rounding Trial was subsequently run from 16 September to 17 November 2013, and showed strong support for rounding both from consumers and retailers.

Therefore the full additional yield would not be available immediately. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue undertakes a range of risk management interventions to target and confront those who do not comply, including tax evasion and black market activity. The objective is that people are deterred from filing inaccurate returns and from engaging in shadow economy activity and smuggling.\u00a0 The range of interventions has increased in recent years. Interventions include appraisals, aspect queries, profile interviews, assurance checks, enforcement, investigation and prosecutions, as well as audits.\u00a0 The appropriate intervention depends on the relevant risk. The average rate of return on each type of intervention varies depending on the intervention.\u00a0 In some types of interventions to tackle evasion and the black economy, such as enforcement, the focus is on the detection of drugs and fiscal smuggling where the direct exchequer yield is not the immediate objective. <\/p>  <p>  It must also be recognised that Revenue has to prioritise its resources and must, for example, provide service for compliance, by making it easier and less costly to voluntarily comply.\u00a0 The administration of taxes and duties requires a wide range of specialists and experts.

As such, the estimated cost attached to REITs relates not to an exemption from tax, but rather to the move from direct taxation of rental income in the hands of investors, to the taxation of dividends distributed to investors from REIT profits arising from that rental income.\u00a0 The REIT legislation requires that 85% of all property income profits be distributed annually to shareholders.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In general, the trading profits of companies in Ireland are subject to Corporation Tax at 12.5%.  Rental profits of companies are subject to Corporation Tax at 25%. Rental profits arising in a REIT are exempt from Corporation Tax.  However, profits from any other activities are subject to Corporation Tax in the normal way. <\/p>  <p>  In answer to the question as to how much annual revenue would be raised by applying a minimum rate of Income Tax of 20% to all REIT income, REITs are publically listed companies, meaning their Financial Statements are publically available, but the specific figures required to calculate their rental profit (the portion of profit that is exempt) is not necessarily available in these public documents.  For reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on specific details of rental profit, if any, of the limited number of REITS currently operating in Ireland. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In answer to the question as to how much annual revenue would be raised by applying a minimum rate of tax of 25% to all REIT Capital Gains, REITs are investment vehicles that are specifically designed to hold rental investment property.\u00a0 They are focused on long-term holding of income-producing property.\u00a0 They are not designed specifically to undertake development activities, or as a vehicle for short-term speculative gains.  There is an exemption from Capital Gains Tax for a REIT on the sale of properties from its property rental business.  It is not possible to predict when (or if) a REIT may sell some (or all) of its rental property portfolio or to predict what gain, if any, may arise on such hypothetical future sales.<\/p>  <p>  In answer to the question as to how much annual revenue would be raised if the non-resident withholding tax exemption was removed for REITs, I can confirm there is no such exemption.  In general, distributions (i.e. payments) from Irish resident companies to Irish shareholders are subject to Dividend Withholding Tax (\"DWT\").  Payments made to non-resident shareholders are generally exempt from \u00a0DWT.  There is no exemption from DWT for payments made from a REIT from profits arising from its property rental business to non-resident shareholders, as the general DWT exemption does not apply in such circumstances.  However, non-resident investors who are resident in countries with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement (DTA) may be able to reclaim some of the DWT, if the relevant DTA permits.  Non-resident investors who are resident in countries with which Ireland does not have a DTA will suffer DWT on the full amount of the distribution. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400077#WRK02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":329,"content":"<p>Question No. 124 answered with Question No. 92.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Reductions","counter":330,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400078#WRL00250"},{"type":"question","counter":331,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[25301\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400078#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the annual cost of reducing to 11.5% the value added tax rate for construction refurbishments costing up to &euro;40,000.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":332,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as the information furnished on VAT returns does not require the yield from particular activities or sectors of trade to be identified, it is not possible to estimate the VAT yield for the specific activities mentioned by the Deputy in his questions.

This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  A study commissioned by my Department estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole. It suggests growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5% and increase in real wages of 1.5%. It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs.  The EU Commission&rsquo;s mandate to negotiate with the United States on a new Free Trade deal includes in the scope (paragraphs 22 and 23), investment protection and investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS).  The stated aim of negotiations on investment is to negotiate investment liberalisation and protection provisions on the basis of the highest levels of liberalisation and highest standards of protection that both sides have negotiated to date.<\/p><p>The mandate makes it clear that the inclusion of investment protection and ISDS will depend on EU interests being met and on the final balance of the Agreement.  Importantly, the mandate states that the objectives of any investment protection provisions would be without prejudice to the right of EU and the member states to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social, environmental, security, stability of the financial system, public health and safety in a non-discriminatory manner.<\/p><p>This means that the type of investment arbitration system under TTIP will be a vast improvement on investment protection in existing Bilateral Investment Treaties, some of which date back to the 1950&rsquo;s.<\/p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s Concept Paper, &ldquo;<i>Investment in TTIP and beyond &ndash; the path for reform<\/i>&rdquo;, published on 6 May, sets out the context for this reform and, building on the important progress that has been achieved in the investment agreements with Canada and Singapore, sets out four areas for further improvement: Governments&rsquo; right to regulate, establishment and functioning of tribunals, relationship between national judicial systems and an ISDS system, and an appellate mechanism.<\/p><p>These improvements are aimed at fixing the problems with investor dispute settlement in order to create a new modern system of investment arbitration.  Ireland already provides the highest protection for investors by virtue of Article 43 of our Constitution, so the policy intention of the Commission in these negotiations is not new to Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400080#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":397,"content":"<p>Question No. 148 answered with Question No. 144.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400080#WRN00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alternative Farm Enterprises","counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400080#WRN00850"},{"type":"question","counter":399,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[25206\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400080#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he has considered the development of an indigenous willow growing industry located in the midlands, underpinned by long term supply contracts; if he has examined any incentive measure including grant aid or tax breaks with the Minister for Finance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":400,"content":"<p>My Department has had a Bio-Energy Establishment Scheme in place since 2007, and this Scheme specifically provides support for the establishment of willow plantations.

The BDGP builds on the large strategic investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years, and will ultimately bring about fundamental improvements to the entire sector by substantially improving the genetic quality of the national beef herd. The Programme was launched on 5 May and almost 30,000 applications had been received by my Department when it closed on 5 June. While analysis of the applications is still ongoing, the initial figures suggest that the programme is fully subscribed.  The requirement for farmers to move towards using four and five star rated stock bulls and heifers is an essential component of the Programme.

I am also aware that these requirements will take time to introduce which is why there is a substantial lead-in time included in the design of the programme.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct to state that bulls or heifers rated as 4 or 5 stars at either the time of genotyping for animals sourced within the herd, or at the time of purchase for animals sourced outside the herd, will remain in compliance with the replacement strategy requirements of the Beef Data and Genomics Scheme even in situations where the animal may be subsequently reassessed to 3 stars or lower as the index evolves.<\/p>  <p>  The intention of the programme is to encourage the introduction and retention of higher genetic merit animals into suckler farms in Ireland &ndash; it would not be appropriate to penalise a farmer who follows this replacement strategy and subsequently finds that some of the animals are reassessed at a later date as the index rises.

The Agency&rsquo;s key priority is to ensure that the needs of survivors are met in the best way possible. Accordingly, the 2015 budget is directed towards protecting front-line services for survivors.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has undertaken a comprehensive review of the domestic, sexual and gender based violence services, in consultation with service providers. Tusla recognises and values the important work being undertaken by these organisations, and the considerable efforts they make to maintain services in the face of funding and other challenges. The review found that despite these efforts, service delivery is fragmented, with inequity in the accessibility of services across different areas. There was also some duplication and overlap in training provision. Tusla&rsquo;s aim is to put these services on a more sustainable footing. <\/p>  <p>  For the first time domestic and sexual violence services are being developed as a specialist national service with a single line of accountability and a dedicated national budget of &euro;19.5m, in 2015. A roadmap for the future of service delivery has been approved by Tusla&rsquo;s Board. The Government&rsquo;s priority is to protect frontline services, and that is what Tusla is endeavouring to do. A key concern in the context of domestic violence is to address the needs of children who witness violence in the family and home setting. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has allocated funding of &euro;600,000 to Women&rsquo;s Aid in 2015, to maintain current frontline service provision, including the development of Women&rsquo;s Aid national domestic violence helpline.  Women&rsquo;s Aid receives funding from a number of government sources for the services it provides, including &euro;157,914 over a two year period from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government; and &euro;140,000 &ndash; an increase of &euro;60,000 in 2015 &ndash; from the Department of Justice and Equality for the awareness raising and court accompaniment services. Women's Aid has expressed concern over the reduction in funding by Tusla, and I met recently with the Chairperson and Chief Executive to hear their perspective on the impact of the reduction and to discuss plans for the future development of services in this important area. My own Department has not undertaken a study on the impact of funding reductions to Women&rsquo;s Aid.<\/p>  <p>  A joint delivery model of domestic violence training to Tusla and HSE staff, and other relevant groups, will continue in 2015. Tusla training staff co-deliver this programme in partnership with domestic violence service providers in local areas; child protection and welfare issues are addressed in this context.   Tusla continues to give full consideration to domestic violence training needs, so as to achieve the most sustainable and effective approach capable of delivering the best outcomes for survivors of domestic violence throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla recognises the valuable work of Women&rsquo;s Aid, and other organisations providing services in this area. Tusla is actively engaging with the organisation on services and funding for 2015, and is committed to continuing to work in partnership with Women&rsquo;s Aid and the wider domestic violence services sector into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400083#WRQ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Adoption Legislation","counter":506,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400083#WRQ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":507,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[25432\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400083#WRQ02100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will acknowledge the distress and other negative effects being caused by the ongoing delay in the introduction of adoption and tracing legislation; if he will confirm the existence, or not, of any new or previously unknown constitutional and legal questions that may have arisen in relation to this matter within the past 12 months, that might have contributed to this excessive delay; the amount of legislative drafting time, in hours, that has been dedicated to this task by his Department officials since the present Minister took office, and in the three years prior to the tenure of the current Minister; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1105","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":508,"content":"<p>As I have stated on a number of occasions  complex legal and constitutional issues  arise in the drafting of the Adoption Information and Tracing Bill.

This case was raised at a meeting of the Permanent Council of the OSCE on 11 June.  The EU expressed concern at reports that this human rights defender was detained for more than 10 hours and subjected to excessive and humiliating treatment by local authorities in the city of Chinaz in Uzbekistan on 31 May, and that she was subsequently detained again on 5 June and subjected once more to a physically invasive and humiliating search.  The EU called on the government of Uzbekistan to properly investigate her official complaint of mistreatment and to ensure that those responsible would be held accountable.  The EU also urged the government of Uzbekistan to implement in good faith its national and international human rights obligations and commitments.  In regard to the position of human rights in Uzbekistan, this was the subject of a Universal Periodic Review at the Human Rights Council in 2013.  As a member of the Council, Ireland called on Uzbekistan to implement fully and effectively the recommendations by the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in his 2003 report and the Committee against Torture in its concluding observations in 2011.  This recommendation was accepted by Uzbekistan.  Ireland also called on Uzbekistan to agree a precise and early date for the visit by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, which was noted by Uzbekistan.  I welcome Uzbekistan&rsquo;s adoption of a National Action Plan aimed at ensuring the implementation of the recommendations which it accepted under the 2013 Universal Periodic Review exercise.  I would strongly encouraged Uzbekistan to step up its cooperation with the UN to ensure that this Plan is properly implemented and duly monitored, in cooperation with international partners. <\/p>  <p>  At the Human Rights Council session in March, Ireland supported an EU Statement on Uzbekistan which acknowledged the recent releases of prisoners as positive steps and encouraged further releases.  The Statement also expressed the EU&rsquo;s ongoing concern at the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, including restrictions on political activity and on civil society, reports of torture, and the imprisonment of human rights defenders.  The EU encouraged Uzbekistan to implement planned reforms and to cooperate with UN Special Procedures.<\/p>  <p>  The Human Rights situation in Uzbekistan is regularly discussed within the framework of that country's Human Rights Dialogue with the EU.  The most recent meeting took place in November 2014.  The EU highlighted its serious concerns about reports of the torture and abuse of detainees, and urged Uzbekistan to make the widest possible use of the next prison amnesty.  Other matters raised included the need to cooperate with the International Labour Organisation on forced labour, the need to ease restrictions on the press, and the importance of independent civil society organisations.  The next EU-Uzbekistan Human Rights Dialogue is scheduled to take place in Uzbekistan later this year and will be a further opportunity to raise with Uzbekistan mistreatment of detainees and the wider human rights situation in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400085#WRS02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":581,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[25220\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400085#WRS03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views regarding the position of human rights and political freedoms in Bahrain, following the detention of opposition leader, Sheikh Ali Salman; if he or his officials have discussed these matters with European Union colleagues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1197","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":582,"content":"<p>I am familiar with the case of Sheikh Ali Salman, Bahrain&rsquo;s main opposition leader, who was reportedly jailed for four years last week.

Excessive restrictions on civil society and interference with the right to freedom of religion or belief were also raised by the EU.     During this dialogue, the EU welcomed certain positive developments in Turkmenistan, including the plan to create an Ombudsman institution in the context of a broader constitutional reform process.

At this time, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the annual levies that may be raised by planning authorities in the operation of the levy.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400089#WRW00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":686,"content":"<p>Question No. 242 answered with Question No. 239.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Records","counter":687,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400089#WRW00950"},{"type":"question","counter":688,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[25179\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400089#WRW01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department uses any system software for the auto-deletion of email messages; if so, his Department's guidelines on the use of such a system; and the length of time emails are stored before they are auto-deleted.","asker":"1100","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":689,"content":"<p>My Department does not use a specific software product for the purpose of auto-deleting email.

Having received and considered Wood Mackenzie&rsquo;s comprehensive and detailed report the Government agreed that Ireland's oil and gas fiscal terms should be revised along the lines recommended.   The principal recommendations made by Wood Mackenzie were as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - For now Ireland should maintain a concession system, with industry rather than the State bearing the risk associated with investing in exploration;<\/p>  <p>  - Going forward a form of production profit tax should continue to apply in Ireland, but for discoveries made under future licences the form of this tax should be revised;<\/p>  <p>  - The tax should be charged on a field-by-field basis with the rate varying according to the profitability of the field and charged on each field&rsquo;s net profits;<\/p>  <p>  - That the revised tax should include a minimum payment at a rate of 5% which would function like a royalty and would result in the State receiving a share of revenue in every year that a field is selling production;<\/p>  <p>  - That the revised tax rates should be higher than the Profit Resource Rent Tax currently in place, thereby ensuring a higher share for the State from the most profitable fields. This would result in a maximum rate of 55% applying in the case of new licences, compared with a maximum rate of 40% under the current fiscal regime;<\/p>  <p>  - That the corporation tax rate applying to petroleum production should remain at 25%; and<\/p>  <p>  - there should be no retroactive change to the fiscal terms applying to existing authorisations.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendation that there should be no retroactive change in respect of existing licences is consistent with both Government policy and the view of the former Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture, as expressed in their May 2012 report on Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration.<\/p>  <p>  For future prospective licence holders a clear regime is being set out and the rationale for that regime has been explained. This should further engender industry confidence in the stability and predictability of Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms and allow the industry to focus on effective and timely exploration effort.<\/p>  <p>  There have been four commercial natural gas discoveries since exploration began offshore Ireland in the early 1970s, namely the Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads (Kinsale area) producing gas fields off the coast of Cork fields and the Corrib gas field off the coast of Mayo. There have been no commercial discoveries of oil to date.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the direct financial contribution to the State, profits from the three Kinsale area gas fields are taxed at a rate of 25%. In addition royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head. The combination of tax, royalties and rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income from these two fields. Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads Gas field or from future production from the Corrib gas field as Ireland moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987. Profits from the Corrib gas field will be taxed at 25% when the field goes into production, which is expected in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The rate of tax that will apply to profits arising from any future commercial discoveries made under an exploration licence granted to December 2006 will be 25%. The rate of tax that will apply to profits arising from any future commercial discoveries made under an exploration licence or licensing option granted from January 2007 to May 2014 will be between 25% and 40% depending on the profitability of the field.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the taxation system and the receipt of taxation are matters for the Revenue Commissioners. As a consequence I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with the current position as regards tax paid or due to the Exchequer in respect of the Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads (Kinsale area) fields, nor to provide estimates of how such a position might alter under hypothetical increased tax rates.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of existing exploration licences where exploration is ongoing, while we hope for more commercial discoveries, there is little point in speculating about potential revenues from oil or gas fields that have yet to be discovered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400090#WRX02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Postcode System","counter":724,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400090#WRX02100"},{"type":"question","counter":725,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[25327\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400090#WRX02200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when Eircode will be operational; the efforts that are being made to assist businesses and households with the transition involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":726,"content":"<p>Capita Business Support Services Ireland were awarded a 10 year contract in December 2013 to develop and implement the National Postcode System.

The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), is statutorily responsible for all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and\/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002. I have no statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas pipeline network.<\/p>  <p>  In 2006, the CER approved a Gas Connections Policy which enabled assessment of the feasibility of connecting new towns to the gas network. In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied.<\/p>  <p>  The policy provides that the construction and operating costs of connecting a town, or group of towns, to the network are recovered through the consumption of gas and the associated network charges. The distance of a town from the gas network is the major factor determining the costs of building a gas pipeline. The anticipated industrial or commercial gas usage in the town largely determines the revenue from gas network charges which must balance the connection costs. Uneconomic gas pipeline projects would unfairly increase energy costs for all gas consumers.<\/p>  <p>  Gaslink completed three comprehensive studies to assess nearly 80 towns for connections to the gas network with the result that more than twenty new towns have been connected in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  Under its New Towns Analysis Phase 3 report, published in 2010, the County Kerry towns of Listowel, Killarney and Tralee were assessed, as was the County Donegal towns of Ballyshannon, Bundoran, Donegal, Lifford and Letterkenny. However, the Gaslink review found that these towns did not qualify for connection on economic grounds.<\/p>  <p>  As the successor to Gaslink, GNI will continue to review the towns which did not qualify for connection in 2010 as well as other towns. The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, usually as a result of the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.<\/p>  <p>The CER recently hosted a consultation on a submission received by it from GNI proposing revisions to the existing gas connections policy, as mentioned above. As the consultation period has ended, a decision is expected shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400091#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":746,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400091#WRY01400"},{"type":"question","counter":747,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[25363\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015062400091#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if eel fishing licences will be reissued by his Department following a ban on eel fishing, which was introduced in 2009; his plans to compensate those who held eel fishing licences in the past; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1108","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":748,"content":"<p>I refer to the reply to Question No. 226 of 11 June.
