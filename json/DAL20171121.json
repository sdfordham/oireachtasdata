In May 2014, the T&aacute;naiste, who was then the Minister for Justice and Equality, stated very clearly that she was committed to providing Maurice McCabe and whistleblowers with the highest levels of legal support and that she was very conscious of the significant role he had played in revealing wrongdoing and malpractice.  The Taoiseach indicated in his reply to my questions on the issue that the T&aacute;naiste had no prior knowledge and only found out about it after the fact, at around the time that it came into the public domain.  He followed that up the following day, in response to Deputy Howlin, and referred to May 2016 as the date of her becoming aware of this.  We now know that is not true.  The D&aacute;il was misled.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach was misled by the T&aacute;naiste.  Deputy Kelly had, prior to this, asked basic questions which the Ceann Comhairle is now following up.  Deputy Kelly did not get straight answers to those questions; he got answers to questions he did not ask.<\/p> <p> Listening to the T&aacute;naiste just before I came in, she said she had received an email which related to a criminal charge against Mr. McCabe being raised at the tribunal on the basis that it had not been properly investigated.  That raises all sorts of issues.  I have to inform the Taoiseach that, just a minute before I arrived in here, I took a phone call from Maurice McCabe - he had been on to another Deputy.  He is adamant that such an issue was never raised during the O'Higgins inquiry.  He is taking very serious issue with the remarks of the T&aacute;naiste on the \"News at One\" today and, it is my understanding, will be issuing a statement.  The House will appreciate I have only taken the call.  I am not in a position to adjudicate on this but it again raises more questions than answers.<\/p> <p> Again, I would make the point that it seems there was an attempt over the weekend to downplay the nature of the adversarial attack on Maurice McCabe at the inquiry - it was just about motivation and credibility.  In fact, it was about integrity.  This is on the record of the House, and it might have been Deputy Howlin who spoke over a year ago in regard to this issue.  It was in the public domain, courtesy of Michael Clifford and of Katie Hannon of RTE.  Mr. Smyth stated: \"[M]y instructions are to challenge the integrity certainly of Sgt McCabe and his motivation\".  This was in response to questions from Mr. Justice O'Higgins.  I can go through the whole transcript but I will not, as I do not have time.<\/p> <p> The bottom line is that the D&aacute;il was misled last week.  Very basic questions are not getting answers.  I want to ask about the email the T&aacute;naiste spoke about.  Who initiated that email?  Who was the justice official who sent that email to the T&aacute;naiste?  Did the T&aacute;naiste read the email in regard to the issue that she raised?  Essentially, will the T&aacute;naiste come before the House, make a comprehensive statement on this and answer questions that Deputies could put to clear this up once and for all?  This is a very serious issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100003#A00300","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511273100,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

I appreciate the opportunity to clarify matters as best I can.  The House will appreciate, once again, that I do not have first-hand knowledge of any of these matters.  I am replying based on briefings from other Departments and other Ministers but I will do my best to shine a light on things.  I want to note as well that these are matters before a tribunal, a tribunal established by this House to investigate into these matters, not a role this House can hold.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm once again that the Department of Justice and Equality had no hand, act or part in the legal strategy pursued by the former Garda Commissioner.  The T&aacute;naiste had no hand, act or part in the legal strategy pursued by the former Garda Commissioner.  The Department of Justice and Equality had no prior knowledge of it.  The T&aacute;naiste had no prior knowledge of it either and, therefore, could not influence it.  The Department of Justice and Equality only found out about it after the fact - after it had already happened.  The same applies to the T&aacute;naiste: she only found out about it after the fact - after it had already happened.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequent to my reply in this House last week, I received some new information in the form of an email I saw at 11.30 p.m. last night for the first time.  This is an email between two officials in the Department of Justice and Equality describing a conversation with a third party, an official in the Office of the Attorney General.  This email was then forwarded to the Minister for information.<\/p><p>The email speaks of a dispute between the legal team of the Garda Commissioner at the time and Sergeant McCabe.  It concludes that neither the Attorney General nor the Minister had any function in the matter.  The email has been provided to the disclosures tribunal.  I do hope that in some way clarifies the matter as best as I can.<\/p> <p> In relation to Sergeant McCabe, I want to say Sergeant McCabe is somebody who I have had dealings with.  I met him when I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport when he made allegations relating to penalty points, allegations which few people believed to be true, but because of the evidence he provided to my Department, I believed that they may well have been true.  I subsequently met him and subsequently supported him on a number of occasions, particularly at times when it was not possible to do so.  He is one of the bravest people that I have ever encountered in public life and he is somebody who has been very much wronged by the State on a number of occasions because of his bravery and because of his willingness to shine a light into some dark places.<\/p> <p> I really hope that we all accept that these are now matters for the disclosures tribunal.  That tribunal should be allowed to do its work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100004#B00700","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511273700,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste spoke to the Taoiseach last week.  The point I made was that the D&aacute;il had been misled.  There is no question about that.  Misleading information was given to the D&aacute;il.  I am not saying that it was deliberately misled, but it was misled because we were given clear information that the Minister and the Department only knew a year later regarding a row with the Department.<\/p>  <p>  There is genuinely great unease on this matter, given the history.  The protestations of support for Sergeant Maurice McCabe contrast with how the system has consistently dealt with him.  The public articulation of support bears no relationship with the consistent adversarial attack on his integrity, his motives and what he was about.  That followed right through.  The significance of the revelations in the O'Higgins report is just that, because in the aftermath of that report, the Government, including the Minister, continued to express full confidence in the Garda Commissioner notwithstanding the clear adversarial nature of the activity at that commission, in essence by the State and legal counsels representing agencies of the State.  That is the point.<\/p>  <p>  We are finding it difficult to accept the credibility of what the T&aacute;naiste is offering us in terms of the level of awareness of the Department and herself and when they became aware.  Is the Taoiseach still holding that it was a full year afterwards in May 2016?  Can we get any clarity on that?

The answers that he has given the House today are again unsatisfactory.  We know that he misled the D&aacute;il, intentionally or not, last week because the Department of Justice and Equality has now clarified that it has miraculously found an email that has been missing for the past two years.  We now know that the T&aacute;naiste became aware of this a full year earlier than the Taoiseach claimed in the Chamber last week.  I welcome the fact that he has corrected the record of the House and acknowledged this, but that does not deal with the entire issue.  We have contradictory information, which raises more questions, particularly given the T&aacute;naiste's interview on RT&Eacute;.<\/p><p>She now tells us that she was aware in May 2015 that legal counsel for the Garda Commissioner was making allegations of a serious criminal nature against Sergeant McCabe and was also claiming that this complaint had not been investigated.  We hear that Sergeant McCabe is disputing at the commission that that ever happened.  We need to square that circle.<\/p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste told us she cannot even remember being told this and receiving the email in 2015.  Let us cast our minds back to the significance of this controversy.  We all know it has caused great hardship to Sergeant McCabe and his immediate and wider family.  It has also led to the resignation of the Minister for Justice and Equality, the confidential recipient and the Garda Commissioner.  Is it really credible to tell us that the Minister for Justice and Equality at the time got an email which said that the legal counsel for the Garda Commissioner was questioning a senior garda whose involvement and bravery, as the Taoiseach said, resulted in the resignation of those three individuals, that informed the Minister that serious criminal complaints were being made against the said garda, and that said that accusations were being made by the Commissioner through the legal representative that the complaints were not being investigated by the Garda which she oversees, and the Minister cannot remember reading that email?  That really stretches credibility.<\/p> <p> Many other things stretch credibility.  We know that the Department miraculously found this email on Thursday.  I am not sure when the T&aacute;naiste was made aware of it.  Again, it was the investigative journalism of Katie Hannon, along with Mick Clifford, who uncovered the story last year.  She put this information into the public domain.  The Taoiseach's Twitter account, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, or the strategic information service did not put this information into the public domain.  An investigative journalist had to draw the information from the Department and Minister.<\/p> <p> A serious number of questions need to be answered.  If the T&aacute;naiste cannot answer these questions credibly, there will be serious questions about whether the she can remain within her position.  This is a major political crisis because the Taoiseach has put false information on the record of the House.  He has now corrected the record of the House, but there are now other serious questions.<\/p> <p> When will the T&aacute;naiste make herself available to answer questions, not just to RT&Eacute; but to the Deputies in the House who hold her accountable?  Will she make herself available today?  Will the Taoiseach, as leader of Fine Gael, ensure that it supports a change to the Order of Business so that we can have proper statements and questions to the former Minister and current T&aacute;naiste?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100005#C02000","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511274300,"counter":36,"content":"<p>This is an email between officials from two and half years ago.

Both occasions related to the Department of Justice and Equality and both now require explanations from the Taoiseach.  The first occasion related to the staffing of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  The Taoiseach told the House in September on the advice of the Department of Justice and Equality that the role of the detective inspector had been filled on a part-time basis while recruitment of a full-time person was under way.  This was not true.  The person the Taoiseach referred to did not fall under the management of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  In truth, that vacancy remains unfilled more than a year after it arose.  I ask the Taoiseach to correct his statement to the D&aacute;il on that matter.<\/p>  <p>  Second, and potentially more seriously, the Taoiseach made comments to me in this House last week when I was trying to get information that the series of questions posed by Deputy Alan Kelly failed to get from the Department of Justice and Equality and its Minister.  The Taoiseach stated the T&aacute;naiste had informed him she only became aware of the legal strategy against Sergeant McCabe around the time it entered the public domain.  That is, quite simply, not true and this is not a small matter.  The legal strategy was designed to fundamentally discredit Sergeant Maurice McCabe and subvert the course of justice, a matter of enormous importance.  This good man could have been destroyed.  The strategy was deployed behind closed doors from where it could not be revealed by Sergeant McCabe under threat of criminal sanction.  At the same time the Garda Commissioner was instructing her lawyers to discredit Sergeant McCabe, she and the T&aacute;naiste were publicly lauding him.  The strategy was fundamentally dishonest.<\/p>  <p>  If the T&aacute;naiste knew even in general terms, as we have now been told, what exactly does that mean?  Will the Taoiseach produce the email partially quoted by the T&aacute;naiste on the RT&Eacute; news programme at 1 p.m.?  Any Minister being told in any terms of a development as potentially explosive as this would say bluntly, \"tell me specifically what happened and why\".<\/p><p>That such an email resulted in no action, and cannot even be recalled, is simply not credible.  Last week the Taoiseach's view was that the T&aacute;naiste did not know about this and therefore could not be asked anything about it.  We are now being asked to accept that she was told by email that an allegation of a serious crime had been part of the legal strategy, yet she still did nothing.  That any Minister for Justice and Equality would fail to examine an issue that so fundamentally goes to the heart of the administration of justice in this State is troubling.  That the T&aacute;naiste appears to have mislead the Taoiseach last week on this matter speaks to the functioning of Government itself.<\/p> <p> These are serious matters.  Will the Taoiseach outline the contacts that he has had with the T&aacute;naiste and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to ensure that questions asked in this House are fully and accurately answered?  Will he explain how something as serious as this could have reached the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality's desk without triggering questions or actions of any kind?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100007#E02500","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511275500,"counter":64,"content":"<p>As the T&aacute;naiste notes, there was a commission of investigation underway at the time under a judge which was set up by this Government, and we now have a disclosures tribunal established by this House to look into all of these matters.  The email is not my property and I do not know if I have the authority to publish it.  It is a document before the tribunal, so I will have to take advice on that matter.  I have had no direct contact with the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I have had contact with the Minister for Justice and Equality and have done my best to find out as many of the facts about this matter as possible.  In terms of my contacts with the T&aacute;naiste, we spoke on the phone when she was in Dubai last week.  As she has said on the radio just now, she did not recall the email at that time.  However, what she said to me was substantially true, that she only became aware of the details of this set of events when they came into the public knowledge.  We have an email between officials relating to a third party conversation in relation to events that happened at the commission which was forwarded to the T&aacute;naiste for information.  The conclusion at the bottom of that email was that she had no function in the matter at all.<\/p><p>In terms of the other matter raised by the Deputy, during oral questions two weeks ago I was asked a supplementary question concerning the vacancy of the position of Garda detective inspector at the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  In my response I stated that: <\/p><blockquote>I understand the duties and role have been undertaken by another detective inspector in addition to other duties.  An ambitious programme of recruitment and promotion is now underway across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is taking some time, but arising from the process a new appointment will be made to the post as soon as possible.  In the interim, the Garda authorities have confirmed that they intend to assign the role on a full-time basis, effective immediately.  It is important to note that there has been a full complement of garda&iacute; at sergeant rank throughout this period.<\/blockquote><p>Subsequent to that, the Director of Corporate Enforcement wrote to the acting commissioner on Tuesday, 14 November, to draw attention to inaccuracies in what had been reported in the media and to communicate his concern in that regard.  In recording those concerns, the director noted that the aforementioned inaccuracies appear to have been formed on the basis of information provided in the House.  This correspondence was only brought to my Department's attention on foot of a media query on Friday, 17 November.  The ODCE did not write directly to me or to the Department of the Taoiseach.  My answer in the House was based on a briefing from the Department of Justice and Equality, which had received the information from the Garda.<\/p><p>On foot of the correspondence between the Garda and the ODCE, I want to provide the following clarification.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na advised that inspector cover was provided to the ODCE from March 2017.  As I said in the House, this was somebody who had other duties at the time as well.  In his letter to the acting commissioner, the director states that at no point had a detective inspector been assigned to him and that at no point had the detective inspector come under his direction.  The director further states that under those circumstances the individual, referred to above, in his view could not be delegated with the director's powers, nor could the director share otherwise confidential information with the individual referred to.  As set out in my original answer, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had informed the Department of Justice and Equality that it intended to assign the role on a full-time but interim basis with immediate effect, and that a permanent officer would be assigned following an ongoing promotion competition.<\/p><p>Subsequent to that and after my answer an issue arose with the candidate identified to carry out the role.  I have now been assured by the Department of Justice and Equality that an inspector has been identified to fill the role on an interim full-time basis.  Following a meeting yesterday, Monday, 20 November, between the director and the detective chief superintendent of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau I am informed that the inspector will take up his new role with effect from Monday, 27 November.  An internal Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na competition is expected to conclude in early 2018.  Following this, a full-time detective inspector will be assigned to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, on a permanent basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100008#F00200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511276100,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I gave the Taoiseach an extra minute to allow him to answer the question fully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100009#G00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1511276100,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I will deal with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement issue on another occasion because I have only one minute now.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste said on radio, and the Taoiseach repeated, that she cannot recall the email.

However, I must raise concerns regarding information that is now in the public domain, regarding a request by Mr. Justice Brian Cregan for a doubling of legal fees, and a significant extension of time for the commission to complete the Siteserv module.  If the full increase in legal fees is granted, it is anticipated the inquiry will cost in the region of &euro;25 million but the original preliminary estimate was &euro;4 million.  The inquiry commenced in mid-2015 and is now seeking yet another extension to the end of 2018.  From the outset of this process, I and others expressed a desire that the inquiry would not cost a fortune and would not go on for years.  It is my understanding that commissions of inquiry are answerable to the D&aacute;il and the Taoiseach should confirm that is the case.<\/p>  <p>  The intention, as I understood it, was that the commission would act as a means of investigation led by a judge, that it would take information provided to it and would investigate based on this and other information it received.  It was not intended to be a judicial process and I have serious concerns now that it is deviating from the role originally envisaged for it.  In my first communication with the commission, I sought an undertaking on confidentiality.  I had given assurances to those from whom I had received information that I would not reveal their identities, and I have not and will not reveal their names.  My co-operation with the Commission is without question up to the point that such co-operation requires me to divulge confidential sources, thus potentially putting people in harm's way.  When whistleblowers come to us as Deputies they sometimes seek assurances about confidentiality and we, as public representatives should, and must respect that.<\/p><p> The information I was given, much of which I passed on to the inquiry, is apparently being reduced in value because I will not identify my sources.  I have a problem with that.  Now it appears that retrospective changes have been made to the procedures.  Recently, I learned that my submission has been widely circulated to what are described as \"potentially interested\" parties.  When I sought assurances on confidentiality from the commission, prior to submitting any information, I was told it would only be divulged as necessary.  There appears to have been a significant deviation from &ldquo;where necessary&rdquo; to &ldquo;potentially interested&rdquo;.  That is no small difference. <\/p> <p> Will the Taoiseach outline to the D&aacute;il how he intends to handle the request for a doubling of legal fees?  If it is to be granted, what Department will the money come from?  Will he confirm that the commission is indeed answerable to the D&aacute;il?  Does he have concerns regarding the deviation from &ldquo;where necessary&rdquo; to &ldquo;potentially interested&rdquo; in regard to the circulation of sensitive information supplied to the commission?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100009#G02300","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511276700,"counter":89,"content":"<p>The issues raised by the Deputy are not dissimilar to those raised by others.

I believe there is no option other than to grant that extension because if we do not do so the investigation will fall.  Mr. Justice Cregan has asked that he have until the end of 2018 to continue his investigations and his work, which is appropriate.  He has also asked that the legal fees be doubled.  The legal fees for commissions of investigation are the same across the board and Mr. Justice Cregan has asked that they be doubled for his commission.  I discussed this at a meeting with party leaders last week, or perhaps the previous week, when Deputy Murphy was present.  She will be aware that the broad consensus across party leaders was that we should not agree to the request that legal fees be doubled for this commission of inquiry, but that they remain standard across commissions.

First, on the idea of referring to the Business Committee, there is no commitment from the Government side that it has any inclination or wish to engage in any D&aacute;il debate on the issue or for the T&aacute;naiste to speak in any capacity.  It is very clear from the replies that people want to invoke the tribunal to avoid any discussion in the House or any questions.  I would point out that parliamentary questions have already been tabled on the matter by Deputy Alan Kelly and there have been replies, but not ones that answer the questions he asked.  The Ceann Comhairle is following up on the quality of those replies.  Even in the House reference has been made to an email.  Reference has been made publicly by the T&aacute;naiste on the national airwaves about the content of that email.  In other words, part of the email is public knowledge at this stage, without the entirety of the email being published.  That is not fair procedure or fair practice.<\/p>  <p>  I stand to be corrected but I believe there have been other precedents whereby in the midst of tribunals there have been plenty of D&aacute;il debates relating to subject matters that were covered by various tribunals.  What I want from the Taoiseach is not for the issue to be referenced back to the Business Committee to be buried in red tape and all sorts of invocations as to why we cannot do it.  This is the Parliament of the nation.  This is the plenary session of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

The extraordinary level of deprivation in the station is difficult to comprehend.  Numerous issues relating to health and safety have arisen.  It has not been fit for purpose for many years.  It was condemned by the regional safety advisor of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in October 2015.  Conditions are so dire that drinking water is not even available in the station because of potential contamination from rats and other rodents.  The cells cannot be used.  When people are arrested, they have to be driven 15 miles away to Ballymote.  The building is not fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  A new building was sanctioned in 2015 to great fanfare.  Two years later, no progress has been made.  It is beyond being a disgrace that hard-working garda&iacute; are being forced to take the kind of action they have had to take.  Essentially, they walked out of the station yesterday.  They will not be going back into that station, and I cannot blame them for that.<\/p>  <p>  Given the specific commitment in the programme for Government to enhance resources and facilities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, how can the Taoiseach explain the failure to implement the programme for Government commitment in the context of Sligo Garda Station?

The Taoiseach should remember those three initials - GRG - because they will play a big part in this Parliament in the coming period.  The FCA, in a recent report, found instances of inappropriate treatment of 92% of viable businesses that were part of its review.  In this State, the GRG operated as part of Ulster Bank and all the evidence points to similar treatment.  A total of 2,141 businesses of Ulster Bank were placed in the GRG where they believed they would be restructured and saved but were instead placed on death row.  Information provided indicates that as few as six of these businesses emerged from the GRG alive.  These companies were asset stripped by a subsidiary of Ulster Bank.<\/p>  <p>  Senior bankers in Ulster Bank told barefaced lies to the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure, and Taoiseach on this issue.  The Central Bank is dealing with the matter and is in discussions with Ulster Bank.  Political pressure needs to be brought to bear, as was the case with the tracker mortgage scandal.

This coming Friday is &quot;Black Friday&quot;, a US initiative which kicks off the peak month of shopping for both shoppers and retailers.  It is obviously the height of the gift giving season.  Almost all of us have faced the question of what to buy for particular people.  We do not want to buy gifts which have to be exchanged and we want the recipients to be able to decide on a date and time to use them and so forth and very often the last resort is the gift voucher.  This is a &euro;300 million industry and it goes right across the spectrum covering toys, DIY, travel, restaurants and everything in between.  Often when people receive gift vouchers they partially use them or they put them away to use at a later date.  The advantage is very much on the side of the retailer as opposed to the consumer.<\/p><p>Sometimes gift vouchers are treated as if they are not money but they are very much so.  It is not as if they are coupons cut out of newspapers.  They are bought with peoples' hard earned cash and very often it is the recipient who discovers the terms and conditions attached to gift vouchers.  We can all imagine situations where people forget about gift vouchers and discover that there is a problem when it is too late.  The financial loss of forgotten vouchers to consumers must run into millions.  In the US, this loss was estimated to be close to $1 billion.  In 2009, an initiative was introduced in the US which removed annual limits on gift vouchers.  A five year limit was put on gift vouchers or cards and evidence shows that the number of unused gift vouchers declined very dramatically as a result.<\/p><p>This Bill is concerned with strengthening consumers' rights when it comes to gift vouchers.  Currently, everything is stacked in the retailers' favour.  Retailers can charge for issuing gift vouchers and can cancel the card or voucher after a short period.  They can also apply charges for the non-use of a card, thus rendering it worthless and can apply charges for refunding the balance.  Many retailers adopt a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; policy, effectively.  The imposition of strict and unreasonable expiry dates comes at the expense of customers.<\/p><p>The Bill addresses these issues and seeks to do four things.  It seeks to give certainty in relation to expiry dates with the provision of a five year limit.  It seeks to ban charges for issuing gift vouchers.  It seeks to ban charges related to inactive gift vouchers and to ban companies from taking money off the balance if a card is not used by certain dates, which is happening routinely at the moment.  The Bill also seeks to ensure the repayment of any credit balance on a gift voucher.<\/p><p>It is a simple way of strengthening consumer rights.<\/p> <p> As I said, similar legislation was introduced in the United States.  The last Government promised action on this but it never happened and the present Government has promised action but has yet to introduce legislation to the House.  It is time we moved to strengthen consumer rights in this respect.  While the EU has announced a revised proposal on digital vouchers, given the very cumbersome way these things are dealt with at European level, we cannot wait for these consumer protections to be introduced by the EU.  We all recognise there is an issue in regard to consumer rights.  This should be proceeded with without any further delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100017#P01500","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1511280600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q00600","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1511280600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1511280600,"counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 to provide clarity with regard to certain applications before the courts.<\/blockquote><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill 2017.  In 2012, when the original personal insolvency legislation was passed, this was touted as a game-changer for personal insolvency in Ireland.  Where the family home was involved, an independent personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, would propose a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, and this, in theory, would offer the best prospect of protecting the family home.<\/p><p>At the time we in Fianna F&aacute;il pointed to a fundamental flaw in the legislation.  By offering the lender an effective veto over any proposed solution, the legislation clearly placed the power in the hands of the lender.  We were told that removing the veto would be unconstitutional.  The bank veto, along with the banks' unwillingness to co-operate fully, ensured this new system was going to be long and cumbersome, and this has proven to be the case.  Some 40% of all applications for a PIA have either been vetoed or the protective order has expired.  Recently, the head of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, informed the justice committee that many lenders are not fully co-operating with this process.  After mounting political pressure from Fianna F&aacute;il and others, the law was changed in 2015 and this offered a way to challenge the bank veto in the courts by way of an appeal mechanism.  The 2015 Act intended to offer an appeal mechanism whereby the borrower could challenge the veto in the courts but this appeal system is clearly broken.  Since the creation of section 115A, some 632 appeals have been lodged and nearly 70% of these cases have yet to be concluded.  Therefore, not only is the personal insolvency system long and cumbersome, so too is the appeals process.<\/p><p>It is because of section 115A that I am introducing this amendment Bill today.  In September of this year the Dublin Circuit Court made a crucial decision that has thrown the entire personal insolvency system into further turmoil.  Under section 115A of the 2015 Act, it was decided that the debtor had no legal authority to appeal a bank veto in the courts and that appeals had to be taken in the name of the PIP.  Nearly a month later the High Court, in a similar case, came to the same conclusion.  It is entirely unfair and unreasonable to expect a PIP to take a very significant personal risk when proceeding with a case in his or her own name.  This has had a major effect on the appeal mechanism.  Appeals have been stalled as PIPs have been left completely in the dark on how the system will be rectified.  Why would a PIP, under the current circumstances, proceed with an appeal?  It is perfectly understandable for them not to go down that route, given all the personal risks that come with it.<\/p><p>Once again, as has been the case with this Government from day one, the balance of power has been shifted even further towards the lender.  I have heard evidence that creditors are using the current situation to their advantage and are being overly aggressive.  Why would they not be?  They have opposed the personal insolvency process at every single point along the road.  This Bill amends section 115A of the 2015 Act by clearly placing the legal authority to appeal in the hands of the debtor, not the PIP, which is the crux of the issue which has to be urgently dealt with.  This is as it should be, and as it was intended to be from day one.  However, I would like to point out that this will not, on its own, solve all of the problems with the personal insolvency process.  It is but a small step in the right direction and much more needs to be done.  Even if this Bill is enacted, it is a huge challenge for a borrower to go down the legal route of appealing the rejection of a PIA to the courts.  The banks too know this, and they are using the system to pressure more and more people into surrendering their home.<\/p><p>Earlier this year we introduced that Mortgage Arrears Resolution (Family Home) Bill 2017.  That Bill would remove the veto power from the bank when it comes to mortgage arrears cases involving the family home and would empower an independent office to make the final decision in that situation.  The balance of power is firmly with the lender in the current system.  The entire onus to co-operate is placed on the borrower while the bank can simply walk away at any point in the process.  The net issue that this Bill seeks to address arises because of a court decision in the Circuit Court, and then in the High Court, which has had very serious consequences for the existing appeal mechanism under the personal insolvency system.  If it is going to take very long for this Bill to be enacted, I would ask the Government to consider amending another piece of justice legislation so that what is clearly an anomalous situation can be rectified as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q00900","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q01000","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q01100","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1511280600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q01300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q01400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1511280600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Property Services Regulatory Authority (Amendment) (Bidding Transparency) Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1511280600,"counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q01600"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to enhance and expedite the transparency of the bidding process during the sale of land other than by auction.<\/blockquote><p>This short Bill is an amendment to the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2017 and concerns the issue of bidding transparency.  At present, during the process of the purchase of a property, agents retain the records associated with any bids made on the property and, if there is a fear on the part of those seeking to buy a property that there may have been fake bids during that process, it is only after the transaction that this can be investigated by the regulatory authority.  While we do not cast any doubt on the industry or on the regulatory authority that is in place at present, we feel there is a gap in the legislation.  As there is this fear, we believe this Bill can be used to accommodate a ten-day freeze during which an investigation can be carried out by the authority.  It is up to the third party investigation to clarify that fact for all concerned; the procedure can proceed thereafter and there would be no cloud over the transaction once it is completed.<\/p><p>As I said, this is not to cast any aspersion on the industry and the current system but, especially given the current crisis, I believe every effort has to be made on our behalf to ensure that those who are seeking to purchase property can do so without any doubt about the process they enter into.  There has to be fair play for everyone concerned and I believe this Bill sets about addressing that issue.  I hope it will not be opposed and that it will proceed to the relevant committee for pre-legislative scrutiny in order for it to be enacted as soon as is practically possible.  It is just one element of a system that is, unfortunately, broken in regard to the manner in which the housing programme and housing crisis are being managed by the Government.  We want to play our part in ensuring this process is above reproach and that we can learn from the mistakes of the past.  As few mistakes as there may have been, if there was one mistake in this area, it is one too many.  This is a loophole that has to be closed.  I would ask the Government's indulgence to proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q01700","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q01800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":212,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q01900","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1511280600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q02100","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q02200","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1511280600,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Community Energy (Co-ownership) Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1511280600,"counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100018#Q02400"},{"type":"speech","time":1511280600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to create a planning condition that enables local communities to invest in a renewable energy project; to create a new prescribed class of development to which such a planning condition can be attached; and to provide for other related matters.<\/blockquote><p>This Bill seeks to do what is set out in the Title, namely, to support the community ownership of new energy projects.  The Taoiseach and other Ministers will be aware that this issue is critically important in regard to meeting our emissions reduction targets and also developing our own renewable energy, rather than relying for 90% of our energy on fossil fuels, as we do at present.<\/p><p>It takes the example of other countries like Denmark, where similar legislation has been introduced mandating a certain requirement in respect of new projects above micro-generation - if it is wind farm, above 500 kW in size, or if it is a photovoltaic project, above self-generation on a roof.  In such circumstances, we argue that there should be a mandated requirement for 30% of the equity in that project to be owned by people living within the local community area.  This is achievable and practical and will have a material benefit in terms of spreading ownership of the new renewable energy projects more widely throughout their local areas.  This will help to raise equity for such projects, which is an important way of lowering the cost and getting them over the line, and reduce the level of uncertainty in the planning process that is making it more difficult to reach the renewable energy targets that we have set for ourselves.  There are other benefits, for example, people being informed of what is happening in their area.<br\/><br\/>We are setting out a variety of co-operative models that could be used to manage such an ownership stake.  It should be practical to introduce, with a geographic area being set.  For example, people within 5 km of a development would be given first right to an equity stake.  We could start at a &euro;250 share and go up to &euro;10,000, which would give people the right to own and be a part of the revolution that is taking place in this country and everywhere else.<br\/><br\/>We are looking for mechanisms to help fund this through credit unions and post offices.  We would support the development of a new public banking system, for example, the <i>Sparkasse<\/i>model, to make lending to these types of development possible.  It is lending to an area when there is certainty that we are going in this direction.  Every country is.  Hardly any new generation using fossil fuel infrastructure is taking place in the EU.  That day is gone.<br\/><br\/>We need to get the changes and the delivery of the new renewable power supply right and avail of the fact that it is now cheaper and more competitive.  We are in a different world than we were ten, 15 or 20 years ago, in that the cost of onshore wind, solar and even offshore wind has reduced to the point at which they are probably the cheapest power supplies available to us if we get the market rules and governance systems right.  We are not doing that currently.  That is why Ireland ranked 49th out of 60 in a major study on climate change last week.  The Government and public administration system are continuing to get it wrong.  In the negotiations around the new EU directives on renewables, governance and market reform, our officials are the ones who are taking the most negative and restrictive position.

In areas of significant challenge, such as housing, homelessness, the rent crisis, health and other areas, the Government is clearly failing.  There has been little progress on areas for which the Taoiseach's Department has direct responsibility.

We told her that her Government must bear the greater responsibility for the failure to reach agreement on the restoration of the institutions, but the Irish Government also has a role to play.  We told her there is no public confidence in talks which will be more of the same; they need to be meaningful.  We told her that the provision of the Irish language Act, marriage equality, a bill of rights and funding for legacy issues are all British Government obligations and commitments.  Progress is only possible if the British Government honours these commitments.<\/p>  <p>  The job of the Irish Government is to ensure that it honours those commitments.  We told the British Prime Minister that direct rule is not an option and that she must look at the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, in particular the establishment of an intergovernmental conference involving the Irish and British Governments.  I ask the Taoiseach to also press this with the British Prime Minister.  There is an urgent need for the two Governments to act to deliver equality.

Quite frankly, they were scandalous and insulting statements which have tried to normalise, minimise or downplay the scale of the housing and homelessness emergency, or even worse, in the case of Eileen Gleeson, blame the homeless themselves.

The Minister of State, Deputy English, suggested that those who talk too much about housing and homelessness are doing damage to our reputation.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as the Government has power over these agencies, is it going to repudiate these kind of comments?  It should denounce them for what they are, namely, shameful attempts to cover up, downplay or normalise the housing crisis.  Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that as the housing analyst Mel Reynolds has suggested, the real problem is the refusal of the Government to build council housing on the thousands of hectares of publicly owned land?  There is an aversion to building council houses.  The Government is playing with figures to try to suggest more houses are being built than is actually the case.

A series of initiatives over the past two years have had very little impact.

We are being told that things are not that bad compared with other countries and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Yet all of us in the House are inundated with people coming into our clinics or contacting us who are in dire situations on foot of having no place to go with their children.  Some are living in very overcrowded conditions with their parents and siblings in, for example, a boxroom in a small house.  Many are on the homeless pathway and others are facing that route.  It is very difficult to match the rhetoric and language we have heard with their everyday life experience.  To be frank, the language which has come from officialdom of late has been insulting to them.<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that there has been a sense from officialdom for quite some time that the market will take care of this and that we do not need to build local authority houses to any great extent.  That view has been there for the past three or four years.  I met Department officials at the time of the formation of the Government when I was talking with Independents and that very much seemed to be what was coming from the officials.  It seems to me that the entire approach has failed abysmally.  I could go on to health and other issues, but my time is up.  On the issue of homelessness alone, it is important not to insult people who are in desperate situations in terms of their personal circumstances and housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100020#S00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1511281800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>The questions were very broad, but I ask the Taoiseach to try to compact them into about four minutes.

That means convening the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference, as if nothing is devolved then everything is devolved to that conference.

I want everyone in the House to be assured that the Government feels very deeply about the homelessness crisis we are facing and that it is worsening.  It feels very deeply about the need for us to return to a <i>status quo<\/i>in which people can aspire to home ownership again, with homes being affordable and available for young people seeking to purchase them.  That is our objective.<br\/><br\/>With regard to social housing more generally, we anticipate 2,000 houses will be built this year.  They are social homes, publicly built homes, council homes or council apartments, whatever people wish to call them.  That is up from only a few hundred last year, meaning the number has more than doubled.  The aim next year is 7,000, with 3,800 direct-build and approximately the same number through other mechanisms.  Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about playing with figures but much of that is going around on all sides.  I was in Clongriffin just yesterday at an Iveagh Trust project.  Many Members know the Iveagh Trust, which has been providing social housing for people for over a century.  It is associated with the Guinness family.  It has 84 apartments and duplexes under construction and they will be occupied by 84 people and their families this time next year.  When our opponents criticise our record on housing, they do not count such homes; to them, these 84 homes do not exist and the people who will be in them do not exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100020#S01200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511282400,"counter":262,"content":"<p>That is untrue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100021#T00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1511282400,"counter":263,"content":"<p>It is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100021#T00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1511282400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>That is not true but the Government is not building on its land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100021#T00400","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1511282400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I will tell the Deputies why it is true.

The primary focus of the visit was growing trade, investment and tourism opportunities between Ireland and the US and highlighting Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in the context of Brexit and other international developments.<\/p>  <p>  In Seattle, I spoke at an event attended by approximately 250 people from Seattle's business community, as well as local Irish community representatives.  I used the opportunity to emphasise Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a location for US investment and highlight our firm and ongoing commitment to our European Union, EU, membership.  I also met representatives of Amazon and Microsoft, who between them employ over 5,000 people in Ireland.  Our discussions focused on Ireland&rsquo;s leadership in driving the digital agenda and the companies&rsquo; continued commitment to Ireland as a location for their global operations and European, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, headquarters.<\/p>  <p>  I then travelled to Silicon Valley and the Bay area for a series of business engagements with existing and potential investors in Ireland.  I visited the headquarters of a number of companies with significant investments and operations in Ireland, including Cisco, Facebook, Google and Apple.  At each of these meetings, senior executives outlined their very positive experiences in Ireland, including the strong capabilities of their Irish-based workforces, and the positive outlook for their operations here.  I was particularly pleased that Facebook announced its intention to create hundreds of additional jobs in its Irish operations next year.  At my meeting at Apple, its chief executive officer, Mr. Tim Cook, highlighted the company&rsquo;s very positive and long-standing experience of their Irish-based operations, particularly in Cork.  The company briefed me on its data centre needs, including in particular its current data centre development in Denmark, and it confirmed that it will consider the Athenry site in the context of future business requirements.  I advised the company of the Irish Government's approach, including the recent decision to designate data centres as strategic infrastructure for planning purposes.  This morning the Cabinet gave the relevant Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the authority to prepare an amendment for Report Stage of the current planning Bill to do exactly that.  We also had a brief discussion regarding the European Commission&rsquo;s state aid case and on regional and global economic challenges.<\/p>  <p>  In San Francisco, I spoke at a reception in City Hall hosted by the city's mayor, Mr. Ed Lee, and attended by approximately 300 Irish-American business and community leaders.  I was also awarded the key to the city.  I spoke about Ireland's economic and social transformation, Ireland-US relations and the strong and vibrant Irish community in San Francisco and the Bay area.  I also had the opportunity to meet with the family of Ashley Donoghue, one of the people tragically killed in Berkeley in 2015.  Also in San Francisco, I spoke at an Enterprise Ireland business networking event attended by 250 people, using the opportunity to promote the strength of Ireland&rsquo;s innovation ecosystem and highlight the depth of our highly skilled workforce.  I also met representatives of a number of Enterprise Ireland clients exhibiting at the event.<\/p>  <p>  I officially opened the new San Francisco office of Irish company Linesight, which is projecting job increases of 200 worldwide in 2018, including approximately 90 jobs in Ireland.  I attended the announcement by IDA client company, Twilio, that it has chosen Dublin as the location for its EMEA headquarters, with the establishment of 100 jobs.  I attended a Tourism Ireland event with representatives of the travel industry and airlines, where I had the opportunity to promote Ireland&rsquo;s tourism offering.  I was very pleased to hear word at that meeting of the Aer Lingus plan to begin direct flights to Seattle, which has now been announced.  Finally, I had the opportunity to meet senior executives from Lucasfilm and hear their positive experience of Ireland as a location for the Star Wars series.<\/p>  <p>  I did not have detailed discussions during the visit on US tax reform proposals, which are entirely a matter for the United States, or on EU digital tax proposals, where our position is clear and consistent that, reflecting the international nature of the digital economy, this topic must be pursued on a global basis through the work of the OECD.  No arrangements have been made regarding a visit for President Trump but I look forward to meeting him during the annual St. Patrick's Day functions in Washington, DC, next March.  Overall, my visit to the west coast was very positive and a great opportunity to develop the strong links between Ireland and the United States, as well as promote Ireland's priorities in the context of Brexit and other global developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100021#T03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1511282400,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  It is fair to say companies headquartered in the United States employ tens of thousands of Irish people directly and indirectly.  They are major contributors to our economy and wider society.  That is why it is important that for decades, taoisigh and Ministers have made it a policy to visit regularly and maintain contact with these companies at the highest level.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach visited many companies which have been in Ireland for quite a long time on his trip to the west coast, including Microsoft, Amazon and Apple, among others.  The consistent policy Ireland has had over recent decades is an important one and speaks to an industrial policy which, over four decades ago, was about making Ireland an open country which exported but also attracted foreign direct investment which acted as a catalyst to promote Irish-owned companies.  I do not believe we should lose sight of that amid the commentary on tax issues.<\/p> <p> I am somewhat taken aback that the Taoiseach did not have any detailed tax discussions with any of the company representatives he met and that there was only the briefest discussion with Apple representatives on tax matters generally.  I am not talking about specific tax issues with each company but rather the European Union tax policy, which will affect companies, and the US tax policy.  It is incorrect to say that it is just a matter for the EU.  It is clearly a matter for Ireland and is fundamental to our corporate tax strategy in terms of attracting foreign direct investment.  President Obama had radical proposals while he was campaigning.  When I was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, we put people into the embassy to monitor what was going on in terms of politics in Washington and to make sure we could get a proper read on what was likely to come through in terms of policy proposals and what the impact would be on our own inward investment strategies.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach has said that he is keeping an active watch on tax proposals in Washington.  Will he give the House his analysis of the proposals which have passed the House of Representatives and have now been reported out of committee in the Senate?<\/p> <p> Commissioner Moscovici has in recent days started an aggressive new approach to changing tax rules.  He has done this without publishing a single piece of paper on impacts or economic justification for these actions.  These measures are separate from the digital taxation measures already promoted.

The consensus across that dinner last night was that what the Taoiseach is overseeing is a republic of missed opportunity and that we are not moving with the new industrial revolution which features clean energy and renewable power which those companies want.  There are 116 companies in the world which have committed to going 100% renewable.  I hope the Taoiseach is listening.  Adobe, Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google, HP, Microsoft and Salesforce were among the companies which the Taoiseach visited.  These companies all want to go 100% renewable.  Ireland cannot even commit to going to 40% renewable by 2030, and we are fighting at every turn in Europe to take away ambition in that area.  Did any of the companies bring up with the Taoiseach when he met them their ambition to go low carbon and renewable, and did they ask why Ireland, which has some of the best renewable resources in the world, did not have the same ambition that they had?  It is one of the reasons behind the Apple decision to go to Denmark rather than Ireland, which to my mind is a disaster for the development of the west of Ireland because it is a clear signal that these companies are starting to realise that this Government does not believe in that new, clean industrial revolution.  It is not leading or partaking in it, and we are starting to see the consequences.

Does the Taoiseach agree?  In recent months he spoke at a rally where he called on NFL bosses to fire American football players such as Colin Kaepernick, who took a knee in protest against the killing of black Americans by the police.

Reflecting its commitment to sustaining a nationwide post office network and daily mails service, the Government has agreed to make available State funding of &euro;30 million to enable An Post to move quickly in delivering on the vision of the plan, building on the momentum of actions taken this year.  This funding will be provided in the form of a repayable long-term loan and is to be used to support the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of a five-day delivery service.  To ensure its long-term success against the backdrop of an accelerated decline in mail volume and falling revenues, An Post is embarking on a significant transformation programme.<\/p>  <p>  The current financial challenges facing An Post have been well documented and I have addressed this matter on several occasions in this House.  They have arisen, in the main, from the decline in mail volumes and the move to electronic transactions in both the mail and post office network.  This is a global trend and is not unique to the Irish postal service.  I have taken a very proactive approach to An Post since becoming Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I acted quickly by introducing legislation to facilitate the repeal of the price cap mechanism when the drop in mail volumes accelerated in 2015 and 2016.  This has resulted in an improved financial forecast for An Post for 2017 with a much lower level of losses now anticipated.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the challenges facing the company, the board has overseen the preparation of a strategic plan for which it is ultimately responsible.  It harnesses the company's existing strengths such as its nationwide reach, trusted brand and the relationship of postmasters with communities, both rural and urban.  At the same time, An Post has recognised that it cannot and should not fight the digital agenda.  It must be embraced and this is reflected in the plan, especially in the emphasis on growing the parcels business.  For example, the company now offers Saturday and evening deliveries and has launched new product lines such as AddressPal and ReturnsPal, embracing the rising trend of online shopping.  Enhanced banking services are becoming available through the post office network with the smart bank account.  It is expected that further such opportunities will be available across the network, especially as high-speed broadband becomes widely available through the roll-out of the national broadband plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also committed to exploring the potential for extra Government business, including motor tax, to be channelled through the network.  The local post office and local staff who deliver mail\u00a0is still an\u00a0important\u00a0part of the fabric of local communities, especially in rural areas, and the Government recognises the importance of ensuring that this continues into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100024#W00327","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1511284200,"counter":335,"content":"<p>The question seeks to establish the Minister's vision for the future of the post office network.  The Bobby Kerr report set out an action plan that did that to secure the future of the post office network.  The only thing on which the Minister could be complimented is his knee-jerk reaction to An Post's calls for increased funds.  On this occasion the &euro;30 million of Government intervention by way of a loan is nothing more than a job loss announcement dressed up as some new departure.  There is nothing in today's announcement to provide for the future security and viability of the post office network.  The moneys that are being provided by way of a loan will be used to create a redundancy fund for those working in the mails business and will be used to pension off postmasters.  I accept that postmasters who have come to the end of their working lives should be provided for at an appropriate level in their retirement, but that cannot be used as a ruse to close post offices.  Post offices are more than the postmasters and postmistresses.  They provide a valuable service to communities.  If they are not financially viable in the short term, the State must intervene and provide State funds on a recurring basis to ensure the service is protected.

The nationwide reach of the post office network makes it uniquely positioned to act as a gateway to Government.  In addition to the existing range of Government business, such as social welfare payments, and Passport Express, a new pilot initiative called Digital Assist will use the local post office as a digital gateway for Government business such as motor tax.  That will be rolled out in ten post offices in different parts of the country initially and is in line with the recommendations of the Kerr report.  The proposed strategy for An Post involves it being split into two distinct business units, An Post mails and parcels and An Post retail.  Efforts to improve profitability will be targeted through growth, pricing and cost reduction strategies and are aimed at establishing a sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates.<\/p>  <p>  There are concerns about the closure of post offices and it is something that also concerns me.  I am advised that An Post has not made any definite decision on post office closures, but the move to electronic transactions has affected the post office network.<\/p><p>Overall activity levels are down by 15% since 2013 and annual payments to some post offices have reduced by up to 20%.  These reductions mean that the income model is becoming unsustainable, especially for postmasters operating smaller post offices.<\/p> <p> I am extremely conscious of the value placed on local post offices in towns and villages across the country.  While it is accepted that, in light of the ongoing decline in activity, the network must be renewed, it is also important that this is done in a controlled and transparent manner.  Changes to the footprint of the post offices network, where they occur, should be a consequence of the modernisation process as opposed to its objective.  In this regard, a protocol will be put in place to manage the modernisation of the network and the impact of postmaster exits on the local community.  It is expected that this protocol would have regard to existing contract arrangements and become a blueprint for decisions on the future of the network, including the opening of new post offices as well as managing the future of a post office where a postmaster decides to take a redundancy package or otherwise to exit the business.<\/p> <p> The protocol must also make provision to ensure that the existing business is effectively transferred in order to support the remaining network and local businesses and should take account of recommendations made by Mr. Bobby Kerr in his report.

Doing nothing is simply not an option.  To the credit of the board, management and employees of An Post, the strategic plan sets out a positive vision for the company, positions it for the digital age and aims to put the company in a position where it can support sustainable jobs in both its mail business and post office network right across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100024#W00800","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511284800,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy Stanley to come in for a minute and then Deputy Dooley to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100025#X00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1511284800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I do not think the Chairman can do that during priority questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100025#X00300","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1511284800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>The questions are grouped.

This is not about improving services or coming up with innovative ways of driving people into post offices.  A financial slide rule is being placed across the books of An Post and this is about eliminating people, cutting jobs and reducing access to the services of the post office.  It is about making the organisation leaner and fitter to continue doing what it is doing but in fewer areas.  We get the continuation of the five day universal obligation on the postal side.

The necessary regulatory steps have already been put in place to phase out flat-rate fees for household waste collection.  The permits of household waste collectors have been amended in order that existing customers who are seeking to renew their contracts or new customers are not offered flat-rate fees.  It is worth noting that this measure is not &quot;new&quot; for about half of kerbside household waste customers because they are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan - in other words, a plan that contains a per-lift or weight-related fee.  As I announced in last June, mandatory per-kilogram pay-by-weight charging is not being introduced.<\/p><p>This phasing out of flat-rate fees is consistent with national waste policy.  Research has shown that all-in flat-rate fees are the least successful pricing structure in preventing waste.  However, it is a necessary measure because twice in 2016, local authorities had to exercise emergency powers to make additional landfill capacity available.  If emergency measures had not been taken, there would have been no way for waste collectors to continue collecting household bins.  In the past two years, the amount of waste disposed of in landfills has increased.  We must act now to avert a return to over-dependence on landfill across Ireland.<\/p><p>Furthermore, Ireland faces challenging EU targets to achieve by 2020, including a household waste recycling rate of 50%.  Failure to achieve such targets could leave the State open to infringement proceedings and potentially punitive fines.  More ambitious waste objectives for 2025 and 2030 are currently being negotiated at EU level.<\/p><p>When introducing the measure to phase out flat-rate fees, the Government gave a commitment to consumers to carefully monitor the transition in the sector.  Accordingly, a household waste collection price monitoring group has been established.  That group has begun the process of tracking the rates charged by household waste collectors.  In addition, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is undertaking an independent study of the market that will, <i>inter alia<\/i>, assess the nature and scale of consumer and operator issues in the household waste collection market and consider whether the introduction of an enhanced regulatory regime could efficiently address these issues in the short and long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100026#Y00700","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1511285400,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the reply.  The problem with what the Minister has done is that he has left a range of options open.

There is a range of options, therefore, and they can be used in combination.  That is the problem with what has happened.  There is no control over this.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned a monitoring group.  Who is on the group?  I understand the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission did not take up the offer to participate.<\/p>  <p>  What we have is side-by-side competition.  According to the Government's regulatory impact assessment in 2012, the household waste collection market in Ireland is unique.  It is unique because it is very cumbersome.  Poland has enacted legislation to switch away from side-by-side competition to a municipalities system.  Finland has also switched from side-by-side competition to a franchise system.

Either we value the product or we do not value it, and if the latter is the case, we will move towards the broadcasting model in place in the United States.  Colm McCarthy wrote an analysis earlier this year in which he stated that the \"advent of laptops and smartphones, equally capable of accessing television broadcasts, has finally brought it home to policymakers that this antiquated and cumbersome method of raising revenue has no place in a modern fiscal system\".

Some of them are also quite close to fibre that has been already built out or that is planned to be built out.  eir has decided to look at its build out plan to see if there are commercial premises, schools or clusters of housing to which its network could be easily extended.  The company is actively looking at that at the moment but that is a commercial decision for eir.  Aside from that, the national broadband plan will bridge the gap and ensure that every single premises in the country will have access to high speed broadband.  More than 90% of premises will have that access by 2020.  We are also looking at how we can sweat the existing asset, the fibre that has been built out and the infrastructure that is already in place.  That is why the auctioning off of the 3.6 gigahertz spectrum was so important because it allows for both mobile and wireless operators to provide broadband data services to a much broader catchment more quickly.

We have one of the\u00a0more comprehensive charge point networks in Europe for a country of our size.  The maintenance and repair of these points is an operational matter for ESB eCars.  Although there will be outages from time to time for technical reasons, ESB eCars operates the system to a high standard.  This can be seen through the online map which shows the status of each charge point including if it is in use.<\/p>  <p>  As battery technology develops, the range of electric cars will grow and higher capacity charging will be needed to support quicker charge times and longer travelling ranges.  It is anticipated that large car manufacturers\u00a0will become increasingly involved in the provision of high-powered infrastructure.  A number of providers are likely to emerge\u00a0onto the Irish market in the coming years.  Nissan already has a number of charge points available through its dealer network and Tesla\u00a0recently opened its\u00a0second supercharger location in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of electric vehicle infrastructure, particularly the availability\u00a0of public charging points, is a key focus of the work of the low emissions vehicle task force.  The task force is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and is examining options for infrastructure, regulation and pricing in order to devise a sustainable policy framework for effective and efficient electric vehicle recharging.<\/p>  <p>\u00a0  The work of the low emissions vehicle task force led to a package of measures in budget 2018\u00a0designed to promote a low carbon, electric vehicle future.  These measures include funding to support the operation and development of the public charging network with a specific emphasis on increasing the number of rapid chargers.  The task force is also planning a stakeholder workshop later this month to explore issues related to the future requirements for electric vehicle recharging infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>\u00a0  Following a public consultation, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, last month published its decision on the future ownership of the electric vehicle charging network.  A key outcome of the decision\u00a0is that the charging network should not form part of the regulated asset base and therefore expansions of the network should not be funded from network charges.  This is in keeping with the proposals published last year by the European Commission in the 'Clean Energy for\u00a0All Europeans' package.\u00a0  The decision also sets out the need for electric vehicle charging infrastructure to operate on a commercial basis.  Currently, recharging electric vehicles at public charge points is free and unlimited.  Deputies will, however, appreciate that\u00a0free fuel for electric vehicles, funded by electricity consumers,\u00a0is not sustainable in the longer term.  At the same time, it is important that if payments for the use of public charge points are introduced in the future, they are at a level which does not disincentivise the uptake of electric vehicles.<\/p>  <p>\u00a0  The low emissions vehicle task force has made a number of recommendations.  The task force\u00a0is also assessing the decision of the CRU in its examination of the future requirements for electric vehicle recharging infrastructure.  The work of the task force is well underway and has already resulted in a package of measures in budget 2018 designed to promote a low carbon, electric vehicle future.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100031#DD01700","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1511288400,"counter":476,"content":"<p>The budget did little to support a greater uptake of electric vehicles.

We will have to put in place financial incentives in the short term.

It is Sinn F&eacute;in's belief that we need to get into home charging, particularly if we are phasing out the current system.<\/p>  <p>  I heard the point about the ten-year phase-out, which is to be welcomed.  I take it the ESB does not have to stop next month or the month after, and that it can be phased out.  The Minister also made the point about there being one charging point for every four cars but that simply shows there is not the take-up we require.  We need to look at this scheme again.  One of the places we could start is with public service vehicles and local authority vehicles that are doing short runs.  The milk carts of 30, 40 and 50 years ago ran on batteries.  Surely it is not beyond the imagination and engineering ingenuity of this generation to get such vehicles running on electricity in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

People park in the environs of their workplaces or public or private car parks.<\/p>  <p>  The Department and the Government need to develop incentives for workplace and private car parks to put the infrastructure in place.  We have a Mickey Mouse operation at the moment, with a couple of high-visibility points around St. Stephen's Green and other places like it that few people will ever get to use.  As the Minister stated, the ratio of points to cars is adequate at 1:4, but we should not even be thinking like that.  If we want a seismic shift in behavioural change, doubters of this technology need to see a free space everywhere they park.  In addition to financial incentives, they would then know that they could charge in a public car park, at a filling station or in their work environs.  That requires State incentives.<\/p>  <p>  Roads used to be ass-and-cart dirt tracks but, with the advent of Henry Ford's invention, people had the foresight to start building infrastructure that could carry that type of vehicle in current volumes.

The Minister will agree that what we are dealing with is an injustice - where a defined benefit pension scheme is wound up and, as a result of the manner in which our pension and taxation laws are levied, its existing pensioners are given no option but to purchase an expensive annuity that does not do them or their families any good and just makes the insurance companies a great deal of money.  The purpose of this debate is to examine the source of the problem and determine what we can do to rectify it.<\/p>  <p>  The situation was aptly summed up by the situation of the supplementary Aer Lingus pension scheme that the House discussed previously.  The trustees wrote to existing pensioners and made the point that, in order to protect those people's funds, the trustees would approach insurance companies in the market and get an annuity.  No other option would be entertained, just an annuity.  In one instance that brings the point home, a woman was told that the cost of that annuity for one person would be &euro;300,000.  That money was being taken from the wound-up scheme to buy her annuity.<\/p>  <p>  We inquired of an Irish insurance company this morning and received a quote for a joint life annuity that allowed for annual inflation of 1.4%.  The quote was &euro;5,000 per year.  If this person lived for 40 years and got &euro;5,000 per year, which would not happen in a pension scenario, the insurance company would benefit to the tune of &euro;100,000 for nothing.  On top of that, the company would get &euro;6,000, or 2% of the purchase annuity price, in fees.  If a recipient died, his or her spouse would get nothing, which is unlike the case with an approved retirement fund, ARF, but that option is not available to the people in question.  It would have allowed them to get a greater yield in their retirement years and their families, spouses or children to benefit from some of that income later on.<\/p>  <p>  A product that is bad value for money is being imposed on members of pension schemes under the excuse that this is just the way the legislation is.  This legislation might not be within the remit of just the Minister's Department, but also the Department of Finance.  Frankly, though, I do not care.  It is every Deputy's responsibility to address the situation immediately.<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Minister that, interestingly, the then Minister for Finance altered the rules in 2011 to allow pre-retirement bonds to invest in ARFs because of the outrageous cost of annuities at the time.  However, he did not extend that option to defined benefit schemes.  Last year, the rules were again altered to allow defined benefit scheme members access to ARFs.  Guess what?  This could only be done in cases where the members were classified as directors of a company.  Rich people can benefit from this arrangement but the pensioners who pay into a defined benefit scheme for all of their working lives cannot.  They are frogmarched into an annuity where the pension industry takes the excess cash and charges a large price for the privilege.  Only really wealthy people would benefit.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister.  We need to address the weaknesses in the legislation urgently because this issue is affecting people's livelihoods in their retirement years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100033#FF01300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1511289600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I will ask the Deputy to humour me because I must read this bit out before I can get to the part for which she is waiting.  I thank her for raising this matter.  I know why she has done so.  Scheme trustees have duties and responsibilities under trust law, other relevant legislation and the Pensions Act 1990, as amended.  The duties of a pension scheme trustee include administering a scheme in trust in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and rules.<\/p><p>Consequently, any decision made by corporate or individual trustees of an occupational pension scheme are governed by the relevant legislation and rules set out in the trust deed and the rules of the particular scheme.  Scheme trustees must always act in the best interests of scheme members.<br\/><br\/>Usually the options available to members for taking benefits will be set out in the trust rules.  In some cases, the benefit structure may be inflexible, leaving the member little or no choice as to the form his or her benefits will take.  This is something I recently brought to the attention of Deputy Daly and she kindly helped me with it, although we could not provide any help.<br\/><br\/>Where a member of the pension scheme reaches retirement age, a pension is immediately payable.  Part of the pension may be taken in cash, and once the entire pension is not taken up by this, the trustees then have a liability to pay a pension income to the member.  The trustees then either pay a pension income regularly out of the fund or they buy an annuity to secure the future liability to pay a pension.  On wind-up, where the pension is being paid out of the fund, the trustees normally purchase annuities for the existing pensioners.<br\/><br\/>Section 48 of the Pensions Act sets out the priorities on winding up a scheme.  It sets out the order in which the liabilities must be discharged and how they may be discharged for members.  When a scheme winds up, section 48(3)(<i>b<\/i>) provides that the trustees may, notwithstanding anything contained in the rules of the scheme and without the consent of the member concerned, discharge the liability for benefits payable by any member by one of the following: transferring the benefits of each member into a new pension scheme; purchasing an approved assurance policy with a company or insurance agency that sells life insurance; or transferring the benefits into another arrangement for the provision of retirement benefits such as, for example, a PRSA or a buyout bond.<br\/><br\/>It must be noted that this discretionary provision and the trustees are not compelled to discharge the liability in this way.  The wind-up options in section 48(3)(<i>b<\/i>) are contingent on the requirement that the scheme&rsquo;s policies or contracts are approved by the Revenue Commissioners under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended.  The Act sets out the circumstances in which retirement benefit schemes are approved by the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes.  In other words, transfers from the scheme being wound up must be made into schemes or products approved by the Revenue Commissioners and which, therefore, comply with Revenue rules.<br\/><br\/>Section 772 of the Taxes Consolidation Act allows for flexible options on retirement, that is, the approved retirement fund, ARF, option.  The purchase of an ARF is not available to members of defined benefit schemes, subject to certain exceptions.  Legislation and policy on taxes and access to ARFs are a matter for the Department of Finance, as Deputy Daly said.  I know why Deputy Daly is raising this matter.  I agree with her.<br\/><br\/>I have asked my Department to refer this particular issue to the Department of Finance.  Given that within the next couple of weeks we will launch a public consultation on what will probably be the most far-reaching reform of the private and public pensions industry, it is probably timely that the Department of Finance considers this issue, and that is the effort I will try to bring to bear during the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100033#FF01400","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511290200,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  The tackling of this issue is beyond overdue and it is not the responsibility of any one Department or Member of the House.  We all have to get our act together in terms of pensions.  Given that they are structured in a manner which makes them incredibly cumbersome to understand and mind-numbingly boring, people hear the term \"pensions\" and switch off.  Sadly, they wake up in their retirement years to find that something into which they have paid all their lives is not worth what they thought would be.  Their families are impoverished at a time when they should be enjoying a better standard of living.<\/p>  <p>  No matter what laws are involved, be it the Taxes Consolidation Act or pension legislation, the reality is that the restriction exists.  As the Minister said, it appears as though there is a choice.  However, in the case of the winding-up of a defined benefit scheme, there is no choice and people do not have access to an approved retirement fund which would be much better for them.  That is the nugget that we have to fix quickly.<\/p>  <p>  Public consultation processes can take a very long time.  It is to be hoped that the one announced by the Minister will be completed expeditiously.  There should be a fix in the Act similar to a previous change.  It was recognised what bad value for money annuities are and the rules were changed by the Department of Finance in previous years via various statutory instruments and Revenue briefings which allowed the situation to be altered for the benefit of pensioners.  That could be done immediately, pending the necessary review of the scheme.

These conditions created difficulties for farmers, particularly in parts of the west on heavier land types.  On the other hand, grass growth rates through the autumn and most of the year were ahead of last year.  However, due to the higher than average rainfall in many parts of the country late on in the year land remained too wet to support grazing.  This resulted in cattle being housed earlier than normal in some areas, particularly on the heavier soils that retained water and were slower to drain.  For the same reason, as land remained wet over a prolonged period, it lost its ability to support machinery and so silage harvesting, particularly that of late cut silage, was affected.<\/p>  <p>  At my request, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, met the president of the Irish Farmers Association, Mr. Joe Healy, and some local farmers in Leitrim to see first-hand the challenges on the ground.  I recognise there are undoubtedly issues in certain areas with regard to adequate winter fodder but it appears there are supplies of fodder in the form of silage and hay available across the country as a whole for those farmers who may require it to supplement their own fodder supply.<\/p>  <p>  I have been very conscious throughout these last few months of the difficult weather conditions and their effect on the agriculture sector.  I acknowledge the point made by a number of previous speakers on having an assessment of the position on the ground and for this reason I asked Teagasc to work locally with affected farmers in areas with fodder difficulties to help them manage their particular farming position and to provide support on fodder budgeting for the winter ahead.  It is important to emphasise that my Department operates an emergency helpline for animal welfare cases.  I urge any farmers facing an emergency animal welfare situation and who may be in need of support to contact the helpline for advice and, if needs be, emergency assistance.<\/p>  <p>  Last month the European Commission agreed to my request for an advance payment of the 2017 basic payment scheme.  I took this action in response to the poor weather conditions we are discussing here this evening and also in response to market difficulties caused by currency fluctuations, among other issues.  This advance translates into an increase from 50% to 70% in the rate for the basic payment scheme to those farmers whose applications were confirmed fully clear.  Issuing of these payments commenced as early as possible, or in this case after 15 October, and balancing payments will be made with effect from early December.  There will also be an increase permitted to the advance for Pillar II rural development schemes.<\/p>  <p>  I conclude for the moment by saying these payments and the payments under the areas of natural constraints scheme have already injected over &euro;800 million into the Irish rural economy.  They are providing a very welcome boost for Irish farm families and will help to finance fodder purchase where necessary.

I understand that the IFA invited the Minister to meet it in Claremorris on 1 December.  I encourage the Minister to take up that invitation and to hear directly from farmers in County Mayo and in the west who are affected.  A similar meeting is being organised by the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA.  I ask that the Minister put a scheme in place before 1 December and to deal with this issue before it becomes an animal welfare and stock crisis.

It is strange that fodder has already become so expensive at this time of the year if there are such adequate supplies.  I saw people cutting grass - in vain, I think - on the last day of October.  I was travelling extensively throughout Cavan, Monaghan and Fermanagh that day.  There were a few dryish days at the end of October, and people were cutting grass, but they were bringing in as much muck as grass.  I do not know what benefit there was in people trying to make silage from that particular grass.  I hope it is of some benefit, but many farmers would say that it is not worth the cost of the diesel.<\/p>  <p>  If there are supplies available, I appeal to the Minister to ensure that a transport subsidy at least is put in place to transport fodder from the wealthier parts of the country to the south of Ulster and to Connacht.

Deputy Collins is probably familiar with my constituency, as I am with his.  He would know that there is a lot of heavy ground, especially in western Duhallow and up to the Limerick border.  I acknowledge the difficulties faced by any farmer who has been farming on heavy ground in a year in which there has been exceptionally high rainfall.<\/p>  <p>  I am not going to get into the difference of opinion about whether there is sufficient fodder in the country, but the Teagasc assessment on the pasture sward is that 2017 was in fact a record year for grass growth and that there is sufficient fodder in the country.  The problem is, as Deputy Aylward opined, that we have surplus in certain areas and a deficit in other areas.  It is not the case that my Department has not been proactive on this issue.  A number of weeks ago, long before any of the Deputies stood to raise the issue, I asked Teagasc to go out into the farmyards in the regions where they are and find out what the situation is on the ground.<\/p><p>Deputy Smith referred to the critical point in the reply.  If there is to be a scheme it has to be one that is based on the evidence on the ground from the Department officials and Teagasc which is in the farmyards in the regions concerned.  That process is under way.  I am satisfied that there is sufficient fodder.<\/p> <p> There are problems at the moment about escalating prices for fodder being demanded.  We need to be conscious of how we fuel that by the expectation that the State's chequebook may be opened in this area.  We need to be conscious of how we progress this matter.  We are doing it in a logical fashion.  I take Deputy Cahill's point about the mental health problems caused when farmers who have more animals than they can cater for beyond St. Patrick's Day 2018 see a diminishing supply of fodder.  The Department is obliged to be rational about it and accumulate the evidence as best it can and then make a decision.  That is under way.  I acknowledge that for example Teagasc, in conjunction with Aurivo cooperative, is helping farmers to navigate the system and give them advice on how to budget whatever fodder resources they have.  We are progressing the matter satisfactorily.  I keep an open mind on the matter but I am conscious that our commentary is fuelling fodder prices when there is no need for that escalation in price.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100036#JJ00900","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Defence Issues","time":1511292000,"counter":524,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100037#KK00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1511292000,"counter":525,"content":"<p>On Monday, 13 November, 22 EU defence ministers signed the permanent structured cooperation agreement, PESCO.

Now we know this was entirely bogus and events and actions have proved us correct.  Not only is the EU sprinting ahead with the creation of an EU army but we know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach want Ireland to be the front and centre of this army.

I am happy to inform the House that the Government earlier today approved for the formal notification by Ireland of our intention to participate, subject to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann's approval of same.  I will bring this issue to the House shortly.  All of us here are fully aware that threats to international peace and security are complex, multidimensional, interrelated and transnational in nature.  The ever-changing complex and intertwined nature of threats to our citizens, individual states and to international peace and security must be acknowledged.  As I have stated many times in this House, no country acting alone can address such challenges.  The best approach for Ireland continues to be to ensure that the countries on the borders of the EU and beyond the European neighbourhood are stable, secure and prosperous.<\/p>  <p>  Our continuing membership of the European Union and the United Nations allows Ireland to deepen and sustain democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights through, among other things, participating in overseas peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions, which in turn will make Ireland more safe and secure.  As the Members of this House are aware, PESCO provides a treaty based framework designed to improve the means by which EU member states can participate jointly in projects to develop capabilities that will enhance contributions to crisis management and peacekeeping operations undertaken by the EU under the common security and defence policy, CSDP.  Participation in any PESCO project is entirely voluntary and it is a matter for each member state to decide for itself whether or not to participate on a case-by-case basis.  Ireland has always strongly supported the development of CSDP and of EU capacity to respond to international crises in support of the UN and has participated in all aspects of CSDP since it was established.  Ireland has also been one of the leading contributors to CSDP operations deployed under UN mandates or with the support of the UN.<\/p>  <p>  PESCO is a further initiative in strengthening the Union's capacity in this regard and developments in CSDP have been supported by the UN Under-Secretary-General as potentially providing additional capabilities for UN mandated operations.  The PESCO notification explicitly recalls \"the commitment of the European Union and its Member States to the promotion of a rules-based global order with multilateralism as its key principle and the United Nations at its core\".  PESCO can contribute to improve the capacity of the EU and member states to support international peace and security, both as EU and as troop contributors on UN mandated missions.  It is also a means of enhancing interoperability and, working with EU partners, ensuring that our troops are equipped with the latest and best equipment and training.<\/p>  <p>  A key challenge to the European Union's capacity to mount crisis management operations has been a lack of essential capabilities and the political will from member states to commit the required capabilities for CSDP operations.  PESCO has been designed to address this challenge, enhancing the political commitment of member states to both develop and deliver capabilities in support of CSDP.<\/p>  <p>  Participation in PESCO, which is provided for in the treaty of the European Union, Articles 42.6, 46 and Protocol 10, was introduced under the Lisbon treaty and has no implications for Ireland's policy of military neutrality, for the triple-lock or the crucial roles we play in crisis management and peacekeeping operations.<\/p><p>The participation criteria expressly stipulate that PESCO will be undertaken in full compliance with the Treaty on European Union and the associated protocols and will respect the member states' constitutional provisions.  Participation in each project is on an opt-in basis and is therefore entirely voluntary.  Three other neutral EU member states, Finland, Sweden and Austria, have already committed to joining PESCO.<\/p> <p> It is important to remind this House that PESCO was comprehensively discussed in the context of the Lisbon treaty and was approved by the Irish people when they voted for the treaty in October 2009.  PESCO was specifically referenced in the Lisbon treaty protocol to address the concerns of the Irish people and Ireland&rsquo;s declaration and that the legislation setting down Ireland&rsquo;s approval process for PESCO was published in advance of that vote and enacted in November 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100037#KK00500","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511292600,"counter":529,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will have to try to incorporate the rest of his response into later comments.

Any EU policy which aims to increase EU militarisation is a potential threat to Irish neutrality and the Government should veto these plans.  Today's announcement is hugely disappointing.  There has been no conversation or discussion in the House on the matter, just an off-the-cuff remark.

This is a scandal.  The aim of PESCO is to develop defence capabilities jointly and make them available for EU military operations.  That is at odds with Irish neutrality.  Our capabilities should be available to the UN and the UN only.  The Minister of State should bear in mind that it also allows for the EU to act alone.  It is not obliged to act with UN support.

It is a policy which was in the Solidarity-People Before Profit pre-budget proposal.  It is coupled with amendment No. 3 which we will discuss in a moment which is to pay for the abolition of the USC by imposing new tax bands on the highest incomes.  There is often a debate over whether, as the Government suggested, there ought to be some reductions in the tax burden on those who earn low and middle incomes or more generally.<\/p><p>Alternatively, although the Government sort of abandoned the policy, the debate is whether we should progressively move towards the abolition of the USC.  Then there are those who say we should not do that but should spend whatever fiscal space is available on public services and infrastructure.<\/p> <p> Solidarity-People Before Profit rejects the false choice that we can either have money for public services and infrastructure or money to reduce the tax burden on hard-pressed working people.  We think it is possible to do both.  However, to do both, it is necessary to be honest with people, which is where the Government fails.  When it is criticised about the small &euro;5 a week tax reductions it is proposing in this budget over the need to spend in other areas, it is open to that criticism and that is because we are fighting over crumbs.  That is what we have in the budget.  Do we have crumbs of &euro;5 a week in tax breaks for workers or do we have crumbs of additional expenditure in public services such as health, education and the arts?  We would have characterised the budget as a budget of crumbs.  There were a few crumbs for the workers and a few crumbs for public services.  However, it did not address the low levels of pay and the high tax burden, whether direct or indirect, on ordinary workers.  It did not in any real sense tackle the massive shortfall in investment in public services, particularly areas such as housing, which is a disastrous situation, and health.<\/p> <p> To do both justice, it is necessary to find other sources of revenue.  That is the point to both of the reports referred to in amendments Nos. 2 and 3.  It is to look for other sources of revenue.  We have a series of other amendments seeking reports in other areas where we believe significant revenues could be raised.  However, for the most part the Government does not want to talk about these revenues, which include taxing those on very high incomes of in excess of &euro;100,000 a year.  When we make such suggestions, the Government states that it is necessary to reward work and that it does not want to impose higher levels of tax on high earners because it disincentivises work.  However, if we are to be concerned about punishing people for working, we should be more concerned about punishing those on low and middle incomes who have suffered pay cuts and the USC and feel disproportionately the impact of regressive indirect taxes, whether they are bin charges, hospital charges, parking charges or any other of the array of stealth taxes which reduce the real income of low and middle income people but mean nothing to high earners.  A person on &euro;150,000 a year is not bothered about paying bin charges, water charges, parking charges or increased public transport costs.  For those on &euro;25,000 to &euro;45,000 a year, however, these charges really hurt and they hurt them disproportionately.  The USC disproportionately hurts them and the pension levy hurts public sector workers as do the pay cuts they suffered during the austerity period.  In proposing the abolition of the hated universal social charge for those earning less than &euro;90,000, we believe it, and a hell of a lot more, can be paid for by imposing higher taxes on those on higher incomes as well as on wealth and profits and other sources of untapped revenue.  That is the basic proposal and we think it is fair. <\/p> <p> The concept of wealth distribution is missing in the economic debate; however, it needs to be debated.  It was often spoken of in the 1960s and 1970s but it is now gone from political discourse.  We end up fighting over things called fiscal space.  As I said, we are arguing about the crumbs but we do not talk about the redistribution of wealth and using the tax system as the main mechanism to do it.  The reason we should talk about it is that the inequalities in the distribution of income and wealth are growing all the time.  That is what these two related proposals in amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are trying to address: the redistribution of wealth from the have-a-lots to the have-very-littles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100038#LL03000","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511293200,"counter":558,"content":"<p>On Report Stage we are not speaking to the sections so I will speak to this issue through amendment No. 2.

Another speaker suggested it is possible to relieve practically everybody in the country of all forms of taxation.  This is simply not possible.  If, however, the State were to examine the various elements of its tax code, including PRSI, the USC, corporation taxes and employers&rsquo; contributions in respect of PRSI, it could, I have no doubt, come up with solutions over time that would enable us to achieve a fair system of taxation and not a system of zero taxation for particular people, as suggested by the previous speaker.  I propose a fairer system of taxation that would allow people on incomes in Ireland, as earned by nurses, teachers, doctors and politicians, to contribute in a fair way and to make provision for their pensions, the health services they require and the education services their children require, be it at preschool, primary, secondary or third level.  In that way, we would be able to provide for continuous growth in this economy that would be fair and balanced, with resources distributed in a way that would benefit the whole population.  We have to be honest about this and state this means most people at work do have to contribute in taxation.  They also contribute through indirect taxes and through taxation at other points in their lives.<\/p> <p> What we have at present is a taxation system that has gone out of kilter.  I have made a certain suggestion to the Minister on a number of occasions.  I do not know whether he would have the courage to do what I propose, namely, establish a permanent standing commission on taxation, operating like the Law Reform Commission.  It would review and examine loopholes, anomalies and instances of unfairness that arise in all tax codes from time to time.  As we speak, I am sure there are some people at junior level in legal, tax and accountancy offices who have been delegated to listen to this debate, examine the Finance Act that arises from our deliberations and set to work, as in a game of chess, to create loopholes, backdoors, side doors, tunnels and alleyways in order that people will not have to pay their fair share of tax.<\/p> <p> Last year at this time, I proposed to the Minister a review of people with offshore bank accounts, just as I proposed this to his predecessor, Deputy Noonan.  In fairness to the current Minister, he agreed to have such a review.  As with all of these trawls of evasion mechanisms, loopholes or tax planning arrangements, the investigation carried out produced, without very much difficulty, approximately &euro;84 million on a first trawl.  That was without examining all the accounts.<\/p> <p> With regard to PRSI and the USC, when the ESRI first produced its proposals quite a few years ago &mdash; just before the crash, if my memory serves me correctly &mdash; it proposed a universal social benefit tax that would result in enhancements in pensions and would provide for people who might not have private company pensions or public service pensions.  It would provide an income in addition to the public service pension paid by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The crash came after Fianna F&aacute;il collapsed the economy and the then Minister, Brian Lenihan, decided he would change the tax from a benefit tax to a universal social charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100039#MM02000","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511293800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>Could the Acting Chairman clarify whether there are time limits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100040#NN00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1511293800,"counter":579,"content":"<p>The Deputy is a minute and a half over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100040#NN00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1511293800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I will finish shortly.

I recognise that the Deputies putting forward the amendment have others that would see revenue coming in.  They are not just suggesting a massive tax cut but the amendment is not well thought out.  The USC is paid on single incomes.  The amendment refers to a threshold of &euro;90,000.  This would mean the top 15% of earners would fall into the gap.  The sum is nearly three times the average income.  I am not sure whether everybody earning less than &euro;90,000 would be exempt or whether somebody earning &euro;91,000 would have a tax liability based on the &euro;1,000 in excess of the threshold or whether she would be paying on the entire &euro;91,000.  Either way, one would fall into the trap set by the Government.  In the last election campaign, it promised to abolish the USC.  The proposers of this amendment, the members of People Before Profit, are arguing for a threshold of &euro;90,000 in respect of the abolition.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party are stating &euro;80,000 and &euro;70,000.  I have made the point time and again that we cannot afford to do this.  It is quite interesting that we are actually paying less tax now on all of these incomes than just before the USC was introduced.  This is because the USC replaced two other forms of tax, the income levy and the health levy.  If they were still in place and if we had just carried that through, we would actually be paying more tax on our income today than we are.  I recognise the Deputies proposing the amendment have tabled others to raise additional revenue but we need to be maintaining and protecting the tax base.  We need to be investing the proceeds in areas of social need, such as in housing, health and child care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100040#NN00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1511293800,"counter":582,"content":"<p>We dealt with this matter on Committee Stage.  I just want to make a few points on the amendment put forward by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett.  I will explain why we will not be accepting it.  The Deputy criticised the last budget when we delivered, through a series of changes to the USC and by increasing the entry point to the higher rate of income tax, a set of gains of around &euro;5 per week for people who tend to be on lower and middle incomes.  During Deputy Boyd Barrett's contributions on the budget and in his contribution earlier today, he criticised us for tax cuts.<\/p><p>He criticised us for saying that we are putting in place any form of tax reform or reduction at a time when we should be investing in public services.  On the one hand he is saying we cut taxes too much in the last budget and in this amendment he is proposing a tax change that would mean that anybody earning up to &euro;1,731 per week would pay no USC at all.  During the debate on the last budget he said we cut taxes too much and now he is saying we should put in place a tax reduction on income which is many multiples ahead of what we did in the last budget.<\/p> <p> I know Deputy Boyd Barrett will go on to say that he would seek to introduce a number of other measures that would raise revenue in other ways.  He can expect that my response will be to say that raising revenue in those other ways would narrow our tax base even further or create difficulties that would undermine the competitiveness of the economy.  If Deputy Boyd Barrett goes back to the exchange we had on Committee Stage, I understand he envisaged that increased income tax rates of between 50% and 65% on income above &euro;100,000 would be used to off-set the USC reduction.  However, as the Deputy is aware, we are already at the point where in 2018 the top 1% of income earners will pay 25% of all income tax and USC.  It is for all of those reasons that I believe to put in place such a measure would really concentrate the risk that the State has in relation to the collection of tax revenues.  As I indicated on budget day, I believe that we should have a threshold into USC, that we do not change in the years to come because if we were to do that it would undermine the breadth of the tax base which we will need even more in the coming years with all of the challenges that could lie ahead.

If we were to take the course of action recommended by Deputy Boyd Barrett it would undermine the strength of the tax base and I believe instead what we should be doing is concentrating the funding that is available to reduce marginal rates of taxation while still asking anybody above a certain level of income to make a contribution to the funding of public services either through USC or through income tax.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the proposals put by Deputy Boyd Barrett in relation to what he would do from an income tax point of view, if we were to go ahead and do it, that would mean the top 1% of taxpayers, who would earn 12% of income, would pay 34% of income tax.  That may well be the objective Deputy Boyd Barrett is seeking to deliver but it would mean that the risk in relation to the breadth of our tax base would be highly concentrated and concentrated at a very high level of income.  Given all the difficulties and misery we have had in recent years that was partially caused by the fact that we had a way of collecting taxes and a tax code that ultimately proved not to be fit for purpose, this is not an amendment I will accept.

That is going to continue unless one has a radical policy of income and wealth redistribution.  When one asks whether the top 5% or 10% should pay a disproportionate amount of income tax, as we propose, I am pleased that the Minister at least understands it because some of our critics do not.  That is exactly what we are proposing and unless that happens we will not close the gap that is widening all the time.  If one goes back to the 1950s and 1960s, the highest earners might have earned seven or eight times that of the average earner but now the highest earners are earning 20, 30 and 40 times that of the average earner.  The Minister has said the top 10% pay 40% of all the tax, which is the case, but they also have 40% of all the income, and rising, and they have 50% of all the wealth, and rising.  We need a tax system that addresses such inequality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100041#OO01600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1511294400,"counter":599,"content":"<p>For good or ill, I read Capital in the Twenty-First Century and it goes through the point Deputy Boyd Barrett made in great detail, but the majority of the book is about the inequality in the distribution of wealth and the causes of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100041#OO01700","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1511294400,"counter":600,"content":"<p>We will move on to that later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100041#OO01800","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1511294400,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Yes, we will move on to that later, whereas what we are focusing on here relates to the distribution of income.

In response to the Minister's last point, the inequality in the distribution of income leads directly to the inequality in the distribution of wealth that Piketty has identified.  In fact, all the studies of the two show as much.  Once a person has higher income or surplus income over and above what he or she needs to pay the mortgage, survive and pay day-to-day costs, he or she can then begin to develop capital.  The person can start to make money out of money.  That is the problem with the system.  Once a person reaches over a certain threshold of income, the surplus available can start to self-expand.  One can invest in property, shares and all manner of things that allow one to start to make money for doing nothing.<\/p><p>We imagine that is fair and legitimate.  However, the problem is that when one person makes money, it does not come out of thin air.  The person is taking it from someone else.  If a person invests in property and is making money out of money because he or she has invested in property, who is losing out?  It is the person who is paying the rent he or she cannot afford.  That is how one thing leads to another.  The inequality in the distribution of income leads to the inequality in the distribution of wealth.<\/p><p>Unless that is addressed, we will continue to see the gap grow, and it is growing.  The Minister says our social transfers somewhat ameliorate the inequality.  It is true that the Irish social welfare system somewhat ameliorates the inequality of income and wealth distribution but it only slows the growth in the gap.  It is not stopping the growth in the gap.  It somewhat slows the gap compared with jurisdictions that have no social welfare system.  Everywhere in the western world the gap is growing.  It is growing all the time at an exponential and obscene rate.<\/p><p>We need policies of radical redistribution using the tax system.  I do not accept the Minister's suggestion that somehow this is an unsustainable narrowing of the tax base.  The problem is that low and middle-income people are not only hit with the ordinary tax bands and the universal social charge, they are also hit disproportionately by myriad indirect taxes.  People are now paying taxes for things that they used to get because they paid tax.  Consequently, they are paying twice.  We used to get our bins paid for because we paid our tax.  Now, we pay &euro;5, &euro;10, &euro;15, &euro;20 or &euro;25 per month.  That is a new tax.  The Minister can call it a charge if he wishes, but in reality for low and middle-income people that is a new tax.  When a motorist has to pay God knows how much in parking charges every day to get to work, something he did not have to pay for previously, it is a tax.  Public transport costs are rising constantly and public transport is seen as something that has to be commercially feasible and profitable rather than something that we need to make the economy and society function.  In reality, the increases in public transport costs are hidden taxes.  Moreover, they disproportionately hit the less well-off.  We can go through the list of public service obligation taxes and so on, all of which disproportionately hit people on low and middle incomes.<\/p><p>Of course we must look at the whole package in the whole.  Anyway, these amendments propose to make a radical move in the direction of redistributing income.  Anything less will simply see the continual increase in the gap between the haves and the have-nots that has reached obscene and unacceptable levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100042#PP00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1511295000,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I do not agree with the amendment.  Those who advocate higher personal tax rates often say that what really matters are the effective rates and not the marginal rates of tax.  Effective rates matter, but marginal rates matter as well.  The landmark level of income has become &euro;100,000.  While someone at that level is paying a marginal rate of 52%, the budget day booklet indicates such a person is paying an effective rate of 39%.<\/p>  <p>  When we are considering the amendment, we should bear in mind what is actually being suggested.  I assume that when the Deputy refers to new tax bands and he puts a percentage next to them, the percentages are replacing the income tax rate of 40%.  Therefore, the rate of 40% will become 50%, 55%, 60% and 65%.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is advocating that the existing marginal rate of 52% would rise to somewhere between 62% and 77%, plus an additional 3% for the self-employed.  That is what has been proposed.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe that someone on high levels of income is going to decide not to work because his tax goes up.  However, I do not believe that such a measure would be without consequence either.  There would be consequences not only in terms of the take-home pay of the people concerned but in respect of investment decisions and other employment decisions.  The notion that we can tax to the hilt people on higher incomes without any consequence for people earning less than those levels is not one to which I subscribe.  This is because the investment environment, tax environment and employment environment are all connected.<\/p>  <p>  I take it seriously when representatives from organisations like IDA Ireland, which is selling Ireland, make the point that personal taxation rates matter.  I believe they matter and I think what is being suggested goes too far.  Certainly, it is not something we could support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100042#PP00400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1511295000,"counter":606,"content":"<p>N&iacute; bheidh m&eacute; ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ochta don leas&uacute; seo ach oiread.

It is altogether disproportionate.  I made the point previously about marginal tax rates.  We continue to discuss myths in the House.  I recognise what Deputy McGrath has said.  He referred to what IDA Ireland representatives have told him and all of us about tax rates.  They have made that claim and that much is without doubt.  That is fair enough and certainly IDA Ireland deals with large multinational companies and so on.<\/p>  <p>  There is no evidence, however, to suggest that high marginal tax rates of the type that we have are a distraction or a problem in terms of employment.  Indeed, ESRI representatives told us those of us in the finance committee that child care is probably a greater barrier to employment than our current tax rates.  The point I made on Committee Stage was that there is a tipping point and we are on a curve.  It is incorrect to suggest there is no relationship between marginal tax rates and employment; of course there is.  Let us suppose we put marginal tax rates up to a high level.  Different people will have different definitions of what constitutes a high level.  Anyway, if we put the rates up to too high a level, as I believe is the case in this amendment, then of course it will have a consequence.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to engaging with Revenue representatives to try to get them to drill down into more granular detail in terms of incomes.  One of the ways to increase taxes - the effective tax rate is the big issue - on those earning above &euro;100,000 is to start to get rid of their tax credits or to have a tapering off of tax credits.  We have articulated this policy for many years.  We cannot put it forward because it cannot be costed.  Anyway, I hope that in the coming 12 months will be will be able to get the costings when the budgetary committee carries out some work with the Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  This policy exists in Britain, for example once a person's income hits a certain level.  Above &pound;120,000, a person's tax credits start to go and the person begins to lose the benefit of the tax credit.<\/p><p>This raises the effective tax rate but does not increase the marginal tax rate.  We can each fight our corner in this argument.  I speak about effective tax rates whereas the Minister of State speaks about marginal rates.  We need to get real on this issue.  It is possible to increase taxes at the high end without increasing tax rates.  Under the current system, people have many ways to reduce their effective tax rate.  These include pension reliefs and other reliefs which are not captured in the budget because they are individualised.  It is interesting to note in the data for all taxpayers that the effective tax rate is relatively low in all cases.  I will not support the amendment because it is disproportionate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100042#PP00500","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511295600,"counter":608,"content":"<p>I, too, oppose the amendment.

I note the proposed changes would apply to salaries of more than &euro;100,000.  I presume the Deputy was referring to those who earn less than &euro;100,000 when he spoke of people being much poorer.<\/p><p>From the 1960s until the 1980s, Ireland had very high levels of income tax.  This was the reason for some of the bugs which have since plagued the tax system, specifically, the ability of very wealthy people to avoid their liabilities by moving offshore, as we have seen in recent times, and employing accountants and experts to mitigate their tax.  This means that people who do not have sufficient income to employ accountants are placed at a serious disadvantage and end up paying proportionately much more of their income in tax than those who can afford to pay for tax advice.  While, on the face of it, proposing to increase income tax to 50%, 55% and 60% may seem reasonable, a public servant would also pay PRSI at 4.5% and approximately 6% of salary as a pension contribution.  Automatically, therefore, we must add approximately 10% to the rate stated in the amendment to arrive at the effective rate.  Given that we parcel out additional charges - some we allocate to PRSI for particular reasons while we allocate others to areas such as pension contributions for people in retirement - these are exceptionally high rates and I do not know how people could be persuaded to accept them.<\/p><p>The amendment has been tabled for propaganda purposes.  It is not intended for any real purpose.  Members of the trade unions marched<i>en masse<\/i>against very high marginal tax rates in the 1980s because people on relatively low incomes, including public servants on average salaries, inevitably ended up paying the bulk of tax.  While it may have been the intention to catch only the very wealthy, in practice many wealthy people were able to avoid tax offshore while those who lived and worked here and contributed to the economy could not do so.  In some ways, the drafters of the amendment should be careful what they wish for because while they may be sufficiently well off to be able to avoid these tax rates, others may not be able to do so. <\/p><p>While this is a difficult statement to make, we must also recognise that we live in a highly globalised economy.  The impact of this is that people look across the water to the United Kingdom, the United States and many other countries and compare the average tax rates and contributions people pay here with those that they might pay if they were to move elsewhere.  People make economic choices in a globalised world based on information about how Ireland compares with other countries.  The OECD makes a number of points in this regard.  It has noted for some time, for example, that the social welfare system lifts more people out of the risk of poverty than almost any other European Union member state.  Ireland's tax code is also dysfunctional in one area which presents a growing difficulty, namely, the element which makes it possible to pay no tax in certain corporate structures.  This applies to companies rather than individuals.  We must address this issue and introduce fair and efficient taxes which treat people in roughly the same manner.  We must enable companies to generate employment while requiring them to make a fair contribution.  We must seek fairness, efficiency and effectiveness in the tax system to ensure we raise enough money to do what citizens want to be done in the areas of health, education, social services and public services in general.  We must have a debate and reach an agreement on what are the approximate and fair levels of tax.<\/p><p>When one adds the other taxes and levies that people have to pay to the tax rates proposed in the amendment, the figure approaches the confiscatory.  The people with the types of salaries listed in the amendment would avoid paying these rates in any case, which means the burden would fall back on people on middle incomes, particularly those who work in public services because all of their income is accounted for and they do not have loopholes that allow them to avoid paying tax.  Incidentally, I am not aware of anyone in the public service who is clamouring for such loopholes.  We have, by and large, a social contract in which people are willing to pay a fair share of tax, if not an excessive amount, that would allow us to create the type of society we want.  Those are Labour Party principles which I stand by because they make sense.  Based on these principles, people approaching retirement age will have been able to provide for their retirement and their employers will also, I hope, have made a contribution to that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100043#QQ00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1511295600,"counter":611,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett appears to be on his own on this one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100043#QQ00500","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1511295600,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I have my comrades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100043#QQ00600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1511295600,"counter":613,"content":"<p>The other speakers may be on the left but not on this occasion.

This would be in addition to the universal social charge system, under which five separate rates are applied, and a PRSI system which has further distinct features.  To place the proposed increases in context, they would result in a marginal tax rate of between 62% and 65% for employees and self-employed persons on incomes of more than &euro;100,000.  Rates would continue to increase with income, reaching a marginal tax rate of 77% for employees and 80% for self-employed persons.  This proposal is not a runner as the damage it would cause and its unintended consequences would be catastrophic.<\/p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Doherty's point on IDA Ireland, my role includes international financial services and I meet many foreign direct investment, FDI, companies backed by IDA Ireland.  Not everyone employed by these companies is earning a fortune.  The first issue consistently raised with me is not the higher rate of tax but the low entry point for the higher rate, which stood at &euro;33,800 until it was increased in the budget to allow people to earn a little more.<\/p><p>Our objective is to increase that in order that people can earn more and pay at a further point along the earning thresholds.<\/p> <p> It is always raised with me by companies which want to come here.  It is always the first issue raised.  A point I like to make to people is that just because it is an FDI company does not mean that everybody is on a fortune.  On the figures Deputy Boyd Barrett is talking about, &euro;100,000 is two people earning &euro;50,000.  I do not believe two people earning &euro;50,000 are particularly wealthy.  One could have two civil servants earning &euro;60,000 getting caught with these thresholds, similar to the points raised by Deputy Burton.  This is not the 1970s or the 1980s.

I refer also to occupational therapists, speech and language therapists or construction workers.  These are workers earning under &euro;90,000.  Were the USC to be abolished, all those people would be much more likely either to stay in this country or, if they are abroad, to come back.<\/p>  <p>  If the Minister of State states he is hearing about the entry point in to the tax system, he is talking to people who are very different to those to whom I am talking.

They ask me to look at their pay cheque stating that is what was imposed on them because of the economic crash where they were made pick up the can for the bankers and all the rest of it.

Relief has expired for qualifying mortgages taken out prior to 2004 and the relief was abolished for new borrowers for mortgages taken out after 31 December 2013.  Therefore, only qualifying borrowings taken out between 2004 and 2012 remain in receipt of the relief.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the financial pressures that individuals continue to face and of the fact that without any action in this Finance Bill, the remaining recipients of mortgage interest relief would have faced a cliff whereby their relief would cease entirely in January 2018.  Therefore, the programme for Government committed to a tapered extension of the relief and it was stated last year in budget 2017 that the extension would run to the end of 2020.  The Bill legislates for that extension, providing for the gradual tapered removal of the relief between January 2018 and December 2020, to allow the remaining recipients a phased period of adjustment to the cessation of the relief.  <\/p>  <p>  The amendment proposed by Deputy Doherty would defer one part of the taper for a year, thereby extending the tapered withdrawal of mortgage interest relief out from three to four years.  However, given that the cessation of the relief has been provided for since 2010, I do not believe such a further extension would be appropriate.  It must be remembered that this relief has ceased for home owners who purchased before 2004 and those who purchased their homes from 2013 onwards have never benefitted from this relief.  In my view, a three year extension which meets the commitment given last year strikes a balance between supporting those current recipients while extending fairness to home owners who have never benefitted from the relief.

Some of those who are having difficulties keeping a roof over their heads are benefitting from mortgage interest relief.  As we parliamentarians cast our vote here, what we will be doing is potentially cutting what could have been 100% relief to 75%.  This is the decision that we have to make.  The Bill before us provides for 75% relief but I want to see that at 100%.  I think we should provide the additional support, namely the current level of support that those families are receiving, which is why this amendment will be pressed to a vote.  I am asking Members to reconsider their position on this, to support these families and to make sure they do not face higher mortgage payments next year as a result of voting down this amendment.

I agree with the Deputy about the consequences that would have for more than 290,000 mortgage accounts, which would almost certainly represent more than 400,000 mortgageholders.  What we are seeking to do and what we have achieved is an abolition that is gradual.

I am circulating separately the email that has been the subject of discussion.  My objective is to put as much information as I can into the public domain while respecting the work of the Charleton tribunal.<\/p>  <p>  For the benefit of all Members of the House, I again wish to put on record that there is a tribunal of inquiry, chaired by Mr. Justice Charleton, that is continuing to carry out its work.  It is a judicial body, with wide terms of reference agreed by this House after thorough consultation by me, and its work should be respected.<\/p><p> Standing Order 59(3) of this House states, \"a matter shall not be raised in such an overt manner so that it appears to be an attempt by the D&aacute;il to encroach on the functions of the Courts or a Judicial Tribunal\".  I would ask Members of the House to consider the tribunal&rsquo;s current work and its wide terms of reference before coming to conclusions.  All of us must be circumspect when commenting on matters before a tribunal and, as parliamentarians, we want to be responsible in making public comment on matters covered by a sitting tribunal.<\/p> <p> The terms of reference clearly mandate the tribunal to consider a wide range of questions, including the then Commissioner&rsquo;s legal strategy.  Among its 16 separate terms of reference are to investigate contacts between members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the media and broadcasting personnel, members of the Government, Tusla, the HSE, any other State entity or any relevant person as the sole member may deem necessary to carry out his work relevant to the matters set out, and to investigate whether the false allegations of sexual abuse or any other unjustified grounds were inappropriately relied upon by Commissioner O'Sullivan to discredit Sergeant Maurice McCabe at the Commission of Investigation (Certain Matters Relative to the Cavan\/Monaghan Division of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kevin O'Higgins.  Members will have to agree these are very broad terms of reference which were, as I said, agreed after a lot of consultation with all Members of the Opposition.  They were accepted on the night in the House.  Members will have to agree that the consultation took place and that is why we have such comprehensive terms of reference.<\/p> <p> I will endeavour this evening to shed as much light as possible on what I and the Department of Justice and Equality knew, and at what time.  I can only speak about my personal experience and knowledge and I must be careful not to say anything that would undermine or interfere with the work of the disclosures tribunal.  Last Monday week, I confirmed to the Taoiseach that neither I nor the Department of Justice and Equality had any hand, act or part in the legal strategy of the former Commissioner.  In that phone conversation, I also confirmed to the Taoiseach that I only became aware of the broad details dealt with in the commission when they came into the public domain in May 2016.<\/p> <p> Last Thursday, the Department of Justice and Equality informed me that an email had been located.  It had been sent to me late in the afternoon of 15 May 2015.  It outlined a conversation between an official in the Department of Justice and Equality and an official from the Office of the Attorney General, highlighting a disagreement that had arisen between the two legal teams at the commission, that is, the legal teams representing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  The email indicated that counsel for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had raised, during the hearings, an allegation of a serious criminal complaint against Sergeant Maurice McCabe which had previously been made.<\/p> <p> It is important to state that the email said that Sergeant McCabe had always denied this allegation.  Counsel for Sergeant McCabe objected to this issue being raised and asked whether the Garda Commissioner had authorised this approach.  The Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s authorisation was confirmed, although it was understood separately that that might be subject to further legal advice.  It should be noted that this matter was extensively referenced on the public record in the opening days of the disclosures tribunal earlier this year - all of that is on the website.  The email also references the fact that the independent review mechanism found that an investigation file on the case had been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, which had directed no prosecution.<\/p> <p> The concluding point in the email sent to me advised that neither the Attorney General nor the Minister had a function relating to the evidence a party to a commission of investigation may present.  I could have no role whatsoever in questioning or in any way seeking to influence the evidence another party gave to a commission of investigation or any legal argument made by such a person.  I might add that this is all the more so in circumstances where the Department of Justice and Equality was appearing before the commission and had separate legal representation, all of which is carefully documented in the final report of the O'Higgins commission.<\/p> <p> As I said to the Taoiseach, I had no knowledge of the details which later emerged in May 2016.  I learned of the details in May 2016 through media reports like everyone else.  At that time, I was asked to comment on leaked transcripts.  I said at the time that it would be utterly inappropriate and unfair of me to comment on such leaks.  That remains the case today.  I addressed this comprehensively when I spoke on the O'Higgins commission in this House and outlined the various follow-up actions that I felt were necessary because of what the O'Higgins commission had found.  We entrusted a commission of investigation to look into all these matters and that is exactly what the commission did.  That commission was held in private session.  That protection of witnesses is pivotal to the effective operation of commissions of inquiry.<\/p> <p> As Minister for Justice and Equality, I strongly encouraged Garda management to put in place comprehensive policies and procedures for whistleblowers, including, for example, bringing Transparency International on board to advise on best practice in regard to whistleblowers.  I established the Policing Authority, one of the most fundamental reforms of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the history of the State, and at all times sought to support and protect whistleblowers.  I never did anything other than protect whistleblowers and make sure they were being dealt with properly within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At every opportunity I had, that was the clear point I made to Garda management.<\/p> <p> Following the report of Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Higgins, I used the powers available to me under the legislation establishing the Policing Authority to ask it to conduct a detailed examination of the procedures and policies around whistleblowing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to prepare a report on the matter, including any recommendations necessary to ensure those arrangements operated to the very best practice.  I also used the legal powers available to me to ask the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, to investigate matters alleged to have occurred regarding a meeting in Mullingar involving certain officers.  This emerged at a later stage.  I established the Mr. Justice O'Neill review which arose in regard to protected disclosures I received as Minister.<\/p> <p> My record speaks for itself, as does my commitment to deal with these issues in a comprehensive, committed and fair manner.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I paid tribute to the work that Sergeant Maurice McCabe had done and I met him and his wife, Lorraine, early in my tenure as Minister for Justice and Equality.  In welcoming the publication of the O&rsquo;Higgins commission report last year, I pointed out that Mr. Justice O'Higgins described Sergeant McCabe as a man of integrity who has performed a genuine public service at considerable personal cost.  He is due the gratitude not only of the public but also of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of this House.<\/p> <p> We set up tribunals of inquiry to look at all of the evidence, hear all sides and establish the truth.  Above all, everyone is entitled to basic, fair procedures enshrined in our Constitution.  We need to let the tribunal of inquiry get on with the work we tasked it with doing.  It is incumbent on us all to let it carry out that work.<\/p> <p> I have sent the email around and I hope Members have received it.  They will receive it very shortly.  I am arranging for it to be circulated.  The Taoiseach has also spoken to Sergeant McCabe in the past two hours and had a conversation with him about some of the issues in the email.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100047#UU00300","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1511298300,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for observing the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112100048#VV00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1511298300,"counter":641,"content":"<p>Could we wait until we get the emails?
