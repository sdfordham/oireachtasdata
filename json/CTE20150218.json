I welcome everyone to the ninth public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Later this morning we will hear from Dr. Donal Donovan, former IMF deputy director.  At the first session this morning we will hear from Mr. Marco Buti from the European Commission on the international, EU and domestic policy context of the banking crisis in Ireland and, in particular, the European Commission's role in monitoring the Irish economy in the years prior to the crisis as part of the stability and growth process.  Mr. Buti, you are welcome to the meeting and I would also like to acknowledge the Commission's positive engagement with this inquiry and for your co-operation this morning.  The committee would like to put that on record.<\/p><p>Mr. Marco Buti has been Director-General for Economic and Financial Affairs at the European Commission since December 2008.  After completing studies at the University of Florence and the University of Oxford, Mr. Buti joined the European Commission in 1987.  He was an economic advisor to the Commission's President until 2003.  From September 2003 to August 2006 he was Director for Economies of the Member States at the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs where he was appointed Deputy Director-General in September 2006.  Mr. Buti has also been a visiting professor at the Universit&eacute; Libre de Bruxelles, the University of Florence and the European University Institute, and has published extensively on EMU macroeconomic policies, welfare state reforms and European unemployment.  <\/p><p>Before I begin I would advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

It is a real pleasure to be here in Dublin and an honour to have been invited to appear before this committee and its inquiry into the banking crisis.  I have prepared quite a comprehensive statement.  I will go through that because it sets out the framework for what the European Commission did at the time and how it read the challenges of the Irish economy before the crisis.<\/p> <p>   I have been asked to deliver a statement on the role of the European Commission in the Irish economy in the years prior to the crisis.  I will structure my statement in two parts.  The first part will focus on the economic development in the run up to the crisis, both international and domestic.  In the second part, I will review the role of the European Commission in economic surveillance at that time.<\/p> <p>   When analysing economic growth in Ireland before the banking crisis, it is useful to distinguish two different periods, from the early 1990s until 2000, and from about 2001 until the bursting of the housing bubble in 2007.  The first period is often referred to as the Celtic tiger period.  It was a period of extraordinarily strong growth.  The annual increase in real GDP averaged 7.2% as opposed to just above 2% in the euro area.  As a result there was an impressive and unprecedented convergence in living standards.  In 1990 gross national income per person stood at around 60% of the euro area average; ten years later it was already above the Euro area average.  In the 1990s economic growth was led by exports.  Ireland was able to take advantage of the single European market and globalisation.  It raised exports in high value sectors such as computers and pharmaceuticals.  Thanks to a flexible and English-speaking economy, Ireland attracted significant FDI inflows which boosted productivity growth and enhanced competitiveness.  The current account recorded an average surplus of 1.6% in the 1990s.  During this period employment growth was brisk with minimal wage pressure since unemployment was relatively high, female participation in the labour force low, and net inward migration flows increased the labour force.  The unemployment rate fell from 13.4% in 1990 to 5.6% in 1999.  Fiscal adjustment taken in the late 1980s to tackle the very high stock of public debts supported this expansion.  Government spending restraint and salary agreements also underpinned wage moderation.<\/p> <p>  In the 1990s inflation was low, on average 2.3%, close to the average record in the Euro area as a whole.  General Government debt fell by half to around 47% of GDP.  The year 2000 marked the end of the ICT boom which had pushed growth rates in Europe and the US close to 4%.<\/p><p> By then, Ireland's real economic growth was close to 10%, wages were rising by more than 13% and annual inflation exceeded 5%.  From about this point until the onset of the Irish banking crisis there was a striking shift in the Irish economy.  The overall growth momentum remained strong, but became largely reliant on domestic demand.  Between 2001 and 2007, real GDP growth averaged 5%, as opposed to close to 2% in the euro area.  Average inflation increased to above 3%, while it stayed slightly above 2% in the euro area as a whole.  Ireland had reached full employment.  Wage pressure began to emerge and competitiveness deteriorated, with tight labour conditions.  <\/p><p> Subsequently, export growth began to wane and export market share fell.  The current account balance deteriorated and by 2007 it recorded a deficit of about 5.4% of GDP.  Economic growth became increasingly reliant on construction.  Interest rates had declined substantially and access to credit increased with Ireland's entry into EMU.  This helped to trigger a boom in investment in housing and commercial property, with rapidly rising property prices.  The positive wealth effects from rising housing prices also contributed to buoyant private consumption.  <\/p><p> By the mid-2000s, the construction sector, especially its residential housing component, had become very large.  Construction investment grew to about one fifth of GDP, the highest in the euro area.  Employment growth also became increasingly reliant on the construction boom and the rate of unemployment fell to 4.4% in 2005.  The proportion of those employed in construction peaked at an unprecedented level of about 13.5% in 2007.  The construction sector benefited from strong inward migration flows, particularly from EU enlargement countries in 2004.  <\/p><p> Nonetheless, the labour market remained tight, pushing up wages.  The reallocation of resources into the housing sector, which was traditionally labour intensive and employed low-skilled workers, left limited room for improving productivity.  House price inflation surged in Ireland and rose more than fourfold between 1993 and 2007, among the highest of any advanced economies.  <\/p><p> On the demand side, demographic trends, higher disposable incomes, lower real interest rates and easier access to mortgage finance supported the booming property market.  Government policies also played a role through the favourable tax treatment of housing, such as the deducibility of mortgage interest payments.  The supply of housing also rose sharply, but eventually beyond the needs of the population.  The idea that house prices would increase forever turned into a recurrent and dangerous motive.<\/p><p> One of the main factors which fuelled the housing boom was the rise in private sector credit.  The private sector debt-to-GDP ratio rose to over 200 % by 2008.  As the bulk of credit was supplied by banks, this led to a major expansion in banks' balance sheets.  There was an increase in competition among the banks with many new entrants into the market, lending standards weakened and average loan-to-value ratios increased significantly.  Lending to households and property developers soared, boosting private sector debt levels.  Domestic banks also engaged in a rapid expansion of foreign activities.  At the end, the Irish banking sector was severely oversized relative to the size of the local economy and the fiscal capacity of the Irish sovereign.<\/p><p> The lending boom by the Irish banks was facilitated by the international context during this period.  Banks increasingly funded themselves easily on external wholesale markets as cross-border financial flows boomed in the international financial system, supported by low global interest rates.  Moreover, EMU had eliminated currency risks within the euro area and this contributed to rising cross-border borrowing.  As credit expanded faster than deposits, Irish banks became increasingly dependent on international market funding, leading to an unbalanced funding structure.  This left banks vulnerable to the eventual tightening in international capital markets.  Ireland was not the only such case; similar developments took place within the euro area in Spain.<\/p><p> The role of the Irish financial supervisor and regulator during the boom years has been extensively analysed and assessed by many observers.  I understand there have been dedicated sessions on this issue in this forum.  I, therefore, do not intend to elaborate at length.  It may suffice to say that I agree with those who conclude that the domestic financial supervisor did not acknowledge and address the risks associated with the credit and housing boom.  I also believe that the supervisors in the originating countries share some of the responsibility, but this is not to detract from the primary responsibility of the domestic supervisor, which has been widely acknowledged in Ireland.  <\/p><p> More generally, supervisors in a number of member states did not seem to care sufficiently about the risks of rapid year-on-year loan growth, the increasing concentration of investment in the construction sector and the relative size of their banking sectors compared to GDP, and Ireland is probably the most extreme example of what can happen when these problems are ignored.  More generally, supervisors in many member states were concerned almost exclusively with micro-prudential supervision, that is, checking the soundness of individual banks, and there was insufficient attention placed on macro-prudential supervision, that is, risks to the financial system as a whole.<\/p><p> The housing and lending boom also impacted Irish public finances.  Government spending rose sharply as a percentage of GDP, financed by the additional tax revenues linked to the housing boom.  The budget was in surplus as of 2003 and the general government debt declined to a low of 24.6% of GDP in 2006.  We know that the structural budget balance, that is, the balance net of temporary components, was expansionary and contributed to the overheating of the economy.  Revenues became overly reliant on the property market and the income tax base shrank due to successive tax cuts.  This left the budget exposed to the ensuing downturn in the property market.  <\/p><p> I have given the committee our assessment of the most important economic developments in Ireland in the years preceding the crisis.  Let me now move on to how economic surveillance was implemented at the EU level during the boom period.  I will start with the surveillance instruments that were available prior to 2007 and then move on to the question of how they were used in practice.  <\/p><p> The European Commission acts as the guardian of the EU treaty.  Within this general mandate, the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs is the service in charge of economic policies.  It carries out its duties, under the supervision of the competent member of the Commission, by monitoring and assessing economic developments in the member states, reporting on the findings of our assessment to member states directly and to the public at large and initiating specific surveillance procedures for member states where economic developments move outside or risk moving outside the perimeters laid down in EU legislation.<\/p><p> In the pre-crisis years, the EU framework for economic surveillance was a reflection of the principles enshrined in the Maastricht treaty.  The treaty, which entered into force in 1993, laid the foundations of the economic and monetary union.  Monetary policy was entrusted to the ECB while fiscal policy remained a prerogative of the member states, but to be carried out in line with commonly agreed rules.<\/p><p> The treaty also included a general provision, according to which member states \"shall regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and shall coordinate them within the Council\".  In the years following the entry into force of the Maastricht treaty, the EU strengthened fiscal surveillance via the Stability and Growth Pact.  The same did not happen to structural policies.  This asymmetry was not an oversight.  It was a reflection of the macroeconomic paradigm prevailing at the time in Europe and beyond.<\/p><p> This paradigm, sometimes referred to as the \"great moderation\", reigned until 2007, the onset of the most severe economic and financial crisis in post-Second World War history.<\/p><p>According to the great moderation paradigm, overall macroeconomic stability was to be ensured by meeting two overarching conditions; one, low, steady inflation and, two, prudent and sustainable fiscal policy.  Experience in advanced economies since the late 1980s corroborated this view especially when compared to the more unstable 1970s and early 1980s.  Countries that kept their fiscal houses in order with inflation reasonably low and stable followed a relatively small path of macroeconomic development.  Other macroeconomic compartments such as the financial sector, house price developments or the current account were not thought at the time to create major problems of their own.  They were expected to be restrained by prudent monetary and fiscal policies.  Today, we know this is not the case, but until 2007 the focus on macroeconomic surveillance in the EU was clear.  The ECB looked after price stability with a very strong mandate and the European Commission monitored national fiscal policy making against the parameter of the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP.  <br\/><br\/>There was also an instrument to co-ordinate economic policies beyond public finances, the so-called broad economic policies guidelines.  However, this instrument amounted to soft co-ordination with no enforcement power.  With benefit of hindsight, there is little consolation to be gained from the fact that not only Europe followed the great moderation paradigm in implementing monetary economic policy.  It is important to underline that, with very few exceptions, the economic profession at large relied on this paradigm.  <br\/><br\/>In the case of Ireland, how was the EU economic surveillance framework applied in this country in the years preceding the 2007 onset of the crisis?  I will start in 2000 for three reasons.  First,  the SGP entered into force only in the late 1990s.  Only since then can we speak of a functioning EU fiscal surveillance framework.  Second, the early 2000s coincided with the onset of the second and less healthy part of the catching up process in the Irish economy.  Third, in 2000, the Irish Government adopted a draft budget for 2001 which brought Ireland onto the Commission radar screen for the first time, signalling potential macroeconomic problems.  Against this backdrop of clear signs of overheating in the Irish economy, budget talk was expansionary and risked adding fuel to the fire.  On Wednesday, 24 January 2001, the Commission issued a critical opinion on the 2001-2003 stability programme.  It concluded the Irish fiscal policy was inconsistent with the broad economic policies guidelines adopted by the European Council six months earlier.  Those guidelines had asked Ireland to avoid further overheating of its economy by containing public expenditure.  In parallel to the critical opinion on the Irish problem, the Commission also recommended to the Council to ask the Irish Government under article 99(4) of the Maastricht treaty to take countervailing measures in the course of 2001.  The ECOFIN Council adopted the recommendation on Monday, 12 February 2001.As some of you may remember, the recommendation was not very well received in Ireland at the time and it was not implemented.  Many in the economic profession derided the Commission, accusing us of focusing more on decimals rather than acknowledging the strength of the Irish economy.<br\/><br\/>As guardian of the treaty, the Commission played its role well, based on the information available at the time.  There was a clear inconsistency between the Government's budgetary plans on the one hand and the economic policy guidance endorsed by the European Council on the other.  Picking up on this inconsistency, and within the existing surveillance framework, the Commission put in motion the relevant wheels and the Council followed.  At this point, I should stress that all EU surveillance documents, including the Commission technical assessment, the stability programmes updates, the Commission recommendation for a Council opinion and the Council opinion, are all available on the website of the DG.  <br\/><br\/>In retrospect, the assessment of whether the 2001 Council recommendation to Ireland was a good idea or not is less clear cut, even controversial.  As we know, the ICT bubble burst in the course of 2001, triggering a sharp economic slowdown in the US and Europe.  Ireland was also affected.  Quarterly GDP growth moved from more than 13% in question one of 2001 to almost stagnation in question four.  With the Irish economy cooling off so abruptly, the Council's call for a tighter budget to avoid overheating did not seem particularly appropriate any longer.  Later in 2001,  when the assessment of the 2002 budgets and stability programme updates were due, the Council reviewed its assessment.  On a<i><\/i>recommendation from the Commission, it issued an opinion that approved the budget plans of the Irish Government.  The Council still urged Ireland to aim for a neutral fiscal stance.  However, the assessment no longer raised any major issues.  The case of the 2001 recommendation under Article 99(4) of the treaty for Ireland was closed.  <br\/><br\/>At the time, the Commission was right in stressing the need to avoid a pro-cyclical fiscal expansion in a boom period, even if due to the unexpected burst of the ICT bubble the recommendation turned out to be ill-timed.  In the subsequent years, the Commission did not shy away from taking a critical view of Irish fiscal policy-making.  On the contrary, the annual technical assessments of the Commission of the successive stability programme updates regularly expressed concerns about strong Government expenditure growth and only moderate budgetary improvements in the face of a solid economic recovery.  In the years after 2001, Commission recommendations for a Council opinion on the Irish stability programmes consistently urged Ireland to strictly control public expenditure, including through the implementation of an effective expenditure framework.  The first such call was already included in the 2002 Council opinion, but did not fall on fertile ground in Ireland.  Helped by the growing influx of revenue from the housing boom, the Government successively increased expenditure and lowered taxes.<br\/><br\/>As the Government deficit remained below the Maastricht limit of 3% of GDP, the post-2001 Council opinions did not identify any formal conflict with existing EU fiscal rules.  At the same time, the Commission assessment did indicate a few points which, with the benefit of hindsight, turned out to be crucial.  For instance, the Commission regularly stressed the uncertainty surrounding estimates of the structural budget balance for the Irish economy - that is, the budget balance net of temporary components.  After 2002, the Commission noted several times that the Irish Government's targets for the general government budget balance may not have been particularly ambitious in view of the very solid recovery of economic growth.  Underlying this message was the sense that the structural fiscal position was weaker than the official estimate suggested, but there was no way to substantiate this view.  The method agreed by the ECOFIN Council in 2002 to estimate the structural budget balance for the purposes of EU fiscal surveillance did not signal any specific problem for Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The second point the Commission underlined clearly in its post 2001 assessments was the strong contribution of construction to economic growth.  In its 2005 assessment of update of the  Irish stability programme, the Commission identified the very high valuation of existing housing stock and a possible sharp downturn from the extended residential construction boom as a downside risk to the economy and public finances.  A year later, the Commission's assessment of the 2006 update explicitly referred to unsustainable levels of residential construction.  Together with very high residential property prices, the construction boom was thought to carry the risk of a sharp downward adjustment in the wider economy.<br\/><br\/>Then again, the identification of risks linked to the construction boom did not translate into concrete surveillance actions.  The EU economic surveillance framework at the time was centred on public finances and Ireland complied with existing rules.  I am not trying to argue that the Commission saw everything coming, but could not do anything.  What I am trying to say, however, is that the Commission did, within its remit, pinpoint issues which in retrospect turned out to be important, but then, even if we had anticipated the end of the economic boom and the beginning of a collapse in Ireland before 2007, we would not have had the legal tools for asking Ireland to take any corrective measures.<\/p><p>However, the lack of legal instruments was not the real constraint for EU surveillance.  The real constraint was our limited understanding at the time of what could really endanger overall macroeconomic stability.  Yes, we understood that the Irish housing boom would not be sustainable, but in line with the great moderation paradigm, we, as others, did not anticipate that the end of the housing boom could give rise to the dislocations that eventually emerged after 2007 which later led Ireland to ask for financial assistance from the EU and the IMF.  The financial sector was thought to simply channel funds in an efficient manner to where the real economy needed them.  Dangerous excesses were thought to originate only in monetary and fiscal policy making.  This is evidenced by the fact that between 2001 and 2007 no Commission assessment of the Irish stability programme updates reviewed developments in the banking sector.  Assessment of financial stability was not part of the broad economic policy guidelines process.  Financial stability risks were mainly thought to be an issue for individual banks, not for the economy as a whole.  Moreover, financial supervision was a national prerogative.  My colleague Mr. Mario Nava, who came before the committee earlier this month, clarified this point.  He stated that in the 2000s the EU regulatory framework followed a principle-based approach that was embodied in the principle of minimum harmonisation.  National supervisory authorities were responsible for applying and enforcing the minimum prudential requirements set out in EU directives.  We worked under the assumption that national supervisors and regulators would be well equipped to address any nascent stability issues in the banking sector.  We assumed they would do their job in a conscientious manner.  <\/p><p>  The post-2007 financial and economic crisis showed us the hard way that our conceptual framework of the macro economy was incomplete.  Ireland was a particularly drastic example, albeit not the only one.  The sudden drop in residential house prices undermined the viability of most Irish banks and exposed a striking lack of supervisory and regulatory rigour.  The Government had to step in with its deep pockets to stave off the collapse of the financial sector and the economy as a whole.  Later, the Government's pockets had to be filled with international financial assistance as access to financial markets at sustainable rates had been lost.  The rest is now history.  At the end of 2013, Ireland successfully completed the EU-IMF financial assistance programme.  While important challenges remain, the country is back on track towards balanced and sustainable growth.  <\/p><p>  As regards EU economic surveillance, the post-2007 financial and economic crisis has not been wasted.  As you are aware, the EU immediately launched an important and far-reaching reform process to upgrade and complete its economic governance structure.  First, the EU surveillance framework has been strengthened with the so-called six-pack.  Secondly, the scope of EU surveillance has been extended to include all relevant instruments beyond public finances; this was achieved with the introduction of the macroeconomic imbalances procedure.  This was also part of the six-pack initiative.  Since 2001 the Commission has consistently monitored member states with imbalances in all areas of the macro economy.  Third, the banking union was introduced, including in particular the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism.<\/p><p>  It would go beyond the scope of my intervention today to go through the details of all these institutional innovations and what they meant for EU economic governance.  My colleague Mario Nava outlined the regulatory response at the EU level to the crisis.  It may suffice to say that they constitute a major step forward.  I am convinced they will help us not to repeat the mistakes of the past.  I apologise for the length of my statement.

First, what changed between 2001 and 2002?  The main element that changed was that the ICT bubble struck the global economy.<\/p><p>So there was a very rapid downturn in the global and European economies.  In the case of Ireland, much of the healthy growth which occurred during the Celtic tiger period was based on ICT and high-innovation products and this was the reason for its wealth.  There was a collapse in growth between 2001 and 2002.  The kind of criticism that was directed towards the budget prior to the unexpected collapse in the ICT economy seemed less appropriate <i>ex post facto<\/i>because the economy had, in a sense, collapsed on its own.  That is why in 2002 we did not repeat the criticism we offered in 2001.<br\/><br\/>The second point is that unlike the position now, the degree of generality relating to the recommendations was quite high during the period in question.  We basically said that countervailing measures should be taken.  However, we did not stipulate which measures should be taken.  The issue of subsidiarity is important and our recommendations remained at quite a high level of generality.  The issue on which we place a great deal of emphasis now, namely, the quality and composition of public finances, on both the spending and revenue sides, were not the focus of attention at that time to which I refer.  We did not, therefore, go into the kind of specifics to which the Deputy referred.<br\/><br\/>On the Deputy's final point, estimating the structural surplus is particularly difficult.  We know it is an unobservable variable.  In retrospect, Ireland's budgetary position at the time was less solid than we believed.  This was the case for two reasons.  First, at the beginning of the last decade we were, like many others, anticipating the growth of the Irish economy to remain high during the following few years.  The potential rate of growth was, therefore, considered to be very high.  Second, at the time there was what economists refer to as very high tax elasticity.  The budget was improving as a result of high tax revenue but, essentially, this was linked to the property and housing market.  In retrospect, with more normal elasticity and a sustainable growth rate that was not artificially fuelled by activity in the property market, things would have been different.  However, budgetary conditions at the time were less healthy than we thought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#L02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Marco Buti","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Buti.

In 2006 we proposed that the output gaps working group focus on this and address the soundness of the methodology used to estimate the structural balance.  We brought in the OECD to reassess the position regarding tax elasticity and eventually, in 2007 and 2008, the methodologies were changed.  However, that was after the collapse.  We were not ignorant of that matter and we had already started the work relating to it.  We do not want methodologies to be imposed by the Commission on the member states on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, we want to use analytical tools which are commonly shared among and supported by all member states.

I am happy to provide them with my thoughts on the role played by the IMF in its relationship with the Irish authorities in the years prior to our economic and financial collapse.<br\/><br\/>I should mention that my observations are offered in a personal capacity.  As members of the committee may know, it is relatively rare for IMF staff to be assigned to work in their own countries.  I was not involved in the work on Ireland during my IMF career which spanned almost three decades.  My thoughts are based on a detailed evaluation of the extensive documentation published by the IMF on Ireland in the build-up to the crisis, viewed in the light of my own experience with the preparation of similar documents for many other countries.<br\/><br\/>The independent evaluation office of the IMF, which, as its name implies, is an independent outfit and usually staffed by external persons, is currently undertaking an extensive assessment and investigation into the role of the IMF <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the euro area in the years both prior to the crisis and during the crisis itself, with special focus on the experiences relating to Ireland, Greece and Portugal.  Since I have been asked to work on this project, I thought I should mention it in passing.<br\/><br\/>By way of background, it may be useful to explain briefly some elements of the IMF's surveillance process over its members.  Normally a team from the IMF visits each country for a period of about two weeks each year to discuss the economic situation and outlook and to review and assess the authorities' policies.  A report is then prepared, called the Article IV consultation report, which is subsequently discussed by the IMF's executive board on which all countries, including Ireland, are represented.  The report is prepared by the staff, not under the direction of the executive board.  The report, together with a shorter document called the executive board assessment, is then published.  This report is not subject to review or approval-clearance by the country authorities prior to issuance, except for checking for factual inaccuracies.  Before being published, authorities may request deletion of what is called market sensitive information.  However, this aspect is interpreted rather narrowly and would not, for example, cover deletions of IMF views that might be quite critical of a country's policies.<br\/><br\/>Between 2000 and 2010, with the exception of 2008, an important point which I will come back to later, consultations took place annually with the Irish authorities.  In addition, in 2006 as part of the financial sector assessment process, FSAP, a separate specialised report was prepared and published on the state of Ireland's financial sector, and this report was discussed alongside the normal Article IV report.<br\/><br\/>In assessing all of this material, I believe it is helpful to distinguish between the period 2000 to 2007, that is, before the crisis broke, and the 2008 to 2010 period when the crisis began to emerge in full force and the content of the discussions was substantively very different.  As an overall comment on 2000 to 2007 period, I think it is widely accepted, and it would be my personal view, that the IMF's surveillance process failed in Ireland.\u00a0 Although, as I will discuss, some vulnerabilities were noted, the assessments by the IMF staff gave no inkling that a major disaster could be in the making.  Adjectives such as &quot;exceptional&quot;, &quot;remarkable&quot; and &quot; highly impressive&quot; were used throughout the first seven years of the decade to describe Ireland's overall economic performance.<br\/><br\/>Such overly positive assessments by the IMF were not confined to the case of Ireland and there is no doubt that the organisation did not see warning signals in many industrial countries in the build-up to the global crisis.  However, the extent to which a country's economic and financial situation deteriorated so sharply and dramatically with minimal prior anticipation by the IMF, that is, in the Irish case, was to my knowledge probably unprecedented in the history of IMF surveillance.  To help understand why such a major misreading occurred, four key areas covered by the consultation reports for Ireland need consideration: the properly market, the financial sector, the budget, and the macroeconomic linkages between these sectors.<br\/><br\/>First, in the case of the property market, in view of what ultimately transpired, it should be noted that the IMF staff did devote considerable attention to the residential property market.  Key indicators, such as the movement in prices relative to rents, the increasing proportion of buy-to-let investors, the historical evidence from other countries' experiences over long periods, and the distorting role of the fiscal incentive regime applicable to property, were all highlighted repeatedly.  The thrust of the staff view was that for most of the 2000 to 2007 period, house prices were somewhat overvalued and a speculative element was increasingly present.<br\/><br\/>Until around 2007, the Irish authorities did not accept the IMF's assessment, arguing that so-called fundamental factors such as the continued rapid increase in personal incomes given Ireland's high growth prospects, inward migration that would boost housing demand, prospective low and stable interest rates, and prevailing low levels of household debt justified the price surges that had occurred.  It appears that, in essence, the IMF staff and Irish officials implicitly agreed to differ over this question.  In addition, IMF staff had consistently urged from the beginning of the decade the introduction of a property tax and a reduction in mortgage interest relief to help counter a strong pro-house ownership bias.  However, in quite candid exchanges in 2004 and 2006, Irish officials, as quoted in the staff reports, referred to &quot;political, like insurmountable difficulties&quot; associated with taking action on these fronts.<br\/><br\/>Although the message of likely property overvaluation was cited throughout, the IMF staff did not go so far as to suggest the existence of a possible bubble and did not speculate on the size or timing of a possible drop in prices.  However, in 2007, the staff report explicitly endorsed the authorities', that is, the Central Bank of Ireland's, view that a soft landing was the most likely outcome.  The CBI's judgment was rightly described later by the Honohan report - I should mention again, as the Chairman did, that I was a member of the Honohan inquiry team - as a &quot;triumph of hope over reality&quot;.  This cautious stance by the IMF may have been due to several factors, some of which may have operated subconsciously: difficulties in challenging definitively the Irish authorities' fundamentals argument; a fear of being seen to cry wolf too often, since the overvaluation thesis had been raised every year since the start of the decade; and also, perhaps, concerns about adverse market and perhaps public-political reactions.<br\/><br\/>Finally, a\u00a0major weakness of the IMF's analysis was the neglect of the commercial property market.  This aspect was not really dealt with in the CBI's financial stability reports either.<\/p><p>However, it turned out to be a crucial, perhaps the most crucial, element explaining the extent of the banks' later losses.  My own jointly authored book on the Irish crisis with Professor Antoin E. Murphy, to which the Chairman kindly referred, pointed out that the surge in lending to developers was actually substantially greater than that to householders, especially when lending by foreign subsidiaries was included, and this latter category of lending was highly significant when, in the end, the bill came to be presented to Irish taxpayers.  As an eminent scholar of financial crises, Charles Goodhart, once pointed out, &quot;Banks are international in life, but are national in death&quot;.  When the bill has to be paid, everything comes home to the country where the bank is located.<br\/><br\/>The second area is the state of the banks.  Analysis of the financial sector always featured in the IMF reports but was given much more intensive attention during the 2006 FSAP update exercise.  This involved a team of financial sector specialists undertaking a separate, more in-depth, look at the state of the Irish banks.  Somewhat sad to say, their overall assessment was reassuring, if not indeed rosy.  While, as with the property market, vulnerabilities were mentioned, the typical message was that the outlook for the financial sector was positive and that banking sector profitability and capitalisation were strong.  The was no hint given as to the possible occurrence of a major problem, let alone of the potential for the crisis that eventually unfolded.  As Governor Honohan has rightly stressed in his report and elsewhere, this clean bill of health from the IMF came at a particularly inappropriate time as it undermined whatever concerns might have been voiced internally.<br\/><br\/>Why did the IMF team get things so badly wrong?  There are several explanations.  First, the analysis was grounded largely on acceptance of the CBI view favouring the\u00a0soft landing outcome for house prices.  While some stress tests involved larger price falls, the possible rise in non-performing loans, NPLs, was, it appears, capped at 5% of all mortgage loans.  Second, the neglect of commercial property lending was a crucial omission,  Third, while the increased dependency on wholesale external funding by the banks was noted, no one considered what might be the catastrophic effect of a worldwide drying up of liquidity as actually occurred in 2008.  Finally, the IMF team appeared to have had no inkling of the indecisiveness and lack of firm engagement underlying the detailed interaction between the Financial Regulator and key individual institutions, problems that were uncovered only much later by the Honohan inquiry.<br\/><br\/>These were serious shortcomings to which can be added the general approach at the time that favoured so-called principles-based, what is sometimes called light touch, financial regulation.  The IMF, being a creature of its member countries, was undoubtedly heavily influenced by this prevailing philosophy.  That said, in my view, it would have been incumbent on the FSAP report, as a minimum, to have posted a health warning and cited more explicitly the limitations that underlay the positive conclusions it presented.  The Irish experience suggests that the absence of such warnings can seriously undermine the credibility of the IMF's work.<br\/><br\/>The third area is the budget.  The last major area covered by the consultation reports was the budget.  Until 2008, Ireland had been running small overall budget surpluses.  However, the IMF staff generally urged that these surpluses be increased somewhat, both to counteract what was thought to be overheating, often described as using contra-cyclical policies, and to build up a reserve against future unknowns.  By and large this recommendation fell on deaf ears.<br\/><br\/>A far more serious shortcoming in my view was the conclusion by the IMF up to and including 2007 that the underlying, that is, cyclically adjusted, fiscal balance, CAB, was in approximate balance throughout 2007.  This CAB measure attempts to strip out so called temporary factors, such as higher than average growth or transitory revenue flows, that mask the true underlying fiscal picture.  In Ireland's case, the IMF, together with the Department of Finance, went along with a common EU methodology used to calculate the CAB.<br\/><br\/>The problem was that this methodology assumed that the high output levels reached by Ireland in the first half of the decade of the 2000s, which in turn reflected the massive reliance on the construction sector, were permanent structural features.  The same assumption applied to the artificial boost in revenues associated with the property boom.  Using more technical phraseology, it was assumed that actual output was close to potential output, but the reality was the other way around.  Irish output throughout the latter years of the boom was far above sustainable potential.  After all, as was pointed out by very few at the time, there was a limit to how many homes people can actually live in.  By 2009, the assumptions underlying the earlier IMF calculation of the CAB were clearly untenable.  In a quite dramatic reversal, the 2009 IMF report re-estimated the CAB for earlier years using a quite different methodology.  For example, the CAB for 2007 turned out to be a deficit of 8.7% of GDP compared with an originally estimated surplus of 0.7%, a change of more than nine percentage points in GDP for the same year.  Seldom has the picture of a country's fiscal health deteriorated so sharply and so quickly.  The question can be asked if, starting from 2009, a far more appropriate methodology was used, why this was not done in earlier years or at least presented as a variant of the standard approach that had been uncritically accepted.<br\/><br\/>The last area concerns the overall macroeconomic interlinkages.  The various IMF reports did point out to some extent the vulnerabilities associated with particular sectors, that is, property, financial and fiscal, but they explore the dynamics of a possible downward self-reinforcing spiral such as eventually ended up happening.  At best, some first round effects were considered.  While precise quantification of a worst case scenario would have been very difficult, some key elements could have been addressed more explicitly.  It is possible that the IMF reports did not go down this route because of the somewhat speculative nature of what was involved.  It would likely also have been seen as highly alarmist, and provoked strong negative market and, one assumes, political and media reaction.  Nevertheless, that complication could have been dealt with by raising the issues confidentially with the Irish authorities as opposed to including a discussion in the published staff report.  However, there is no evidence available indicating that such discussions occurred.  There could have been pressures both within the IMF and<i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the Irish authorities to dismiss the possibility of such very negative outcomes.  The consensus, reflecting perhaps strong elements of groupthink, was to stay with the soft landing hypothesis and to hope that perhaps, in the end, our luck would hold out.<br\/><br\/>I will turn briefly to the second period, 2008 to 2010, when, of course, things were quite different.  The 2007 report was the last rosy IMF report on Ireland.  By the time of the 2009 consultation two years later, the picture had changed dramatically.  The property market was in free fall, the budget deficit had exploded, unemployment was soaring and the full extent of the banking disaster was starting to emerge.  However, no consultation took place in 2008.  Normally, the consultation would have taken place as scheduled, unless the authorities indicated a desire to postpone it.  The reasons underlying this hiatus are not in the public domain.  The postponement meant that during this critical two-year period, from mid-2007 to mid-2009, there was no formal dialogue between the IMF and the Irish authorities.  This must be considered a significant flaw.  If IMF surveillance is to be meaningful, there should be at least the opportunity for timely inputs from the IMF at a time when, amidst global financial disarray, many key policy options were being considered on the Irish side.<br\/><br\/>In particular, there are no indications, at least on the public record, suggesting that the IMF staff provided input on the end of September 2008 bank guarantee, either before this decision was taken or afterwards.  The 2009 consultation report described the guarantee but did not offer any views as to its appropriateness or otherwise.  It did, however, contain a useful table summarising the key features of guarantees provided by various other countries during the past 30 years.  This table is summarised as part of chapter 10 on page 214 of the book Dr. Murphy and I wrote.  The chapter deals extensively with the guarantee decision.  Perhaps contrary to what is sometimes said, it appears from this table that the coverage of the Irish guarantee was not that radically different from that contained in several other earlier guarantees.<br\/><br\/>Overall, it seems that around this critical time, the IMF did not provide sufficient timely professional technical advice to the Irish authorities.  Whether this was primarily a supply side issue, perhaps because the IMF was busy elsewhere, or reflected demand side factors, because perhaps the authorities preferred not to hold the consultation in 2008, remains an important question to which I do not have the answer.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Chairman and committee members for their attention.  I am, of course, very happy to answer any questions they may have on the foregoing or on any other related aspects covered in our book or elsewhere.  I received a list of possible questions that committee members may raise and I am certainly happy to do my best to try to answer them as far as I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#S00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Donovan.

The IMF was set up in 1945, following the so-called Bretton Woods Conference, to try to avoid, collectively, the bad policies that had occurred in 1930s.  By now, nearly all countries in the world are members of it.<\/p> <p>  The IMF has two main functions.  One is to lend money to countries that enter into crisis situations and that require bailouts, which we have seen recently.  This function has been around for 50 years.  It lent mainly to low-income countries, emerging market economies.  Before Iceland in 2010, the IMF had not lent to an industrial country for 30 years.  The last one was the UK in 1977, but now it is different.  <\/p> <p>  The second function it has, which is what we are talking about today or what I mentioned in my statement, is that it is supposed to exercise surveillance, that is, discuss, analyse and offer policy recommendations, which may or may not be accepted, to member countries, which are then discussed collectively by the IMF board, as I mentioned.<\/p> <p>  It is possibly the case that the IMF has been more successful in the first activity, which one could call picking up the pieces, than it has been in the second activity in the area of crisis forewarning and prevention.  The record would show over several decades that despite many efforts that has not been terribly successful, and the euro crisis would be a good case in point.  <\/p> <p>  The IMF is funded by all the member countries, and the Chairman asked about this.  It is like a credit union.  Everyone puts in a certain amount of money and that amount of money is calculated; it is basically related to the size of the country in the world economy.  There is a total pool of, say, 100, and everyone's contributions are calculated as a percent in regard to their relative size in the world economy.  That determines what money they put in, and it also determines the voting power of countries within the IMF.  For example, the US is the largest shareholder.  It has about 16% of the votes.  It puts in 16 cent on every dollar and it has, more or less, its exact equivalent in having 16% of the votes.  I do not have the exact figure for Ireland but it is quite small.  It has perhaps 0.2% of the votes and puts in 0.2% of the money.  I hope that is helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I wish to ask about two matters arising from Dr. Donovan's statement.

The basis for conditionality is that in order for the IMF to have such assurances that such funds will be repaid, it needs to be confident that the government is undertaking measures to reform, change and alter the policies that got itself into the problem in the first place.  This is the basis of conditionality which has been there since 1950.<\/p> <p>  The IMF has always applied this approach in its lending activities.  The groups of countries to which it lent have varied somewhat over time.  There was some lending to industrial countries in first few decades of the IMF ending in the mid-1970s.

They were rightly or wrongly - and one could debate this at some length - aimed at modifying policies that had been followed in quite a number of countries, which were - let us call them - relatively regulated policies, that is to say, relatively closed exchange and trade systems, an emphasis on import substitution, an emphasis on statement enterprises, an emphasis on wage and price controls and discouragement of private banking activities.  Rightly or wrongly, around the 1970s and 1980s, many countries and many in the IMF and the World Bank felt that these policies had not been successful and had not led to economic improvements in these countries.  The agenda - I agree with the Deputy's characterisation - was to try to change these policies.  These were politically sensitive; they were politically difficult.  Whether they worked well or not is a matter for debate, but I suggest one important point is that there has been one group of countries - it missed all of the terrible mess we have had over the past ten years - which has performed very well and whose economic growth performances overall has been remarkably positive.  Those are the African countries over the past 15 years.  Many would argue, again rightly or wrongly, that the policy changes they began to implement in 1980s and 1990s were finally bearing fruit and having a positive effect and that this contributed to what has been, which would be agreed by most observers, a surprisingly positive and sustained improvement in Africa's economic performance not just in terms of overall growth, but also in terms of reducing poverty.<\/p><p>Of course there is still poverty in Africa but on a wider range of indicators, the results could be regarded as quite positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#U01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Obviously, I cannot debate the issue with Dr. Donovan but given the horrific poverty and breakdown in Africa, some people would not agree with his assessment.

The IMF, being a creature of its member countries, was undoubtedly heavily influenced by this prevailing philosophy.<\/blockquote>Could it be that the explanation for the failure of the IMF to identify what was going on in Ireland, in reality, and the use of the adjectives &quot;exceptional&quot;, &quot;remarkable&quot; and &quot;highly impressive&quot; were used during the bubble because the financial deregulation, privatisation and free reign given to major financial institutions in Ireland in fact made the country the star pupil of the IMF policy and the policies of the dominant countries within the IMF?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#V01000","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424217600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I am not sure I would quite go as far in that direction.

Here is a key point, and I think I share the Deputy's view, that this provided a false picture of the strength of the Irish economy because we were seeing these growth rates of 5%, 6% or whatever per cent in the first half of the decade that were not based on underlying export growth as they had been in the years prior to the millennium - the true period of the Celtic tiger perhaps.  These growth rates were heavily based on construction - on a construction boom and on a construction bubble.  In that sense, the rosy picture of the IMF, painted by the IMF which said the economy seems to booming along, continuing to grow and still among the highest growth rates in Europe, if not highest, I agree with the Deputy that that in itself was based on a lack of appreciation of the property bubble nature of this.  Then one can say that the property bubble nature of this was in turn a good part influenced by the approach to financial regulation.  In making those connections, yes, the rosy picture was linked indirectly but definitely to the deregulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#V01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Following on from the bubble and the inevitable crash, Global Exchange, which I mentioned earlier, alleges, first, that in regard to the IMF approach to the peso crisis in Mexico in the mid-1990s, and to the Asian countries, \"...the IMF required governments to assume the bad debts of private banks, thus making the public pay the costs and draining yet more resources away from social programs\".<\/p><p>Does Dr. Donovan agree with that?<\/p><p> Second, if the IMF therefore could be held responsible for encouraging moral hazard on behalf of the major international financial institutions by having them realise that they could be bailed out if they go over into a crisis, would it take any responsibility, some responsibility or none for this situation, the risks that were taken and the type of speculation that was allowed to develop of which witnesses like Professor Black here have evidence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#V01200","speaker":"954","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424217600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>On the first point, and I would have to recall the precise details, the solutions to the Mexico debt crisis and the solutions to the East Asian debt crisis did involve restructuring, reorganisation and alleviation of the debts in question.  The Deputy is right.  It was not simply a question of \"Let's wipe out all these debts\" but the programmes, particularly in Mexico I recall, did involve a substantial write-down by creditors of the claims they had on Mexico.  This was known, if I recall correctly, as the Brady plan.  It would be overly simplistic for an author to say it was straightforward that the IMF required the Governments to assume all of these debts.  There were quite a lot of bankruptcies and private sector write-downs.<\/p> <p>  The second point is a very interesting one and it is something the IMF and its executive board has grappled with over many years.  There is a potential moral hazard problem if countries believe that if they get into trouble, the IMF will come along to help.  I am not saying they would welcome that because, after all, there is political stigma and huge political costs associated with being associated with the bailout, but the more important point is that private lenders feel that if they get into trouble, the IMF will come along and bail them out.  This can create moral hazard, and can cause riskier and inappropriate decisions to be taken by private lenders.<\/p> <p>  This has been wrestled with over several decades.  It is not an easy problem.  The IMF would wish to try to provide money to countries that are in trouble but the taxpayers in IMF countries do not want to see this money disappearing back out the door to private lenders who should have adopted a less risky policy.<\/p> <p>  I know this might come up a little later, Chairman, but it is interesting that in the euro debt crisis it is fairly well known that the IMF was quite keen at an earlier stage for some write-down of debt by Greece to be included as a critical part of the Greek programme, and this occurred in 2011 to 2012.  It is also no secret that in the discussions on the Irish bailout the IMF, at least the IMF mission here in Dublin, explored quite a bit the possibility of some limited burning of senior unguaranteed bondholders.<\/p> <p>  The IMF has generally not been opposed to debt write-downs as a matter of principle.  There are costs and benefits, but it does not have a philosophical objection to that.  It approaches the issue in a pragmatic way and would tend, in my experience, to take the view that if a debt is unsustainable and some restructuring write-downs are needed, then it is better to do that earlier rather than later because if it ends up being done later there are a lot of costs involved in the meantime.  It is a more nuanced approach to the handling of debt issues on the part of the IMF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I will call Deputy Higgins again as we wrap up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#W00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Donovan.

If the Deputy looks at the reports, there was an urging by the fund staff that the Government should do a bit more.  At that stage it was put more in terms of a higher surplus or a lower deficit - one and a half percentage point of GDP or something like that.  More important was the collective failure to understand the underlying nature of Ireland's fiscal position, and this is the so-called cyclically-adjusted balance, the CAB.  As far as one can tell, the IMF accepted unquestioningly the Department of Finance methodology, which in turn was based on the common EU methodology.<\/p> <p>  I am not saying I would have done this but I do suggest that it would have been appropriate analytically for the IMF to say, \"Okay, that is what you do, that is what the EU does\", and explain what it does and does not imply.  The assumptions underling that approach are key and turned out to be flawed but let us change these assumptions and have another look at what the underlying fiscal balance of Ireland might look like in that situation, and it would probably have uncovered that the deficit was quite different.  Whether this would have spurred action by the authorities is another matter.<\/p> <p>  On the financial sector, and looking at the banks, I suggest again some reasons.  There were constraints.  There were constraints of people.  What Professor Honohan and his inquiry did to uncover the true story of what had happened in bank lending took four months of highly intensive work by a small team of specialised people.  One cannot expect the IMF team coming to Dublin or to any country in two weeks to get even remotely into that kind of thing, so I am not sure it could have done more.  <\/p> <p>  I do think it should have been more cautious in its assessments.  It should not have accepted uncritically the soft landing hypothesis.  It should have said, \"This might happen but where is the evidence on the CBI's part that this is going to be a soft landing?\", and there was not evidence in the 2007 report, as I am sure all the members are aware.

Our book refers to the table in the IMF report.  It has far more detail and I am happy to provide the reference in the original report, which is on the public record.  The Irish guarantee was certainly the most comprehensive in the sense that it included subordinated debt.  I can come back and talk about that if people wish.  None of the guarantees referred to in the IMF included subordinated debt.  There is an issue there, of course.<br\/><br\/>The coverage in terms of bonds and senior debt was not that dissimilar - I have chosen these words advisedly - to that contained in many other guarantees.  I cannot say it was exactly precise because one would have to look at all the legal documents.  <i>Ex post<\/i>, it is probably true that the cost of the guarantee, either the <i>ex ante<\/i>cost of &euro;400 billion covered or the <i>ex post<\/i>cost in terms of the &euro;64 billion or &euro;40 billion or whatever the number, was well up there among the highest.  I think there are a couple of cases, perhaps Indonesia, where it was pretty high too.  I cannot make an exact comparison.<br\/><br\/>The guarantee is of course very controversial.  We examined it for our book and we discuss it at some length.  We took the approach that was important to ask if the guarantee was very bad and such a disastrous decision at the time then what other alternatives were available and would they or might they have led to a better outcome.  The analysis of this question starts with the proposition that, for good or bad, there was a major agreement among Ireland, Europe and elsewhere that no bank should be allowed to fail in Ireland, for good or bad.  I will come back to that again on the question of Anglo Irish Bank, which was the last question that the Deputy raised.<br\/><br\/>The second key point was that Europe, in the form of the ECB, we assume, had made it quite clear to the Irish authorities in the days before the guarantee the previous week that there was no pan-European solution coming, and that every government, be it in Ireland or elsewhere, had to do whatever it took and whatever was needed to solve its problem.  Given those two constraints - they may not be good constraints and they may not be right, but they were constraints - we have looked carefully at other alternatives.  We looked at the alternatives of delaying, doing nothing, waiting a week, ELA, nationalising Anglo Irish Bank and excluding deposits.  When we go through each of these - I am happy to spend as long as people are interested going through them, but I know there are time constraints - it is difficult to conclude, in our view, that either of them would have led to a materially different outcome at the end of the day, unless one assumes that senior bondholders were going to be burned.<\/p><p>Whichever way one looks at the analysis, one comes back to the same point.  Are we going to burn senior bondholders?  For example, it has been argued that only new debt should have been guaranteed and that existing debt need not have been guaranteed.  That is true but it would only have made a difference if, at the end of the day when that existing debt fell due, someone concluded that we were not going to pay it or pay only part of it.  In other words, we come back to the burning of the bondholders.  Otherwise we would have had to give another guarantee to get the debt rolled over or we would have just paid it, which is what we ended up doing and is where the &euro;64 billion came from.  That is the fundamental proposition and, to put this as neutrally as possible, the record of the following four years showed that, for good or bad, the European position was that there was to be no burning of senior bondholders.  I am not suggesting that was the right view but it was the view and it did not change.  It did not change at the time of the Irish bailout in November 2010 nor in March 2011 and, indeed, it was supported by the United States at the time, as we all know.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#X03300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I will need you to wrap up because I will bring Deputy O'Donnell back in at the end of this session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#Y00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424217600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>At some stage, Chairman, I would like to come back to the Anglo Irish Bank liquidation issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>This is my last point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#Y00400","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Can we deal with Anglo Irish Bank very quickly and then Deputy O'Donnell's last question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#Y00500","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424217600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>This is quite important.  Yes, the option was to discard the hypothesis that no bank should fail and to allow Anglo Irish Bank to fail - a disorderly liquidation.  Of course, nobody knew or believed that Anglo Irish Bank's situation was as bad as it turned out to be at the time.  There would have been no particular reason, therefore, to have allowed Anglo Irish Bank to fail because by definition and by assumption it was only facing a liquidity problem.  Why would we have closed the door?  I believe that the costs if, for whatever reason, Anglo Irish Bank had been liquidated would have been very substantial.  I do not want to waste time repeating this but the Honohan report on pages 131 and 132 paints a very striking picture of the huge economic and social costs and disruption if there had been a disorderly closure of Anglo Irish Bank that night or the following morning, both directly and internationally and for other banks and so on.<\/p> <p>  Who knows what those costs would have been or how big they would have been.  I think the case is made, however, and I would make the statement, based on my own experiences with other countries where there have been bank runs and disorderly bank failures, that the costs would have been substantial and they could not have been minimised.  Whether they would have been as great as the cost of the &euro;30 billion or &euro;40 billion associated with the bank guarantee is, of course, something that only history can tell.  Faced with the possibility of the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank that night if nothing were done, I do not think allowing Anglo Irish Bank to have collapsed would have been the right thing to do and I think it is unlikely that any government would have done that.  Many academics and commentators have subsequently suggested what the Government should have done.  In my view, people who lead a Government have to be risk averse.  They cannot try various courses of action.  If it does not work, the academics will be okay, but if one is the leader of a country that is in the middle of a crisis, one has to do things that will not lead to a catastrophe the following morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#Y00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Dr. Donovan is significantly over time.

She would have been my boss if I was still there.  She is also chairperson of the executive board of the IMF.  She has two roles.  In her capacity as executive board chairperson she takes into account the prevailing broad view of member countries - all of the board members but probably some a little bit more than others, depending on the country.  Her job is to approve the negotiating mandate for a team that would come to Ireland.  She does that in her capacity as head of the staff.  People cannot leave Washington unless there is an agreed position.  She takes into account what she thinks the broad feeling of the board would be.  It is through that process that decisions are made.  The views of contributing member countries are definitely taken into account.  If, for example, after negotiations, the staff come back with an agreement, it will not be a complete agreement unless and until it is signed off by the executive board of the IMF.  The board will discuss the proposal to lend the money and the conditions attaching to the loan.  There can often be substantial disagreements among members of the board.  Some countries may wish for tougher conditions, others may think that the conditions are not tough enough, and so on.  In controversial cases there can be extensive debates.  At the end of the day the staff proposal is approved or not, and it is usually approved.  The views of the board will definitely be taken into account the next time the staff have discussions.

I will put it like this: we had a strong case for it.  We did not get that because of opposition from the European Central Bank, which feared systemic consequences, and more importantly from the United States, the intervention of which is described vividly by the former Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Geithner, in a page of his book.<\/p> <p>  That being said, and this is quite important, the magnitude of the failure to get something done on the senior unguaranteed bondholders has been exaggerated, in my view.  There was approximately &euro;20 billion of those out there.  Perhaps &euro;18 billion is the figure.  I have seen reports that have estimated that one third of that was owned by Irish institutions - credit unions, pension funds and investment funds, etc.  If one is talking about the net savings that might have accrued to Irish taxpayers, one has to take that out because the burning of these people would have been the burning of Irish people.  Maybe &euro;10 billion or &euro;11 billion would have been left at that point.  If we had decided to apply a 50% burning rate, on the basis that it was half our fault and half the bondholders' fault, we would have saved approximately &euro;6 billion.<\/p> <p>  One could get to that number in a different way.  If I recall correctly, Governor Honohan did so in his testimony.  We could have decided not to burn any bonds held by Bank of Ireland or AIB because they were still in the market, their reputation was important and they were hoping to go back into the market at some stage.  We could have decided to leave them untouched while burning 100% of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society bonds that were eligible for burning.  It so happens that this produces approximately the same figure - approximately &euro;6 billion - that was mentioned by Governor Honohan, if I am recalling what he said correctly.  I stress I am in no sense suggesting that &euro;6 billion is not an important number.  Of course it is very important, but we have to remember that it is not &euro;64 billion or &euro;270 billion.  The amount of money that could or arguably should have been saved is &euro;6 billion.  My personal view is that to hang the whole cost to the taxpayer of the banking crisis on this particular non-event - the veto, if one would like to call it that - is to exaggerate its importance in the greater order of things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#Z01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Michael McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#Z01300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Donovan.

It was on Friday 26 November that the Troika staff told Brian in categorical terms that burning the bondholders would mean no programme and, accordingly, could not be countenanced.

I do not know if anything new will emerge.<\/p> <p>  I used to think an inquiry was not necessary.  This was my view after having worked on the Honohan and Nyberg investigations.  However, over the past two or three years, I have come to the opposite view.  An inquiry can be very helpful.  Why?  There are three reasons.  There are many people who think there is a conspiracy which is waiting to be uncovered, that there are some dark secrets and a true story of what really happened and that if we had an inquiry we would uncover this.  My personal view is that this is unlikely.  People, however, need to see that this is the case.  They need to be aware that there were catastrophic policy failures, to see it for themselves and to be made aware of it.  Not everyone, in fact most people, will not have read the Honohan and Nyberg reports.  I am sure very few people will have read our book.  This is the first reason. <\/p> <p>  The second reason is that it is important that the individuals concerned who have, by and large, not appeared on the public record do so, and come and explain what they did.  I expect many of them will acknowledge very serious mistakes.  It is, again, important for public confidence that this happens.  It is a cathartic effect but it is an important one to enable us to get over this whole thing.  <\/p> <p>  The third thing is more of a suggestion.  I think I made it in one of my media contributions.  In addition to going back over what happened, which is necessary, it would be important if the inquiry in its conclusions addressed the question of what needs to be done to avoid a similar repetition in the future.  We all know about lending and property bubbles and banks not being regulated.  We all know this and this will be watched.  However, there was something deeper, in my view, happening at the time.  There was a failure of the economic policy making process.  This involves Government institutions.  Risk analysis was not undertaken.  Scenarios that were central were too comfortably adopted.  There was groupthink and a shutting down of concerns.  All of these things were part of the culture in policy making.  It would be very helpful if the inquiry were to consider some of these questions and ask itself what fundamentally needs to be changed in the Irish approach to some of these things to ensure that another crisis of whatever source----- <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#AA00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I will allow the witness to return to this in his concluding remarks because this will be a final issue in the discussion this afternoon.

Many IMF programmes, which I mentioned in my response to Deputy Higgins earlier, have included this as a very substantial part, as otherwise the numbers will not add up.  It is not possible to put the thing together unless creditors take a hit.  This is a long-standing feature of IMF programmes.<\/p> <p>  However, it is not a general principle that always has to apply.  One looks at each particular country, because there are costs associated with debt write-downs.  Countries' reputations suffer.  If one can get away without doing it, it is possibly better.  However, if it is inevitable that there is no solution other than including that, the IMF is pragmatic and will say, \"Let's do it\".  It will probably say, \"Let's do it sooner rather than later because we are just postponing the inevitable\".<\/p> <p>  I hesitate to speak too much for Europeans but, in various places, I have made the observation that the ECB would have been very reluctant to entertain too much in the line of debt write-downs and restructuring.  Why is this?  The IMF over 50 years has a lot of experience of what works and does not work.  It sees what may have to be done sooner.  The ECB is a young institution.  It clearly wishes to safeguard its reputation, and having to preside over bank losses or debt write-downs for an institution that is ten years old is not something which would fit too easily with a central bank seeking to enhance its reputation.  <\/p> <p>  The view might also be said by some in Europe who would oppose debt write-downs, at least the ECB, that it is okay for the IMF to say we should probably do this and things will work out better.  However, what if the IMF is wrong and the costs associated with this turn out to be much higher than anyone had thought or that the IMF had said might be the case?  The IMF people can always get back into their aeroplanes and go back to Washington.  However, the ECB is the institution which would have to remain to pick up the pieces if the strategy did not work.  For this reason, perhaps there is an element of conservatism on the part of the ECB.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#AA00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Is it unusual for the approach to rescheduling not to be taken in this context?

The first is whether the analysis is appropriate in terms of coverage, depth and so on.  The second is whether any notice will be taken of it.  They are two slightly different questions.  The issues I discussed here were essentially to do with the faulty analysis or incomplete analysis of the IMF part.  Whatever the analysis is, whether it is good or bad, it may have some impact.  In the case of Ireland, the positive indications given as to the state of the financial sector were somewhat counterproductive, as the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, said, because they provided a message of reassurance when that was not appropriate.<\/p> <p>  More generally, there is a problem in that although the IMF's advice is published and the views of the executive board - which usually endorse the staff views, but not always - are published, governments can and do ignore this advice.  Sometimes they disagree with it.  This is quite common in the UK, for example.  Over the years, the UK Chancellor has often said: \"That's an interesting report.

We will do the same.\"  The second problem was more fundamental - the problem of the cyclically adjusted balance - in that the Stability and Growth Pact either did not refer to the structural balance or, if it did, it got it wrong because it measured it wrongly.  There was nothing in this EU-wide system which was going to detect the massive flaw in the Irish budgetary position.  This was true, I understand, to a significant extent in a number of other countries, such as Spain.<\/p> <p>  The second design flaw was the absence of centralised bank supervision or transnational bank supervision.  There were reasons for this, political and others.  Everyone was supposed to look after their own banks, but the problem was that when the banking crisis came, whatever we had thought about fiscal stability or the Stability and Growth Pact, it was immediately torn up.  That was because, when one has bank failures, inevitably, to some extent, governments find themselves with an obligation to at least put in some fiscal resources, so the fiscal ceiling goes out the window.<\/p><p> Those were the two fundamental flaws.

That is a broader question about how we assess collective responsibility, and individual responsibility.  Ministers take decisions, but what is the role of civil servants?  It is a very big issue.  In the case of the banks, though, there was a certain - or, more than certain, a fairly substantial - move towards encouraging those who were perceived to be responsible to move on.  That happened to a fairly substantial extent.  The issue of civil service and responsibility is a deep one, and I do not know the answer to that question.  In the IMF, decisions are taken collectively.  There is huge internal debate among the staff, more than many people might think.  It is not a monolithic institution at all.  Ultimately, however, it is a collective institution, so one cannot say Mr. X was personally responsible for a decision on whether to burn bondholders, for example.

The neglect of commercial property lending, for example, is a very important issue that has come out more clearly.  Why did the IMF not look at the massive increase in developer lending?  I have heard two reasons being mentioned.  Of course there is no good explanation.  First, many of these developers had properties in different parts of the world.  They had different kinds of properties in different markets.  I believe the view held by the regulators was that, while one part of this market might fail, or one type of product might fail, it would be unheard of for them all to go down together, since they were scattered in different places.  It was argued that this had never happened before in a property market.  I think that was an element.  Second, nobody knew anything about the kinds of things that appeared in the section of the Honohan report dealing with what was really going on in commercial property lending.  Given that nobody knew about the problems with bank guarantees and inadequate documentation, it would not have been reasonable for the IMF to have known about them.

Is it fair, therefore, to state that they were somewhat overvalued?  I do not know of a single instance where an international or a national organisation - such as the IMF, the EU Commission or the Central Bank of Ireland - uttered an expression of concern regarding that young generation of working people who were the victims of the huge inflation in house prices which took place between 1996 and 2006.  At that time, the periods of repayment relating to mortgages were extended from 20 years to 40 and lending reached unsustainable levels.

However, in the case of Ireland, there was the taxation system and this encouraged people to engage in widespread house purchases.  In turn, this led to individuals buying not just one but a number of houses.  As a result of the fact that there was no significant capital gains tax or a property tax and that there was substantial mortgage interest rate relief, relative to other countries - this is all relative - the fiscal structure in Ireland leaned towards and favoured more than the average in the context of the acquisition of houses, including for investment purposes.  Eventually, it ended up with people purchasing houses for speculative purposes.  That is the point at which the IMF was trying to get.<\/p> <p>  On the observation with regard to houses being \"somewhat overvalued\", I must stress that I am only describing what the IMF said, I am not defending its statement.  The IMF was reluctant - as is the case with many other entities - to put a number on how big it believes an overvaluation may be.  This is partly because there are dozens of different calculations one can make and people come up with different views.  My personal view is that it could have been somewhat more explicit on this matter and might not have used the term \"somewhat\".  However, that did not prove to be the case.  Perhaps that is a legitimate criticism.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the third observation, the IMF does not attempt to provide views on all aspects of the economy.  It is not within the organisation's mandate to do so.  However, there is no shortage of institutions, both domestically and externally, that will address issues of equality, poverty, the inability of people to buy homes and so on.  It is not that the people who work for the IMF, as individuals, do not view this as a bad situation, it is because it is just not part of the organisation's mandate to address specific issues of inequality and difficulties relating to access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#FF01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":521,"content":"<p>In the book on the late Brian Lenihan, Dr. Donovan referred to Professor Honohan.

First, if they had known that Anglo Irish Bank was insolvent, then the question would have been what to do.  I understand there is a view that it should have been liquidated overnight.  That would have, however, led to the kinds of costs associated with the closure of Anglo Irish Bank that the Honohan report describes at some length.  Whether those costs which he describes very vividly and to my knowledge he has not changed his view, would have been greater than the costs up to &euro;64 billion or a figure ranging from &euro;40 billion or some other number, who knows.<\/p> <p>  The second scenario is completely different and distinct and is the one that Anglo Irish Bank had, a liquidity problem.  Should they have gone for emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, and hoped that something would work out at the end of the week?  This is discussed quite a bit in our book.  One never knows what would have happened.  Would a solution have been found?  In my view for what it is worth, I do not see a strong reason to believe that the European position on the Thursday before 29 September would have been radically different one week later.  Others may disagree.   What would have changed?  We had no new information on the bank's situation.  We were still thinking that it was illiquid but not insolvent.  We never found that out until six months later.  What would have happened in a week for the Europeans to say, \"Okay, on second thoughts go ahead and liquidate Anglo Irish Bank and do something different\".  That is where I have a problem with the idea that waiting a week would have changed matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015021800002#GG01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424217600,"counter":538,"content":"<p>We are moving into the realms of speculation.

I am joined by my colleagues Niall Egan, a principal officer in the Department with responsibility for jobseeker and lone parent income policy, and by Erica Klein, assistant principal officer with responsibility for one-parent family payments.  In this first session, I propose to provide a short update on activation developments.  As committee members will be aware, I made presentations on this topic on a number of occasions, most recently on 28 January.  Unfortunately, time constraints on that occasion limited the time for discussion, so rather than take up much of the committee's time today by repeating what I said then, my presentation today is a shortened version of that provided on 28 January.  I understand the committee clerk has circulated copies of that presentation and I and my colleagues will be pleased to address any questions on today's statement or that of 28 January.<\/p> <p>  As members of the committee will be aware, the Pathways to Work strategy set out a comprehensive reform of the State&rsquo;s approach to helping unemployed jobseekers return to work.  It was initiated in 2012 as a strategy for the period 2012 to 2015 and is designed to complement the Action Plan for Jobs as part of a twin-pronged approach to tackling the jobs crisis that emerged in the final years of the last decade.  The Action Plan for Jobs is focused on stimulating employment growth.  Pathways to Work is focused on making sure that as many as possible of these new jobs, and other vacancies that arise in the economy, are filled by people who are unemployed jobseekers.<\/p> <p>  I do not intend to outline the wide range of reforms implemented as part of Pathways to Work as these have been outlined to the committee previously, but they include, for example, the merger of the community welfare service, the F&Aacute;S employment service and the Department of Social Protection in order to provide a one-stop shop experience for job seekers; the development and implementation of a case management approach based on client profiling; one to one engagement between clients and case officers; personal progression planning; the streamlining of decision-making to reduced decision times from weeks to days; the development and launch of new services and schemes such as JobsPlus and JobBridge; and the introduction of a social contract of rights and responsibilities, including penalty arrangements for those not engaging with activation services.  Reform also involves, certainly over the past year, a significantly increased level of engagement with employers.<\/p> <p>  As stated in previous presentations, while it is very difficult to ascribe a cause and effect relationship between the reforms implemented and the reduction in unemployment, there are definite signs that Pathways to Work has had an impact.  In particular, it is notable that the jobless growth phenomenon that  was typical of economic recoveries following other recessions is not being repeated.  In fact, jobs growth in Ireland led rather than lagged economic growth.  Other signs that the approach has had an impact are that some of the key targets set out have been achieved ahead of time.  For example, over 60,000 long-term unemployed people have moved into work since the Pathways to Work strategy was launched, the persistence rate from short-term to long-term unemployment has also fallen from 33% to 29% and the progression rate to employment for people more than two years unemployed has already reached its end of 2015 target of 40%.  I have provided an up-to-date statement of performance against the individual metrics as an appendix to my statement.<\/p> <p>  Looking ahead, while the initial focus of the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s reform programme focused on improving services, via Intreo, to those newly unemployed people identified at high risk of becoming long-term unemployed, its focus in the Pathways to Work 2015 is to augment this approach by increasing the intensity of engagement with people who are long term unemployed and the level of engagement with employers.  Persuading employers to offer employment opportunities to people who are long-term unemployed, predominantly males over 35 years of age, is a particularly difficult challenge.<\/p> <p>  In 2015, this will involve implementing a structured process of engagement of people who are long-term unemployed, which will see approximately 8,500  people being referred to the Intreo activation process each month; rolling out JobPath, a payment by results contract model with third party providers of employment services specifically targeted at long-term unemployed jobseekers; establishing a professional account management and sales capability within Intreo, targeted at employers; introducing new schemes, including FirstSteps and JobsPlus Youth, to give effect to commitments made in the Government&rsquo;s youth guarantee implementation plan; developing new IT capability, including an upgraded jobs website, to respond more effectively  to employer and jobseeker needs; expanding the number of places on JobsPlus, the jobs subsidy specifically designed to support long-term unemployed jobseekers; introducing the back to work family dividend to address work incentive and welfare trap issues; and providing access to employment services and supports to lone parents transitioning from the one-parent family payment.<\/p><p>In addition, it is planned to improve the evaluation of process and programme effectiveness and inform future developments by commissioning quantitative and qualitative assessments of the impact of Pathways to Work, changes in job seekers' progression to employment and also job seekers' satisfaction with the services.  These evaluations will be conducted with the input and advice of the Labour Market Council, which is a forum of labour market experts and stakeholders established by the T&aacute;naiste in late 2013.<\/p><p> I hope this summary of past and future developments has provided the members of the committee with some insight into the Department's activation programmes.  My colleagues and I will be happy to take any questions that committee members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":549,"content":"<p>Can I ask whether we are time-constrained today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#D00300","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":550,"content":"<p>Yes; we are hoping to finish within the hour on this topic and then move on to the next topic of one-parent families at 2.30 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#D00400","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I notice there are a number of representative groups here to discuss one-parent families.

I have explained my opposition to some and my support for others.  I have a few specific questions.  One is about the staff allocation to JobPlus and JobPlus Youth and also to JobBridge.  One change since the last time the witnesses were here has been the announcement of JobPlus Youth and First Steps.  Can you explain why First Steps is not called JobBridge Youth, given that it is very similar?  A question also needs to be raised in relation to the work placement programme which predated this with Tesco and Diageo.  It now seems that the likes of those companies will be availing of the new JobBridge for young people to displace existing jobs.  It is not just Tesco - there are other companies out there that I have complained about - but we already know that Tesco Ireland is contemplating major lay-offs.  Has it been taken into account that while Tesco is contemplating laying off staff, it is availing of JobBridge or an equivalent scheme?  Does that factor into any of the discussions within the Department, and does it set off alarm bells that jobs will be displaced, with the State subsidising a company with high, albeit decreasing, profits? I believe Tesco made &pound;1.4 billion in profit last year.  I do not have a clue what Diageo's profit was but I know the CEO is on a wage of &pound;7.4 million per annum.  In the past, those companies would have taken people on at entry level at a lower rate, rather than taking on people for a number of months fully subsidised by the State.  In some ways JobBridge, or its equivalent, would be displacing jobs which might have been low paid or low entry-level.  We all know of young people coming out of school who, in the past, would have been able to get into employment on a paid level on very low wages and work their way up.  Now, more and more, they are expected to take on up to nine months' work for no pay but a social welfare top-up, and the company does not have to pay a penny or contribute in any way.  In the past, companies would have had to make the payment and train the staff at that entry level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#D00900","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I wish to ask specifically about one-parent families.

We have seen figures recently to the effect that the number of lone parents in the workplace has decreased.  The fact is that child care support is not there at the moment to facilitate many lone parents to get back into the workplace.  I know the witnesses cannot comment on the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, but do they think that is a factor?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#D01100","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424264400,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I will try to take the questions in order.  If I skip any, please tell me.  I am not trying to avoid answering any questions - I will try to answer them all - but when there are so many, sometimes it is hard to keep track of what I have answered.  The last day I gave an update on the labour market situation in terms of unemployment rates and so on.  Since then, the Central Statistics Office has released the live register figures.  It showed that the unemployment rate had dropped from 10.6% to about 10.5%.  One of the interesting things the EUROSTAT publication estimated, based on the CSO figures, was that unemployment was now about 21%, whereas the last day I reported it was 23%.  They are statistical measures in terms of updates.<\/p> <p>  Since then, there have been no new policy developments that were not signalled.  There have been, as Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh pointed out, announcements and launches by the T&aacute;naiste of some of the initiatives which we signalled on that day, particularly First Steps and JobPlus Youth.  They are designed to deliver on the Government's commitments under the implementation plan for the Youth Guarantee.  First Steps is a programme targeted at supporting disadvantaged youth in taking their first steps into the labour force.  That is why it is called First Steps rather than JobBridge - to make the point that this is for the many young people who are disadvantaged, may have left school early, may have been on Youthreach programmes, may have been released from the Probation Service or may have addiction problems.  These are the young people we are talking about - young people who, even during the Celtic tiger years, would probably have been unemployed.  The initiative tries to target that group of young people in terms of work experience.  That is what First Steps is about.  It is similar to, but different from JobBridge.  It is similar in that it is a work experience or internship type of opportunity.  It is different in that training will be given to the young people in advance of a placement with an employer.  It is different in that the placement with the employer is four days a week and not five days a week.  The young person will have a dedicated case worker assigned to him or her from the Department to work with him or her on the fifth day of each week on training and education options and lessons from the internship.<\/p><p>The other thing that is different about it is that the employer does not get to select the candidates.  With the JobBridge scheme, which is voluntary, the employer advertises the position on the JobBridge website, people apply and the employer chooses the candidate.  In this scenario, we select young people who we identify as being particularly disadvantaged and who we feel would benefit from a work placement.  The employer is asked to sponsor these young people.  <\/p><p> We are always conscious of displacement.  A standard requirement of the JobBridge scheme, which will also be part of this scheme, is that any opportunities offered are not to displace existing workers or to be used to fill vacancies created by redundancies.  This is a particular concern for us.  The rules of the scheme do not allow this to happen.  Unfortunately, there have been some instances of this, but we take action when we believe employers are doing it.  I would emphasise that this scheme is for young people who would are particularly disadvantaged.  To be fair to the employers mentioned earlier, I was involved with both of them and the schemes they ran.  They took on young people who, not to put too fine a point of it, might not otherwise have got past their reception desk.  They gave them a chance.  Most of these young people have gone into employment having had a lot of intense support.  This is a good thing.  We have to be conscious of this. <\/p><p> I will ask Mr. Egan to deal with the questions on one-parent families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#D01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424264400,"counter":558,"content":"<p>The figures for 2011 show that 49% of recipients of the one-parent family payment were in employment.  This figure has decreased.  It decreased in 2013 and, based on the information we have, it was down to 36%.  I have to give a caveat for this information, which is that we gather it at a particular point in time but on a regular basis.  The figure increased in 2014 and in 2015.  As the end of January 2015, 45% of recipients were in employment.  There are a number of reasons for the fluctuations.  The key large change is the economic crisis.  It affected everyone, including lone parents in employment.  Many lone parents lost their employment.  Another key factor is what happened at the start of 2012.  Previously, recipients of the one-parent family payment could participate on a community employment scheme, receive their one-parent family payment and also get a current payment of the community employment allowance.  This was stopped.  A direct result of this was a significant decline in the number of lone parents participating in community employment.  This was a key factor.<\/p> <p>  Questions were asked about activation supports for lone parents. There are about 70,000 recipients of the one-parent family payment.  Everyone who is familiar with that cohort realises the diversity in the range of people in it.  It includes very well educated individuals with doctorates as well as people with very poor literacy and numeracy skills.  There is no set single programme that is suitable for one-parent family payments recipients.  This makes it difficult to engage with them.  However, what is available is the range of supports we have on foot of the reforms that we will speak about later.  This is the broad range of supports available through the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills.  These have largely been designed for job seekers but they will now be available to others and will cover a range of people.<\/p> <p>  Child care is an issue.  It falls within the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and in order to encourage lone parents into valuable schemes such as community employment, we have introduced a community employment scheme for child care.  This has significantly improved the number of lone parents availing of community employment.  We have also introduced an after school child care scheme on top of the available supports the Department of Children and Youth Affairs makes available.  Is it enough?  I would argue it is not.  However, it is a start and it is something the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has announced it will examine.  <\/p> <p>  As lone parents are such a diverse group, the Department has, through the Irish Research Council, undertaken specific research on what works in terms of activation, both internationally and in an Irish context.  This looks at specific measures for lone parents as well as the supports required.  Dr. Michelle Murphy from NUI Galway is undertaking this research.  This will be a key piece of research which will help us to tailor our supports for lone parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":559,"content":"<p>The improvement in the unemployment figures over the past number of years is to be welcomed.

A lot of resources are being put into that kind of intervention by the VECs, particularly the City of Dublin VEC.

Almost twice a week in our constituency offices we are reminded that there are no such schemes.<\/p> <p>  These people have given the State a great service.  They have raised their children and they are keen to go back into the workforce but there is nothing there for them.  They cannot get on any schemes because they are not allowed to sign on or register for credits.  They are in no man's land.  It is a scandal.  We need to look into this and see whether we can bring back the schemes that were in place previously.  We need to get these people re-educated and back into the workforce.  They have given the State a great service and they want to go back into the workforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#F00100","speaker":"1079"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424264400,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I will try to address the questions in order.  Reference was made to long-term unemployment.  Long-term unemployment is decreasing; in fact, it is decreasing at a slightly faster rate than unemployment generally.  The long-term unemployment rate has dropped from 9% one year ago to approximately 6% now.  There are problems with long-term unemployment.  The cohort who are long-term unemployed is partly made up of people who have been unemployed for between three and five years.  There has been a marginal fall in the number of people who are three years unemployed and a small increase in the number of people who are five years unemployed.  Most of these are male and over 35 years of age.  The figures for this cohort are particularly worrying.  This is why Pathways to Work 2015 is focused on initiatives to help in this area and to continue some of the work we started last year.<\/p> <p>  Committee members raised the question of engagement with employers and the long-term unemployed.  Several things are happening in this area.  I will outline what we are doing in the area of engagement with employers.  We have spent much time in the past two years trying to get our message out to employers.  We held mass briefings for employers and spent a good deal of time with the various employer representative bodies and individual employers briefing them on the various supports that are available.  Arising from that process, we have made changes to some of the supports.  Members will be aware that previously there was a PRSI exemption scheme and a revenue tax assist scheme for employers who took on people who had previously been long-term unemployed.  At most, we had 1,200 people on that.  Arising from the feedback from employers, we changed this to the JobsPlus scheme.  Now, we have over 4,000 people on JobsPlus.  JobsPlus has changed the system.  Previously, a rather convoluted application process was necessary to reclaim PRSI paid or to offset the employment costs of long-term unemployed people against corporation tax.  We have changed this into a payment to employers for every month that they employ a person who was previously long-term unemployed, up to a maximum of two years.  The amount paid varies from a little over &euro;300 per month to a little over &euro;400 per month, depending on the prior duration of unemployment of the person concerned.  Interestingly, the cut-off point in this case is that if someone has been unemployed for 12 months but less than two years, the subsidy paid by the State is &euro;7,500 over a two-year period.  However, if someone has been unemployed for more than two years, it is &euro;10,000 over a two-year period.  The figures for the take-up for JobsPlus indicate that a little over 61% of the job seekers who have benefitted from the scheme have been unemployed for more than two years.  Let us consider the figures in this area prior to JobsPlus, particularly the cohort of long-term unemployed and the profile and distribution of long-term unemployed who went back to work.  A total of two thirds of those people had been unemployed for between one and two years and one third had been unemployed for a period greater than two years.  JobsPlus has turned that around.  It appears to be having the effect of increasing the number of unemployed people who are hired by employers, with a particular focus on the long-term unemployed.<\/p> <p>  I will provide a little more detail about what the Department is doing with employers.  It is something of a new departure for the Department.  We are setting up an account management structure.  We have already appointed a number of managers within the Department, whom we call employer engagement managers.  Depending on the size of the geographical division, we have either one or two full-time employer engagement managers in each of our regional divisions.  Their job is to go out and find jobs for job seekers and promote the placement of job seekers with employers.  We are building on this and setting up what we term an account management structure.  This is similar to the way a commercial firm in a business-to-business market operates in that all of the major employers in the State are allocated a dedicated account manager.  That account manager's job is to work with the employer to anticipate employment requirements and plan in advance in order that we will get job seekers, particularly those who have been long-term unemployed, placed with those employers.  We will be starting the recruitment process for that account management role shortly.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about job seekers.  It is a fact that has been on the record for a long time that the number of caseworkers in the Department was insufficient to deal with the vast number of people who were unemployed.  At one stage, at the height of unemployment, we had approximately 800 unemployed people for every caseworker.  European norms would be approximately 200:1.  In fact, many European countries operate at approximately 100:1.  We have done two things in response.  First, we have doubled the number of caseworkers from 300 to 600, which has brought the ratio down to approximately 500:1; second, we went to tender for the contracted employment model or the job path contract employment support model.  We are finalising the contracts at the moment.  When that gets up and running it will bring the ratio down to the European norm of approximately 200:1.  The model is particularly focused on people who are long-term unemployed.  That is the position on working with employers and working with people who are long-term unemployed.<\/p> <p>  There was another question about the supports for people in education and training.  The Department provides many supports for people in education and training.  There are a number of specific and special income support schemes, including the part-time education option and the back-to-education allowance.<\/p> <p>  Department caseworkers operate a referral mechanism for people who are unemployed.  People are referred to the training part of what is now the education and training boards, which used to be F&Aacute;S.  When people go on those programmes they get a training allowance and so on.  I would be disappointed if people are not benefitting from that in the way they should and I would welcome reports of individual instances in which people believe they are not getting the support they should.  It would not be the first time I have heard of it.  The last time I was before the committee I made the point that we carried out nearly 300,000 one-to-one interviews with job seekers last year.  Among that number of 300,000, there are always going to be cases that are less than perfect.  I trust, however, that it is only a small minority of cases.  Anyway, if people can give me examples it will help us to improve our service.<\/p> <p>  I will ask my colleague Mr. Egan to take the question on lone parents and consistent poverty presently, but first I will address the question about the husband-and-wife or partner situation.  Where two people are unemployed, both parties can access the services of the State for training, education and casework.  This requires them to split the claim and that is something we encourage people to do, rather than the entering the classic scenario of one breadwinner, whether that is the male or female partner.  In the latter scenario, the person would typically claim the payment and then claim a qualified adult payment for the partner.  However, it is possible to split a claim such that both people can be individual claimants in their own right and both can get the supports that are available.  It is not something people seem to know about, although we keep telling them.  It has been expressed to me before that there are cultural issues and so on behind this.  Anyway, we tell people about it and it is something we promote.<\/p> <p>  What about where one partner is working and the other partner is not?  The first thing is that they do not have access to the full range of services, but that is not to say they do not have access to any services.  We take walk-in clients in our Intreo case centres.  We take walk-in clients in the local employment services as well and we support them with personal progression planning and identifying the options available.  They have access to the part-time and evening education options and so on in the education and training boards.  It is not that they are excluded from everything.  However, we have to be honest about the nature of some of these schemes.<\/p><p>There are many more people on jobseeker's payments than we would like to have.  The State imposes on them an obligation to be genuinely seeking, and available for, work.  We have limited resources.  When we impose an obligation on one category of job seeker to make themselves available for work if they want their income support payment, our priority in allocating those scarce resources has to be that cohort.  It has to be the people to whom we say \"If you do not co-operate, you do not get a payment.\"  We have to make options available for them to satisfy their job search obligation.  We have to be conscious of that.  It is not to say that as the situation improves and the numbers on the live register fall, such issues would not be considered in the allocation of resources.  They would be considered, because we would be very conscious of the qualified adult situation.  We can address that partly through claim splitting, but we are conscious that there are people who want to be in the labour market but are not.  As resources allow, we in the Department are looking to extend a wider range of services to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":565,"content":"<p>How easy is it to split the claim?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#G00200","speaker":"1013"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424264400,"counter":566,"content":"<p>It is very straightforward.

Could the witnesses give an up-to-date figure for participants on the Gateway scheme and how close the Department is to the target of 3,000 formerly unemployed people working with the local authorities?  In respect of the Gateway scheme, there are people who want to work and those who do not want to work.  That is a harsh reality.  A scheme such as this is ideal for the numerous people who cannot find work and want to work.  I know they are required to be unemployed for two years, and 20% of places are kept for people who refer themselves.  I am anxious to see people who have been unemployed for three or six months and would love to refer themselves to the local authority get work experience there.  The local authorities have the wherewithal to manage these people who want to contribute.  The Department should do a little more for those within the 20%.  I appreciate that it is dealing with the long-term unemployed to make them a priority, but would it consider relaxing the criteria for the 20% who refer themselves to allow people who have been unemployed for six months get onto the scheme?  It would be in the interests of the local authorities and of the people who want to get the work.<\/p> <p>  What penalties does the Department impose on people who are invited onto the Gateway scheme, which is compulsory, if they refuse to cooperate?  Have there been sanctions affecting payments for many people, or have they been disqualified from receiving their payments for a period of time or indefinitely?

I presume that people who leave the country do not appear anywhere else on the system.  Does the Department track that to show how falls in the unemployment figures relate to emigration or actual engagement with labour activation or employment?<\/p> <p>  I have a few very vociferous constituents who feel there is a problem with the JobsPlus scheme.  The argument goes that when people who are trying to get back into work contact employers to go on JobsPlus scheme, the employers say they must be joking, and why would they take them on when they could use JobBridge.  I hear that quite often.  How does the Department respond?  I hear the witnesses say the figure is 4,000, which is not bad, but I get quite a few reports of people who would like to go on JobsPlus but find that a lot of employers do not entertain that because it is a better deal for them to pay people nothing and effectively get free labour through the JobBridge scheme.<\/p> <p>  While I take the point about positive discrimination towards the long-term unemployed on JobsPlus, there is another side to that equation.  A similar argument is as follows: why would an employer take somebody on for &euro;7,500 in the first year of unemployment instead of taking the &euro;10,000 that is provided if the person is unemployed for more than two years?  People come to me who have tried to get on the JobsPlus scheme but because they have been unemployed for less than two years the employers ask why they would take them on when they can get &euro;10,000 for people who have been unemployed for more than two years.  It is an understandable grievance on the part of somebody who is more recently unemployed who cannot get back to work because of the way the incentive works.<\/p> <p>  One-parent benefit has featured a little, but not as much recently-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#G00800","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":572,"content":"<p>The Deputy was not here at the beginning of the meeting when we said we would deal with that later in its entirety.

I will, therefore, send a written response.  I do not want to quote the numbers from memory, but the numbers are on track to reach 3,000.  There was a fairly slow take-off, but the figure has accelerated.<\/p> <p>  On changing the eligibility criteria, there was a policy decision taken, but we can certainly feed back the committee's views and talk to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys about it.  The rationale for picking the particular threshold was to focus on persons who were long-term unemployed.  It is very difficult to make exceptions to which we can hold hard.  Once we make an exception, the whole thing begins to unravel.  That would certainly be my advice from an operational perspective.  There are trade-offs to be made.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of the total numbers on schemes, Table 10 in the live register statement from the Central Statistics Office produces them.  It shows that the total number on schemes in December 2014 was 86,027.  The figure was 86,162 at the end of December 2013; therefore, there has been a small decrease.  This shows that the reduction in the level of unemployment during this period was not due to people being shifted into an employment programme.  The employment programme numbers have been relatively steady for the past few years.  It includes full-time F&Aacute;S training for unemployed persons but not some of the part-time and evening training programmes which would not impact on the numbers on the live register.  We rely on the numbers produced by the Central Statistics Office which is independent of the Department.<\/p> <p>  We keep an eye on the emigration figures.  It is true that if we had not seen an increase in emigration in the last period - certainly up to last year - there would, without a shadow of doubt, be more people on the live register.

We cannot always control what employers do.  We would try to position the two schemes as complementary in the way Senator Moloney suggested, in that they are not competitive.  I refer to the numbers in the past year since JobsPlus has been in operation.  The numbers of people on JobBridge have fallen slightly by about 300 or 400, whereas the numbers of people on JobsPlus have increased from basically zero to just over 4,000.  This does not indicate that people are still being pushed into JobBridge.  The number of people who have come from JobBridge into JobsPlus is about 20% - I do not have the exact number but I can send it to the committee for circulation.  About 20% or thereabouts of people on JobsPlus were previously on JobBridge with the same employer.  We regard the schemes as complementary.<\/p> <p>  I understand the question as to why would an employer take on someone who has been 12 to 24 months unemployed for &euro;7,500 when they can get someone who is two years unemployed for &euro;10,000.

For example, a person who became unemployed in 2012 had a 50% chance of getting employment within the next 12 months.  If that person was not successful in finding employment in that period, his or her chances of getting employment in the 12 to 24 month period was about 20%; if not successful in the 12 to 24 month period, his or her chances in the next 24 to 36 month period, was in low single digits - low as in 1% approximately.  That is the reason it is structured in a particular way.  We have a large number of people in that cohort and as things stand, if there is a two-year gap in a person's CV, the chances of an employer giving that person an opportunity are remote.  There are trade-offs but that is the nature of our business in the sense that decisions have to be made and it is not possible to have a perfect continuum.  That is the background.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Senator Moloney's question about displacement, we respond to parliamentary questions and representations from Deputies and we also have an online facility where people can report instances and we act upon them.  On the question of the number of staff deployed on JobBridge and JobsPlus, I do not have the information on the precise number with me.  JobBridge is operated by a small policy-based team known as the JobBridge policy unit which is comprised of three people.  JobsPlus has approximately the same number of people, three or four people working at the centre.  Both schemes are supported by our divisional and operational structure for processing applications.  JobBridge takes a bit more operational time because we do inspections to ensure that any issues of displacement are captured or allegations of abuse are investigated.  We carry out random samples.  However, in cases of abuse we send out inspectors to meet the intern and the employer and to check the records.  This takes a bit more governance.<\/p> <p>  On the first step issue, this was not pathways to work nor was it the youth guarantee implementation plan.  We called it the youth development internship.  We have changed the name from youth development internship which is a bit of a mouthful.

One Family calls on the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection to petition the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Social Protection to get matters right for lone parents.  The issues relating to lone parents have been known since 2012 and lack of planning and implementation in respect of such parents is of major concern.  It is quite astonishing that research relating to activation among lone parents - which will become available in June - is only being commissioned now, particularly when 39,000 lone parents are due to be activated on 2 July.  The decision to restrict eligibility for the one-parent family payment for those parenting alone whose youngest child is aged seven or under was announced in Budget 2012.  On 2 July next, most of these 39,000 lone parents will be transferred to the jobseeker's transitional allowance payment.  The major concern for us in this regard relates to the lack of planning, support and information provided and responsibility taken by the Department of Social Protection in terms of these action.<\/p> <p>  The Department must take responsibility for the impact of its policies.  It must also put in place the necessary services and provide the information that is available from other Departments.  Activating lone parents is an issue which does not just relate to the Department of Social Protection, it is one which requires a whole-of-government approach.    In that context, the Departments of Education and Skills, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Children and Youth Affairs must be involved.  An integrated approach in respect of this matter has not really been planned.  There is a need to develop a customer charter whereby parents will be given clear, sensible and correct information.  I will not go into detail on the anecdotal evidence in our possession in respect of this matter.  However, we have received a number of inquiries from parents to our askonefamily national helpline regarding incorrect information, etc.  Suffice it to say that such information is confusing the whole issue.<\/p> <p>  I will now discuss some of the headline issues relating to lone parents.  At present, 63% of lone parents are experiencing deprivation.  By anybody's standards, this is obviously a key issue which we must address.  Regardless of the issues relating to the payment and the question of supports, the level of deprivation must be tackled now.  We are beginning to see evidence that work is not a route out of poverty but that for some people it is a way into persistent and consistent poverty.  This is going to be a major issue going forward, particularly for those families that will be moving on the jobseeker's transitional payment.  The number of people in receipt of the one-parent family payment who are involved community employment has dropped from 33% to 9%.  Community employment is a good activation measure because people only need to work for 19.5 hours per week and it facilitates parents who have caring responsibilities for children.  However, these individuals are financially restricted as a result of the fact that child care is expensive.<\/p> <p>  Another headline issue relates to lone parents entering third level education.  As a result of the transition, these individuals may transfer to the back to education allowance but this has not been fully confirmed.  What is going to happen after the transition on 2 July?  What will happen on 3 July and during the remainder of the summer?  Lone parents are actually considering not returning to third level to complete their fourth year of study because they simply cannot afford it.  That runs contrary to the Government's policy of getting people to the highest level of education possible.<\/p> <p>  Another matter that arises is the fact that people are unable to take up training and upskilling options because of issues relating to time and cost.  Why do classes relating to training and upskilling start at 9 a.m. rather than 10 a.m.?  There are simple things which could be done in order to facilitate people in pursuing the options available to them.<\/p> <p>  Parents are also giving up part-time work on foot of the move to the jobseeker's transition payment and issues relating to family income supplement.  The latter is a threshold payment and if one earns &euro;1 above that threshold, one does not receive it.  There is an issue with regard to how we can use family income supplement to better support parents who are working.  Perhaps a sliding-scale mechanism or some other more creative approach could be used in this regard.  The current situation is having an impact on many lone parents who are being obliged to make rational decisions with regard to whether they should be in work.<\/p> <p>  Members are aware of the issues relating to child care.  Affordable, accessible and quality child care is needed in order to facilitate those who are already in or those who wish to enter employment.  Child care is an economic development issue.  It is also an economic policy issue and we should be examining it in the context of facilitating not only lone parents but also all parents who wish to work.  Child care schemes are clumsy and complex.  In addition, they are not understandable and coverage is poor.  A major issue arises in terms of considering how we can create a child care strategy - and provide child care funding - which actually facilitates people who wish to work or pursue educational opportunities.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of urgent actions which the Government and the Department of Social Protection should take.  The overarching aim must be to ensure that work pays.  We also need to ensure that parents are treated with respect and dignity by the Department of Social Protection.  In addition, we must use a variety of ways to ensure that parents will not be compromised financially, emotionally or socially in the context of the move to the jobseeker's transition payment.  A key issue relates to the need to examine the position with regard to free part-time education options for those who are parenting alone.  This is cheap activation - there are courses and programmes available - and it is a better way to ensure that parents become educated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stuart Duffin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424264400,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  We welcome the opportunity to discuss the grave realities facing families.  Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Children, SPARK, is a voluntary organisation that was established in December 2011 to campaign specifically in respect of the changes to the one-parent family payment.  The reforms lone parents are facing in July are the final stage of reforms introduced in budget 2012.  They are wide-ranging in nature but in essence they remove the status as carers for parents once their youngest children turn seven.  This has huge implications for how one-parent families can manage both child-caring and chief-bread-winner roles.  During the initial debate relating to the relevant legislation, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, allayed concerns from NGOs , Opposition members and backbenchers by undertaking not to proceed with the legislation without a child care system similar to that which obtains in Scandinavia.  We are now facing into these changes in the absence of the affordable child care and we are worried for our families.<\/p> <p>  One-parent families have traditionally suffered higher deprivation and poverty rates than the general population.  The policy in this regard was designed to encourage more active inclusion of one-parent families through greater uptake of employment and educational opportunities.  However, while this has been the motivation, the necessary child care supports have not been provided.  Our families are the poorest in society and we are not in a position to withstand any further cuts to our incomes.<\/p><p> Our families are the poorest and we are not in a position to withstand any further cuts to our incomes.  Child care is a huge barrier to all working parents in Ireland.  According to the OECD, the average two-parent family spends 17% of its net income on child care.  For two-parent families in Ireland that goes up to 34% and for one-parent families 53% of their net income goes on child care.  This is the barrier we face.<\/p><p> These cuts are regressive and will see those earning least paying most  A lone parent with one child, working 20 hours per week on the minimum wage, will lose &euro;50.72 this July and that is taking into account the back-to-work family dividend and increases in FIS payments.  That will rise to &euro;80.52, or 18% of their income, by July 2017 when they lose the back-to-work family dividend.  The poorest will lose 18% of their income.<\/p><p> Jobseeker's transitional payment for parents whose children are aged over seven and under 14 has been introduced in lieu of child care.  This is a welcome move but it is not enough and it is a regressive step for working lone parents as a working lone parent earning &euro;150 per week will lose an additional &euro;30 per week.  This loss is in addition to cuts caused by changes to the income disregard, so there is a cumulative loss of &euro;53 per week for a person earning &euro;150 per week and transitioning to the jobseeker's transitional payment.<\/p><p> Lone parents transitioning to FIS will lose fuel allowance of &euro;520 per year and 40% of their current one-parent family allowance payment.  Lone parents who are full-time carers and not in receipt of domiciliary care allowance will lose &euro;86 per week when they lose entitlement to one-parent family allowance.  There are many claimants on primary social welfare payments who are entitled to this indefinitely.<\/p><p> Lone parents in full-time education may transfer to back-to-education allowance, although it is not guaranteed.  If they can do so, they will lose their student maintenance grant, a loss of &euro;2,375 per year or a total weekly loss of &euro;45.  Many will be forced to abandon their studies.<\/p><p> We believe there are many flaws in the policy.  First, the objective of the policy is to encourage lone parents into job activation and education, yet it is making it harder for those already fulfilling that objective.  Only parents who are already working, learning or caring will face any financial changes.  Second, the State has a mechanism to hold an absent parent responsible for costs incurred in maintaining a one-parent family with its maintenance recovery unit.  Once we change to jobseeker's allowance the State loses that mechanism.  There is no longer a liable relative and the State cannot recoup the money once a child turns seven. <\/p><p> We are also concerned about the treatment of child maintenance.  If a court orders &euro;100 to a child the State uses that to offset some of the payment to a jobseeker.  The state provides &euro;188 per week to all jobseekers, providing they comply with conditions.  If a court has ordered child maintenance the State is now using this income, ordered for the benefit of a child, to offset the cost of an adult jobseeker's payment.  There was legitimacy in this when the State was supporting a parent in a carer&rsquo;s role, but it is questionable whether the State can use child maintenance payments to pay statutory payments to an adult.<\/p><p> We believe there are discriminatory aspects to the legislation which may be challenged on family status grounds.  In a two-parent family on jobseeker's allowance only one parent is obliged to actively seek work.  There is no obligation on the second parent to engage in work outside the house, regardless of the age of the dependent children.  A one-parent family must look for work outside the home when their youngest child turns seven.<\/p><p> A lone parent who is also a carer will lose his or her primary social welfare payment and half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance when the youngest child turns seven.  However, an adult dependent claimant of a jobseeker is entitled to keep his or her primary payment and half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance indefinitely, regardless of the age of the children or whether or not he or she even has children.  Other categories of people on primary social welfare payments are entitled to keep their carer&rsquo;s allowance.  These include widows, deserted wives and pensioners.  There seems no justification for a parent of a seven-year old to be treated differently.  The State, through the homemaker's contribution scheme, supports a parent in a two-parent family for one of them to stay at home until a child is 12.  A parent in a one-parent family must become a job seeker once their child turns seven.  In July 2015 an estimated 39,000 families will lose their entitlement to one-parent family allowance.  We believe that our families will suffer greatly if these changes proceed.<\/p><p> We thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss this matter and to highlight the flaws inherent in the policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Louise Bayliss","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bayliss.

However, notwithstanding the availability of this support, and as members of the committee will be aware, lone parent families continue to experience high rates of consistent poverty compared to the population generally.<\/p> <p>  It is widely acknowledged that the best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through employment but it is also recognised that work, and especially full-time work, may not be an option for parents of young children.  Accordingly, there is no job-seeking conditionality associated with the one-parent family payment scheme.  The reforms which I will outline today seek to strike a balance between recognising that family commitments may constrain a lone parent&rsquo;s availability for work while at the same time start a process for engaging with, and providing support to, lone parents so that they can participate in education, training and work experience programmes.  In this way it is hoped to create a pathway to employment so that once their children reach an appropriate age, lone parents can improve their own, and their children's, economic and social circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The genesis of these reforms was contained in the 2006 report, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents.  This report recommended that a time limit for receipt of the payment be introduced.  The report also advocated that lone parents should be engaged with in a systematic manner to facilitate their movement to education, training and employment.<\/p> <p>  The report also acknowledged that Ireland&rsquo;s supports for lone parents were out of line with international norms, where there has been a general movement away from long-term and non-conditional support towards a more active engagement approach.  For example, in the United Kingdom the equivalent lone parent scheme, the income support for lone parents, ceases when the youngest child reaches the age of five.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt but I do not have a copy of Mr. Egan's script.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#L00400","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":620,"content":"<p>It is on the second page of the opening address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#L00500","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424264400,"counter":621,"content":"<p>The reforms to the one-parent family payment were first announced in 2010 and the first reforms were introduced in 2011.  Subsequent reforms were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012.  These reforms reduced the one-parent family payment qualifying age of the youngest child on a phased basis.  The final phase will see the maximum age under the one-parent family payment scheme being reduced to seven years for all recipients from 2 July 2015.  As a result of this change, once a recipient&rsquo;s youngest child reaches the new age limit, they will no longer be entitled to the one-parent family payment.  Should they still have an income need, they will transition to another social welfare income support payment appropriate to their circumstances, for example family income supplement or the new jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance transitional arrangement, which was introduced specifically for one-parent families in June 2013.<\/p> <p>  There are two exemptions to these changes.  The first is for lone parents who are in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance for one of their children.  They will continue to be entitled to one-parent family payment until that child&rsquo;s 16th birthday.  The second exemption is for those who are recently bereaved.  In these circumstances the one-parent family payment will be payable for two years from the date of death of the spouse, civil partner or co-habitant or until the youngest child reaches age 18, whichever occurs first.  It is anticipated that approximately 30,200 customers will transition on 2 July 2015.  As has happened every July since 2013, affected lone parents will be contacted by their local Intreo office inviting them to attend detailed information sessions.  At these sessions, lone parents will be briefed by departmental staff on their income support, training, education and employment support options and advised, on a case-by-case basis, as to the best available option for them.<\/p> <p>  In order to help lone parents with young children who are affected by this reform the Government introduced the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance transitional arrangement.  Under this arrangement, lone parents whose youngest child is aged between seven and 13 are exempt from having to be available for and genuinely seek full-time employment.  No lone parent with a child under 14 years of age will be required to take up employment in order to receive income support from the Department.<\/p><p>We estimate that approximately two thirds of the 30,000 cohort who will be affected will move into this payment.  <\/p><p> All jobseeker's allowance transition arrangement customers will have access to the Intreo services and will be given an opportunity, for the first time, to develop a personal development plan with an Intreo case officer.  This will enable them to gain enhanced access to educational and employment supports.  Individuals on the jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangement can move into employment, including part-time employment, if they wish, however, there is no requirement to do so in order to get the payment.  The jobseeker's allowance transitional arrangement thereby allows these customers to balance their caring responsibilities with progression into the active labour market.  I wish to bring to the committee's attention the fact that the Social Welfare Bill 2015, which was published today, will, if enacted, make the jobseeker's allowance transition arrangement available to all new lone parents, whereas previously one must have been formerly a recipient of the one-parent family payment.<\/p><p> There are a wide range of other options available to lone parents, including, for example, the combination of family income supplement and the new back to work family dividend in situations where the parents work more than 19 hours per week.  These will be explained to lone parents at the information session, which have already commenced in some parts of the country.  It is important that lone parents attend these information sessions in order to receive the best information and advice available given their individual circumstances.<\/p><p> I want to take issue with a comment made about the lack of planning in the Department.  This reform, as I acknowledged, has been on the tracks since 2010 and in its current guise since 2012.  The Department has been working from July two years ago in terms of the previous transitions and almost 11,000 people have made the transition to date.  As part of that reform, we have always engaged with lone parent representative groups.  We have a good working relationship with them.  We continuously brief them on new changes and amendments and on the impact they will have.  We have asked them to pass that information on to one-parent families.  We are always available.  I have attended and responded to requests for briefing session from representative groups, but I stress that the work at the local level during the past two years is key to why this reform has gone the way it has gone to date.  That comes down to the work of the local Intreo offices whose officers have gone out and ensured that lone parents attend the office and where they did not attend, they followed up by way of telephoned calls and brought them in on a one-to-one basis to inform them of what is happening and what are the best options available to them.  <\/p><p> I hope I have given the committee an insight into the steps Department is taking to streamline and improve services and employment outcomes for lone parents.  We are have very happy to take any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Egan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":623,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Egan.

I also thank the Department officials for explaining where they are coming from in terms of the Department's side.  There are a few aspects of this that I have difficulty understanding.  Reference was made to the availability of the family income supplement for working lone parents and the family income dividend and so on, but regardless of that, and taking into account that they will have access to increased family income supplement and access to the family income dividend as a result of the legislation published today, the point is that they are still going to be worse off.  Working lone parents will be financially worse off, by and large, as a result of these changes.  That is the net point we are trying to make.  The figures are there to demonstrate that.<\/p> <p>  I wonder about the motivation for this.  We have raised this issue on numerous occasions both at this committee and in the D&aacute;il and the Minister keeps talking about activation to encourage people, to take people out of the dependency on social welfare and into the workplace.  As a result of the changes during the past few years, a lone parent who works fewer than 19 hours per week will now be &euro;54 per week less well off - in respect of one child - than they would have been four years ago.  Instead of getting &euro;150 - forgive me if I am &euro;1 or &euro;2 out - in addition to the lone parent's allowance, they will now get less than &euro;100, about &euro;96.  How does that create an incentive?  We have the family income supplement as an incentive for people to take up low paid jobs, as one gets the family income supplement payment in addition to one's pay.  It widens the gap between what one comes home with in one's pocket and what one would have got if one had remained on social welfare.  That is an incentive.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the availability of the family income dividend will enable people, in certain circumstances, who go into low paid jobs to retain the child dependant element of social welfare benefit for a year, going down to 50% after one year, but at least they will be getting something for two years.  The fact that they will be getting something is an incentive.  That is my interpretation of an incentive or a measure to activate a person.  When one starts to do the opposite to that, one creates what I would regard as a disincentive.  One of the witnesses said when responding to earlier questions that quite a number of lone parents dropped out of the community employment schemes because the financial provision changed for the worse.  That is what happens in the real world.  When people get more of an incentive they are inclined to act accordingly and when there is a disincentive they act in precisely the opposite way.  That is human nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#M00300","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy that he has used his allocated three minutes and I ask him to put his question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#M00400","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I could talk about people who work more than 19 hours per week and how much money they will lose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#M00500","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":627,"content":"<p>To be fair to other members, the Deputy might put his question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#M00600","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I have a few brief questions.  How exactly will these changes benefit lone parents who are not working?  How will they ease their access to employment and training measures?

I do not have time to read a communication in this respect that was brought to my attention by my colleague, Deputy Barry Cowen, this morning.  I have received communications and letters from lone parents who are in the third level system who advise that they will have to drop out as a result of the changes that have been made. <\/p> <p>  What will the effect of these changes on carers?  A carer who is a lone parent currently gets their one parent's allowance and a half-carer's allowance.  When they lose their lone parent's allowance when their child is over the age of seven, they will simply get a the full carer's allowance, which is estimated to be &euro;80 or &euro;90 per week less.

Mention was made of the 2006 report.  That report was not implemented, even by the previous Government, with all its faults, because it set a different timescale.  The fact that a Minister in this Government pursued it with gusto, in particular in 2012, highlights the ill-thought out strategy around the cuts to the one-parent family payments.  My key issue is that in a response by the current Minister last month she outlined the numbers that would be affected substantially by these changes.  Some 800 one-parent families who are in receipt a carer's allowance will lose &euro;86 per week.  Even for those of us who are in full employment, and who have other family members in employment, &euro;86 a week is a substantial amount.  The Minister went on to say that up to 6,400 one-parent families will lose up to &euro;36.50 per week, another group of 4,500 one-parent families will lose up to &euro;57 a week.  That is not taking into account, as was mentioned by the group representing the parents, the cumulative effects of other cuts prior to this and other consequences.  Rents have increased and the cost of going to college and the cost of child care - which is what this is about - have increased.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the Department officials.<\/p><p>It is a policy matter and the official might be able to say he is sorry but he cannot answer it, but when this measure was introduced the Minister promised that she would not proceed with any of the changes unless we had the Scandinavian model of child care.  Where stands that from the Department's point of view, because one was supposed to follow the other?  Has any consideration been given to suspending the measure this year given that the policy position has not been achieved?  That is key.  If the Minister is not willing to row back, there is nothing to prevent her suspending the measure until such time as her ideal has been achieved.<\/p><p> It was stated that the system was out of step with international norms.  Why is the international norm not out of step with what we did?  We should never be in a race to the bottom.  It should be the opposite in that we should be setting standards.  The representatives of lone parents would probably be the best people to answer the next question.  Based on their work, how many women or men who are in this predicament are trying to stay out of work?  Even the Government report dating to 2006 highlighted the fact that the vast majority of people who are parenting alone wanted to go back to work, or in fact found work, before their children reached the age of seven anyway.  That information is key in terms of how we approach the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#M01100","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":634,"content":"<p>The 2006 report must be seen against a backdrop of nearly full employment or when we all thought we had full employment and that things would never change.  Things have changed drastically and that must be taken into consideration.  I would like the committee to seriously tease out whether we are putting a cohort of people into more deprivation than is the case currently.  The SILC report referred to a rate of 63% in 2013.  I asked Mr. Egan about the reduction in employment rates.  He said in 2013 it was 36% but it has increased slightly.  He said the number of lone parents on community employment, CE, schemes reduced from approximately 10,000 jobs to 1,800 jobs.  They were majorly impacted from that point of view.  Mr. Egan said the numbers have gone up again.<\/p> <p>  There are questions to be asked about the quality of jobs done by lone parents but we have not heard anything about that.  Questions must also be asked about why the Government introduced legislation in 2012 that put people in work in a position where they could lose up to &euro;53.  I find that phenomenal.  We are not even talking about the cohort of lone parents who are not working as they have not been able to find work.  We are talking about people who will lose out substantially in their weekly income because of those changes.  That beggars belief.  The committee must tease out the matter with the Department in terms of whether we can stand over it.  I would like the committee to consider whether to recommend to the Minister that the initiative would go ahead and how long the change should last.  The issue must be linked to child care.  It was not part of the legislation, but we were emphatically told in the D&aacute;il Chamber by the Minister, Deputy Burton, that none of the changes would be introduced unless affordable child care was specifically introduced in the budget.  That has not happened.  I do not understand how we can put so many lone parents into a situation where they are caught between a rock and a hard place.  We cannot stand over that.  We must take hard decisions in the committee today or else have a specific meeting to discuss the issue more broadly.

I am of the firm belief that nobody should be better off unemployed than working, yet it appears that is the case.  On the one hand the Department recognises the importance of having a parent in the home until the age of 12 by awarding a homemaker&rsquo;s credit to a parent who chooses to be at home to look after the children, but, on the other, we say there is no need for a parent to be at home when a child has reached the age of seven and that the parent can go out to work.  Is it possible that a one-parent family could get a transition payment and a half rate of a carer&rsquo;s payment?  It has been said that they do not have to be available for work.  In that case, would the transition payment and the half-rate carer's payment be available to them under the new scheme?<\/p> <p>  If a domiciliary care allowance has been granted to a parent for a child, he or she is exempt, but what about a parent who has a child over 16 on disability allowance?  A 16 year old is only a child.  Likewise, what about someone who is caring for an adult?  Why is he or she not exempt just because he or she does not have a domiciliary care allowance?  Surely the same rules should apply to anyone who is caring?<\/p> <p>  In her presentation, Ms Bayliss, mentioned the liable relatives.  That is something that is always left out of discussions when we talk about one-parent families.  Nobody ever seems to think there is another parent of the children.  That seems to go amiss generally, but reference was made to it.  Could the officials let us know what are the statistics in terms of chasing up people for maintenance, and what happens when the parent living with the child transfers to a transition payment?  Does the liability on the other parent fall at that stage or will the Department still chase him or her for maintenance?<\/p> <p>  The elephant in the room is child care.  It is the most important issue to address not just for lone parents, but for working families.  Child care in this country is unaffordable for every family and the matter must be addressed.  Could the officials indicate whether there is ongoing discussion between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Social Protection and, if there is, could we have an update on when we will move to safe and affordable child care in this country?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#N00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I will continue to allow members to ask questions.

Given that the purpose of the change was to incentivise people to go to work and find jobs, has the Department seen the figures that have been presented by SPARK in that regard?  It appears to be the case that a parent with one child who is working 20 hours a week would lose &euro;50.72 per week.  Does the Department accept those figures are correct?  Does it also accept that if the purpose was to incentivise people to go back to work, the effect has been to hit people who are already at work?

There are great difficulties for single parents in particular being able to access child care.<\/p> <p>  I am a firm believer that education pays.  When one educates a person, it puts them into a position where they are not dependent on the State and they can move on in their lives as well, and so can their children.<\/p><p>My question is to Mr. Egan and Mr. McKeon.  There seems to be a very low uptake of the after-school child care, ASCC, scheme.  Only 172 parents are availing of the scheme, which supports 236 children.  Why is the uptake so low?  Is it simply to do with spreading the news about scheme or is it about getting single parents to understand the reason for the scheme?<\/p><p> I have been studying this area, including single parents.  I am sorry for referring to single parents, lone parents and one parent; we are all parents whether we like it or not.  I made the observation that in respect of a lone parent with two children who is returning to education, if their weekly allowance, the back to education allowance and their children's allowance is averaged out, the figure is about &euro;1,500 a month.  That is more than &euro;359 a week.  That is a substantial amount of money, leaving aside bills and so on.  I have gone through this in great detail and found that after every bill is paid there is a surplus of &euro;80 a week.  Can Mr. McKeon explain why we are not promoting the back to education allowance more strongly and getting more young people, particularly single parents, back into the workforce?  I understand the child care problem in terms of looking after children, but what are we doing actively to promote this allowance, which I believe is the key to this question?  These people are trying to rear their children on their own but they want to avail of this service and get back into education.  The money is available; the statistics show that.  \"Profitable\" is not a good word to use but it is worthwhile for these people to go back into education because the system allows it.  The down side of it is the child care issue.  We all know that without the support of families, friends and neighbours, many people would not be able to get back into the system.  What is the percentage uptake of the back to education scheme, particularly among lone parents?  How is it being promoted?  We spoke about the Intreo offices.

SPARK might confirm that it does not even include the impact of the loss of the concurrent payment, which is on top of this, and, therefore, we have had a double whammy of dramatic proportions.  I would like to hear what the Department has to say about that because in terms of the logic the Minister outlined when all these measures were being brought in and about which there was much heated debate in the D&aacute;il at the time about labour activation, we have unequivocal evidence that the opposite is the case.  What we have got is labour deactivation and disincentivisation, and that is reflected in the fall-off in the numbers of people on community enterprise schemes that he has just acknowledged.  It strikes me, but I would like to hear his comment on it, that there has to be some correlation between this and the dramatic figures we have seen recently in terms of increased levels of deprivation and increased levels of child poverty among lone parents.  I suspect a big cohort of that child poverty increase is the children of lone parents.  The reason I was not here earlier was because I was attending a young people's protest about child suicide, which is awful.  I am not saying there is a direct correlation with that but in terms of deprivation and a worsening situation for lone parents who are hit disproportionately, is there an acknowledgement on the part of the Department that we have got this wrong and that it needs to be remedied?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the carers, which may have been raised by other members, I asked some questions about this and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#O00900","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":648,"content":"<p>The Deputy might leave that question because I can only give him three minutes and he is almost out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#O01000","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":649,"content":"<p>If a carer is looking after adults, not children, he or she will lose &euro;86.

A promise was made to our families that this would not go ahead without affordable child care but yet, it is going ahead without affordable child care.  As everyone has seen, it is obviously affecting working lone parents.  That is what we want to emerge from today's meeting.  Deputy Boyd Barrett made a point about the two different payments, which highlights there is an element of discrimination against our families.  The point I am making is this is discrimination against our families.  Members should consider the deprivation rates of 63% and yet, these cuts will affect the poorest families who are working.  Obviously, the issue of child care is important but child care is more than just baby-sitting because people with a child who is over 14 now have a choice between jobseeker's allowance or their part-time jobs.  Why would one take people out of their part-time jobs?  Why take people out of any type of employment as this simply does not make any sense?

A number of people made reference to concurrent payment and community employment and took the fact that the number of people on community employment and lone parent's allowance has fallen as evidence of deactivation, rather than activation.  I make this point from an activation perspective but it is important not to confuse a place on a scheme with being activated.  Most members of the joint committee will be aware of the very strong criticisms that have been made in the past of community employment as an activation programme.  These included some reports from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which questioned fundamentally the relevance of community employment, as well as the very low progression rates out of that scheme, particularly among lone parents, where people effectively used the concurrent payment and stayed on it for a very long time.  They were not progressing into employment but were getting a top-up payment by doing something in the community employment sector.  The general point I wished to make is that is not the same as activation.<\/p> <p>  The second general point I wish to make is with regard to the references to deprivation and the survey on income and living conditions, SILC.  It is not necessarily a subject to go into at this committee meeting but this might be possible at a subsequent meeting.  There are some headline numbers contained within the survey that everybody will grab and it is understandable why people will do so.  It is an extremely complicated study and the actual real story is not necessarily the story that is portrayed in the headline numbers.  At some stage, it probably is worth having a committee meeting on the survey and I am sure the Department would be happy to appear before the committee and give its views on it.  As I mentioned, to get into it now would take hours but members should be aware that some of the headline numbers are not necessarily reflective of all the numbers it contains.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":666,"content":"<p>Mr. Egan should now try to address as many of those questions as he can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#P00700","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424264400,"counter":667,"content":"<p>I will do my best and if I miss anything, perhaps the clerk will bring it to my attention and I will follow up with Deputies and Senators.  The key point to make here is the rationale for the reform.  In 1997, we introduced the one-parent family payment and it has been in place since then.  At that stage and as was the case until recently, an individual lone parent could receive the one-parent family payment until the youngest child was 18 or 22 years of age if that child was in full-time education.  What has happened and what we have noticed since 1997 ties in with some earlier comments that lone parents have more than double the rate of consistent poverty when compared with the population as a whole.  When there is no conditionality on the one-parent family payment and when it ceases, all of a sudden one has people, typically women, coming in and looking for a jobseeker's payment only to be told they must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.  In some cases - I acknowledge completely not in all cases - these people have had no experience of work and nor do they have education or training attainment.  This transition essentially is what leads to these people to struggle and more often than not, they become long-term unemployed based on the figures provided earlier by my colleague, Mr. John McKeon.  This is the situation we are trying to avoid.  Basically, since 1997 the Department has not engaged properly with lone-parent families.  We have had a situation in which we gave them an income support payment and left them.  We had nothing in terms of follow-up and did not engage with them in terms of education, training or employment supports to identify what they needed to bring in or to assist them to have better outcomes for themselves and their children.<\/p> <p>  One point I wish to highlight to the committee is just how significant are the changes the jobseeker's allowance transition payment has introduced in this regard.  When the reform in its current guise was first introduced in legislation in 2012, there was huge fear among lone parents, which was completely understandable, that in its original guise, from the time the child was aged seven they would be expected to be available and genuinely seeking full-time work.  Realistically, how could that be achieved for a lone parent with a young child in terms of child care, about which we have already talked today?  It could not and that is why the jobseeker's allowance transition payment was introduced the following year.  It is in recognition that the existing supports for the child care element were not there and yet is addressing the fact that lone parents had a justifiable fear that they would be required to seek employment and take up any sort of job.  This alludes to a point raised by Deputy Joan Collins in respect of precarious employment.  That is now removed and they will not be required, as I stated in my opening statement, in terms of taking up a job.  They will be supported and will have the opportunity to have an intensive engagement with a case officer.  For the first time ever, they will have a personal development plan, the idea being to give them the opportunity to upskill and get a better job for themselves and their children.<\/p> <p>  As for the 30,000 people who are coming off the scheme in July, I wish to highlight that two thirds of those people will not suffer any loss or in fact will gain on foot of this reform and it is important to note that.  Obviously, however, the inverse of this point concerns the one third who will suffer a loss.  I am familiar with the figures that Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK, has produced in that regard.  However, of that one third, it is important to note that 60% of them have the opportunity, if they can increase their hours of work and qualify for family income supplement, to be better off financially than they are at present.  This is a very important message we are trying to get out to lone parents and it is true.  These are people who do not currently qualify for the family income supplement.  I believe I was asked by Deputy Ryan whether the figures produced by SPARK are accurate.  While they are not quite 100% accurate, they are in the ball park and give one a sense of the scale.  I will not argue over very small amounts of money and they are accurate in that context.  However, it is important to note that we have been through two Julys already in respect of this reform and I refer to what the evidence shows as to what happened on those two points.  From our perspective, there is no evidence to date that lone parents are giving up work.  They make the transition to the jobseeker's allowance transition payment or - as we constantly are pushing - the family income supplement.  Over the past two Julys, we have noticed there has been a significant increase in lone parents making first-time applications for the family income supplement.  This indicates they are getting up to 19 hours work per week and when they do that, they are financially better off than they were under the one-parent family payment scheme.  On foot of the introduction of the back-to-work family dividend, the position is further improved.  However, I acknowledge the broad lines of the figures that SPARK has produced.  There is a cohort of people who will lose out but the reform must be put in the context of the entire population of lone parents.<\/p> <p>  The issue of carers came up quite regularly.  As the T&aacute;naiste announced two weeks ago in the D&aacute;il, this issue is being examined and is almost at a final stage.  I cannot go into anything more than that but the Department is highly conscious of the loss in this regard.  I acknowledge that &euro;86 per week is a highly significant loss and as the T&aacute;naiste has stated, this matter is under serious consideration at present.  I cannot say anything more than that at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#P00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":668,"content":"<p>What about the double payments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#P00900","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":669,"content":"<p>As we are against the clock, we should allow Mr. Egan finish his contribution.

A higher percentage of lone parents have a tendency to be in precarious employment and I note the recent coverage of child care being an area in which there are highly-skilled jobs with low pay.  While this is an issue, it is why the jobseeker's transition payment gives these parents the opportunity, for the first time ever in the State and we should have been doing this a long time ago, to engage with the Department and for the Department to give them a helping support to improve their education and training attainment in the hope that they can get a better job.  As for the liable relatives issue, the Department is aware of it.  It is not currently under the jobseeker's legislation but is something we will be considering in the future.<\/p><p>I do not have statistics for Senator Moloney on maintenance but I can certainly look into this and revert to her.<\/p><p> With regard to child care, as I stated, the key measure to be addressed first is the jobseeker's allowance transition payment.  It largely negates the need for a lot of child care provision.  Someone with a young child can qualify for the FIS and still not require child care provision because FIS involves 19 hours, which works out at just under four hours per day.  Admittedly, this is not possible in all circumstances but it is possible for a lone parent with a child in school to match what is required.<\/p><p> I said at the start that child care is a considerable issue.  The country has struggled with it and it has been the subject of much attention in recent weeks and months.  The Department is working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on this and we have done our best in this regard to introduce new schemes, including the after-school child care scheme and the CE child care scheme.  There are approximately 40,000 subsidised child care places for low-income parents.  Therefore, there is provision.  Is this how it should be?  The matter is complex, as Mr. Duffin has said.  The system is not perfect and needs to be addressed; there is no doubt about that.  As I stated, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will be examining this through its new group.  We will be feeding into that process.<\/p><p> With regard to Deputy Byrne's specific question on after-school child care and the low take-up, a number of issues are at play.  One involves the complexity of the scheme when first launched.  We have made changes in that regard and streamlined the scheme.  We have focused considerably on promoting it through local offices but the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is actually responsible for promoting it and does so through the county child care committees.  That is a key issue.<\/p><p> The regional spread is also an issue.  However, it should be noted that while there are plenty of places in certain parts of the country, the take-up remains low.  We must investigate this.  We have already said we will carry out a survey of the participants and those who inquired about but did not take up a place.  We will feed our findings into the work of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs' group on child care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015021800002#P01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Egan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424264400,"counter":672,"content":"<p>We must conclude.

I call on the Minister to give his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015021800002#A00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1424278800,"counter":688,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to appear before the select committee today in connection with the 2015 Estimates for my Department and for the offices under the ambit of my Department, including the Revenue Commissioners, the Appeal Commissioners and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I thank the Officers of my Department for their ongoing dedication and commitment as we continue to develop sustainable macro-economic, fiscal and financial services strategies for the future and work through external programme support monitoring.<\/p> <p>  Before we commence our discussion of the 2015 Estimates, I would like to touch briefly on the key outputs of the Department during 2014.  During the course of 2014, our EU and international division continued to engage at various fora with a view to representing, protecting and advancing Ireland's interests on the wider stage.  Following the successful exit from the EU-IMF programme in 2013, the work of the division was refocused on maximising Ireland's position in a post-programmes environment including, managing the EU semester and our interaction with the European institutions, the IMF and the OECD.  <\/p> <p>  A key element of the work of the division in 2014 was the re-financing of the IMF loans, a transaction that will deliver at least &euro;1.5 billion in savings to Ireland over the lifetime of the loans.  To date, two repayments totalling some &euro;12.5 billion, representing 54% of our &euro;22.5 billion IMF loan facility, have been completed.  The impact of this - the reduction of the interest bill on the national debt - reduces the amount of tax revenues and borrowing that go towards financing the debt.  This frees up resources for investment in activities that will grow the economy and create jobs and opportunities.  This has knock-on benefits across the economy and can lower the cost of debt for businesses and families.<\/p> <p>  In the banking and financial services area, the division delivered against an extensive list of objectives across the sector.  The banks continue to make significant progress in regaining financial health and have benefited from the general improvement in the macro-economic environment.  To date, this progress has allowed us to commence the process of monetising our banking investments with the sale of our Bank of Ireland, BOI, debt instruments.  Much of the banking-related work in the Department of Finance in 2015 will now focus on AIB.  Given the nature of our investment and the range of options available to recoup value from the bank, officials within my Department are working with AIB on reconfiguring its capital structure.  Goldman Sachs International has been appointed to provide financial advice to the Department in this regard.<\/p><p> Both AIB and BOI returned to profit in the first half of 2014, on the back of improving interest margins and reduced levels of impairments.  With this improvement in profitability, the rate of the regulatory capital build in 2014 at AIB and BOI has been impressive.  The funding position for Irish banks is in good shape with both AIB and BOI comfortably within the required loan-to-deposit ratio and with ready access to the wholesale debt markets at a cost that continues to improve.  Overall the results of the recent ECB comprehensive assessment confirm the strength of the Irish banking system.  Arrears management is an area of continued focus and the banks are beginning to make real progress in this area with reductions in non-performing loans evidenced across all loan portfolios.  The latest Central Bank statistics show that the number of mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses in arrears fell for the fifth consecutive quarter.<\/p><p> In other areas of financial services, the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, is focused on the new IFS strategy where we will look to build on the success of this important sector of the export economy, which contributes to State revenue as well as employing some 35,000 people directly.  The EU legislative reform programme continues, with progress across a number of areas, including the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, the Single Supervisory Mechanism, and the Single Resolution Mechanism-Fund.<\/p><p> The key objective for the fiscal policy division in 2014 was to continue to deliver on our deficit targets and to reduce the debt.  Restoring ordering to the public finances was a necessary precondition for the growth that we are now experiencing.  Taxes continued to perform ahead of targets and we have been exceeding our deficit target in 2014 and are on track to reduce the deficit below 3% in 2015.<\/p><p> Considerable resources were also focused on an extensive study of Ireland's corporation tax policy during 2014.  This resulted in a budget day publication of an Economic Impact Assessment of Ireland's Corporation Tax Policy', a comprehensive output the purpose of which was to quantify the effect of the three elements underpinning Ireland's corporation tax policy - rate, regime and reputation.  Comprehensive reviews, involving public consultation exercises, were completed in respect of the special assignee relief programme, the foreign earnings deduction and the employment and investment incentive.  A review of tax measures in the farming sector, which was announced in budget 2014 as a joint initiative between the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, was also completed, resulting in the publication of the agri-tax review.  This review detailed a number of recommendations for the agri-tax area, and a cost-benefit analysis of these measures.<\/p><p> Ireland is fully committed to the OECD BEPS process but we must also secure our revenue stream which provides the necessary funding for our public expenditure.  In this context, the division therefore also focused the opportunities for Ireland in an international tax policy context.  The recently published A Road Map for Ireland's Tax Competitiveness updates Ireland's international tax strategy and sets out a comprehensive package of competitive tax measures designed to reposition Ireland to reap the benefits of sustainable foreign direct investment and a changing international tax landscape.<\/p><p> The budget introduced in October was also the first mildly expansionary budget introduced by this Government and significant resources were focused on reforms to the income tax system to support those at work and create jobs.  The changes to the income tax system introduced in budget 2015 which came into effect last month mean that all those who pay income tax and-or USC are seeing an increase in their take home pay when compared to someone on the same income level last year.  As Deputies will be aware, this is the first phase of a reform plan to reduce the tax burden on low and middle-income earners.<\/p><p> The economic division continued to engage in research projects designed to inform our policy options and macroeconomic framework in order to better support the Department and the Government in decision-making.  In pursuit of this strategy, my Department recently signed an agreement with the Economic and Social Research Institute with the aim of undertaking and disseminating research on various macroeconomic and taxation issues.<\/p><p> Both economic activity and employment are on the rise again in Ireland.  The latest economic forecasts were published by the Department of Finance in October last for budget 2015.  They include forecast increases in gross domestic product of 4.7% for 2014 and 3.9% for 2015.  The rate of economic growth in Ireland was the fastest in the EU.  The national accounts figures for the third quarter of 2014 broadly support the expected outturn for 2014 in relation to total economic activity as well as for employment, exports and domestic demand.  More recent hard data has strengthened the assessment that 2014 was a very good year for the Irish economy and they provide positive indicators for 2015.<\/p><p> Growth is coming from two main sources, the domestic-facing economy and the foreign-owned sector.  Consumer spending was strong in 2014, with retail sales up over 6% compared with 2013.  Manufacturing production in 2014 as a whole was 20.9% higher than in 2013.  The total number of new vehicles licensed in January this year was some 26% higher than in January 2014.  Consumer confidence is at a seven-year high in January and tax revenues grew by 9% last year.<\/p><p> The recovery has been most evident in the labour market, which is a key Government priority.  The trend in unemployment continues to be strongly and steadily downward.  While still unacceptably high, unemployment has fallen from over 15% to 10.5% in only three years.  Over 80,000 jobs have been created since the low point of 2012.  Jobs have been created right across the economy, in virtually all sectors.<\/p><p> Inflation was low in 2014, with an average increase in the HICP of 0.3% for the year as a whole.  Inflationary pressures are also expected to remain relatively muted in 2015, with the fall in oil prices having a major influence on this assessment.<\/p><p> Although Ireland's economic performance was strong in 2014 and we are expecting the economy to maintain its upward trend in 2015, there are, of course, risks attached to this benign scenario.  These risks stem from both external and domestic sources.  Continued low inflation in the euro area presents a risk in that it could lead households and firms to defer spending and investment.  As against this, however, the ECB's recent quantitative easing announcement is to be welcomed as it should help to avert this threat as well as benefiting the Irish economy in other ways.  Another risk is that if more robust growth in our main trading markets fails to materialise this could have a negative impact on our exports.<\/p><p> Although we are, of course, dependent on growth in our trading partners, our experience in recent years has demonstrated that the Irish economy is flexible and resilient, as well as having developed greater competitive strengths than before.  I, therefore, have confidence that this increased economic strength, combined with the Government's commitment to fiscal discipline, would enable the Irish economy to cope if external growth was to be slower than expected.<\/p><p> Turning to the public finances, it is important to note that, since 2008, Ireland has introduced consolidation measures in the region of &euro;30 billion, or almost 17% of GDP.  These measures were strategically implemented in a manner that was in line with international best practice, that is, the majority - over 60% - of the consolidation measures have been on the expenditure side.  Furthermore, in tax measures introduced during this period, the strategy has been to widen the tax base while ensuring a fair, efficient and competitive income tax system, which is essential for economic growth and job creation.  The implementation of these measures has seen Ireland make significant progress in correcting the imbalances in the public finances and enabled us to consistently overachieve compared to the Excessive Deficit Procedure, EDP, fiscal targets.  I am confident that the 2014 deficit target will also be met by a significant margin.<\/p><p> Budget 2015 targets a deficit of 2.7% of GDP for 2015, which provides a prudent buffer to achieving a GDP deficit of less than 3%.  I would fully expect that the continuing revenue growth and expenditure restraint will enable Ireland to exit the Excessive Deficit Procedure in 2015.<\/p><p> With regard to the National Asset Management Agency, the end of 2014 NAMA had redeemed a total of &euro;16.6 billion in senior bonds, which represents 55% of senior bonds issued.  If one includes IBRC-related bonds, total redemptions have reached &euro;29.5 billion.<\/p><p>This significantly reduces the contingent liability for the State, from a possible &euro;43 billion to &euro;13.5 billion at year end 2014.  These redemptions yield benefits in terms of the creditworthiness of the sovereign.  This has been clearly stated in statements by the credit rating agencies as they have upgraded the Irish sovereign, in part, reflecting the positive impact they consider that NAMA's actual and planned accelerated disposal programme is and will continue to have on Ireland's creditworthiness.  Of particular importance has been the manner in which NAMA has not just consistently met but exceeded its targets.  NAMA is confident, assuming current market performance is sustained, that it will be in a position to fully repay its borrowings and hopes to achieve a surplus over its life, thus eliminating the State's contingent liability.<br\/><br\/>Deputies will be aware that the joint committee of inquiry into the banking crisis was established last year.  The Department is fully committed to supporting the work of the committee and is currently in the process of sourcing, examining and formatting the substantial number of records requested.  We have already provided a substantial number of records and will continue to do so.  This commitment to deliver applies equally across all areas of work in the Department.  It is a knowledge-based professional organisation with enormous responsibility and accountability to deliver to its stakeholders.  Changes already implemented ensure that resources are directed towards key priorities.  This is complimented by the Department's investment and focus on performance management, enhancement in its IT systems, employee engagement, workforce planning and learning and development.  These initiatives and developments are being managed and led by a senior management team and are actively contributed to and supported by staff.  <br\/><br\/>Our change programme for 2015 is focused on continuous improvement and higher performance levels.  We will continue to develop and implement underlying actions to our HR strategy to achieve our strategic goals and deliver public value.  We will enhance and promote good corporate governance and compliance so that we can best deliver on our objectives in a professional, fair and balanced manner.  Through collaboration with Office of Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, we will continue to invest in the roll-out of our ICT strategy as a key enabler to introduce innovation to and transform the way in which we work that achieves our business needs and assist us to deliver public value.  We will also work with the Office of Public Works and other tenants to ensure that we maximise efficient and co-ordinated usage of our physical facilities.  <br\/><br\/>The ongoing programme of economic repair, having regard to social recovery, will require that we partner and exploit synergies with our colleagues in other Departments, as well as public and private sector bodies.  We will continue our strategic collaboration and partnership with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to achieving our common goal of ensuring the long term sustainability of the public finances while also delivering widespread positive outcomes for all stakeholders, including citizens, businesses and public servants.  My Department is fully committed to the ongoing programme of change in the Civil Service which seeks to build capacity to respond to existing and future challenges and improve the performance of the Civil Service and its staff.  Strong leadership and active participation in the implementation of this programme of change will be a key focus over the period.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the business of the committee today, the funding allocation sought for the Finance group of Votes for 2015 totals &euro;368 million and compares to a 2014 Vote group total of &euro;358 million.  This represents an increase of 3%, which is largely driven by a technical requirement to provide for 27 fortnightly payrolls in 2015 - an addition of some &euro;9 million to the Vote group.  The remainder arises because of the need to provide for additional resources in Revenue and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which I will come back to later.<br\/><br\/>Some &euro;31 million of the 2015 Vote group allocation provides for the administrative and non-administrative costs of the Department of Finance.  This allocation is broadly unchanged compared to 2014.  Almost 61% of this is provided to cover pay bills, with a further &euro;4 million to cover facilities and non-pay administrative costs, a large portion of which is in respect of transactional pension, banking and financial management shared services.  Costs will reduce in this area over the next few years as these services transition to the shared services Vote.  The remainder of the gross Estimate is provided to enable the Department to widen its engagement at an international level, to be proactive in addressing policy issues and to secure a robust banking system and economic climate.  As I indicated at the outset, our ongoing focus is the development of strategies to secure a functioning and sustainable macro-economic environment, which will lead to a better standard of living for our citizens, to promote domestic consumption and sustainable lending, and to continue to implement improvements within the domestic and international financial services sector.<br\/><br\/>With regard to Vote 8, the budget of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is applied towards a single programme with the following outputs: auditing the financial statements of public bodies and issuing audit opinions; control of issues from the Central Fund; examining and reporting on financial management arrangements in public bodies and the value for money of public services.  Members will be aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General also assists the Committee of Public Accounts in its scrutiny of the public finances.  Additional resources of &euro;760,000 have been allocated to this office in 2015 to enable it to address capacity issues and a build up of work in the financial audit directorate.<br\/><br\/>On Vote 9, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners has requested a budget allocation of &euro;329 million, an increase of &euro;9 million or 2.8% on the 2014 net Estimate, of which 74% is related to pay for an employment ceiling of 5,874 staff.  The Revenue Commissioners, as the Irish tax and customs administration, plays a vital role in our economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State.  These receipts underpin Government's capacity to meet our debt obligations and to fund vital services and facilities for society.  In my Budget Statement I signalled an increase in Revenue resources as one of the elements of the corporate tax reform road map to reflect its role as competent authority and in recognition of the many changes taking place globally in corporate tax.  I fully support Revenue's proactive approach in sourcing the skilled professional and technical expertise required to allow it to deliver on its challenging role.  The additional provision for 2015 will provide for 20 staff for international taxation, 50 permanent staff for the local property tax project and 56 auditors in line with proposals by Revenue in its comprehensive review of expenditure.<br\/><br\/>In 2014, net tax and duty receipts increased by 3.1% over budget to &euro;41.28 billion, the fourth successive year-on-year increase in returns to the Exchequer.  Revenue also reduced total tax debt, maintained high levels of compliance for the taxes and duties under its care and management and delivered quality services to make it easier and less costly for taxpayers to voluntarily comply.  As one example of the work undertaken, Revenue achieved a 95% compliance rate and collected &euro;491 million in local property tax, including household charge arrears.  This, together with timely filing and payment compliance rates of 99% for our largest business cases and 97% for medium sized business cases, is evidence of a strong compliance culture among Irish taxpayers.  Furthermore, during 2014 Revenue introduced the online home renovation incentive systems.  The level of home renovation incentive activity<i><\/i>is significant with over 14,000 properties benefiting from the scheme in respect of works with a value in excess of &euro;290 million.  In addition to increasing employment and activity in the construction sector, this incentive supports legitimate trade and improves the competitiveness of legitimate contractors and enables Revenue to develop additional compliance programmes to identify and tackle shadow economy activity within the construction sector.<br\/><br\/>In its new Statement of Strategy for 2015-17, Revenue is committed to two key strategic priorities: to make it easier and less costly to voluntarily comply and to identify and confront non-compliance.<\/p><p>On making it easier and less costly to comply with tax and customs requirements, Revenue will promote the delivery of quality information and services, as well as the early resolution of taxpayers inquiries.  To achieve this it intends to promote self-service and electronic channels as its primary service provision channels.  Where electronic or self-service engagement is not a viable option, an excellent telephone service, organised around the needs of the taxpayers, will be provided.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately non-compliance is still a feature.  To support and to underpin its efforts to support voluntary compliance Revenue will confront non-compliance on a risk priority basis.  Revenue intends to maximise the use of data and the deployment of analytics and risk assessment approaches to identify the incidence, scale and significance of non-compliance and to target its resources to successfully confront and overcome those risks.  In this way Revenue will identify and challenge all forms of shadow economy activity, tackle organised crime activity and smuggling and confront aggressive tax and duty avoidance.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that Revenue collaborated with a wide range of Departments and agencies on the implementation of Government policies and on the international side, Revenue has been an active contributor in the development of EU and OECD initiatives providing for the automatic exchange of information between tax administrations and the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, action plan.  In 2014, Ireland continued to expand its network of international agreements with the signature of two new double taxation treaties, bringing the number of signed treaties in place to 72.  Another example of collaboration will be the joint introduction of a new fuel marker in Ireland and the UK to counter fuel laundering.  Revenue will continue to contribute to our economic recovery and support the Government's medium-term economic strategy by collecting taxes and duties as efficiently and effectively as possible.<br\/><br\/>In my Budget Statement for 2014, I also announced a reform of the role, functions and structure of the Office of the Appeal Commissioners.  It is expected that legislation will be introduced in 2015 providing, <i>inter alia<\/i>, for the establishment of a new tax appeals commission.  Accordingly, the proposed allocation for Vote 10 - Office of the Appeal Commissioners has been increased by &euro;300,000, or 63%, in 2015 to reflect the part-year funding required to advance this reform.<br\/><br\/>I thank members for their attention and I commend the Revised Estimates for the Department of Finance group of Votes to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015021800002#A00700","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424278800,"counter":692,"content":"<p>We will begin the discussion on Vote 7- Office of the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015021800002#D00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1424278800,"counter":693,"content":"<p>Is there a change from monthly pay to fortnightly pay?

There is an increase in the budget for 2015 which appears to relate to the recruitment of some additional staff.  In the notes we have, there is a reference to a build-up of arrears of some reports that have not been completed, presumably because of a lack of staff on the reporting side.  Could the Minister provide some details on that? Are these special reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office that we have not been able to conclude because of the lack of staff on the reporting side? How many people are we sanctioned to take on - I believe it is the region of 15 whole time equivalents, if I am reading this correctly.

I have an appendix which gives the arrears cases.  In 2011 and 2012 there are still three clients, Inland Fisheries, National College of Art and Design and County Cork VEC where the reports have not yet issued.  In 2012, there are 16 clients that have not been reported on.  These include Dublin Dental Hospital; National Museum of Ireland; Grand Canal Harbour management; County Limerick VEC; HSE patient private property account; Bord Altranais and Cn&aacute;imhseachais na h&Eacute;ireann; Family Support Agency; Fishery Harbour Centres; University of Limerick; UCD; Trinity College; NUI Galway; Dublin City University; Waterford Institute of Technology; the Sea  Fisheries Protection Authority; and the National Gallery - combined accounts.  In general the reasons for the delay are a combination of one or more of the following: delays in accounts production, significant accounting errors that require adjustment, or account format problems.  In some cases such accounting errors relate to capacity problems and changes in systems in the client bodies that arise in regard to the establishment or dissolution of bodies.  Another reason is delays in the provision to the audit team of complete explanations with the necessary back-up evidence in response to queries raised on audit.  A third reason is requests by the audit team for additional disclosure in the notes to the financial statements or in the statement of internal financial control to ensure a balanced complete and understandable assessment of the bodies position is given.  There are more complex matters, such as reputation or consideration by the Comptroller and Auditor General of reports on accounting propriety and regulatory concerns.  Finally, there is the unavailability of audit resources to respond promptly when explanations are provided.  In a few cases, significantly delayed audits are being progressed with the subsequent year's audit.  In most cases, prior year uncompleted audits have a knock-on effect on the audits for the subsequent years.

I am not familiar with the details of it.  However, my understanding of it from newspaper reports was that three cases were legally pursued by Revenue.  I think one of them went to sanctions.<\/p> <p>  I am advised a detailed report on offshore accounts held with HSBC is being prepared by the Revenue Commissioners for the Committee of Public Accounts but, in the meantime, I can provide the following information.  Information on offshore account holders in HSBC Switzerland came into the possession of the French authorities  in December 2009.  The Revenue Commissioners wrote to the relevant French fiscal authorities in March 2010 when they became aware that the French Government may have obtained information in regard to bank accounts held with HSBC Bank, Geneva.  That communication expressed an interest in any such information which related to Irish residents and requested that the French authorities exchange this information under the provisions of the Ireland-France double taxation agreement and EU mutual assistance arrangements.  <\/p> <p>  On 23 June 2010, the French authorities responded positively to this request and provided details to Revenue in regard to bank accounts purported to be held with HSBC Bank, Geneva, which had been linked to Irish nationals or to addresses in Ireland.  The receipt of this information was referred to in Revenue's 2010 annual report.<\/p> <p>  On receipt of the data Revenue undertook an assessment and evaluation process which indicated that no further liability arose in the State in a number of cases.  It should be noted that the existence of a foreign bank account is not evidence of tax evasion.  No liability will arise where relevant taxes are paid on the funds in the bank account and any interest accruing in the account.<\/p> <p>  To date, Revenue has initiated 33 investigations as a direct result of the data received.  As result of these investigations, 20 settlement payments were made, of which four were made be legal entities.  Overall, the total amount recovered to date as a result of these investigations and subsequent settlements is &euro;4,559,371 million while a further &euro;174,442 has been received in payments on account in two ongoing investigations.  <\/p> <p>  On the basis of data provided by the French authorities and the subsequent investigations conducted, Revenue also took action in any case where sufficient admissible evidence was available to bring criminal prosecution in regard to any identify tax offences.  To date, three persons have been convicted of such offences and fines ranging from &euro;4,000 to &euro;25,000 have been imposed by the courts.  A further case remains under criminal investigation.<\/p> <p>  Revenue deployed the resources necessary to evaluate and assess the information provided in regard to HSBC account holders and to subsequently undertake investigations and prosecutions that followed.  Revenue officials who were involved in this investigation were concurrently involved in other investigations.  It is not, therefore, possible to disaggregate the time and resources involved in the investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015021800002#M01300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1424278800,"counter":894,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of putting that on the record.

I am joined by personnel from the President's establishment, the Office of the Attorney General, the Central Statistics Office, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor together with staff from my Department.  I welcome the opportunity to appear before the select sub-committee as it considers the 2015 Estimates for Votes 1 to 6, inclusive.  These Votes are made up as follows: the President's Establishment, &euro;3.444 million; the Department of the Taoiseach, &euro;27.022 million; the Office of the Attorney General, &euro;15.03 million; the Central Statistics Office, &euro;52.836 million; the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, &euro;37.834 million; and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, &euro;26.966 million.  I will describe for the sub-committee the broad areas of work undertaken by the Department of the Taoiseach.  I will also briefly outline the proposed Estimate allocations for the President's Establishment, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  As Members will be aware, while I have certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas in respect of administrative matters in the legal offices, they operate completely independently of my Department.  I will also make a short statement on the Estimates for the Central Statistics Office for which Minister of State Paul Kehoe has delegated responsibility.  He is unable to attend because of the death of his father last week.<\/p>  <p>  The Revised Estimate for 2015 for Vote 1 - President's Establishment is &euro;3.444 million.  This includes just over &euro;2.3 million for pay and administration, with the balance to fund the centenarians' bounty.  Based on last year's figures and recent trends, it is estimated that approximately 400 centenarians will receive the bounty in 2015, although it is impossible to be precise.<\/p>  <p>  A total of &euro;27.022 million has been provided in the Estimates in 2015 for Vote 2 - Department of the Taoiseach.  My Department has a current staffing complement of 185.  Of my Department's &euro;27 million budget for 2015, &euro;15.8 million is allocated towards pay and administration costs, &euro;4.755 million is allocated towards the Moriarty tribunal third party costs and &euro;2 million is allocated towards the costs of the Fennelly commission of investigation.  It should also be noted that my Department's 2015 allocation reflects new areas of responsibility assigned to my Department, including the assignment of three Ministers of State to the policy areas of diaspora affairs, data protection and international financial services, and some additional responsibilities in relation to renewal of the Civil Service.  In accordance with the programme for Government, my Department provides a strategic centre to ensure a joined-up approach to the development and implementation of Government policy, including a small office to monitor delivery of the programme for Government across all Departments.  As well as a number of executive functions appropriate to the centre of Government, much of this work involves support for meetings of the Government and of Cabinet committees, including the Economic Management Council.<\/p>  <p>  Across all the areas of my Department's responsibility, considerable time and effort goes into answering parliamentary questions, preparing material for use in the Oireachtas, processing freedom of information requests, answering ordinary letters and queries from the public, organising events, preparing speeches and responding to media queries.  For example, in 2014 my Department dealt with 58 Government meetings, 76 Cabinet committee meetings, 952 Government memoranda, 20,000 pieces of correspondence, 805 parliamentary questions, and 173 freedom of information requests.  Carrying out this work to a consistently high standard is central to my Department's role in serving the Government and the Oireachtas, as well as providing public accountability.<\/p>  <p>My Department's strategy statement for 2015-2017, which will be published in the coming weeks, reflects the changed context since 2011 and my Department's role in meeting the emerging challenges and opportunities our country faces.  I will briefly outline for the sub-committee the progress made by my Department on key priorities in 2014 and indicate where we intend to focus our efforts in 2015.  <\/p>  <p>               The Government is determined to continue Ireland's journey towards sustainable economic recovery and is committed to ensuring that the recovery is felt in the daily lives of individuals, families and communities throughout the country.  Creating the circumstances for job creation and supporting job seekers in finding work is absolutely central to this task.  The Cabinet committee on economic recovery and jobs oversees policies and actions that support job creation and maximise the employment and training opportunities for those who are on the live register.<\/p> <p> In January 2015, the Government published the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs which identifies 382 specific actions to be delivered in the year ahead, building on the 1,000 or so delivered since 2012.  The Government has set itself an ambitious target for job creation: to grow employment by 40,000 in 2015, in addition to the 80,000 net increase in employment since the beginning of 2012.  It has also set a goal of restoring employment to 2.1 million by 2018.<\/p> <p> My Department plays a central role in ensuring the implementation of the action plan, including through the Cabinet committee and the quarterly reports on delivery of each action.  In parallel, the Pathways to Work strategy aims to ensure that as many as possible of these jobs are filled by people who are on the live register.  In October 2014, the Government published the Pathways to Work 2015 document, which has a special focus on long-term and youth unemployment.  My Department also helps to ensure that initiatives and opportunities in this area are well-communicated to and understood by employers, job seekers and the wider public.  This work will continue throughout 2015.<\/p> <p> In May 2014, the Government published its Construction 2020 strategy, which reflects the importance of the construction sector to economic recovery.  The primary focus of the strategy is to return the construction sector to sustainable levels to meet housing needs and maximise sustainable employment in the sector.  The strategy contains detailed actions to identify and remove obstacles to appropriate development, including in housing, and to ensure that future growth and activity in the sector is sustainable and is underpinned by proper data and proper analysis.<\/p> <p> There have been encouraging signs of recovery in the construction sector in recent months, albeit from a very low base.  According to the CSO, 7,000 more people were working in the construction sector in the third quarter of 2014 compared with the same period in 2013.  Activity in the sector has risen for 16 consecutive months and housing completions increased significantly in 2014, although they still fall far short of housing demand.  A new Cabinet committee was established last September to oversee the implementation of Construction 2020.  This is to be a priority for 2015.<\/p> <p> The IFSC directly employs more than 35,000 people, not only in Dublin but in centres throughout the country.  Given the importance of the sector, the Government appointed Deputy Simon Harris as Minister of State with responsibility for international banking, including the IFSC.  Deputy Harris is working on preparing a new strategy for the sector, which has been informed by an extensive consultation process over recent months.  The strategy will be submitted to Government and published in early March 2015.<\/p> <p> There is en ever-increasing presence of digital technology in almost every single facet of modern life.  This results in an increase in the generation and use of personal data and, in turn, the need to protect the rights of the user.  Coupled with this is the recognition of the importance of the digital sector to our economy and the need to take a whole-of-government approach to data related issues.  Ireland needs a data protection regime that is fit for purpose and which can keep pace with technological developments.  The Government has therefore given the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, lead responsibility for data protection issues with a small section in the Department of the Taoiseach to ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach to this important issue.<\/p> <p> In September 2014, the Government established a new Cabinet committee on economic infrastructure and climate change.  In 2015, the committee will continue its work on the negotiation of the EU 2030 targets to ensure a fair and achievable target for Ireland while also making progress on meeting Ireland's 2020 targets.  Once the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill is enacted, the Government will also be engaged in developing national mitigation and adaptation plans.  My Department will continue to support me in a strategic programme of international engagement to increase trade and investment and build on the progress that has been made in restoring Ireland's international reputation.<\/p> <p> In 2015, the Government will continue to focus on the priority of markets with significant trade and investment potential for Ireland.  During the planning and organisation of overseas visits, my Department will aim to prioritise value for money and minimise costs.  I attended the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos in January.  While there I hosted an IDA Ireland dinner which was attended by senior executives of several major multinational firms, principally in the high tech and financial services areas.  I expect to travel again to the US in March for St Patrick's Day where my focus will be on enhancing our strong economic, political, and business links with the US and progressing issues of concern to the Irish community, including immigration reform and the undocumented Irish.<\/p> <p> In July 2014, the Government appointed Deputy Jimmy Deenihan as Minister of State for diaspora affairs at the Department of the Taoiseach and at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The key priority for the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, for the end of 2014 and early 2015 has been to conclude the review of Ireland's diaspora policy, which process is drawing close to finalisation.  The diaspora policy will put in place a range of actions that will deepen our engagement with members of our diaspora for mutual benefit.  The main goal is to build long-term sustainable relationships with diaspora communities around the world.  This will include strengthening connections with emigrants and promoting opportunities that are available to them as we continue to grow the economy and create jobs back at home.  The policy will also emphasis local activation, building on the lessons of the year of The Gathering in 2013, and recognising the importance of a sense of place and equipping people to act at the county level to reach out to their own communities overseas.<\/p> <p> There is an allocation of &euro;1 million in the 2015 budget for my Department for new initiatives and projects for the diaspora.  This funding will be used to support local communities to develop relationships with their diaspora and to bring forward other new initiatives and projects which will arise from the forthcoming publication of the diaspora policy.  This &euro;1 million is in addition to the &euro;11.595 million which has been allocated to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the emigrant support programme.<\/p> <p> The Cabinet committee on social policy and public service reform oversees reforms across a wide range of areas.  In many cases the focus is on ensuring a joined-up response by all Departments to issues such as homelessness, alcohol misuse, older people, people with disabilities and people with mental health issues, as well as reforms in areas such as education.  The committee and the Department also support the implementation of the Government's public service reform programme, with actions in areas such as shared services, procurement, and external service delivery.<\/p> <p> The Government also published a new public service ICT strategy recently.  Each department and sector prepares and reports progress on an integrated reform plan to deliver reforms and make the situation more efficient.  An important new development is the Civil Service renewal plan, which was published by the Government in October 2014.  The plan sets out a vision for the Civil Service for the future and 25 individual actions to build the capability to meet the needs and the expectations of the Government and the public into the future.  For the first time, a Civil Service management board, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, has been established to implement the plan.  A new accountability board, which I will chair, is being established to strengthen accountability and performance across the Civil Service.  This reform programme for the Civil Service will be an important aspect of my Department's work in 2015.<\/p> <p> Last year the Government also established a Cabinet committee on justice reform which is overseeing major changes to policing in Ireland, including the establishment of the new Garda authority.  Delivery of these reforms will be a major focus in 2015.<\/p> <p> The Cabinet committee on health continues to meet regularly to oversee the ongoing reform programme in the health service, while also seeking to maintain and improve services in a fiscally constrained environment.<\/p> <p> Promoting Ireland's interests in the European Union is a core function of my Department.  Our economic well-being is interlinked with that of the wider Union, and throughout 2015 we will continue to focus particular attention on initiatives which support jobs and growth.  In this context, we have welcomed the new investment fund and will push for further improvements to the trade and investment environment.  This includes full implementation of the Single Market in services and advances in the digital area.<\/p> <p> We remain a strong advocate of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership.  Improved access to the US market will benefit Irish companies.  We hope the negotiations with the US can be concluded before the end of President Obama's term of office. We will also work with partners to take forward the Union's climate policy and energy goals.  <\/p>  <p>                 Another vital European Union interest for Ireland is keeping the United Kingdom within the Union.  That is why the Government has consistently made its position on the EU-UK question clear.  We want our closest neighbours across the Irish Sea to remain in the EU.  We will be following carefully the evolving debate on the matter in 2015, especially given the impending British general election in May.  We will try to help, where we can, to create the conditions where the UK will feel more comfortable within the European Union.  My Department will deploy increased resources to deal with all aspects of British-Irish relations, including Northern Ireland and North-South relations, east-west relations and the implications of potential changes to Britain's relationship with the European Union.<\/p> <p> Beyond that horizon and further afield, there have been several troubling recent developments within the Union's borders and in our neighbourhood that will require our attention throughout 2015, such as countering terrorism and radicalisation as well as encouraging a peaceful resolution to the situation in Ukraine.<\/p> <p> Advancing Ireland's interests in Europe demands an excellent network of strategic alliances, including alliances with the institutions and other member states.  I will continue to represent Ireland at regular meetings of the European Council.  Earlier this month, I participated in a productive set of meetings with the new Presidents of the European Council and the Commission.  At a time of institutional renewal in Europe, we have been developing relations with the new and restructured college of Commissioners and the new European Parliament.  We have had ministerial visits to plenary sessions of the European Parliament in Strasbourg in recent months.  These have involved meetings with political groups, members of key committees and Irish MEPs.  Ministers are required to and continue to maintain high levels of attendance at Council meetings.<\/p> <p> We are also deepening our long-term relationship with the European Commission and other institutions by maximising the number of Irish people working there on a permanent and temporary basis.  For this reason, the Department's Estimate for 2014 provided &euro;1.2 million towards efforts to increase our presence, including meeting the cost of seconded national experts in EU and international organisations.  In 2015, this funding is being increased to &euro;1.6 million to provide for the full-year costs of the posts already filled and to fill several additional posts, including in the OECD.  This is an important investment in our future and will increase the understanding of Ireland within those institutions as well as our understanding of the institutions, whose work often impacts significantly at national level.  My Department's 2015 Estimates also include an allocation of &euro;250,000 for supporting EU engagement.  This money is being spent to support work in primary schools, through the well-known blue star programme, in local community groups, NGOs and others, as well as on work with other stakeholders to build awareness of the EU jobs available to Irish citizens.<\/p> <p> An important aspect of the work of the Department is supporting lasting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and continuing to enhance and strengthen our relations with Britain.  As committee members will be aware, after 11 weeks of intensive negotiations involving significant commitment from both Governments and all parties, the Stormont House Agreement was successfully concluded on 23 December 2014.  The agreement sets out a firm foundation for Northern Ireland and its politicians and people to move forward together.  The Stormont House Agreement covers a broad range of political, social and economic issues.  It sets out a plan for financial and budgetary reform.  It proposes a way forward on flags, identity, culture and tradition through the establishment of a commission.  It envisages the devolution of responsibility for parades to the Northern Ireland Assembly.  It establishes a programme of institutional reform at Stormont and progresses several outstanding aspects from the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.  It also establishes a new comprehensive framework and structure for dealing with the legacy of the past.  These include a new historical investigations unit, an independent commission for information retrieval and an oral history archive.  The immediate priority is to progress the implementation of the agreement and ensure that all the institutions and structures are established and commence operating as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> Last March, the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, and I renewed our support for the joint statement agreed between us in March 2012.  This sets out plans for closer bilateral engagement on a wide range of areas to increase economic trade and investment between our two countries in addition to our joint commitment to Northern Ireland as well as continued co-operation on EU and global issues.  Significant progress continues to be made across a range of areas, supported by the work of the Secretaries General and Permanent Secretaries.<\/p> <p> The Government will continue to develop the North-South institutions, with a particular emphasis on economic and infrastructural development in the Border region.  The Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland will work closely together through the North-South Ministerial Council and beyond on common interests that are beneficial to both parts of the island.  I look forward to chairing the next plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, to be held on 5 June in Dublin Castle.  We will discuss new sectoral priorities for co-operation that will contribute to economic renewal in Northern Ireland and, as a consequence, bring benefit to the all-island economy.  I look forward to the next British-Irish Council summit as well, which I will host this year in Dublin Castle in June.<\/p> <p> The 2015 commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising will take place at the GPO on Easter Sunday, 5 April, while the national day of commemoration ceremony will be held in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham on Sunday, 12 July.  Regional ceremonies mirroring the national day ceremony in Dublin will be organised by the local authorities in Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo, Mayo and Waterford.  It is hoped that members of the Oireachtas who cannot attend the national ceremony in Dublin will attend a ceremony in their area.  In addition, work in my Department has started on the 1916 centenary commemoration, which will take place at the GPO on Easter Sunday, 27 March 2016.  This event is part of the broad programme of events planned for the decade of commemorations.<\/p> <p> The Constitutional Convention completed its work in March 2014.  Nine reports were submitted by the convention.  The convention is of course independent of Government and reports directly to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Government has responded to five of the reports and the remaining four are under consideration.  The Government will hold two referendums in May on foot of reports from the Constitutional Convention on the age of candidacy for presidential elections and marriage equality.  In 2015, my Department will support a proposal by the convention's academic and legal support group for further research, dissemination and communication on the work and impact of the convention.  I thank all those who have contributed.<\/p> <p> Following the Seanad referendum I met the leaders of the parties and groupings in both Houses in December 2013 to hear their views on how we should proceed with reform.  There was agreement that procedural reform of the Seanad should proceed immediately and that the parties and groupings, including the Government, through the Leader of the House, should present their reform proposals to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  In February last year, the Government submitted a package of reform measures to the committee.  In 2014, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government published the general scheme of a Bill to give effect to the 1979 referendum decision to allow the State to extend the franchise for the election of members of the Seanad by certain universities to other institutions of higher education in the State.  Following public consultation on the general scheme, I understand the Minister expects to publish the Bill.  In addition following an announcement in the Dail on 11 November 2014, I established a working group on Seanad reform, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning.  The principal focus of the working group is on possible reforms of the Seanad electoral system within the existing constitutional parameters.  The group will also explore ways of reforming Seanad &Eacute;ireann generally and the manner in which it carries out its business, again within existing constitutional parameters.  The group also undertook a consultation process and received numerous submissions from many interested parties.  The group has been asked to report to the Government not later than the end of March of this year.<\/p> <p> The Moriarty tribunal is currently dealing with applications for third party costs.  The sole member has indicated to my Department that the majority of applications for costs have been considered by him and that he hopes to have this process finalised in the near future.  To the end of 2014, a total of 49 bills of costs amounting to &euro;10.76 million have been settled for a total of &euro;4.77 million.  Settlements in excess of &euro;20,000 are published on the Department's website each quarter.<\/p> <p> The Department's Vote also includes a provision of &euro;2 million for the commission of investigation chaired by Mr. Justice Fennelly.  This follows my agreement, on foot of a request from the commission, to extend the timeframe for reporting until the end of 2015.  <\/p>  <p>                 I have outlined some of the priorities my Department will be working to make progress with during the course of this year.  The Department seeks to ensure value for money and maximise efficiency in all areas.  It will continue to do so in 2015, while adhering to best practice in terms of procurement.  The Department actively participates in a number of shared services initiatives.  It will continue to exploit the opportunities and efficiencies that such initiatives provide.  I thank them all for their service.<\/p> <p> Under Vote 3, for 2015 the Office of the Attorney General has a net budget of &euro;15.03 million, which is broken into &euro;13.408 million for the administration subheads, &euro;2.437 million for programme expenditure and an appropriation-in-aid of &euro;815,000.  The majority of the administrative expenditure relates to staff salaries, which will cost &euro;11.532 million in 2015.  The next largest expenditure is &euro;2.149 million in respect of the Law Reform Commission.  This is provided for in subhead A4.  Funds for the operation of the commission are channelled through the Vote of the Office of the Attorney General as a grant-in-aid.  Since 2008, the office has reduced its gross budget by 18.9%.  Measures taken include reductions in expenditure where possible.  For example, there has been a reduction of almost 16% in the number of administrative staff.  Staff losses have been confined to administrative positions to avoid any interruption of the core work of the office, which is the provision of legal advice and drafting services to its clients.  The office is fully engaged in all the public service reform initiatives.<\/p> <p> Vote 4 relates to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which is responsible for the collection, processing and publication of official statistics on economic, social and general conditions in Ireland.  While its main focus is on meeting the statistical requirements of the Government, the information it publishes is also used by other public bodies, business, universities, research institutes and the public.  There is a significant international dimension to the work of the CSO.  The EU institutions, the IMF, the OECD and other international bodies are important users of official statistics.  These bodies have a significant role in defining and monitoring standards for the compilation of comparable information.  The CSO subscribes to the standards set out in the UN fundamental principles of official statistics and the European statistics code of practice.<\/p> <p> The net allocation for the CSO in 2014, which amounted to &euro;39.577 million, included preparatory funding for the 2016 census of population.  The net allocation for this year, which amounts to &euro;52.836 million, provides funding for core outputs and for the 2014-15 Irish health survey, the 2014-15 national employment survey, the 2015-16 household budget survey and the 2016 census of population.  The CSO is implementing a long-term programme of changes in how it organises household surveys in order that it can meet future information needs as efficiently as possible.  The CSO will publish approximately 300 releases and publications in 2015.  All of these statistics are published online.  Members of the public are increasingly aware of and able to access statistics and indicators on the social, economic and environmental issues which affect their daily lives.<\/p> <p> The CSO's statement of strategy gives priority to delivering the core statistics needed for policy, while keeping a strong focus on cost reduction.  The CSO continues to meet all its commitments under the public service reform programme.  It is implementing a programme of reform and continuous business process improvement in the collection and processing of statistics.  It is taking a lead role in developing the Irish statistical system by working closely with other Departments and public bodies to promote a more coherent approach to meeting data needs through the development of a code of practice for the Irish statistical system and the promotion of a national data infrastructure which will support greater usage of administrative data for statistical purposes.  Making better use of data throughout the public sector, which is an important part of public service reform, will contribute to more evidence-informed decision-making and better measurement of policy outcomes.<\/p> <p> Better co-ordination also contributes to reducing the burden on data providers.  Since 2008, the CSO has continued to reduce the response burden placed on Irish enterprises and agricultural holdings by surveys.  The response burden barometer for 2013 represented a reduction by 18.9% since it was first measured in 2005.  When measured against the peak year of 2008, the response burden barometer had reduced by 32.4% by 2013.  The CSO Vote for 2015 provides for a total of 750 staff.  This represents an increase over the 2014 figure.  This increase relates primarily to the data collection and processing phase of the household budget survey and the preparation for the 2016 census of population.<\/p> <p> The Estimate for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which is set out in Vote 5, is &euro;37.834 million.  This provides for the salaries and expenses of the director and her staff, the cost of the local State solicitor service, fees to counsel engaged by the director to prosecute cases in the various courts, and legal costs awarded against the State arising from judicial review and other legal proceedings.  The Estimate for 2015 represents an increase of 3%, or almost &euro;1 million, over last year's Estimate.  There are two principal factors driving this increase.  First, the provision for salaries and wages has increased by &euro;819,000.  The majority of this is to fund the extra payroll which will fall in 2015, but there is also provision for the payment of increments and for some extra staff.  Second, there has been an increase of &euro;650,000 in the provision made in input A3, fees to counsel.  This input provides for the fees paid to barristers who prosecute cases on behalf of the director.  The increase is required to deal with a number of lengthy and complex financial trials that are scheduled for 2015.<\/p> <p> The 2015 Estimate for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, which is set out in Vote 6, is &euro;26.966 million.  Within the administrative budget, salaries, wages and allowances account for &euro;15.318 million out of a total of &euro;17.626 million.  The remaining &euro;2.3 million is attributable to the general running costs of the office.  That includes provision for items such as information technology services, training, security, cleaning, utilities and upkeep of offices.  A figure of &euro;11.2 million is allocated for the payment of legal fees incurred by the office.  This can be broken down into &euro;9.6 million for counsel fees, &euro;1.4 million for general law expenses and &euro;200,000 for the use of external solicitors.  Appropriations-in-aid are estimated at &euro;1.86 million and will include legal costs recovered by the office along with the recoupment of the pension levy.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputies for their attention and commend these Estimates to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI32015021800002#A00200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":941,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach.

If the Taoiseach does not have the information with him, he can send it on.  My first question concerns the new Court of Appeal which was set up recently.  Will the Taoiseach indicate the extra costs and possible workload that might entail for the Chief State Solicitor's office or any of the other legal offices?  We have the High Court and the Supreme Court and now we have this new in-between court.  There must be an implication in terms of costs.  The Taoiseach might indicate how that works.<\/p>  <p>  This is a question mainly for the Attorney General's Vote, specifically the role of senior counsel and junior counsel appointed by the State to various functions relating to tribunals.  One tribunal is directly under the Taoiseach's Department.  I understand the daily rate is in the range of &euro;2,500 or whatever and that the Attorney General's office would have had a role in agreeing the rates, performance and other issues.  From a taxpayer's point of view, would all these legal advisers and senior counsel be required to produce professional indemnity insurance?  We see the claims that come through the State Claims Agency in the health area.  Such claims occur in many areas where people provide a professional service which means they must have professional indemnity insurance.  <\/p>  <p>               Recently, the Supreme Court has been scathing of some of the unprofessional work carried out by the legal teams involved in the Mahon tribunal; has the Taoiseach or the Attorney General's office looked at the professional indemnity insurance of the people involved to establish whether they acted in a fully professional manner?  Is it possible for the State, in the interests of the taxpayer, to recover some of the additional cost that will now be incurred?  It would be very poor if we were to pay &euro;2,500 per day to barristers if there was no comeback against them or their insurance if they acted in an unprofessional manner.  I believe the taxpayer would like this to be pursued.  It may upset some people but I think the taxpayer would like to see these people upset.  Does the Taoiseach have a view on that?

If one looks at the CSO figures, between March 2011 and February 2015 58,600 new jobs were created by the State.  There is a significant discrepancy between that figure and the figure quoted by the Government of 80,000, or 100,000, depending whom one listens to.  If one includes the activation jobs in this figure, it is about 21%.  Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a necessity for a more honest appraisal of the state of play with regard to job creation?  That is the first question.<\/p>  <p>  There are sections within society that have not benefitted from job creation.  Between March 2011 and February 2015, the west and south west of Ireland continued to experience a reduction in the number of existing jobs.  There are 48,500 fewer people under the age of 35 in employment.  There are 1,783 fewer long-term unemployed; this is a marginal decrease.  Ireland still has the highest rates of underemployment in the EU and the lowest pay among OECD countries.  How will the Action Plan for Jobs tackle these issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI32015021800002#F01400","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":970,"content":"<p>First of all, 134,000 people came off the live register last year.  There is always a very significant movement of people into work and out of work.  The Action Plan for Jobs is driven by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and is monitored by both that Department and the Department of the Taoiseach.  Representatives from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are required to attend at Cabinet sub-committee meetings on a regular basis to ensure that the targets that have been set are achieved.  The evidence we have is that there has been an increase in employment in most areas around the country.  We hope to have full employment by 2018; that means a return to 2.1 million people working.  Over the years almost 300,000 young people have emigrated, but I hope that by the end of 2016 we have net immigration of Irish people back into the country.  In other words, by the end of 2016 there will be more young people returning to Ireland than leaving.<\/p>  <p>   The Action Plan for Jobs sets out more than 380 actions for 2015.  A number of those are very specific.  They are what we call disruptive reforms; in other words, they really shake things up.  One is the national talent drive, which aims to attract and retain world-class talent, ensure that work pays for all and provide a great place to live and work.  We are targeting 13,800 graduates in the science, technology, engineering and maths disciplines by 2018; that will be an increase from 10,200 in 2011.  <\/p>  <p>   Then there is the delivery of regional potential, including the launch of competitive funding initiatives of up to &euro;25 million to promote entrepreneurship and innovation in the regions.  The Europe Energy Innovation Hub, which was driven by Deputy Pat Rabbitte when he was Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, provides a one-stop shop to attract mobile investment and position Ireland at the forefront of innovation.  One can argue the figures depending on which base one is using, but the clear evidence from the live register is that 135,000 moved off it last year and there is evidence that 80,000 net jobs have been created by the present Government over the last number of years.  The Government target this year is the creation of 40,000 new jobs, which will hopefully go a long way towards surpassing its target of creating 100,000 net new jobs by 2016.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI32015021800002#F01500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":971,"content":"<p>I agree with the Taoiseach that there have been improvements with regard to job creation, but I would argue that the rate of job creation has not been ambitious enough to deal with the crisis that we are in.  If full employment is to be achieved by 2018, the Government, over the next three years, will have to triple the rate of job creation that has occurred over the past four years.  We wish the Government luck with that.<\/p>  <p>   The issue of the construction industry is also mentioned in your notes.  I want to draw the Taoiseach's attention to the Kishoge dispute.  The Taoiseach may be aware that there is a principal contractor who is building a school in Lucan; that contractor has about 13 different contracts with the State at the moment.  There has been a dispute going on there for almost a year.  Some of the staff there claim that they are being paid half the minimum wage and that they have been forced into self-employment.  They have been to the Labour Court; the Labour Court ruling has been ignored by the contractor.  The machinery of the State - Scope and NERA, which are investigating the situation - is moving so slowly that there will be children learning in the school by the time they make any determination.  Meanwhile men are getting up at 6 o'clock in the morning to stand on the picket line day in and day out to try to get paid at least the minimum wage.  <\/p>  <p>               What can be done to ensure that justice, in the construction industry, is served in a timely fashion by the instruments of the State?  A plethora of people feel they have been forced down the route of self-employment as a result of these practices.  It is leading to a very corrupt construction industry. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI32015021800002#F01600","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":973,"content":"<p>On employment, although we are heading in the right direction and progress has been made, it has not been enough.  As the economy begins to improve and confidence begins to rise, one has to deal with the expectations of people for faster results in terms of their lives and lifestyles.  It is always a challenge to meet this.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned that the west and south west were not measuring up in the overall employment figures.  This has always been a challenge in terms of infrastructure - namely, roads, water, broadband, power and energy.  Agendas are in place and progress is being followed.  For instance, more than 200 secondary schools have been fully linked in to effective broadband.  We expect to have approval shortly from the European Commission for the regional development programme that we negotiated under Ireland's Presidency.  It includes a budget of &euro;2.5 billion for 2014 to 2020.  It will include measures in respect of the Leader programmes which are coming to an end at the end of March.  This is an important element in the development of provincial and rural Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  With the abolition of milk quotas, as the Deputy is aware, we will become the most productive dairy unit on the planet.  There are projections for several thousand on-farm jobs over the next number of years.  Quite a lot of interest has been expressed in land acquisition and leasing of land.  There have been changes, in the budget, to facilitate young farmers and the evidence is that many of them are choosing the agri sector as a primary career.  All of the courses in agriculture colleges are booked out.  It is important to note that the Japanese and American markets have been opened for specialist Irish beef.  Ireland is the first country in Europe, for a long time, to achieve this.  Negotiations have also been under way for some time in respect of China and a number of other counties.  These are important elements of the community response to facilities provided by Government and its agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Quantitative easing from the ECB has weakened the euro against both the dollar and the pound sterling.  From an export point of view, this benefits Ireland.  It also means that from a product point of view, principally the hospitality sector, the Border regions are now becoming busier in terms of what they offer.  Initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way, which goes from northern Donegal to Kinsale, offer a unique opportunity to develop these sectors and create jobs.  The Government abolished the travel tax and reduced VAT, stabilised the industry and created 35,000 jobs.<\/p>  <p>  I congratulate Darren Clarke on being appointed the next European Ryder Cup captain.  The Irish Open in Northern Ireland this year will attract very heavy numbers, as the world's number one will be there.  These are opportunities in the hospitality sector which can provide a really good basis for careers and jobs. <\/p>  <p>  On subcontracting, 2020 is the programme.  It is very detailed.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is working on two planning Bills which will deal with Part V provisions, development levies and the question of contractors getting on site.  There is a very big demand for housing in the greater Dublin region.  This cannot be dealt with unless more houses and accommodation are provided.  We need to stimulate this.  One of the big problems for contractors - competent contractors and not cowboy contractors - is getting finance to start a project.  The funding model has been changed by the Central Bank.  The subcontractor legislation has gone through the D&aacute;il and is now law.  This should be applied in the case of the site mentioned by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI32015021800002#G00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":974,"content":"<p>It is inadequate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI32015021800002#G00300","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":975,"content":"<p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will look at it if it is inadequate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI32015021800002#G00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":976,"content":"<p>It is not being applied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI32015021800002#G00500","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":977,"content":"<p>We are supposed to be dealing with the Estimates and we are very quickly running out of time.

The Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora has reflected on the practical consequences of having potentially very serious numbers of people who might be eligible to vote depending on the criteria set down.  The Government has not made a decision on how best to consult on these practical arrangements.

Things have never been so optimistic in rural Ireland.  As the Taoiseach is aware from his visit to Mitchelstown, there have been huge developments in construction in the area.  It is fabulous to see it.  People who say rural Ireland is going backwards need to put their finger on the pulse.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned ten posts for Irish staff in the European Commission and other institutions.

An officer from the Department of Finance was placed in the European division with the German finance Ministry.  An official from the Department of Foreign Affairs was placed with the policy co-ordination unit in the Foreign Affairs Council.  An official from the Department of Agriculture, at assistant agricultural inspector grade, was placed with the European Commission, dealing with climate, finance and deforestation.  A principal officer from the Department of Justice and Equality is working with the Commission in the Directorate General dealing with the support group for Cyprus.  <\/p>  <p>               An official from the Revenue Commissioners is dealing with the Directorate General for Taxation and Customs Union, TAXUD, and the development of a one-stop shop for the EU VAT system and e-services, simplification of VAT systems and so on.  An official from the Department of Finance based in the Commission is dealing with fiscal policy and surveillance.  Another official from the Department of Finance is dealing with retail financial services and consumer policy, while another is dealing with the secretariat of the EPC banking union, the future of the EMU and the preparation of ECOFIN and Eurogroup meetings.  These officials will get experience in these other offices and will bring that experience to the Department.  It will lead us to a point at which Ireland has had a really strong permanent representation in Brussels as well as people working in the different institutions who have added greatly to both our information level and our capacity to influence matters.<\/p> <p> There was a reduction of 16% in the administrative subhead for the Office of the Attorney General.  The number of legal staff increased by eight in the past two years.  As Deputy Rabbitte will be aware, the pressure on the Office of the Attorney General in terms of capacity in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has been enormous.  Some of the complicated Bills that were put through and are in passage through the Oireachtas demand an inordinate amount of time.  Let us take the example of the Children and Family Relationships Bill 2014, on which the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has been working flat out over the past four or five weekends to be able to draw all of the different threads together.  It is difficult to get a continuous stream of competent people, so I thank those who have given an extraordinary commitment to drafting the legislation for consideration by the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p> The Civil Service renewal plan was published recently and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, is very anxious that it be followed through.

The Estimate for this year is &euro;53 million, up from &euro;39 million last year.  This is a 34% increase, which is significant.  I know the Taoiseach may say the office is getting ready for the census, but there may be more to it than that.  There was a report at the weekend about crime statistics not being published because of some difficulties regarding how information was recorded in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Pulse information system.  The CSO is getting the lion's share of the Estimate, &euro;53 million, so we want to ensure it is well spent before the D&aacute;il votes it through.  Will the CSO send a report on what is holding the crime figures up, as well as a report on any other delayed, not finalised or unpublished statistical outputs that should in the normal course of events have been published?  I know about that because I read it in the newspaper.  Are there several other examples or is that an absolutely isolated case?  It is often the case that some public bodies do not get the published information, and we would like to see that. <\/p><p>My final question relates to the market corporation test for Irish Water.  The CSO is the key organisation in Ireland with a role in this.  I have a reply to a parliamentary question from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, in which he states:<\/p><blockquote>The Central Statistics Office is responsible for engagement with Eurostat on such matters ... The Government remains confident that Irish Water will pass the Market Corporation Test.  The decision is ultimately a matter for Eurostat.<\/blockquote>  <p>I think the Government has a great deal invested in Irish Water being successful in the market corporation test.

Staff costs for a national employment survey and an Irish health survey are also included.  That is the cyclical impact of the CSO's activities.  I am informed that the office is facing significant challenges in delivering statistical requirements for users as both national and international demands, particularly those from the EU, continue to expand at a rapid rate in the context of a greater focus on evidence-based policy making.

Funding for year one of a three-year investment programme was approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as provided for in the 2015 allocation.

I want to start by extending our condolences, as an aid agency, on the occasion of the death of a British aid worker in Juba last night.  The full details of that have not emerged just yet, but it has been confirmed by the Foreign Office that an aid worker from the UK was killed last night in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, and we extend our condolences to his family.  It underlines the dangers that many of our aid workers are exposed to regularly throughout the world and the bravery they bring to the discharge of their functions.  This also applies to the local aid workers we employ.  The work so many of them do is completely selfless and highly motivated.  I am sorry to start on this, but I think it is important to note that event.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for coming to see the GOAL Syria programmes last week.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and the Chairman, Deputy Pat Breen, came over to GOAL Syria to look at our programmes from our base in Turkey.  From my point of view, it was a very interesting trip.  As Deputy O'Sullivan will know, we saw some very harrowing scenes in relation to the conditions that many Syrians living outside Syria have to put up with at the moment - those who are not in refugee camps at present.  There will be opportunities for GOAL and other NGOs to try to meet some of the need.<\/p> <p> I am joined by Conor Elliot, our director of international programmes.  He has extensive experience of Sudan and South Sudan and he will give a full account of our current work in South Sudan and how things are looking.  <\/p> <p> I want to create some context.  In terms of humanitarian crises, 2014 has been an exceptional year.  It is very easy to lose heart or to lose interest because of the number of crises.  There is a record number of humanitarian crises going on at the moment.   Level 3, L3, is the most extreme crisis and there are four L3 crises going on at present, and that does not include West Africa and the Ebola situation.  Obviously there will be serious funding issues due to the large number of crises going on at the same time.  For example, the World Food Programme has started rationing in Lebanon in relation to refugees from Syria living there.  Rations have been cut by half.  This is a downstream consequence of the large number of humanitarian crises happening around the world right now.  It has a direct impact on young people who have lost out on their educational opportunities and are now facing other, absolutely unacceptable, hardships.  It is also worth noting that in the next few years the population of the world will grow from 7 billion to 9 billion.<\/p><p>Those people are not going to live in Dublin, London or Washington but in Kinshasa, Mumbai, Lahore and places where people have not wished to live up to now.  They will live in hillsides, river deltas, perhaps reclaimed land, flood plains - places that are particularly vulnerable to climate events.  We also know there are going to be more intense and more regular climate events in the next 20 or 30 years.  We have a humanitarian system under extreme strain.  We have to see that there are daily consequences for vulnerable individuals who have suffered as a result of conflict or natural disasters.  <\/p><p> Although I could say that to any western European parliamentary committee, it is particularly significant for an Irish one because we hold a lot of clout - what is called soft power - and are a real, persuasive influence in large fora like the European Union and the UN, out of all proportion to our size.  That power is something we can use for the benefit of the people we are talking about.  We have built it up over many generations because of our emigrant population, our missions and our NGOs.  As we stand here in 2015, the question is, are we going to continue that tradition, and if so, how are we going to do it?  It is not just about funding, but also how we leverage influence in different contexts.  The soft power we hold is critical to our business communities, who look to invest and set up companies overseas, and we have to make sure we protect that.  Next year we will have the world humanitarian summit and one of the challenges I would put to the committee is that we really want to put a distinct Irish stamp on it.  There will be a meeting at the end of May this year where the opportunity will arise here in Dublin to begin to develop our narrative of how we will input into the summit.  <\/p><p> GOAL has been growing very dramatically over the past few years.  We released our 2014 results yesterday, which show that we increased our spend from &euro;70 million in 2013 to &euro;105 million in 2014, which reflects the large number of humanitarian crises that are taking place.  Our budget for 2015 is &euro;170 million.  A very dramatic and exponential growth can be seen as result of those crises.  <\/p><p> I will come back in at the end of Mr. Elliott's presentation and look forward to any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015021800002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424271600,"counter":1013,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to talk about the crisis in South Sudan; it is a privilege to be able to do so.  I also join in Mr. Andrews's sentiment in thanking the Deputies for their recent visits - two in the last year - when they took the time to come and explore the issues with us in the field.<\/p> <p>  I will give a quick overview of the situation in South Sudan, provide some of the facts and figures, outline the context and briefly talk about GOAL's response.  Hopefully we can answer some questions afterwards and put a slightly more human narrative to the committee.  The figure are stark and alarming, and often the human element is lost in a conversation about numbers.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputies will know, the current conflict in South Sudan began in mid-December 2013, when a long-standing political dispute erupted into violence.  An armed confrontation between officers loyal to President Salva Kiir and soldiers backing his ex-deputy, Riek Machar, broke out in a Sudan People's Liberation Army barracks, in Juba.  The events leading up to the clash continue to be disputed, but regardless of exactly what precipitated them, the subsequent exchanges of fire tipped the balance from unstable peace to widespread political violence.  The confrontation quickly deteriorated as the split in the army was replicated across sections of the population, resulting in widespread violence and killings, largely along tribal and ethnic lines.<\/p> <p>  South Sudan is already one of the poorest countries in the world with some of the world's worst development indicators, and is now rated as the world's most fragile state.  The impact of the ongoing conflict on the overall humanitarian situation has been catastrophic and is showing little potential for improvement.  Similarly, there is virtually no sign of political will for an end to hostilities, although we discovered today that a peace accord was signed last night in Arusha in Tanzania.  We will wait to see how that progresses - it is one of many steps along the way that we have taken before.  <\/p> <p>  We are now one year on from the UN declaration of a level 3 emergency.  As Mr. Andrews has explained, this is the highest classification of a humanitarian crisis.  The overall security situation in South Sudan continues to be volatile, unpredictable and extremely violent, particularly in the three states of Jonglei, Unity and Upper Nile, which have been directly affected by the conflict.  Meanwhile localised violence, military defections and ethnic tensions have spread to areas that were previously relatively peaceful.  Today, over 1.5 million people have been internally displaced as a result of violence and insecurity, while an additional half million refugees have fled to neighbouring countries.  Regional and international attempts at stemming the conflict have proved ineffectual, with all cessation of hostilities agreements and ceasefires signed to date - again, bearing in mind what happened last night - proving effectively worthless in practice, with neither government nor opposition forces acquiescing to their terms.  <\/p> <p>  In 2014, urgent action from the humanitarian community narrowly averted what would have been the world's first man-made famine.  However, the ongoing conflict, subsequent failed planting and harvest, widespread destruction of assets, poorly functioning markets and increased cattle disease have now left 2.5 million people at risk of food insecurity.  There is an urgent need for scaling up the humanitarian efforts in South Sudan now to prevent the widespread loss of life.  The situation is so dire that even allowing for large-scale food aid interventions, South Sudan is likely to experience famine in some parts of the country in the coming months. <\/p> <p>  GOAL has a long-standing history in Sudan and has been operational there since 1985.  Its initial programmes worked in the health sector and primary health care remains at the core of our programming in South Sudan, although our operations have expanded over the years to include multi-sectoral responses in water, sanitation, nutrition, livelihoods and emergency non-food item programming.  Since the outbreak of hostilities in December, our programmes have shifted in response to the rapidly changing needs of both the internally displaced and the vulnerable and under-served host communities, to include a significant emergency response portfolio, particularly across the Upper Nile state.  GOAL has positioned itself so as to meet the needs of people displaced from its historical areas of operation along the corridors of displacement in South Sudan and across the border into the refugee camps in Gambella, Ethiopia.  In South Sudan, GOAL has scaled up its programme significantly, providing life-saving emergency interventions to almost 700,000 beneficiaries through 66 health and nutrition centres.  This programme is complemented by integrated food security, livelihood, water and sanitation programmes.<\/p> <p>  In response to the crisis last year, we expanded our operations into new areas following the displacement patterns of the communities forcibly displaced because of the violence.  Late last year, GOAL's nutrition team carried out a nutrition assessment in an area of Upper Nile state, which showed alarming rates of malnutrition in this hard-to-reach area, with 47.5% of children aged six months to 59 months presenting as malnourished.  This is significantly beyond the World Health Organization's emergency threshold and the worst rates of malnutrition that GOAL's experienced nutrition team has ever seen.  <\/p> <p>  GOAL also works in informal camps for internally displaced people, as well as supporting host communities whose livelihoods and coping mechanisms have been severely stretched by the large-scale presence of the displaced.  In Ethiopia, GOAL teams continue to form a critical part of our overall response to the South Sudan crisis by managing emergency nutrition, feeding programmes and other support in Gambella.  This region, located just over the border from our programmes in Upper Nile State, continues to experience enormous influxes of south Sudanese refugees.  More than 193,000 have sought refuge here since December 2013 and we expect those numbers to rise dramatically again in the coming months.<\/p><p>Working closely together, the two teams in South Sudan and Ethiopia look to provide a continuum of care along this corridor.<\/p><p> The committee will be familiar with the recent visit by President Higgins to the Gambella refugee camps.  Mr. Andrews referred to Ireland&rsquo;s interest and history of involvement and the reference to Ireland punching above its weight.  It was great for GOAL, for the beneficiaries and for the wider sector in the region to see the President of Ireland visiting a remote and difficult corner of Ethiopia which is a very challenging environment at the heart of this response.  We were delighted to be a part of that experience.<\/p><p> Irish Aid&rsquo;s support in both South Sudan and Ethiopia is critical in meeting the needs of over 259,700 direct beneficiaries through both emergency and recovery funding mechanisms; enabling life-saving health, nutrition and water and sanitation programmes; preventing further loss of assets and livelihoods; and putting in place foundations for future community recovery.  GOAL would like to take this opportunity to thank the Irish Government and the Irish people for the generous support that they have shown to our programmes in South Sudan and Ethiopia.  The statistics relating to that support are contained in the submission to the committee.  In 2014, the Irish public and taxpayers have, through Irish Aid, given aid worth &euro;3 million for the response in South Sudan.  We emphasise the need for continued assistance and awareness to help prevent widespread loss of life.<\/p><p> We were asked to speak to the committee about some of the key humanitarian challenges for operating in South Sudan.  I am sure members will have questions about this situation.  Due to extreme levels of poverty, the almost total lack of infrastructure and the proliferation of armed actors, South Sudan has long been one of the most complex humanitarian operating environments, a situation that has only intensified since the outbreak of conflict.   For this conflict to end, and for GOAL and other international non-governmental organisations to reach as many people as possible with humanitarian aid in the interim, key challenges must be addressed.  There is an imperative need for a coherent political solution.  Contrary to how it has regularly been presented  as an intrinsically ethnic conflict, South Sudan&rsquo;s crisis is an inherently political crisis and as such, it requires a political solution.  The main IGAD-mediated peace talks have proven largely ineffective as have a host of political initiatives in the region over the past 14 months, with a view to resolving this crisis.  Equally, the African Union&rsquo;s decision  to delay indefinitely the publication of a report into human rights abuses conducted by both sides &ndash; ostensibly to enable the continuation of peace talks &ndash; represents a key strategic error, in our opinion.  The absence of a meaningful reconciliation process since the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement 2005, has been one of the primary contributing factors to the current crisis, whereby the main political actors involved have re-ignited long-standing unresolved tribal rivalries in order to serve their own political ends.  As such, openly addressing the abuses and violations that have been committed by all parties in this conflict is key to enabling future reconciliation among fragmented and traumatised civilians.<\/p><p> With regard to shrinking humanitarian space, since the eruption of hostilities more than a year ago, relations between the international community &ndash;  including international NGOs - and the Government of South Sudan, have deteriorated significantly.  It should be pointed out that since the eruption of hostilities more than a year ago, relations between the international community, including international NGOs and the Government of South Sudan, have degraded.  Initially, increasing governmental antagonism centred on UNMISS and other UN agencies.  However, from mid-2014 onwards, South Sudanese government officials have increasingly targeted international NGOs.  This has taken the form of an increasingly restrictive operating environment, with bureaucratic impediments, both formal and informal, restrictions on humanitarian access, and proposals to introduce legislation giving the government direct control over humanitarian operations, in contravention of humanitarian principles, international law and South Sudan&rsquo;s constitution.  These policies are having a deleterious effect on the ability of NGOs to impartially provide services to all people in need, regardless of ethnicity or political affiliation.<\/p><p> A critical shortfall in donor support and key logistical assets is a particular constraint for the humanitarian community but the humanitarian needs remain acute.  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, predicts that $1.8 billion is required for the 2015 response, of which $600 million is needed by the end of February to make use of the narrow window for transportation of critical supplies and assets, in preparation for the arrival of the rainy season in April or May.  Of particular concern is the shortfall in funding for essential logistical services, in particular air support.  Given the lack of a road network in South Sudan and the fact that 90% of all international development projects are in difficult to reach locations &ndash; many of which are only accessible by helicopter &ndash; the international NGO community is reliant on a regular and effective UN Humanitarian Air Service asset which in South Sudan is operated by the World Food Programme.  However, funding for the World Food Programme has been problematic and there has been a restriction and a reduction in the number of air assets available for deployment in South Sudan.  Similarly, the UN central emergency response fund is exhausted.  This has provided an essential pipeline for funding the humanitarian community&rsquo;s response in South Sudan.<\/p><p> That concludes my brief overview.  I would be pleased to answer any questions from members with regard to the context and the challenges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015021800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Elliott","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Brendan Smith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015021800002#C00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424271600,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>My old habits die hard and I apologise for interrupting the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015021800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":1017,"content":"<p>We forgive and we make allowances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015021800002#C00400","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424271600,"counter":1018,"content":"<p>It is superb that this committee is covering the issue of South Sudan today because it is not being covered in the media and there are no events that would create attention for this issue.

Mr. Elliott has concluded his presentation by making reference to the lack of air access to some of the most difficult to reach places in South Sudan and the requirement for pre-positioning of stocks in order to avoid the hardship that is being predicted.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for giving us this opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015021800002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":1019,"content":"<p>We also thank Mr. Andrews and Mr. Elliott for making this presentation and for their attendance.

What is the total population of South Sudan?  I understand that a pledging conference was hosted by Norway last May at which $600 million was pledged.  We hear about pledging conferences but the follow-up and the delivery of pledges is critical.  Has GOAL access to information on the moneys provided to date by those pledges made by so many countries?  The aim of the pledges is to ensure rapid humanitarian assistance and essential supplies.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Andrews has explained that immediate further assistance is needed because of the onset of the rainy season.  The committee received a briefing from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which stated that Irish Aid will decide in March or April on applications for further funding.

The figures I have seen indicate that most of the Irish Aid funding allocated in respect of South Sudan has been given to NGOs.

Have GOAL's staff come across evidence of child soldiers being recruited?  It may seem to be a silly question to ask but is it easier to obtain funding for an environmental crisis than for a man-made one?  Does part of the difficulty relating to this matter revolve around the fact that people have almost walked away from it?  The picture our guests have painted seems to indicate that, rather than improving, the situation appears to be becoming worse.  The numbers involved are staggering and the potential for famine to strike is terrifying.  In that context, the work GOAL is doing is amazing.  Is the conflict taking place in the bush or is it centred around urban areas?

It is not that long since they came before us to discuss the Ebola virus and other matters.  This committee discussed many humanitarian and other crises but when we hear the words \"South Sudan\" we feel a sense of hopelessness and despair with regard to a solution ever being found.  All of the stories emanating from the country indicate there is chaos there and that conditions are extremely unsafe for people, particularly women and children.  Mr. Andrews will be aware of the Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa, AWEPA, which has an Irish section that operates on an all-party basis.  AWEPA had a programme in South Sudan but it was obliged to pull out of it because of the unsafe conditions.  I am in awe of the GOAL operatives who remain in the country and who are continuing to try to do their work.<\/p> <p>  GOAL is faced with a number of problems.  For example, conditions are dangerous and chaotic and they appear to be deteriorating rather than getting better.  In addition, there is no end in sight politically and there is no evidence of an obvious solution emerging.  There is also the reduced ability of the various agencies to respond to the crisis, largely as a result of the number of other humanitarian crises that are ongoing across the globe.  What would GOAL like us to do?  If the UN has no money and is actually halving its food programme in Lebanon, what can we do?<\/p> <p>  GOAL may be seeking more money from the Government but what difference can such money make in terms of having an impact on a crisis of the scale of that in South Sudan, which may, as far as we can see from a political point of view, continue indefinitely?

The European Union has been tardy in paying attention to issues in Africa in the past.<\/p> <p> The elections have now been postponed.  Is that because there was no constitution or is it because of the conflict?  Could an election under strict supervision assist in resolving the conflict or would it exacerbate it?  The African Union has done some work to find a resolution but, according to the presentation we have heard today, the likelihood is of a long drawn-out conflict which will escalate and cause a lot of human suffering.

I am sure I also speak for the Chairman when I say that the stories we heard there were very grim, harrowing and depressing.  I compliment the commitment and energy of GOAL staff in the area and admire the way they keep going in spite of the very difficult situation they face.  I also must acknowledge the Syrian people, whom we met living in very difficult circumstances, and the efforts of Syrian civil society groups to help their citizens.  This is another crisis which has slipped off the agenda.  I do not know where Gaza is at this stage.  It was a major crisis last summer and we seem to be limping from one crisis to another.<\/p> <p> I want ask a question about the progress GOAL was making in Sudan before the current crisis, and the programmes it was running after the civil war in which 2 million people were killed.  Progress was being made but now it seems we have taken two steps forward and four back.  The programmes were working very successfully but where are they now?  Is GOAL diverting its energy into the latest crisis rather than towards its former programmes which had been working?<\/p> <p>  Earlier this morning a number of us met a research student who outlined the staggering financial costs of the war in South Sudan, which runs to billions.  We can only imagine what life could have been like for those people without the conflict.  Why is there no political will to address it?  Is this driven by the oil industry and the massive profits being made there?  Is there something this Government can do to bring transparency to the financial affairs of the oil industry?  No pun is intended but somebody is fuelling this conflict and somebody is selling arms to the various groups involved.  We must look at the humanitarian aspect of the situation but we must also devote attention to the question of who is keeping this war going and whose interest it is in to do so.  It is certainly not in the interest of the ordinary Sudanese people.  <\/p> <p> It is dreadful to think of the young British lad who died recently.  A young Irish friend of mine is working in Juba at the moment with one of the smaller aid agencies but people like him are taking their lives into their hands by working over there.

It is clear that the difficulties have their origins in problems between the President and Vice President going back to 2013, and that oil also plays a part.  Is there any evidence of willingness on the part of the warring factions to resolve the political difficulties?  Is there any shred of confidence that a settlement can be reached?<\/p> <p> The witnesses spoke of a shrinking humanitarian space.  I understand that the South Sudanese Government does not welcome the aid agencies, NGOs and other members of the international community but if they were not there, providing assistance to displaced people, how would the Government provide assistance on its own?  It should welcome as much assistance as it can get for deprived people in South Sudan.<\/p> <p> We have built up considerable influence at the UN and in the EU over the years and we continue to use that influence but how can we ramp it up?

In so far as war is concerned, for some unknown reason people across the globe begin to restless every so often because after a period of peace and calm, there comes a time of war.  It is a little like the saying there is a time to be born and a time to die.  The number of events that are occurring and the degree of violence are disturbing.  There are many situations where the level of violence has been ongoing but it is becoming more prevalent.  I do not know what the reason for it is other than that history seems to repeat itself, tragically, again and again and lessons never seem to be learned by the upcoming generation.  They always know better or pretend or think they do and inevitably find out that they do not when it is too late.  The consequences of that, unfortunately, impact on people, the civilian populations, who pay the price, and women and children in particular pay a huge price.<\/p><p> Our comments must relate to the extent to which GOAL, along with others, can impact in that area as well.  I do not know what can be done.  We all deal with it in the course of our constituency work because we meet people from these areas who present us with information on a fairly regular basis and it is horrific.  The witnesses are very much more conversant with those issues than we are.  The question that arises is what influence can the international community bring to bear on the potential hot-spots, other than by international peacekeeping forces and what they can do is limited as well, as we know from past experience.  How can we improve that situation?  It appears nothing can be done and that it is inevitable that huge loss of life and carnage takes place.

They give us an opportunity to discuss some particular issues.  As there is some overlap in the topics raised, forgive me if I answer some of them thematically rather than by responding to each member.  I will start with Deputy Durkan's comment, and a link to the theme of hopelessness has come through in many of the members' questions.  The situation is most definitely not hopeless, intractable, predetermined or definite.  What is of great hope to all of us is the man-made aspect, particularly of this crisis in South Sudan and, by definition, it being man-made it is within the power of particularly the political elites in South Sudan to find a solution.  Our staff, employees, colleagues and other Irish agencies live and work in extremely difficulty and challenging environments but it is never hopeless.  Our whole mission is devoted to improving the lives of people and we impact on hundreds of thousands of people every day, particularly in South Sudan and now in Ethiopia in regard to this crisis.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly run through some of the points raised.  The population there is in the region of 11 million.  Somebody will correct me on that but it is approximately that size and we can provide the committee with the correct figure. I do not  have figures from the pledging conference in Norway but we can get those and provide them afterwards.  We can give a better breakdown on the pledges that were made last year and what were, and were not, met and what is the position regarding the current round of pledges.  <\/p> <p>  A question was raised about Irish Aid or at least about the influence this committee can bring to bear on allocations or discussions around funding in Ireland.  We have a very positive and responsive relationship with the humanitarian section and the civil society section in Irish Aid, and they are very responsive.  We have very close relationships with them, however, we will always request that pressure be applied to the allocation of more fundings to non-governmental organisations.  In terms of timing, now is a very good time for that.<\/p> <p>  The issue of timing links to another Deputy's question.  South Sudan has just come out of the wet season.  The wet season is a very big event in South Sudan.  It is a moveable feast.  It can start as early as April or May and as it moves across the country it can run as late as December and even into January.  When it rains in South Sudan everything stops.  South Sudan has very few roads.  I wish I could give the members the figure for the number of Tarmac roads there.  I worked in Sudan as the country director for GOAL on a  long-term placement seven or eight years ago and at that time there was 4 km of Tarmac roads in South Sudan.  That has dramatically  improved today but it gives members an idea of some of the logistical challenges.  We have to fly into most of the operational sites in which we work.  In the wet season they can only be accessed by helicopter.  We access some of our areas by boat and by canoe.  There are no standard logistical supply lines into huge tracks of South Sudan.  <\/p> <p>  There has been a poor harvest due to the conflict last year as a result of which there was a failure to plant.  South Sudan has just come out of the west season.  People have just harvested.  Today the indicators are not as bad as they will be in two months time.  Today people are eating the stocks they have just harvested but those stocks will deplete very rapidly.  We know they are nowhere yet near the levels they need to be to bring people through until the next harvest.  We know that between now and the start of the next wet season there will be pockets of famine in and around certain locations in South Sudan.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Eric Byrne began the discussion around politics which subsequent speakers all raised, which is central to this whole issue.  Ultimately, we are a humanitarian agency that is responding and reacting to the situation on the ground but the underlying causes of this are political and the solution will be political.  It will have to be.  <\/p> <p>  I will provide some background in terms of the question of ethnicity, the tribal groups versus ethnic groups and so on.  Like all such conflicts, I cannot simplify this as it is very complex.  All of Sudan and South Sudan have a very complex and long history of conflict and fighting.  Many generations have lived through conflict, conflict with Sudan in the north and also conflict internally within South Sudan.  There is a long history of fault-lines between communities, between geographical areas and between ethnic groups or tribes in South Sudan.  There is a dominant ethnic group, in terms of numbers, in South Sudan known as the Dinka and it is by far and away the largest ethnic grouping.  I could not tell the members the size of that grouping but probably 60% or 70% of the population are Dinka.  The next largest group is known are the Nuer and it constitutes approximately 11% of the population and the rest of the population is a range of groups comprising Equatorians and so on.  The current split between Salva Kiir, who is Dinka, and Riek Machar, who is Nuer, falls down along that ethnic line, but it is far more complicated than just the Nuer versus the Dinka.  Much of this is tied into resources over which there is conflict in South Sudan.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan raised the issue of natural disasters versus man-made disasters.  Often there is a particular link between those in that natural disasters mean competition for resources and the competition for resources tends to lead to conflict and man-made situation around conflict.  That is an issue in South Sudan and it has always been an issue.  There are always cattle raids and conflict over access to lands and so on, but there is also the issue of oil and access to funding around oil, which Deputy Mitchell raised.<\/p><p>That is a very significant issue and a very thorny issue for conflict.  Also, as throughout the history of Sudan and other conflicts there is an issue of the debate, argument or power being centralised in a very small elite group and that there is an urban-centred approach and an enormous disconnect between it and people in regional and rural areas.  Frankly, at the heart of all of this is the disconnect between the ordinary people of South Sudan in the rural areas and a small, extremely powerful military elite political group.<\/p><p> A question was asked about whether we support the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD, endeavour.  This is at the heart of the political issue.  There have been many initiatives in the past 14 months.  One of the problems in fact has been that the process of trying to transition to a political solution has become fragmented and fractured and there are parallel and different conversations.  There is Arusha, Addis Ababa and Juba and all sorts of different avenues of conversation.  Also, within the different groups, be it the pro-government or the opposition, there has been a fracturing of the support base within those different groupings.  It is a very complex group of different factions that are now involved in a range of different talks.  The international community needs to back the one horse in this conversation.  My position on this is that IGAD approach is the most likely one to back.  It is the most advanced and probably the most credible conversation at this point.  There needs to be a very frank conversation where all of these peace talks are brought in under that one stream.  That stream needs to be amended, however.  It needs to be changed to reflect the diversity of actors that are involved in this conversation.  It has been quite limited in terms of who is involved in the process.  It has involved the elites and it has not involved the voices of the other stakeholders, which is a very significant shortfall in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015021800002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Elliott","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>I wish to ask about the role of the African Union and neighbouring countries such as Ethiopia which has been very accommodating to refugees fleeing the conflict and also Uganda.

We know the report is finished.  We know that it is ready for publication but a decision has been made not to publish it.  We know that the justification for that seems to be that in order to progress peace talks, a certain indemnity or immunity is required to bring people to the table.  That is partly why the report is being shelved.  We understand that, but I question it.  We know the conversation around the sector in South Sudan and the conversation from a number of think tanks including the parliamentary group in the UK whose name escapes me right now.  That process of conversation, understanding and transparency about what has happened has to happen in South Sudan.  There has to be an openness and a working through of the historical events and incidents and the crimes and the violence that have happened in South Sudan.  A lot of actors in this believe that failing to do so continues to support a peace process that does not address the underlying causes of conflict in South Sudan.  Without doing that it will never solve the underlying problems anyway.  There has to be a process of reconciliation and truth.  I hope that goes some way towards answering the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015021800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Elliott"},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>Is there a government?

There is a president, which is Salva Kiir.  He terminated &ndash; removed from office &ndash; many members of that government recently and they have become the heads of the opposition movement in South Sudan.  There are government-controlled areas, which are controlled by the Sudan People's Liberation Army, SPLA, the regular army of South Sudan.  There are supply lines, towns, and assets &ndash; oil fields &ndash; that are held by government forces.  There are non-government or opposition-held areas in South Sudan that are held by armed elements in the opposition group, but there is a government.<\/p> <p>  What tends to happen is that the existing governmental structure still remains in place.  There have been changes of people in some of the key positions such as state governor or some of the district level positions, depending on whether it is an opposition-held area.  Some of that has fallen down ethnically.  For example, in some of the opposition-held areas they removed the previous governor or administration and replaced it with their own, but the structures tend to be the same.  Obviously, within this type of environment any type of government funding is hugely problematic.  There are huge challenges in an effective government because it is very problematic to have government funding flowing into opposition-held areas.  This is an issue that we find problematic in some of our work, where there can be barriers put in the way of funds flowing out to things like ministry of health clinics, for example, in opposition-held areas.  There is a structure in place.  There is a government in place that controls certain areas and the opposition controls opposition-held areas.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe inquired about the nature of the conflict; whether it is rural or in the communities or what it looks like.  It is not in downtown Juba, which is the capital city, today.  It was in December.  It is however fought largely over urban areas, which are of strategic value, either areas that are on key routes into other countries, close to markets, trade routes or near the oil fields.  An example is the town of Malakal, which is close to the oil fields, but which also links Sudan to Ethiopia.  Strategic towns are fought over.  Malakal is a terrible example.  Over the course of several months at the start of the conflict somewhere in the region of 250,000 people who used to be in that town are no longer there.  No one has any idea where they are.  Malakal was a thriving town but nothing is left but burnt out buildings.  There are various villages and towns like that in South Sudan.  The conflict tends to be fought over those types of towns, roads and the oil fields, important bridges or strategic assets.<\/p> <p>  There is a question to be asked and answered about the arming of the conflict and who is supplying weapons.  Perhaps we will get into it later.  There was a question about cholera in Juba.  Cholera is under control there now.  That epidemic was dealt with last year, although it continues to be a risk.  I think it was in May last year.  I am trying to remember exactly when it was.  We talked briefly about harvesting and planting.<\/p><p> Deputy Mitchell asked how GOAL's programmes have changed.  To be honest, the type of programme we have in South Sudan is largely humanitarian programming.  Prior to the conflict in December of 2013, it was the newest country in the world but also the poorest country in the world with appalling indicators, very poor public service infrastructure and poor food security rates.  The indicators were very poor.  Before the conflict started in December, we were running a very large humanitarian programme.  We have changed some of our activities in some of the conflict areas where, for example, we were working with farmers, farmer field schools, agricultural fairs and so on.  Those have come to an end but we have rolled out measures like our emergency health care mobile clinics, nutrition activities, water and sanitation projects and expanded them into areas where people have moved from conflict.  <\/p><p> We have a new state now, Upper Nile state, in which we operate.  Upper Nile is next door to Jonglei, which is one of the primary conflict areas.  Many people have left Jonglei and moved into Upper Nile state where we have expanded a very large programme.<\/p><p> Our geography has changed a little.  We have scaled up the activities.  We have lost some agricultural livelihood activities.  The type of activities we undertake are largely the same, but we have many more beneficiaries in new areas.<\/p><p> While the logistics for South Sudan are always very difficult, where we are now in Upper Nile state, particularly in terms of the displaced, there is a community and not much else.  There are no services.  There is no air strip.  There is no clinic; there is nothing.  We had seven clinics bombed and destroyed in Upper Nile state.  We are currently using mobile clinics.  There is no infrastructure in many of the areas we are in now.  That is a new challenge for us in some ways.  We have had to build our own air strips.  We have had to clear fields for helicopter landing areas, so the logistical challenges are more difficult for us now than they were previously.  That is why the United Nations support with the World Food Programme, WFP, is so important for us in the region.  We always charter our own aircraft, but every time we charter an aircraft it costs approximately $7,000.  That flies one tonne of food into an area, but that is gone in a couple of days.  We are constantly flying in items, which makes our operations extremely expensive.  Our operations in South Sudan are the most expensive operations we have anywhere.<\/p><p> We are trying to compensate for the UN's inability to fund, deliver and put those air assets in place.  We are chartering private chargers and flying things in, which is a phenomenally expensive way of operating, but it is the only way to get that food, medicines and so on into those areas.  A properly resourced UN response in-country would negate the need for that and would be cheaper because we would not be paying premium private sector rates to commercial actors.<\/p><p> Deputy Byrne asked why 90% of the people in the camps in Gambella are women and children.  That is a very good point because we know that the number of those under 18 in the camps is extremely high.  I think there are 196,000 refugees now in Gambella of which approximately 90% are women and children, and a very high proportion of those are children under 18.  Some of them are caught up in the conflict, but many men stayed behind to either try to secure their field and harvest and to protect their family's agricultural land.  Many people stay behind and try to look after the family holdings and so on in South Sudan.  That tends to be a big issue where many of the male population remain and the women and children cross over into Ethiopia.<\/p><p> Mr. Andrews will respond on the oil question.<\/p><p> I want to come back to the hopelessness issue because it ties into the question about what this committee, and the international community, can do, even what we in GOAL can do.  It is about the small areas we can influence that will bring about significant change.  Ultimately, this is about politics; it is a political issue.  That is the big picture.  The most important thing all of us need to do is stay the course.  What do we want?  We want peace.  How do we get that?  It is a long, difficult journey.  A great deal of coercion and influence is required.  Ultimately, we have to influence this from the outside without stepping in and directly doing it.  This needs to be a South Sudan solution to a South Sudan problem.<\/p><p> How do we do that internationally as a community?  The members are much better versed in that than I am, but we have to stay the course.  We have to continue to fund operations like those of GOAL.  We must continue to keep people alive while at the same time, through the European Union, at the UN and everywhere we can, using Ireland's foreign policy platform, the reputation Ireland has to persuade and cajole.  We need to continue having these type of fora.  The committee must continue to invite us back to talk about this issue and, bit by bit, we will try to influence from the outside.<\/p><p> Ultimately, the peace talks with IGAD are where we will see the most likelihood of progress down the road, but there is a huge amount of work to be done.  There needs to be an understanding that a South Sudan solution is required.  There needs to be a real connection between the grassroots and the political elite.  There needs to be truth and reconciliation, a political will and a connection with the people of South Sudan in that solution.  All of that is missing currently in the processes that are under way.  I hope that answers most of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015021800002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Elliott","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424271600,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>I will not be very long.  Mr. Elliott has answered all the questions but I want to add some comments.<\/p> <p>  On the hopelessness question asked by many members, there is a type of desensitisation after so many conflicts and crises and the question of how we keep ourselves motivated arises.  In GOAL we do not have any sense of hopelessness.  We live by the maxim that it is not an excuse to do nothing because we cannot do everything.  We will do everything that is in our power to try to relieve the distress for as many people as possible.<\/p> <p>  We should remember that when we became Independent, a civil war occurred straight away.  Thankfully, it was a short war, but South Sudan is experiencing something similar.  It is not a time for hopelessness.  It is a time for us to apply our knowledge and experience, and not to pull the ladder up behind us.  <\/p> <p>  Many countries in western Europe experienced convulsions of violence after independence as power struggles went on, and Mr. Elliott has described the political situation in the region.  It is complex.  It is about political power struggles and taking advantage of ethnic divisions rather than them being the cause of it for long periods of time.  We are not a source of conflict.  At other times they were, and they were sometimes influenced by battles over resources and political power, so there is no sense of hopelessness.  <\/p> <p>  If we look at the role Ethiopia is playing in terms of providing support to refugees, 30 years ago Ethiopia was the recipient of dramatic international aid.  It is now a provider of refuge to hundreds of thousands of people.  That is why we should not be hopeless.  The aid community is not taking the credit for that.  Far from it.  We have played our role but this is where South Sudan will go, so there is no excuse for hopelessness.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, we live in a much murkier world.  Someone said that during the Cold War, if one understood one thing one understood everything.  It is much more complex now.  All the conflicts around the world are wars by proxy.  We have non-state actors.  There is very difficult humanitarian access in Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia and Syria.  In past conflicts we would have been welcomed anywhere as an agency, but now it is much more difficult to gain access.<\/p><p>There are these complexities and it is much more difficult to unpick, unravel and understand these things.  Deputy Crowe touched on the question as to whether people are less interested in man-made conflict than in natural disasters and they definitely are.  They perceive these things as political and therefore not deserving of our sympathy and compassion but yet, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and the Chairman saw the victims of man-made conflict in Turkey last week.  We have talked a little bit about them in respect of South Sudan.  Very often, the distinctions between natural disasters and man-made conflicts are false.  Arguably, Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines was a man-made disaster because of climate change; not a natural disaster as some would classify it.  In my view, that question is getting a little less clear.<\/p><p> In a couple of quick points, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked about the costs involved and the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, which is the parliamentary group here in the Oireachtas, has produced a very good report on the cost of war in South Sudan.  The information we have is that for the most part, armaments for the Government of South Sudan are being provided by the Government of China.  In addition, for the most part, the oil revenues of the Government of South Sudan also are being provided by China.  Clearly, it is having an influence and is providing the support for the Government to maintain the conflict.  Valerie Amos has called for an arms embargo on the Government of South Sudan, therefore identifying the supply of arms as one key driver of conflict.  Clearly, this is an outstanding issue and the report that has been produced is incredibly insightful in that regard.<\/p><p> The question everyone is asking is what can the joint committee do.  GOAL is a humanitarian organisation and as Mr. Conor Elliott noted, we would be slow to drift into ordaining political solutions.  However, it must be indigenous.  There must be a local solution and it must not merely involve the elites but must be broadly based.  We have seen this on the island of Ireland and as Mr. Conor Elliott indicated, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD, is the most likely forum in which a peace can be arrived at.  However, it must be deeper than a simple agreement.  It has been said that peace is not the mere absence of war and it will require reconciliation, which in turn requires the collection of evidence to achieve justice.  Consequently, while the report into human rights abuses by the African Union is not produced, we have turned our face against justice, evidence and reconciliation and those elements of peace which make it sustainable.  The joint committee and the Oireachtas in general can use their roles, as Mr. Elliott has stated, within the United Nations and the European Union.  They also can use Ireland's membership of the Human Rights Council, which it holds for the rest of this calendar year.  In addition, I mentioned the World Humanitarian Summit, which will be held in Istanbul in 2016.  In two months' time, Ireland will conduct its own investigation into how it can put its stamp on that summit and I encourage the joint committee to call in those people who are putting together that report and are developing the Irish voice in respect of the aforementioned summit because we must address these issues.  These are huge issues that will dominate the news for the next 20 or 30 years, be they man-made disasters, natural disasters or a relationship between the two.  Consequently, I encourage members to engage in that process.  As the meeting in Ireland will be held in Dublin on 28 May, there is plenty of opportunity for us to put our stamp on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015021800002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424271600,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives from GOAL for their attendance.

I refer to seeing the operations ourselves at first hand, visiting the border and talking to those families that have been affected by the atrocities in Syria, as well as the entire fragile situation in Syria, the movement of different areas and the question of who takes control of an area in a particular week.  When we have compiled the report, members of the joint committee should read it because it will give them a greater understanding of the complexities and challenges that exist within Syria and on the borders of Syria for the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, working there.

The witnesses mentioned all the other current areas of conflict throughout the world and it is very easy for places such as South Sudan to go off the radar as the media move around to the different areas of conflict.  As Mr. Andrews rightly stated, that country is going through a civil war with various ceasefires and so on.  Obviously, the terrain there makes it difficult for the Government there to defeat the opposition or those involved in the civil war.  Hopefully, there will be a peaceful solution and the European Union, the United Nations, the various neighbouring countries and the African Union will be able to contribute to that in some way.  I again thank the witnesses for updating the joint committee on GOAL activities there.  Members really appreciate GOAL's involvement in South Sudan and in such delicate and fragile regions.

I have sent the committee a large, recently published report entitled Illicit Drug Markets in Ireland, as well as an article on that and some implications from that study.  I will highlight some of the key points that are coming from that evidence.  We are trying to ensure that policy is informed by the evidence.<\/p> <p>  There has been fairly consistent evidence of growing levels of violence associated with the illicit drug market in Ireland since around 2005.  While violence has always had a certain role to play within illicit drugs markets, the levels and nature of the violence has changed.  In particular, the profile of victims of what we call in the literature \"systemic crime\" - that is, crime associated with drug markets - has also changed.  One of the main things that has changed is the impact on families of drug use.  Previously, while there might have been violence between those buying and selling drugs, it would have been confined to those within the market and would not have spilled out beyond that to have an impact on the families of people caught up in debt.  However, this is something that has been seen increasingly since 2005.  As a consequence, the family support network and the Garda National Drugs Unit established a pilot scheme and then an initiative to respond to that.  There is a broad community impact, but it is also a hidden impact and something that is not really on the radar.<\/p> <p>  Something else that has changed is the impact on community workers.  People working in the drugs field were generally seen as untouchable in that they were doing good work in the community.  We have seen evidence of a broader impact on the local community.  We have also seen increased youth involvement in the illicit drug trade, which has been identified since 2005, in both the supply and running of drugs.<\/p> <p>  The drug market study showed that a lot of the violence is associated with drug debt.  In recent years, just as credit dried up in the legal economy, so it did in the illicit economy.  As a result, the families of such people are trying find ways to repay those debts.<\/p> <p>  One of the main impacts on particular communities in which drug markets develop is a fear of reprisal from those involved in the drugs trade.  It is not something that generally impacts on the broader society.  When people are asked in national surveys if they have been victims of crime and they say \"Yes,\" there is a range of reasons they do not report it to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Generally, however, fear of reprisal is not one of them.  In studies I have done and in the most recent survey of 800 people in four drug markets around the country, fear of reprisal was the main reason cited by people who do not engage with the Garda.  It is a hidden harm and needs to be investigated.<\/p> <p>  There is also a strong reluctance to engage in community safety or policing initiatives.  That is a major factor in terms of any attempt to engage with local communities.  I wish to highlight a number of policy implications.  When I was invited to examine the concept of gangland crime, I did not understand the definition.  We need to broaden our conceptual understanding of the drug-crime relationship, and the nature of drug markets and how they differ across different communities and localities, as well as the nature of drug law enforcement, supply control and its impact, both routine and specialised.  We need to talk not about individuals in the drug trade but about the thousands of people who are caught up in drug dealing networks.  It is increasingly referred to in the literature as a network.  As regards focusing on individuals, there is nothing an individual can bring to the drug trade that somebody else cannot bring within a couple of months if one person is taken out of circulation.  We need to think about it as a market, so that where there is demand there will be supply.  <\/p> <p>  We also need to appreciate the challenges of drug law enforcement.  In drug-related crime - the Garda will explain this with more expertise - there is generally not an individual victim, and neither is there a crime scene.  It is an intelligence-driven form of policing and, like the market itself, it is a hidden form of policing.  It is often judged on seizures or arrests, but that does not account for all the other activity that goes on.  However, we do not really know a lot about that; it is information that needs to be examined and researched.  <\/p> <p>  We need to appreciate the complex interaction between drug markets and what I call their host communities.  Drug markets bring a lot of crime and disturbance to many local communities, but they also bring cheap goods.  For lack of a better term, they also bring employment to a lot of young people who are surrounded by unemployment.  They have a complex interaction with the local communities in which they develop, so any response needs to recognise that. <\/p> <p>  The needs of communities should also be appreciated.  In the research I conducted, people living in communities where drug markets tend to develop all identified the main reasons for drug use and drug-related problems as being high unemployment, boredom and a lack of facilities for young people.  However, when I asked what was needed in response, an overwhelming majority said they needed more garda&iacute; on the streets.  The cause and response are very different, and a different level of understanding is required as to why that is so.  Communities demand more garda&iacute; as a primary response and they also demand more amenities for local youth.  We need to provide community safety structures that can win local support.  Ms Metcalfe will talk about the north inner city community policing forum, which is the model for community safety structures.<\/p> <p>  Given the fear of reprisal, in order to get people engaged we should focus on the priorities from a community perspective.  In the study I conducted, for example, while people said they would be reluctant to engage with garda&iacute; and report drug-related behaviour to them, when asked if they would report the involvement of young people in drug dealing to garda&iacute;, the positive response was quite high.  That was something people were willing to engage with.  Or else, while they might not report young people dealing to the garda&iacute;, they would report it to their parents or others in the community.  Those are the things that people see as a priority.<\/p> <p>  Resources are required to provide community safety structures, as well as innovation to displace drug economies.  For example, one issue that has always been there is asset seizure and the call for those assets to be returned to the communities they came from.<\/p><p>When one looks at a drugs market as an illicit economy, what one is looking at are ways of displacing that economy.  In another country, I saw a local community centre funded from the proceeds of drug dealing.  That had a significant impact from a community perspective in several ways.  It was a positive influence on young people rather than the negative influence of the local dealer with the flashy car or clothes.<\/p><p> On broadening our understanding, policy responses need to be based, particularly in this highly emotive area, on empirical research.  This is an area completely bereft of original empirical research, despite the resources that go into it.  Research programmes at EU level and the development of ways to understand drug-related crime, illicit drugs markets and their structures, organisations and impact, as well as supply reduction activity, must be supported.  Research that can identify the hidden harms associated with this invisible problem must also be supported.  That is challenging research, as it requires not only national surveys but locally based research.  Systems such as PULSE should be used to capture information on cases that do not lead to prosecution.  We need to appreciate the limits of interventions.  Not all drugs markets are equally harmful in terms of their impact on communities.  Some involve open drug dealing while some might involve the open dealing of crack.  Some are more violent while some involve young people.  Given the challenges of law enforcement, in that very few drugs are seized and very few drug-dealing interactions will be intercepted, there is a hugely challenging environment.  Given the demand for drugs, there needs to be a selective focus in areas of greatest harm.<\/p><p> We also need to appreciate the unintended consequences of drug laws and their enforcement.  Successful drug seizures can actually lead to greater market disruption.  If a drug seizure is made, a debt still has to be paid which can lead to new people being brought into the drugs trade, debts being called in and increased levels of violence.  We need to look at the positive as well as the negative consequences of different interventions.  There is ten-year mandatory sentencing legislation for people caught in possession of &euro;12,500 worth of drugs.  The Law Reform Commission recently concluded that this has had unintended consequences in that the market has adapted and, simply, what it has led to is an increase in the number of people in prison who are low down the scale in the drugs market, such as couriers from impoverished countries and people caught up in debt.

Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilise all available resources and legislation, including additional legislative provisions introduced by the Oireachtas in 2009 which amended the Criminal Justice Act 2006 relating to organised crime.  The force continues to develop and implement strategies to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks through targeted operations.<\/p> <p>  Criminal organisations involved in the trafficking and distribution of illegal drugs operate at a local, national and international level.  We have various strategies to target these.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na co-ordinates drug trafficking investigations on a national and international basis through the Garda National Drugs Unit based in Dublin Castle.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na supports local communities in tackling drug dealing in their locality through various initiatives pursuing both supply and demand reduction initiatives as laid out in the Government&rsquo;s national drugs strategy.  We continue to tackle organised criminal networks involved in drug crime and drug importation, working closely with our partners in law enforcement nationally and internationally.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is involved in a variety of activities including local and regional drug and alcohol task forces, Garda youth diversionary projects, the juvenile diversion programme, the Garda schools programme and the conducting of proactive operations designed to address drug supply in communities.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, more than &euro;62 million worth of drugs were seized in the country and in excess of &euro;310 million internationally.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to tackling the supply of drugs at all levels.  We work with joint policing committees both at regional and city level.  Community policing forums are based locally in individual Garda districts and sub-districts.<\/p> <p>  Drug-related intimidation is a serious issue which impacts greatly on our communities and society as a whole, but most particularly on families.  Whether a family or loved one has drug debts should not be a deterrent in seeking the help, advice and support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will take action against drug-related intimidation, as there are several policies and procedures in place to deal with this issue.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in partnership with the National Family Support Network, NFSN, has developed a framework, the drug-related intimidation reporting programme, which is now implemented at national level to assist persons who may be subject to the threat of drug-related intimidation.  An inspector has been nominated in every Garda division throughout the country to act as a single point of contact.  Inspectors are at management level within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have significant expertise, knowledge and experience.  They liaise directly with their local superintendents on each individual case and will provide specific assistance in whatever way they can.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to create awareness and promote the drug-related intimidation reporting programme in communities nationwide, with the assistance of the NFSN, relevant agencies, regional and local drug and alcohol task forces and community groups.<\/p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has several policies and procedures in place to deal with the utilising of young persons in the illegal drugs trade.  A framework has been developed and is now in place at national level whereby an inspector has been nominated in every Garda division nationwide to ensure there is an appropriate Garda response to target adults involved in the drugs trade who use juveniles to engage in illegal activities associated with the drugs trade.<\/p> <p>  In line with action No. 38 of the national drugs strategy, a framework Pathways to Support programme has been developed, incorporating a treatment referral option for people who have been arrested by the Garda due to behaviour caused by substance misuse.  This is in line with the overall strategic aim of the national drugs strategy to provide appropriate and timely substance treatment and rehabilitation services tailored to individual needs.  This is being done with the local and regional drug and alcohol task forces, which, in turn, can refer persons to the appropriate drug and alcohol treatment and support services.  This framework is in the advanced stages and it is envisaged that it will be fully implemented by mid-2015.<\/p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that, in addition to the considerable volume of drugs seized in recent years, a significant impact has been made on dealing with the problem.<\/p><p>However, it continues to be an ongoing challenge for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We work covertly and overtly and we work in partnership with communities and all the other agencies involved in this area to try to address the particular problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015021800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Twomey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424269800,"counter":1063,"content":"<p>I am the co-ordinator of the community policing forum near the north-east inner city.

I find them a great resource.  I cannot say very much about them because I need to give them time.  There has always been petty drug dealing in most complexes but over the past few years, things have changed.  This is because of the credit crunch .  People lose their jobs and resources are gone.  We did not realise how bad it had become and how badly we were hit in respect of resources until this year.  Since the closure of Fitzgibbon Street Garda station, we have lost 120 garda&iacute; in the division.  The number could be larger, but the last time I checked it was 120.  We cannot afford to lose one garda, never mind 120.<\/p> <p>  Due to the water protests all over the country, garda&iacute; must leave my division to police protests.  This means that we are on our own again.  It is all down to resources because I know the garda&iacute; do their job and how well they can do it.  I know how well they can communicate and engage with and support me.  We do not have the resources, which is appalling.  What I am looking at in my street is similar to what happened when I started.  Intimidation is happening and it is appalling.  I have attended meetings about meetings about meetings, and nobody has ever come up with a safety net.  That is what we are missing.  There is no safety net for a woman who came into my office.  Her partner owed a drug debt of &euro;100,000.  She cried and cried and I had to counsel her for nearly four months.  She could not go to the Garda.  Who is going to protect her and her family if she gives the information regarding the drug dealer - the person her partner owes the money to?  She cannot do this.  You try to do your own thing in communities to help the family because you cannot go to the Garda.  There is no safety net.  I always make sure I get the community to engage with the Garda, but on this issue I do not because there is no safety net for them.  They go away and get the information.  <\/p> <p>  When I began my job 16 years ago, I would have thought that raiding a house or any flats complex for drugs was amazing.  I have changed my opinion, and I will tell the committee why.  When the Garda gets information on a particular house, they carry out surveillance on it and then they know whether they have the right information.  When they decide to carry out the raid, they go in.  They might come out with guns, money or drugs, and it is absolutely wonderful for them.  I am glad they get what they need, but it does nothing for us.  The garda&iacute; lead the raid at 7 a.m. and it might be 8 a.m. when they are finished.  Within the next half hour, I can guarantee operations will have started up again.  <\/p> <p>  I want to see three units in my Garda division - the drug unit, the community garda&iacute; and a mini Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, unit.  A mini CAB unit would be an amazing facility for us.  The babies who were in their prams when we were marching in 1995 might be drug dealers now, or they might be going around on bikes and getting &euro;50 for moving hash.  That is a lot of money for any child to make.  Who would not want to make a few bob every day moving drugs on a bike?  We need a mini CAB unit so that if I am a drug dealer and garda&iacute; are well aware of me and know my assets, they can target me and find out where I am getting the money from, how I am able to live in this big house and how I can drive around my community in a huge Jeep.  It is a case of \"I want that and I am going to get it.\"  <\/p> <p>  I am asking for more resources.  I cannot complain about Dublin City Council and the garda&iacute; in particular in respect of the way they communicate with my project.  It is a brilliant initiative and I would like to see it happening all over the country.  I have visited other community policing forums and I do not see them working the way we do.  That is fine, because everyone has their own way of working, but I think we work very well.  I have access from a young garda right up to the assistant Commissioner 24 hours a day, so I cannot complain about access.  What I must complain about are resources and the fact that a mini CAB unit is not being used in local communities, because we are still losing children, people are still dying and mothers and fathers are still intimidated by debt.

With regard to the nature of violence, when the drug trade, particularly the heroin trade, emerged in the 1980s, there was fear, and one of the reasons for this fear was the fact that armed criminals were moving from other types of crime such as robbery into the drug trade.  That immediately brought with it the potential for violence.  It was violence that was confined within the drug trade itself - what we refer to as systemic violence.<\/p><p>I was an adviser in the establishment of Community Policing Forum and in 2001, I conducted a survey on fear of reprisals, which was a major issue at the time.  The first meeting of the Community Policing Forum was in January 2000 or 2001.  Before that, we had distributed 3,000 leaflets and held 57 local meetings just to get people to come to Store Street Garda station for one meeting.  A huge amount of work was required in the local community, much of it trying to engage with the fear that existed.  There was cynicism and poor relations, but also a great deal of fear.<\/p><p> Around 2005, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs did a community study which identified the increasing number of young people involved in drugs.  This may have brought higher levels of violence, as young people were trying to show off to older people.  It also showed the impact beyond those involved in the drug trade in terms of debts.  This was a new departure in that the violence was no longer confined to those buying and selling drugs but was impacting on their families.  In 2009, the National Family Support Network heard about this and conducted a very detailed study with project workers.  Again, they could not speak to the people who were victims of this, but they talked to people involved in various projects with which they were associated.  The study showed very serious levels of violence, from petty violence and controlled intimidation to serious sexual assault and murder.  Much of the violence was directed in particular against the mothers of drug users.  The study showed the impact this was having on the families, not just economically but on relationships within families.  For example, a drug user's mother might be trying to deal with a debt without the father knowing.  This issue was largely hidden.<\/p><p> This issue of drug debts has become more serious.  During the Celtic tiger era, as in the legitimate economy, there was a lot of credit floating around.  There was a huge increase in the availability and consumption of cocaine, which was no longer a rich man's drug but was used across the social strata, as shown by much research.  There was much disposable income and many people willing to give drugs on credit.  The economic crash also had an impact on the illicit economy.  The credit dried up and people wanted to recoup debts from anyone they could - the user, or anybody in their family who was working, such as their grandparents.  If the dealers managed to get money from somebody, that person was seen as a soft touch, and then it became about extortion.  It was no longer about the original debt, or the debt was increased.  With younger people involved, there is a willingness to threaten very serious levels of violence for relatively small amounts of money, such as &euro;100.  Given that a gram of cannabis herb costs &euro;12, a young person can get into &euro;100 of debt over a weekend without realising, until the Monday, that he or she has to pay for the drugs that he or she thought had been given for nothing.<\/p><p> The nature of this violence and the fear it engenders are different.  While we often hear about gangland crime and we constantly read about it in the newspapers, people generally do not make a connection with it.  Somebody who reads about a person who lives around the corner or in the next estate being shot is very likely to know or be indirectly related to either the victim or the perpetrator.  The impact of this death is far greater on such a person than on a person who lives in a middle-class area that does not have an active drug market.  If an individual who is associated with the person who carried out the shooting threatens another person, knocks on his door or says in a pub that his son owes money, the person will pay up because it is a real threat.  This is how I analyse the fear of reprisals.<\/p><p> Fear of reprisals was a serious issue for many people involved with the Community Policing Forum in the north inner city, and Ms Metcalfe is the best person to testify about this.  Much of the forum's success was based around the fact that she was trusted, the involvement of people such as the late Tony Gregory, the engagement of very senior garda&iacute; and the way people said it was not a talking shop but would get real results which would be measured and evaluated.  People believed they were engaged in something that might make a difference.  Ms Metcalfe did not mention that it was resourced.  Ms Metcalfe works with two other people.  It takes resources to engage at that local level and it is the only initiative of its kind that has such a resource structure in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015021800002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Johnny Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424269800,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>In Mr Twomey's submission he stated that drug-related intimidation is a very serious issue, which we totally accept.

After this happens, it seems to break down, in line with what Ms Metcalfe said earlier.

However, there is no way they will go public because of the points Ms Metcalfe and Dr. Connolly made.  Does Mr. Twomey have any ideas on how one can deal with such intimidation from a policing point of view?

People often try to deal with the issue themselves.  For example, they will try to pay a debt or try to avoid people.  Sometimes they go to the local authority to ask to move house, but they will not say it is related to a drugs debt, although that is what it will be about.  Somebody might report violence to the Garda, but he or she would not want it go further.  It will then not appear anywhere.  We are, therefore, not being told about the true extent of the violence.  I am involved in a study with CityWide in which are we trying to conduct an audit of drug-related and community violence and intimidation.  One of the factors that distinguishes a licit market from an illicit market that is there no regulation of disputes in an illicit market and if somebody gets a bad deal, he or she has no one to go to.  In the study I conducted all of the violence was associated with debt.  A Garda drugs seizure is an indicator of successful law enforcement, but the debt relating to it will continue to stand and follow the person.  He or she might end up in prison, but the debt might follow him or her into the prison environment or affect his or her family outside prison.<\/p> <p>  One of the most in-depth studies of this kind was carried out in Limerick and it showed the different layers, including the extreme violence, about which we all know.  The study was entitled, Understanding Limerick.  The violence occurs in a continuum.  There was a story about a woman who was driving along a road in a certain housing estate in the city.  A five year old child was standing in front of her on the road and as she was about to blow the horn, she saw the child's parent at the door of the house.  She realised the parent was connected to somebody involved in a gang and, therefore, drove in a different direction.  People's houses are attacked and petty vandalism takes place, but this is choreographed to a certain degree.  There are, therefore, layers of violence and its impact is in layers.<\/p> <p>  Another study entitled, The Iceberg of Intimidation, was conducted recently in Blanchardstown.  It was not conducted by a professional researcher, but he was trying to describe the impact of the violence which occurred.  He described it as lower order violence involving young children, middle order violence involving people participating in the drugs trade, including drug users, and higher order violence involving the serious players.  Each form of violence is different and the responses need to be different.  What is done with a five year old who is caught up in this or a 12 year old who is running drugs is different from what would be done with a serious player high up in the dealing chain who never touches drugs and is never seen with them.  The violence impacts on the different levels and is insidious.  Sometimes families report that they do not know whether to pay the debt.  They might be advised by the Garda that they would be better off paying.  Sometimes it will depend on whether they trust the threat and whether they believe whoever is behind it is serious.

Another thing that is happening on a global level is a large meeting in the UN called UNGASS, which is planned for 2016, and will review the so-called war on drugs.<\/p> <p>  There are three different dimensions to the debate.  One is the arguments for legalisation, which have been heard here from different perspectives.  Legalisation is being advocated from a legal perspective; it is argued that it is a human right for people to do with their bodies what they want to do.  Much of the emphasis has been on cannabis in particular, and there have been developments in North America in which many states have legalised cannabis.<\/p> <p>  Research has been carried out recently on the head shop phenomenon.  I think that injected a dose of reality into the debate to a certain degree in that it showed that people who might not have previously experimented with psychotropic substances or mind-altering substances did so when they were made available to them, and locally available.  It challenged the argument that is often used in the legalisation debate that it does not matter what the law says because people will use drugs anyway, and it does not matter what one says or does.  I think the head shop phenomenon really challenged that and it made people realise that availability and access do matter and the law does matter.  That is one side of it.  <\/p> <p>  The other are in which there has been interest here, in particular, is decriminalisation.  The CityWide Drugs Crisis Campaign has recently urged a debate on decriminalisation.  I think it is important to make a distinction between legalisation and decriminalisation.  When one talks about legalisation one is talking about the regulation of a drug.  A lot of this pertains to cannabis.  What impact will it have on a community that has a serious drug problem if cannabis is dealt by the same person who is dealing crack?  Young people might smoke cannabis but not touch crack, but if the two drugs are in proximity to each other one has to take account of the impact that might have.<\/p> <p>  Decriminalisation is a different type of thing.  That means taking the sanction of the criminal system away from somebody who might be caught in possession of drugs for personal use - any drug, perhaps.  The person may have an addiction.  The evidence from the model that has been adopted in Portugal, which was the first European country to introduce decriminalisation in 1990, has been quite positive.  Initially it led to a slight increase in the prevalence of drug use, but that has now stabilised and Portugal has seen a sharp drop in drug-related deaths, for example.  That was decriminalisation of all drugs for personal use in a public health context, with people being diverted away from the criminal justice system into a dissuasion commission which looks at social work issues, legal issues, treatment issues and so on.  Many countries around the world have engaged with different forms of decriminalisation.<\/p> <p>   The third dimension is the need to recalibrate the balance between the criminal justice system - where many countries have focused much of their resources - and the public health system to try to find a more appropriate balance between law enforcement and criminal justice approaches and the public health response.  Maybe there is work that can be done in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015021800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Johnny Connolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1424269800,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Mac Lochlainn have another question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015021800002#F00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1424269800,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>Around $100 billion is spent per year spent on fighting the war on drugs.  It is estimated that the illicit drug trade is worth about $450 billion a year, all in the hands of criminals.  Of course, that is what drives drugs gangs; that is what drives criminal gangs.  This debate must be interlinked with policy on drugs.  It is mostly disadvantaged inner city areas that are affected.  I am a rural TD and my constituency is also affected, as is any area where there is an urban conglomeration.  I do not have a strong view one way or the other, but what I know for sure is that what we are doing now is failing and has been failing for a long time.  We have talked about the Portuguese model, but it might be useful to look at other models in the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Spain.  It is not that people are told that taking drugs is fine, but the focus is shifted from a criminal justice perspective to a health and education perspective.  We have work to do on this, and obviously while we have the policy we must also support communities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>   I apologise for making comments rather than asking questions; I will try to get to a question as quickly as I can.  It is difficult to avoid commentary on this issue.  <\/p> <p>   When I speak to people who work at the front line against drugs they tell me that, as with all community voluntary groups, they face cutbacks in the resources available to them.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na faces cutbacks in the resources available to it, and now there is apparently an upturn again in the use of drugs.  It is a cycle.  For me the temptation is to do something that takes the power away from the criminals and gives it back to the community - deploying resources in health and education and in communities to help people who feel the need to take drugs - rather than what is being done now.  I suppose I would like more debate on it from people on the panel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015021800002#F00500","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1424269800,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>What is coming across for me - and, I am sure, for Deputy Mac Lochlainn as well, is how complex this is.

One of the objectives of this system was to alleviate the resource pressure on the Forensic Science Laboratory, so that if somebody admits to cocaine or cannabis possession for personal use there might be a prosecution but they would not be prosecuted for supply.  There would be a presumptive testing regime rather than having to go to the Forensic Science Laboratory, which is usually resource intensive.  It is quite a pragmatic way of dealing with the problem, which at least alleviates some of the resource pressures, particularly in view of the fact, for example, that 80% of drug prosecutions are for what is called simple possession - section 3 possession of cannabis for personal use.  That is not where all the resources go, but a prosecution has to go through a trial and so on.<\/p> <p>   In many countries measures have been introduced, particularly at the level of possession, to find different ways of diverting people, and there have been a number of different experiments throughout the world in which they have focused on that particular dimension.  One of the initiatives here was the presumptive testing initiative.  Many of the garda&iacute; I spoke to in the study I did felt that they would like some discretionary power to be able to deal with certain cases of possession, not necessarily specifying what that was - perhaps a different approach that could be adopted for certain types of offence where they believed a warning might have been more appropriate.<\/p><p>They did not state what it would be, but that they would like to be able to adopt a different approach to certain types of offence where they believed a warning might be more appropriate.

At an earlier time I was one of the first to sit on the local drugs committee, with Ms Marie Metcalfe, the late Tony Gregory and others.  I will address some of the issues involved, having dealt with them at local level and now at national level.  <\/p> <p>  On the suggestion of a mini CAB, this was something for which Tony Gregory fought hard.  When I was chairperson of the supply sub-committee in the north inner city, the head of the Criminal Assets Bureau who later became Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Mr. Fachtna Murphy, came to the local committee and met the task force.  The outcome was that the first eight, nine or ten targets of the Criminal Assets Bureau were people nominated by the local drugs unit in the north inner city, having interacted with the community.  A very important target in the north inner city was an entire family involved in drugs supply.  The father received 20 years in prison, while four or five members of the family were arrested.  All of their assets were seized.  A \"Prime Time\" programme at the time showed the local community marching outside a house in the north inner city, off the North Strand.  It came to us and within weeks the house was the first property to be frozen by the Criminal Assets Bureau and the person responsible received 14 years in prison and his assets were taken from him.  Coincidentally, he died on the same day as Tony Gregory.  He was a main target of the local group at the time.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Metcalfe stated, she was concerned because some of us who worked with her in the community were disappearing to move elsewhere.  We have come back, in my case, as head of the drugs bureau.  Someone else who was very much involved at the time is now in a senior position in the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Mr. Stephen Courage replaced me in the drugs unit in the north inner city.  We are more than willing to meet those with whom we worked at an earlier time to look at assets and put this to the fore in the targeting by the Criminal Assets Bureau.<\/p> <p>  Many issues to do with anonymity and staff are raised with regard to having a criminal assets bureau, mini or otherwise, outside that which is in place.  In looking at alternatives and understanding the alternatives in tackling the drugs problem, after I left the north inner city drugs unit and went elsewhere, my organisation sent me to study drugs policy to masters degree level at Trinity College Dublin, where I was joined by a number of doctors, senior people in the health boards and judges.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been sent abroad - I have worked with a drugs unit in Copenhagen in Denmark.  We have studied and understand.  We realise it is for the Legislature to decide what drugs it wants to legalise, but we bring our experience - let all concerned learn from it - through, for example, the north inner city drugs forum.  Mr. Courage represents the Garda in dealing with the national drugs strategy.<\/p> <p>  On the sale of tobacco, organised crime takes place, but it an area in which we have had significant seizures in the State, involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies. Tobacco is for sale on the shelves.  Therefore, one must be cautious about looking at particular options.  If it was decided to decriminalise drugs, could Ireland do so on its own?  What about the shipment in which I, Mr. Courage and others in the national drugs unit were involved at the tail end of last year, when hundreds of millions of euro worth of drugs were seized in a vessel off the south-west coast of Ireland?  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was very much involved in the seizure.  If cannabis, cocaine or heroin was in nice little packets on shelves in chemists and it was lawful to sell it, do committee members think this shipment of cocaine, or part of it, would not have arrived into Ireland to be sold in an illicit market, just as the tobacco business has an illicit market element to it, even though tobacco can be bought legally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015021800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1424269800,"counter":1096,"content":"<p>There is a distinction between decriminalising and legalising.

For us, this was very important because in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na we did not know how best to treat people who, unfortunately, had got involved in drug use.  We do not pretend to know how they should best be treated.  In the holistic approach in the Garda we deal with law enforcement and will certainly enforce whatever legislation is decided on by everybody coming together in the interests of the victim.  Drug users are victims in this business.  We will play our part and provide whatever information we have.  We certainly have huge sympathy, as Ms Metcalfe will state.  We have dealt in a very sympathetic manner throughout the city, particularly from my experience of the north inner city, with people who, unfortunately, have become victims through using drugs.<\/p> <p>  With regard to intimidation, in the early days the problem was that people would not come to us with information on drug suppliers.  Now drug suppliers, as well as drug users, come from within the community.   Historically in the north inner city, dating back to the Lock-out, the relationship between garda&iacute; and the community was poor.  In the mid-1990s an element of trust was built.  All of a sudden, others in the drugs unit and I could walk into houses in the north inner city and people were not afraid that we would be seen walking in.  There was a genuine level of co-operation.  This continues in the north inner city, as the assistant commissioner, being in charge of policing in Dublin, is aware.<\/p> <p>  Money lending has become intertwined with the drugs business and the people creating or causing the intimidation live in the community.

It was the first such study ever conducted in Ireland and one of the first in Europe.<\/p> <p>  Despite the many concerns about the issue, we know very little about its basic elements, for example, how markets evolve in certain areas, how they are structured and organised, the impacts locally, what law enforcement agencies do and the rationale for same.  I interviewed many senior garda&iacute;, as well as garda&iacute; in the drugs units, in the four markets I studied.  I wanted to know what was their thinking and what were the challenges they faced and them to describe what they did.<\/p><p>For me, this information is important in the context of the provision of resources, yet we are almost completely bereft of this type of analysis.<\/p><p> In terms of gangland crime and the whole concept of the hierarchy and violence, not all markets are violent.  Some are more violent than others and others are geographically displaced.  One can go into a community and find a drug market in one corner that is thriving while around the corner there is nothing happening.  The are also many new markets, including on the Internet.  There is now a whole new form of buying and selling drugs that does not require a physical space or require people to even know each other or have any contact other than over the Internet.  They all pose different types of challenges.<\/p><p> In the context of the discussion around community impact, given the demand that exists in society for drugs and our legal system and the approach we have taken, the most optimistic estimate is that 20% to 25% of the drugs in circulation at any one time will be seized.  The amount of drugs that remain out there is so large we can only ever have a limited impact.  In the study I carried out the Garda acknowledged the reality that it can disrupt the market temporarily but it will recover very quickly.  There is a need for a more holistic and broader approach which requires us to think about what we actually mean when talking about gangland and to identify our concerns in that regard.  For example, are we talking about youth getting involved in gangs and how we interact and prevent this at an early stage?  Are we speaking in particular about violence?  Interestingly, the number of so-called gangland shootings has decreased recently.  Why is that?  What is going on that the number has decreased? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015021800002#H03300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Johnny Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424269800,"counter":1132,"content":"<p>Did Dr. Connolly say that the number of gangland shootings has decreased?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015021800002#J00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424269800,"counter":1133,"content":"<p>Yes, but only recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015021800002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Johnny Connolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1424269800,"counter":1134,"content":"<p>There were two such shootings in the past 24 hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015021800002#J00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424269800,"counter":1135,"content":"<p>I am speaking about prior to that.  We need to look at what is happening in the market to explain that change.  We need to identify the harms we are trying to address and to acknowledge that while the Garda might be able to disrupt a market temporarily there will still be people who are looking for drugs who perhaps need to be diverted into treatment.  It is essential that the Garda work with treatment organisations, and it is.  In terms of a policy approach, both actions must go hand-in-hand.  We need to change our conceptualisation in terms of the language we use and to focus our energy and resources on what we think are the most harmful aspects of a market.  For example, in one of the areas I studied there was an open thriving market for crack cocaine in a particular shopping centre.  As there is only one real shopping centre in this area one can imagine the impact this is having on the local community, in particular the young people in that community.  That is a clear priority.<\/p> <p>  While it will not be possible to remove that market in its entirety, intensive engagement is required to disrupt it, not only because of the harm associated with that particular drug but because of its visibility.  That in a sense is what I am talking about.  This is what is happening on a European level.  A worthy Irish focal point is the European monitoring centre on drugs and drug addiction based in Lisbon which, along with the Irish representative of that agency, Europol and the European Commission is looking at how we can improve our monitoring of the links between drugs and crime, drug markets and supply control activities in trying to develop an evidence base in this area.<\/p> <p>   As I mentioned earlier, I am currently engaged in a study with CityWide which is trying to put a number on the amount of incidents of intimidation on society.  We all know this is happening.  It has been reported to councillors and Deputies but it is not appearing in any official picture.  From a Garda perspective this information, even if does not result in any prosecution - this is something that the Garda Inspectorate recently comment on - should be counted.  Threats in this area generally escalate.  As in the case of domestic violence, the first threat should be recorded somewhere because it will probably tend to escalate.  Even if a reported incident does not end up in a prosecution we will, at least, at a policy level be able to get a handle on the extent of the problem, including who is making the threats and if they are coming from the same individuals and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015021800002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Johnny Connolly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424269800,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>In regard to intimidation and the reporting programme, we are satisfied that there is an uptake in this regard.

Cigarette smuggling was referenced in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Retail Excellence Ireland appeared before the committee recently on a different matter.  That agency stated that it would be willing to fund the use of scanners of containers at ports.  This would require the provision of hand held devices which could be used to scan containers to see if, for example, cigarettes were legal or not.  Many people say we should ban cigarettes.  However, they are legal.  Those who smoke pay a huge amount of tax on the cigarettes they purchase, which tax will be used to fund the health services they will probably require when they end up in hospital at some future point because they smoked so many cigarettes.  When speaking about drugs it is important we speak about all things that damage our health, including alcohol, cigarettes and drugs.  Currently, it is approximately &euro;10 for a pack of 20 cigarettes.  However, it is possible to buy them illegally for half that price.  This means a reduction in taxes for the Exchequer and a consequent reduction in health services provision.  Cigarettes are legal on the basis of the amount of taxes they bring in for the Exchequer.  That is the understood public principle in this regard.  Therefore, cigarette smuggling undermines all of this.<\/p> <p>  What is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na strategy and approach to tackling cigarette smuggling?  This is related directly to the topic we are discussing now.  If we are to consider decriminalisation of particular drugs we need also to ensure that we tackle the criminal enterprises.  An education policy only is not sufficient.  There will always be a role for law enforcement and tackling those who are acting illegally.  If we are to allow people to legally take alcohol, cigarettes and drugs then there needs to be a tax return to support the health services that will be required into the future to help them when they experience health difficulties.  This is where the criminal justice agencies come in.  What is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na strategy around cigarette smuggling?  Is it working with Retail Excellence Ireland to tackle the issues and take on board the offer it has made?  Can we then with confidence say if we ever were to consider decriminalising drugs that the same approach would be taken in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2015021800002#J00700","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1424269800,"counter":1138,"content":"<p>There is a difference between legalising and decriminalising something.

All the law enforcement agencies of this State, with the relevant law enforcement agencies of Northern Ireland, meet in what is called the cross-Border organised crime forum.  We publish a threat assessment every year and detail the activities in which we engage.  Through a combination of activities on both sides of the Border, the combined law enforcement authorities on the island tackle the illicit sale of cigarettes.  Primarily, it is a Revenue issue and that is how most of the seizures take place.

It is the first time I have had the opportunity to address this committee.  I hope that my contribution will be of help to the members in the work they are doing.<\/p> <p>  Dr Horgan&rsquo;s petition touches on many important matters such as Ireland's traditional policy of neutrality and our views and policy with respect to international human rights laws.  In its initial consideration of the petition, the committee found that the claims made by the petitioners are very serious.  The petitioners made an oral presentation to the committee last June and I understand the members of the committee made a fact finding visit to Shannon Airport in October.  The Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also appeared before the committee last December to discuss the role of that Department in decisions relating to foreign military aircraft.<\/p> <p>  In March of last year the committee wrote to my Department seeking clarification on a number of matters related to the petition.  In response the Department pointed out that many of the issues raised by the petition are more relevant to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In addition to its appearance before the committee in December, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also addressed these issues in some detail in its written responses to the committee in December 2013 and March 2014.  In advance of meeting the members here this afternoon, my Department has also provided the committee with a comprehensive briefing note, which updates and elaborates on the information provided in the Department&rsquo;s previous letter.<\/p> <p>  Before addressing the matters that fall within my remit, it is useful to briefly set out the historical context.  The transit of US military through Irish airspace and airports is a longstanding practice, which began shortly after the Second World War.  Successive Irish Governments have maintained this practice and Ireland has never withdrawn or suspended these facilities.  Similarly, successive governments have deemed this to be compatible with Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality, which is characterised by non-participation in military alliances.<\/p> <p>  I must make it clear at the outset that as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, my functions in regard to the use of Shannon Airport and Irish airspace by the US military are limited.  The relevant functions that I have are outlined in detail in the briefing note provided to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The issues that are of most concern to the petitioners fall outside the remit of my Department.  Questions relating to Irish foreign policy, Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality, alleged extraordinary rendition and the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not matters on which I am able to comment in any detail.  Similarly, I have no role in regard to flights by military or state aircraft through Irish airspace or landing at Irish airports.  Such flights require the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952. <\/p> <p>  A clear distinction is made in both international and national law between military aviation and civil aviation.  I am responsible for matters relating to Irish civil aviation legislation and policy.<\/p><p>The 1944 Chicago Convention is the main international treaty governing the operation of civil aviation.  Article 3 states that the convention is not applicable to state aircraft, being aircraft used in military, customs or police services.  The convention set up the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, a specialised agency of the UN.  Ireland was a founding signatory of the convention, has fully ratified it and is an active participant in the ongoing work of ICAO.<\/p><p> At the core of civil aviation law at international, EU and national level is the safety and security of aircraft and persons on board aircraft.  It is the responsibility of my Department and the Irish Aviation Authority to ensure that civil aviation using Irish airspace does so in as safe and secure a manner as possible.  For good reason, civil aviation is one of the most regulated industries in the world.  A comprehensive legal framework at global, EU and national levels applies to all civil aviation using Irish airspace, irrespective of what or who is on board such aircraft.<\/p><p> Civil aircraft have been used by the defence forces of many countries for various purposes for many years.  For instance, the Irish Defence Forces often charter civil aircraft to deploy personnel on UN peacekeeping missions abroad.  Civil aviation law applies to aircraft being used by the military in the same way as it applies to other civil aircraft.  The petition focuses on the use of Shannon Airport and Irish airspace by the US military in particular.  Like all other civil aircraft, when such aircraft are used by the US military in Irish airspace, my primary role is to ensure that these aircraft are operated safely and securely, in accordance with applicable laws.<\/p><p> Article 35 of the Chicago Convention states that no civil aircraft may carry munitions of war over a state without that state&rsquo;s permission.  This requirement is ratified in Irish law in the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, as amended. Under the 1973 Order the carriage of weapons and munitions of war is prohibited in any civil aircraft in Irish airspace and on board any Irish registered aircraft, unless an exemption is granted by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Chicago Convention and the 1973 Order apply to munitions of war only, not to military personnel that may be on board civil aircraft.<\/p><p> I have already provided the committee with statistics on exemptions issued under the 1973 Order.  In 2014, a total of 584 exemptions were issued, a significant decrease from a peak of 1,495 exemptions issued in 2007.  The period 2005 to 2011 saw the highest number of exemptions issued.  The vast majority of the exemptions granted under the Order relate to munitions of war belonging to the US military - this is more a function of geography than policy.  Since 2011 there has been a consistent reduction in exemptions due to the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq and the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan.<\/p><p> In many cases, for these flights operated on behalf of the US military for which exemptions are issued, the most direct flight path between points in North America and points in continental Europe passes through Irish airspace.  The US Department of Defence has used civil aircraft to transport troops and munitions of war between the US and Europe since the Second World War.<\/p><p> In accordance with the provisions of the 1973 Order, my Department operates a procedure under which airlines wishing to carry weapons or munitions through Irish airspace or airports must apply for each individual flight at least 48 hours in advance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021800002#B00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424275200,"counter":1160,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt the Minister but I have just been advised by the broadcast section that someone has a mobile telephone close to a microphone and it is causing interference.

My Department seeks the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on foreign policy issues and the Department of Justice and Equality on security issues.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Aviation Authority is consulted on aviation safety issues but only on applications involving munitions that are also categorised as dangerous goods.  If any of these bodies objects, an exemption will generally not be granted.  A copy of the application is also sent to the Department of Defence for information.<\/p> <p>  As I have stated, the vast majority of exemptions under the 1973 Order are issued to US airlines chartered by the US Department of Defence transporting US troops to various destinations around the globe.  Usual international practice is that such troops travel with their personal weapons.  The weapons are unloaded and no ammunition is on board the flights.  Given the unloaded weapons on board, these flights require an exemption under the 1973 Order to enter Irish airspace.<\/p> <p>  Roughly half of these flights land at Shannon for refuelling purposes, while the rest overfly Ireland.  The choice of routing for these flights is a matter for the airlines themselves.  Around 90% of the exemptions issued are for civil charters carrying troops, with the personal unloaded weapons of the troops on board.  For obvious safety and security reasons there are very strict civil aviation rules regarding the carriage of any dangerous goods on aircraft.  Unloaded firearms, however, are not categorised as dangerous goods.  Nevertheless, any civil aircraft transporting munitions of war in Irish airspace, irrespective of whether they are categorised as dangerous goods, requires an exemption.  In addition, while the dangerous goods rules do not apply to the carriage of unloaded weapons, there are other rules regarding the carriage of unloaded weapons in aircraft to ensure the safety and security of the aircraft.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 10% of the exemptions are for aircraft carrying munitions of war other than unloaded weapons, such as ammunition and explosives.  These are usually transported on cargo-only aircraft and the aircraft transporting such munitions do not usually land in Ireland.  Such munitions are of course classified as dangerous goods and are subject to the same strict rules that apply to the many other types of dangerous goods that are transported by air every day.<\/p> <p>  I hope what I have said today, together with the briefing note provided to the committee, have clarified the role I and my Department play in the issues raised by this petition.

I thank the Minister and his officials for attending.  This has been a very emotive petition.  I was one of the people who went to Shannon and we had a very good briefing there.  There is a sense from the petitioners that because of the way the system is set up, it is almost like a political three-card trick.<\/p><p>Technically, we can say we are neutral as a State but activists on the ground who have been watching the flights coming in and out of Shannon, and international observers, seem to think we cannot classify ourselves as neutral because of the nature of the flights coming through Shannon.  That is what we are trying to tease out at some of the hearings we have been having, and I welcome the Minister's presentation today.<\/p><p> A number of issues were raised by the petitioner.  I know the Minister is not responsible for the military flights that are landing but in terms of the civilian planes landing at civilian airport next to military aircraft, which we know are carrying ammunition in some cases, as Minister with responsibility for the civilian element, is he concerned that Shannon could be seen as a target because of the military aircraft?  Is there a danger to civilians who are unknowingly landing in the airport next to military aircraft?  Could this put civilian passengers coming through what they would see as a civilian airport in danger in terms of the dual nature of the airport being used for both purposes?<\/p><p> I appreciate the Minister said he does not wish to comment extensively on neutrality but as a Cabinet member, he has collective responsibility for Government policy.  Could he outline for us his understanding of the meaning of neutrality?  Some of the petitioners and other people we have heard from believe that, technically, we might be neutral.  Yet any independent observer who is seeing military troops coming through an airport, even unarmed soldiers because the guns are not loaded, would see them as a military force coming through an airport in a State we are being told is neutral.  That is part of the argument being put forward.<\/p><p> The weapons are unloaded.  What checks are done to make sure the weapons are unloaded?  How do we know they are unloaded?  That is a question that has been raised with us.  Also, we know that in the aftermath of the  9\/11 attacks some jurisdictions had a policy of putting agents on aircraft, air police as such, to police some of the flights.  If an FBI agent is on a flight from the United States as an air policeman, has he or she got loaded weapons with him or her on those civilian flights?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021800002#C00400","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424275200,"counter":1164,"content":"<p>We will take those questions first and the Deputy can come back in later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021800002#D00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1424275200,"counter":1165,"content":"<p>I will come back in because I have a number of other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021800002#D00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1424275200,"counter":1166,"content":"<p>I do not want to have four or five questions put to the Minister.

He is correct that while I do not have a formal role for foreign policy in regard to neutrality, I am a member of the Cabinet and have collective responsibility regarding that matter.  The two defining characteristics for me in regard to our neutrality are, first, our non-participation in military alliances.  Second, I would interpret it as being the role we play, and have played, in terms of the values with regard to the rule of law and human rights.  They are the two defining characteristics of our policy of neutrality.<\/p> <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, a role I held before I became Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I saw in great detail the strategic value of that policy to our State because while I would justify it in terms of principles, it is the right policy for our country.  It means also that we can bring value and a perspective to discussions on foreign policy matters.  That is valuable and allows us to project our values and beliefs in what is currently a volatile and difficult world.<\/p> <p>  On the second question the Senator put to me about Shannon Airport, the security status of all our airports is monitored constantly.

Given there may be fewer exemptions now, as the Minister has stated, could such checks be something the Department could do in a manner similar to what the Garda would do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021800002#E00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1424275200,"counter":1185,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  As for his first question on whether, because there are fewer civil aircraft now coming through the airport, it would be easier to deploy an operation, the logical answer to that question is that because fewer aircraft were going through any kind of a check or mechanism, it would be covering a smaller number of aircraft than was the case in the past.  As for my own role in this regard, I must emphasise again - I acknowledge this may be unsatisfactory to the committee - that I only have a role in respect of civil aircraft.  I have no role with regard to military aircraft or aircraft used for any other purpose.  I am purely focused on that point.  As for the checking of assurances provided, I reiterate that the Government raises these matters with the US Government when an aircraft is coming through.  The Government accepts the assurances given to it and if anybody has evidence to the contrary with regard to the breaking of those assurances, it is a matter then for the regulatory body or for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021800002#E00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1424275200,"counter":1186,"content":"<p>Does that actually happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021800002#E00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1424275200,"counter":1187,"content":"<p>In respect of rendition, I am not aware.

It is estimated that 2.3 million US soldiers came through Shannon Airport, the overwhelming majority of them so doing with exemptions or licences from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Throughout that period, they were travelling on civilian or chartered aircraft and all 2.3 million of them would have had sidearms and, one assumes, rifles, which the Minister has stated were unloaded.  I refer to a scenario in another country in which persons on their way to a theatre of war stopped in someone's house.  They were wearing full military clothes, clearly identified themselves as being involved in conflict and carried their weapons into the house.  They were given dinner and sleeping quarters overnight but later on, when those in that household were being prosecuted by the relevant authorities, they argued that the weapons were unloaded.  Although the members of that household did not check, they claimed they were assured by the visitors that the weapons were unloaded.  Does the Minister think that would constitute a defence of the proposition that the household in question was neutral in that war?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021800002#E00600","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1424275200,"counter":1189,"content":"<p>That is a good and pointed analogy to put to me.  However, there is a difference between the relationships between a household and families and that between two countries.  We have raised this issue at diplomatic and political level with the US Government, which is the source of nearly all of the personnel to whom the Chairman refers.  The American authorities have assured the Government clearly that the requests of the Irish Government are being implemented.  It is the clear and strong understanding of the Government that the munitions with which it would be necessary to load these weapons are not on the aeroplane.  Our understanding is the munitions are carried on a separate aeroplane most of the time.  Consequently, where I would differ, in respect of the Chairman's analogy, is that we are not talking about relations between families or between communities but about relations between two countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021800002#E00700","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1424275200,"counter":1190,"content":"<p>That brings me to my next question.  I am as strong an advocate as anybody about the importance of the relationship between Ireland and the United States.  We have umbilical ties extending back hundreds of years, as well as strong trade relations.  Obviously, large numbers of Irish people are based in the United States and Irish companies employ 100,000 people in the United States, while American companies employ approximately the same number here in Ireland.  Consequently, our relationships are very important.  However, in respect of international law and our having declared ourselves to be a neutral country, the United States took part in a war on Iraq after the attacks on 11 September 2001 that was not sanctioned by the United Nations.  It was an initiative the United States took with some other countries in its own right.  Undoubtedly, large numbers of troops who were involved in that conflict passed through Ireland while on their way into Iraq.  Many of them stayed overnight, had food and so on and were wearing military uniforms before continuing on their way.<\/p> <p>  I make the point that neutrality is precious to the Irish people.  I refer to positive neutrality, which means taking part in United Nations peacekeeping missions or being involved in conflict resolution.  For example, as we speak, we are involved in conflict resolution in the Basque country, Colombia and Sri Lanka.  Third, in respect of foreign affairs, no country over the past ten years has given more to overseas aid, per head of capita, than have the Irish people.  Therefore, we are involved in positive neutrality or that is how it is perceived.  How does the approach of positive neutrality then marry with the fact that Ireland allowed in large numbers of US troops on their way to Iraq in an operation that was not sanctioned by the United Nations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021800002#E00800","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1424275200,"counter":1191,"content":"<p>These are questions I am sure the Chairman will put to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

I wish to follow up on his understanding of neutrality.  He has stated this is a foreign policy matter, but it has been put to him that he is part of the Cabinet and that, therefore, there is collective responsibility.  In so far as he must adjudicate on the civil safety and security aspects of any application made for the use of civilian airports, in doing so he must also make a certain judgment on what the potential security risk might be and, consequently, not only consider whether he believes a flight would accord with neutrality but also how others who might be security threats might consider it.  In deciding whether it is safe to use Shannon Airport, he must consider whether others might consider it a target.  It seems it is part of his remit to consider whether it would be in danger for whatever reason, even if he thinks it is all fine in terms of neutrality, as others might not perceive it as such, including those who might want to target the US military in some way.  The sheer scale of the numbers of US troops and munitions, in some cases dangerous munitions, which pass through Shannon Airport, particularly in the context of the Iraq and Afghan wars, massively outstrips any other licence or exemption given by the Minister to any other country and means that any outside observer is likely to see us as participating, given that it involves disproportionately US weaponry and US personnel in their millions heading into the theatre of war.  Is it not reasonable to be concerned that others might think that, no matter what we may say, we are participating and that consequently Shannon Airport is at risk?<\/p> <p>  The Chairman took certain thoughts from my mind because I was going to use the exact same analogy in terms of somebody coming into a house.  I will extend this analogy.  Let us say a very good friend of the Minister's, whom he has known for years and trusts and with whom he has very good relations, drops in and states he has guns in the car and is on the way to take out somebody whom he believes is a terrorist.  He then states he does not have bombs in the car but has stashed them outside the Minister's property.  The Minister would not let this person into the house no matter how well he knew him and how well he trusted him because he would consider it to be participation or support for the action about to be taken.  Any reasonable person would say it would amount to participation.  If anybody involved in a criminal investigation - if it was not about military issues - was to question the Minister subsequently were he to allow it to happen, he would be considered to be complicit in the conduct of a crime.  Is that not the case and is it not how any reasonable outside observer would look at it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015021800002#H01100","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1424275200,"counter":1246,"content":"<p>On whether the passing through of US troops makes Ireland or its airports a terrorist target, that is not the way in which a decision is famed on aviation security.

The political response or the potential violent response of others to a decision which might be taken is a foreign and security policy matter.  It is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality which takes all such matters very seriously.

What he seems to be saying is that generally the reason applications are refused is aeroplanes would be carrying indiscriminate weapons.  As opposed to personal guns or rifles which are unloaded, apparently, such aeroplanes would possibly be carrying indiscriminate weapons such as cluster bombs and missiles.  For some reason, the authorities, the Department or whoever assessed the risk of what might be carried on board, decided the particular flights might be carrying these things.  On what basis did the Minister come to this conclusion?

A number of reasons could lead to such a recommendation, the first of which is the indiscriminate nature of the munitions.  The Chairman has quizzed me on that matter, but the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade can revert to the committee on it.  Other issues could be considered, for example, the origins of a flight, to where it would be flying, the international climate at the time and so on.

The Deputy has travelled up and down the country to meet our members on so many occasions.  I thank Deputy Ellis for his help and contribution.<\/p> <p>  Today is our last-ditch attempt to seek change within our industry to ensure the safety of thousands of lives that are at risk across the country.  Lives of families in each constituency are at risk because of the failure of the regulatory system.  We are the people on the ground working in people's homes and businesses each day.  Our members witness illegal operations but little or nothing is being done about it.  We have tried for over two years to engage with the regulator to find a solution.  There is a need for proactive policing and severe penalties for those who break the law.  These are not currently in place.<\/p> <p>  Down the corridor from here, there is a public banking inquiry under way.  The one point on which we can all agree is that this inquiry is being held because the regulator was asleep at the wheel.  If our industry is not properly regulated, sooner rather than later it will face the same fate as the thousands affected by the collapse of the banks.  However, we are facing serious fatalities, with thousands of people's lives at risk.  We simply cannot wait until it is too late.  Our members are deeply concerned and holding out hope for a positive outcome today and for the help of the committee to prevent a major crisis.  I shall now hand over to our secretary, Mr. James Egan, who will explain to the committee a number of the facts, including those on the illegal operations of natural gas systems installers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Giffney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424251800,"counter":1294,"content":"<p>This presentation is crazy and I hope it is clear to all the members.  Some 100,000 illegal boilers have been installed since the regulatory system was introduced in June 2009.  We are deeply concerned about this and believe lives are at risk.  Some of the potential accidents could kill.  The market is awash with illegal operators and there is a loss of revenue to the State as a consequence.  It is driving legitimate operators out of business.  These are the main three points we would like to get across.<\/p> <p>  In 2012, it was suggested to us by the chairman of Register of Gas Installers of Ireland, RGII,<\/p> <p>and it was discussed with the CER that we should look into the number of boilers sold in Ireland.  In 2012, Mr. Dermott Jewell carried out an independent survey and contacted the main six brands.  There are probably ten or 15 but, as with every industry, the main ones are fewer in number.  When Mr. Jewell contacted the six main boiler brands, he discovered they sold 27,500 boilers in 2011.<\/p> <p>  Under legislation, the CER has responsibility for putting in place what is supposed to be a comprehensive system of safety.  In June 2009, it set up RGII, whose remit is to regulate registered gas installers.  With regard to the investigation of complaints made to it, it is not responsible for identifying illegal works or installers.  This is a fundamental flaw in the system.  We believe no one takes responsibility for proactively identifying illegal works and operators.  The system is not like that in Northern Ireland where the inspector actively looks for people who are doing illegal works.  If necessary, he will call to their home, mark the cards, camp outside or do whatever must be done.  <\/p> <p>  For over three years, the APHCI has been talking to the CER and RGII about the scale of illegal and black-market operations.  In 2014, after years of denying the problem, the CER acknowledged to the APHCI that action was needed.  Despite this acknowledgement, we feel nothing has really happened since, and little action has been taken.  The CER produced a decision paper recently entitled Regulation of the Gas Installer Industry with respect to Safety from 2016.  In 2016 the RGII&rsquo;s tender will have expired.  It may be reappointed then, or some other body might be.  That is why 2016 is the year listed.  In the document, which was published last November or December, the CER expressed the view that, in general, the scheme has worked effectively to regulate gas installers from a safety perspective.  We found, after working with it for a long time, that this was just unacceptable.  We invested considerable time in seeking change but saw there would be none and that there would be another seven years of the same conditions.<\/p> <p>  There are 30,000 gas boilers sold each year.  Some 12,000 of these are certified.  It is legally required by the legislation that they be certified.<\/p><p>By law, the certificates are supposed to be returned to the RGII within ten days.  <\/p><p> By comparison, the number of registered gas installers in Northern Ireland is 2,000.  On 13 February, the number of registered gas installers in the Republic of Ireland was 2,775.  The market in the Republic is obviously far bigger than that in Northern Ireland.  In its 2009 tender document, the CER said there were 4,984 gas installers in the Republic.  There are 650,000 gas customers in the Republic and fewer than 6,000 boiler replacement certificates are returned to the RGII each year.  This means that a gas boiler is being replaced, on average, once every 108 years.  <\/p><p> The CER published a report for the Minister on safety cut-offs and disconnections.  According to the report for 2011, two years after the scheme came in, safety disconnections were up 133%.  Safety disconnections occur where somebody has a problem in their home.  When they telephone Bord G&aacute;is networks, which is now called Gas Networks Ireland, somebody calls out to them within 25 minutes.  If they find a problem internally in the house they will safely disconnect.  <\/p><p>  An independent public inquiry needs to be set up to finally establish the facts.  We need proactive policing, not advertising.  The CER will say that it advertises about carbon monoxide and about always using a registered gas installer.  In theory that is great, but in practice we need inspectors to proactively seek illegal operators and illegal works.  A systematic approach is required to tackle the 18,000 uncertified boilers that are sold annually.  <\/p><p> We need to have sufficient penalties for those who break the law.  Since 2009, there have been about ten or 11 prosecutions.  The majority of those prosecutions, as far as I am aware, have been given the Probation Act.  Their names have not been published and they have received fines in the region of &euro;250.  It is laughable because it encourages people not to register.  At the end of the process, that person can still become registered.  There is nothing to stop them from becoming registered, even during the prosecution.<\/p><p> Someone needs to take responsibility for the seriousness of what is happening.  Legislation is required on the sale of boilers only to registered gas installers.  Every boiler that is produced and brought into this country has a unique reference number, which can be traced by the manufacturers.  It is possible for that number to be taken by a supplier, when it is sold over the counter, and put into the system.  That can then be followed up through the installer to ensure the certificate was issued and where that boiler was installed.  From that information, inspections could be carried out in people's homes.  The system is there to do it.<\/p><p> As regards random inspections, at the moment registered gas installers are inspected once a year.  It is done by appointment and they get to choose where they meet the inspector.  No one from RGII is going out to look for illegal workers outside that system.  No home should be insured unless it has certification for the gas boiler.  This is already the case with alarms and others such items.<\/p><p> We first brought this matter to public attention in 2012, yet three years later nothing has really changed.  The current system is not fit for purpose.  A recent survey of registered gas installers, which closed six days ago, showed that 98% said they have no confidence in the CER or the regulatory system.  Some 95% said they had no confidence in the RGII, and 98% said they would like an independent public inquiry.  The system simply allows illegals to go unhindered with little or no chance of being prosecuted.<\/p><p> We issued the survey at 3 p.m. on 5 February and two hours later we had received 31 replies.  Each survey comes back with an IP address.  It was a requirement of the survey, but was not compulsory in that one could still complete the survey without completing a couple of parts of it.  We asked for the RGII number, name and telephone number so that we could identify who voted.  The 31 replies had nothing on them.  They were in favour of the system.  When we looked up the IP address online it turned out to be RECI's IP address.  The RGII is a subsidiary of RECI.  The following morning a further 81 similar replies were received.  For obvious reasons these have been removed from the survey.  They were invalid because they did not have a person's name on them, but it illustrates the point.<\/p><p> A level playing field must be achieved with a proactive approach to finding illegals.  We want the JLC to provide an independent consultant to investigate the regulatory system.<\/p><p> That concludes my presentation, which I hope was clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Egan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424251800,"counter":1296,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Egan and will now hand over to Commissioner Garrett Blaney.

We are pleased to make a presentation on the important issue of gas safety.<\/p> <p>  All aspects of the gas supply chain are subject to safety regulations - that is, from the well to the burner tip.  I want to reassure the committee that gas is essentially a safe fuel in Ireland.  I want to reassure gas customers that they can have assurance on gas safety if they use a registered gas installer to carry out an installation in their home, to service or change a boiler, or to carry out any work on their gas installation.  <\/p> <p>  I wish to make three key points about using registered gas installers.  First, those gas installers are on the register because they have been deemed competent to be there.  Second, they are insured.  Third, they are subject to audit and inspection by the Register of Gas Installers of Ireland.  That is the assurance gas users can take from using a registered gas installer.  It is a key message that we continue to try to put out, both in our dialogue with the industry and in the advertising we run.<\/p> <p>  Nevertheless, we operate on the basis of continuous improvement.  The scheme we run is subject to continual review in order to determine where improvements can be made.  We welcome the opportunity to talk with stakeholders, including the association, and to talk here today with members of the joint committee.<\/p> <p>  We learn from this dialogue and from the investigations that we carry out, and we also learn from any gas incidents that occur.  This feeds into our ongoing development of the registered gas installers' scheme.  There are three key facets to the overall RGII scheme.<\/p><p>First, we rely on communication - making the public aware of the general dangers associated with gas and with  installation that is not carried out by a competent installer.  Second, we carry out prosecutions of unregistered gas installers who install or carry out servicing on a gas installation or who portray themselves as a registered gas installer.  Both of these are criminal offences for which we have powers to prosecute.  The third aspect of the regulatory scheme is registration, the means by which we ensure people can be portrayed as registered gas installers and, therefore, people can have confidence in using them to carry out gas works.<\/p><p> All functions pertaining to the registered gas installers scheme stem from the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006.  As with everything done by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, it is a creature of statute and operates within the legal framework that is in place.  The CER is responsible for the overall operation of the scheme.  It defines works that can only be carried out by a registered gas installer.  We have the power to define gas works which are restricted to registered gas installers.  We also undertake prosecutions of people who carry out gasworks when they are not registered gas installers and those who portray themselves as registered gas installers when they are not.  We also undertake audits and inspections of the gas safety supervisory body, the Register of Gas Installers of Ireland, RGII.  Through public consultation and engagement with various stakeholders, we make decisions on the overall RGII scheme criteria.  Recently, we completed a consultation on it.<\/p><p> We also carry out activities to raise public awareness about the dangers associated with carbon monoxide and the need to use a registered and competent installer when getting any fuel-burning appliances serviced or changed.  The RGII is under contract to us to provide the day-to-day operation of the scheme.  It maintains and publishes the register of gas installers and it is its job to ensure all applicants to join the register have attained the appropriate qualifications and hold insurance.  One common reason for an installer to be suspended temporarily is that he or she does not have insurance.  RGII also undertakes audit and inspection of installers on at least an annual basis.  It will also investigate complaints where members of the public or gas customers make a complaint against a registered gas installer.<\/p><p> When the voluntary registration scheme operated, it had between 500 and 600 installers on its register.  Since the scheme became statutory, the number has risen to 3,000 registered gas installers.  The majority of certificates sold are servicing certificates.  There is a gap between the number of certificates sold and the number returned to RGII.  Recent initiatives have been put in place which we hope will address this.  We have already seen some improvements in rectifying this gap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424251800,"counter":1300,"content":"<p>A key building block of the scheme is our reliance on the public to act as the police, as it were, on the ground.  It is important for the success of the scheme that the general public be aware of why the scheme is in place, its benefits and what people can do to protect their families and their homes.  The CER, in conjunction with RGII and other stakeholders, participates in several publicity campaigns on a yearly basis.  These are designed to focus on the key message, which we try to get across to the general public in an accessible manner.  Essentially, the message is to use a registered gas installer to carry out work at home as it is a legal requirement.  They are insured, competent and will do the work in accordance with the standards set down.  We also advertise the importance of servicing gas appliances such as boilers, and carbon monoxide awareness, a key risk to the public but one against which it can protect itself.  We also advertise through public engagement how people can contact us if they suspect work has been carried out in their home which is substandard or carried out by unregistered workers.  Whenever we have a successful prosecution, we advertise that, as it will act as a further deterrent against illegal activity.<\/p> <p>  Prior to 2009, when the CER took over this legal responsibility, a voluntary scheme was in place with only 800 people participating in it.  Now it is a legal requirement.  Due to the work done on public engagement, awareness of the RGII and its benefits has increased over time, reaching a level of 69% among natural gas users.  Not only do we put our efforts into engaging with the public, as they are key to the scheme, and carrying out the awareness campaigns, we also monitor the effectiveness of these campaigns to see if the message is getting across.  Over time, we have adjusted the message to ensure it remains effective.<\/p> <p>  It is a legal requirement for people who are undertaking gas works in the home to be registered.  It is also illegal for a person to claim he or she is a registered gas installer when that is not the case.  Penalties have been laid out in legislation for these offences.  On indictment, there is a fine of &euro;15,000 and the potential for three years&rsquo; imprisonment and, on summary conviction, a &euro;5,000 fine and six months&rsquo; imprisonment.  We have put much effort over the past two years into strengthening the work we do in the enforcement area.<\/p><p>All complaints notified to the CER are investigated.  We do not tolerate illegal activity and as such, we investigate all complaints.  The number of successful prosecutions we have taken has increased.  Last year, we had seven successful prosecutions and we have had one so far this year.  We have three that are about to go to court.  In total, we now have 45 ongoing case files.  That compares quite favourably with Northern Ireland, which has no such prosecutions.  It also compares very favourably with the UK given the number of gas installers.  We have focused on ensuring that when our cases go to court, we follow best practice in respect of how evidence is gathered.  We have focused on streamlining our internal processes and we have never yet brought a prosecution that has not been successful.  Whenever we are successful with a prosecution, we have strived to attract as much publicity as possible relating to the offences that were committed and we have had quite a deal of success in getting these prosecutions publicised in trade journals and newspapers.<\/p><p> Complaints can be made to us in three ways, all of which we investigate.  People can contact us anonymously, so if anyone suspects anybody of conducting illegal activity, there is a phone number they can call.  They can also contact the RGII website and they can also write directly.  All complaints are recorded and can be made anonymously.<\/p><p> We must balance the level of resources we put into enforcement and audit and inspection.  As was mentioned in the previous presentation, whenever anybody contacts us, including the association, with ideas about how we can focus more on enforcement, we always look into these ideas.  In our recent consultation, people suggested that we concentrate more on public awareness.  That is something we are committed to doing.  Initiatives have been suggested in respect of restricting the sale of gas boilers or appliances to those who are registered.  That is not within our legislation but, on a voluntary basis, we have contacted all DIY suppliers in order that they can advertise the scheme and in order that they might consider agreeing to sell boilers and appliance parts only to those who are registered.<\/p><p> We had a recent consultation because the scheme had been operating for up to seven years and we are now about to go to tender for a new gas safety supervisory body to run the scheme.  We had a lot of meetings with stakeholders, including the association, in respect of how the scheme was operating.  We also had more than 20 responses in respect of the scheme and how it was doing.  The CER remains committed not only to the scheme as it is but to improving the scheme constantly, continuing our focus on enforcement, the work we have done on returning the completed certificates, constant engagement with stakeholders about how the scheme can be improved, and monitoring the gas safety supervisory body going forward in respect of key performance indicators such as how quickly it is resolving complaints, etc.  We reiterate that we are committed to tackling illegal activity and any deficiencies in the scheme.  Anyone who suspects that illegal activity is taking place should address their complaints anonymously or otherwise to the RGII or use the phone number indicated on the slide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sheenagh Rooney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424251800,"counter":1302,"content":"<p>Each spokesperson will have three minutes to ask questions.

This is a very serious issue.  I have had significant engagement with both groups.  I know that the association has been pretty exasperated by the issue.  More than 200 plumbers attended a meeting in a Fitzgerald hotel on a Tuesday evening in the middle of January.  They are exasperated.  They are busy people and have plenty to do but they spoke about what they found and the type of installation that has bee done.  I have spoken to the commissioners and outlined very strongly the seriousness of this issue.  While there has been engagement with both parties, there is huge frustration among the association.  The statistics speak for themselves.  There is a pile of unregulated jobs, for want of a better word.  If something were to go wrong, there would be a massive outcry about why this was not raised or policed.  There seems to be a shortage of tools to move this forward.<\/p> <p>  We must find out what needs to be done from a regulatory point of view because it is not working.  A lot of unauthorised work that is not up to standard is taking place.  This is a toned-down version of what I could say.  I thank the Chairman for permitting both bodies to be here today in order that we can thrash out exactly what needs to be done.  What further powers do we need to give the regulatory regime?  Mr. Egan mentioned the new tender in 2016 but many issues have been discussed and highlighted over the past three to four years.  The seriousness of the situation does not seem to have been grasped.  Perhaps it is because the CER lacks the powers to police and tackle it head-on.  At the meeting in the Fitzgerald hotel, I saw the frustration of very busy plumbers who had 101 other things to do other than to sit there on a Tuesday evening discussing the issues.  They were able to reel them off without any prompting.  They were talking about real-life issues.  I am not a plumber and do not know much about it but I can tell the witnesses that the information they gave at the meeting was quite startling and frightening.  We need to step up to the plate to make sure something is done about this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#G00300","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424251800,"counter":1304,"content":"<p>I will respond to the points made by Deputy Moynihan.  The CER takes its statutory function in respect of safety very seriously, from the well head to the burner tip.  The RGII scheme is an important part of the overall safety framework that applies in Ireland.  We regard the RGII scheme and the overall safety framework that applies in Ireland as world standard in respect of the overall aim of reducing the risk to the public to a level that is as low as is reasonably practical.  That is the general gas safety framework.<\/p> <p>  The RGII scheme is a very important element of that scheme.  Our role is threefold.  It is to operate a registration scheme in which people can have confidence.  Much of that is achieved by ensuring that people are aware of the need to use a registered gas installer when they carry out an installation.  We therefore carry out a communications and public awareness campaign each year which is subject to continual review.  It is also important that people can have confidence that the person they hire is competent.  Again, that is done by ensuring that entry into and continuing membership of the scheme is subject to review and assessment and that the installers are insured.  We also acknowledge that this is an evolving scheme that does not stand still.<\/p><p>We have never said we have it perfectly right, and this is why we engage in dialogue with stakeholders, go through public consultation and get a variety of views on the role of public awareness on whether we should do more or less.  We must take a balanced approach to the variety of views we hear when we engage in public consultation on any aspect.  Nevertheless, we have continued to make changes to the scheme over time regarding the membership of the scheme, the requirement for continual assessment and other aspects on which Ms Rooney might be able to elaborate.  It is to reassure members of the committee and the public that gas is a safe fuel in Ireland for people going about their daily lives.  To ensure this, however, the need to use a registered gas installer is one of the key messages we want to get out there.  It is very important the message gets out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424251800,"counter":1306,"content":"<p>The APHCI has made numerous practical proposals to the CER and RGII but in all cases has been totally ignored.

There may be some disagreement over the figures, but that figure is frightening.  Mr Giffney describes it as the gravity of the situation facing the gas industry.  I am concerned about that but I am more concerned about the gravity of the situation facing the public.  If there have been 100,000 illegal boilers installed since 2009, this means that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people illegally installing boilers.<\/p> <p>  I recently met Paul Duffy, who I believe is a member of the APHCI, and he took me around one housing estate.  I am not an installer or a plumber, but it was obvious, even to the layman's eye, that some work had been carried out externally.<\/p> <p>  The dynamics that are at play here are, first of all, legislation.  There have been roughly 100,000 illegal installations yet only 45 cases have been taken.  This indicates that there is something wrong, either with the legislation or the implementation of the legislation.  As legislators, we need to determine why this is.<\/p> <p>  Obviously the costs of it will be an issue as well because if there are more inspectors needed, this will cost the public more.  I am conscious that all I saw was the external work that had been done.  I did not see, nor would I be qualified to comment on, the hidden work that had been done, for example, the pipes that would be in concrete and rubber coating.  I am not aware if those kinds of things are being inspected.<\/p> <p>  What is of biggest concern to me is that the focus appears to be on registered installers while the legislation may not be strong enough in relation to unregistered installers.  There is much work going on in looking at the work of the registered installers but there does not seem to be much work going on in relation to the unregistered installers.  That, in my view, is the gap that exists.  Does the CER agree with that analysis?<\/p> <p>  The APHCI has suggested that there should be an independent review of our system in Ireland.

All of their telephone numbers are available.  It is remarkable that one has to rely on the public to detect this activity.  One advertisement has been placed by a person who will undertake a gas installation, wire a house and do painting and timber work.  This is very serious and no laughing matter.  I am stunned that the CER is relying on people to telephone to complain and that only 45 cases have been taken.<\/p> <p>  The reason I am annoyed about this - I ask the Chairman for his indulgence - is that a young woman in my constituency, Miriam Reidy, went with her family to enjoy a hen party in west Cork.  With her sister and members of her extended family, she stayed in a hotel in which she died from carbon monoxide poisoning.  During the inquest it was mentioned in evidence that the amount of carbon monoxide in the room had been beyond detectable limits, in other words, it had exceeded the maximum limit.  The room had been flooded with carbon monoxide, such that it is amazing that only one person died in the hotel that night.  Ms Reidy's family in Ballyhahill, west Limerick deserve to know that this issue is being taken seriously.  Their daughter went away for a weekend and never came home.  The reason she never come home was that the boiler in the hotel had not been installed correctly.  We do not have to wait for another incident; this girl is dead as a direct result of something that should never have happened.  It was a failure of the system.<\/p><p>The D&aacute;il is discussing a law that has been introduced to reduce speed limits in housing estates because a young child was killed.  It took that child's death to reach consensus in the Houses that something needed to be done.  For the life of me, I do not see how the <i>status quo<\/i>can be defended or why the commission, the Department and the regulatory authorities cannot admit that the current system is not working.  This girl's memory deserves more than defending the indefensible.  She is not coming home and never will.  Her family have been left with question marks over how someone installed a boiler in good faith but incorrectly and no one inspected it.  There was a lack of regulation and a total collapse of the system in protecting an unsuspecting person.  The boiler was not in a home but a hotel.  It could have been in a nursing home, a private hospital, a public hospital, etc.  We should drop the defence because the system is not working.  If it had been working, this girl would have been back at her job in AIB the following Monday.  Instead, her family had to accept her remains.  That is the reality.  As the system does not work, I would like people to stop defending it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#M00500","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424251800,"counter":1337,"content":"<p>I will revert to the figures.  I would hate it if any committee member believed we had distorted the figure of 100,000 illegal boilers.  According to the 2014 figures we have obtained, 34,100 gas boilers were sold.  Last year we exceeded the figure of 20,000 illegal gas boilers being installed.  One does not need to be Sherlock Holmes to discover how many gas boilers are sold.  One only needs to contact the appropriate merchants selling them.  We have a great relationship with them.  We have tried unsuccessfully to educate the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, on how to obtain this information.  It has been trying to obtain accurate figures for the past three years, but it has failed to do so.  We have also asked it about getting the merchants that are selling products to the illegal operators on a daily basis to put up signs pointing out that it is illegal to install gas equipment unless one is a registered gas installer.  Our request has been refused.  The CER has failed to accept any proposal we have put to it to date.  For example, it has refused to contact the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, to require insurance companies to request declarations of conformance for gas works.  It has failed to take action, allowing registered gas installers to work after a ten-day training course.  Registered Gas Installers Ireland has 2,700 members.  We asked how many of these had entered our organisation as registered gas installers having only completed a ten-day training course.  Our evidence suggests carpenters, machinists, labourers, JCB drivers, taxi drivers and so on have entered the registered gas installer scheme.  I have evidence that a man from a foreign country approached me approximately three months ago with GI1 and GI2 pass certificates stating he was a qualified gas engineer, yet he did not have a clue what a gas boiler even looked like.  He wanted to know whether I would take him on for a six-month trial period and let him work with my installers in order that he could learn to service gas boilers because he had been told that there was a good income to be earned from it and that there was very little work involved.  That is what we are up against.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Giffney"},{"type":"speech","time":1424251800,"counter":1338,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Giffney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#N00300","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424251800,"counter":1339,"content":"<p>It is important to acknowledge the Deputy's contribution on the sad case of Ms Miriam Reidy.

If we can get that message across today, it will have been worthwhile.<\/p> <p>  As to what we are doing about the problem, it has been acknowledged that the incident occurred on a commercial premises.  While the scheme we have put in place tackles the issue of the competence of those installing on domestic premises, it does not tackle the requirement for someone to be registered in the case of commercial premises.  Last year we published a consultation paper on our website, with the specific purpose of bringing the requirements that applied in the domestic sphere into the commercial one.  We will shortly publish a draft decision paper proposing a scheme to require those conducting such gas works on commercial premises, including hotels, to be qualified, trained, audited and inspected.

Unsuspecting people who have difficulty in running their households will naturally opt for the cheapest option they can find.  They have never heard of the CER, RGII or the like, but they know the value of the euro in their pocket.  In many cases, they do not know about carbon monoxide because it does not affect them until it is too late.  If one googles &quot;cheap gas installer Limerick&quot;, &quot;cheap gas installer Cork&quot; and so on, one will find a person who can do everything in a house, from digging the foundations to hanging gates.

I do not know the exact specifics of the case mentioned, although I have heard something about it.  My understanding of the regulation - I may be incorrect - is that while industrial-commercial boilers are not covered, a domestic boiler fitted in an industrial-commercial premises is covered.  My understanding is that in the case in question a domestic boiler was fitted in a commercial premises.  Again, I cannot be sure about this.<\/p> <p>  I would like to make an important point.  People who have problems in their homes are not being told to contact RGII to make a complaint; rather, they are being told to contact Bord G&aacute;is Networks or Gas Networks Ireland.  Each year approximately 19,000 calls are made to Bord G&aacute;is Networks and 4,000 plus safety clamps are installed in people's homes.  Bord G&aacute;is does not investigate the cause of the problem in the house.  Up until recently, it had not been telling people that they must contact RGII about such problems.  It is reasonable to assume that if a domestic customer with a problem in his or her home contacts Bord G&aacute;is, the problem will be dealt with.  When the CEO of Bord G&aacute;is Networks appeared before the committee, he said that in such cases a Bord G&aacute;is representative would call to the house and clamp the meter.  He said that was the sole responsibility of Bord G&aacute;is Networks, but I do not understand how that can be allowed.<\/p> <p>  Following on from that, we asked that people whose supply had been safely disconnected be given the AHPCI leaflet, but that is not being done.  The leaflet draws the attention of people who have had work done in their homes, in respect of which a problem has arisen and as a result of which their meters have been clamped, that they should report the matter to RGII which will then send a representative to the house to investigate the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Egan"},{"type":"speech","time":1424251800,"counter":1344,"content":"<p>Who has been asked to do this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#O00400","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424251800,"counter":1345,"content":"<p>We have asked the CER to do it.

There appears to be a dispute between the two groups about the scale of the problem.  It has been stated approximately 30,000 boilers are being sold on a yearly basis, of which only approximately 12,000 are being certified, and that up to 100,000 have been been fitted illegally.  If there are 600,000 gas customers, this means that one in six boilers has been fitted illegally.  This needs to be verified.  I note the statement that the CER is struggling to verify it.  In 2011 Mr. Dermott Jewell of the Consumer Association of Ireland carried out a survey of main dealers.  The figure he came up with was 27,500.  Has he been consulted on the basis of that survey?  He should be because it would give us some idea of the scale of the problem.  If the scale of the problem is anywhere near that figure, there is a big problem in terms of regulation.  We certainly need further investigation of the issue by RGII which needs to be given additional powers in this regard.<\/p> <p>  I note that RGII has stated it is not responsible for weeding out illegal installers.  While it may not have responsibility, it should have a role to play in verifying the scale of the problem.  I have had many experiences of gas boilers and plumbing in general.  Huge issues in this regard arose in the Ballymun regeneration project.  Throughout the Celtic tiger era many contractors subcontracted out work, the standards of which was, in many cases, very poor.  We now have a huge number of housing estates, the work in which was signed off on, but it was substandard.  According to Bord G&aacute;is Networks, there has been a 33% increase in the number of gas escapes.  Has consideration been given to engagement with it on the putting in place by it of a mechanism through which it would engage with every customer in time?  I accept that it would be a big ask, but if the scale of the problem is as great as stated, it is important that Bord G&aacute;is Networks engage with each customer.  I acknowledge that it will take some time to ascertain whether all boilers, etc. meet the required standard, but we may need to establish an inquiry to examine this issue.  I am not aware of the penalties applied in this area.  Perhaps the delegates might address that issue.  The suggestion that identification numbers be printed on boilers is a good one.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Alex White, in his letter to the AHPCI states, \"neither I, as Minister, nor my Department has any role in gas safety.\"  What is the view of the AHPCI?  Is gas safety solely its responsibility?  Surely, the Minister has some responsibility in this regard.  It is not sufficient for him to say he has appointed a regulator and that he has no role in the matter.  I would welcome hearing the delegates' opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#O01600","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1424251800,"counter":1357,"content":"<p>How many inspectors are attached to the CER?  When replying to that question, the CER representative might also respond to two specific points raised by the AHPCI.<\/p><p>One relates to the insurance dimension; it is similar to the issue of the inclusion of alarms in the household insurance process.  What communications have there been with the insurance industry?  There is a proposal that legislation needs to be introduced to force merchants to sell boilers only to registered contractors.  We should take that on board and fully support it if it is a legislative issue.  Does the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, have a view on this or support such a process?<\/p><p> How many merchants are there?  The contractors have indicated they have a good relationship with merchants, so why have they not initiated a type of publicity campaign in association with merchants, such as putting up signs in shops?

Mr. Giffney mentioned a figure of 20 boilers sold every day.  My colleague, Deputy Moynihan, wished to ask about the statistic that emerged in the last exchange with Bord G&aacute;is that there are 4,000 households that have had appliances clamped, presumably because of health or safety issues.  Could the CER use that as a starting point and liaise with Bord G&aacute;is to identify the problem with those 4,000 households?

We are satisfied with the resources we have for the legislative framework.  The RGII regulates registered installers and it has five full-time gas inspectors.  It also has a person overseeing those gas inspectors.  The CER also inspects the inspectors from the RGII, auditing them and their processes on a yearly basis.

If there is a successful prosecution against somebody for being unregistered, with a fine levied, it is open to the person to enter the scheme again and become registered.  Such an installer would only become registered by meeting all the criteria, including qualifications and work for inspection, with audit and inspections undertaken in that respect.  Our objective is to get as many people as possible registered.<\/p> <p>  We have endeavoured at all times to follow up on any ideas that anybody has on how the insurance scheme could be improved.  One idea is a requirement under home insurance that a person must show that a boiler is being serviced by a registered gas installer.  We have written to the Irish Insurance Federation about that but as of yet we have not received a reply.  We have engaged with merchants to see if they would be willing on a voluntary basis to only sell boilers and appliance parts to people who are registered, as we do not have legislative power to make it mandatory.

I will begin by explaining the key cost components of an electricity and gas bill and then I will hand over to Ms Brien, who will talk the committee through recent developments in wholesale markets and how that impacts on retail prices.<br\/><br\/>Our first slide shows some of the components in electricity and gas bills.  The first element is the network charge.  In electricity, that relates to the costs of operating, maintaining and developing the transmission and distribution lines that bring the electricity from generators to our homes and places of business.  This amounts to around 30% of the final bill.  The CER has a role in regulating those costs, because there are monopoly providers of those services.  Our focus is on ensuring the least-cost investment in necessary infrastructure and driving efficiency and innovation for ESB Networks<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>and EirGrid in that area.  <br\/><br\/>We then move to the market component of the bill.  For electricity, there are two elements.  There is the wholesale element, namely, our generators.  There, the CER has a role, along with our Northern Ireland counterparts, as part of the<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>single electricity market committee in setting the rules for this all-island competitive single electricity market.  Those rules are, again, about ensuring that we get the least-cost generation portfolio to meet demand at any given time.  That element of our bill, the wholesale cost, constitutes about 50% of the final bill.  We also have a competitive retail market.  The activities of the suppliers around billing, customer service and buying the electricity for the customers constitute 12% of the final bill.  The CER has a role in regulating the activities of suppliers, particularly to ensure that competition is working for the benefit of consumers and to ensure a significant level of consumer protection in that area.<br\/><br\/>Finally we have the levies, which are shown on electricity bills as the PSO levy.  This is effectively a Government policy instrument to support particular types of electricity generation, including renewables and peat.  That amounts to 8% of the final bill.  There is no PSO levy on gas but there is a similar breakdown of networks, namely, the pipeline and interconnector conveying gas to our economy, primarily from Scotland.  That is about 40% of the bill.  There is also the cost of purchasing the gas in the UK market and bringing it across, which makes up the remainder of the bill.  <br\/><br\/>About 50% of the gas bill will be impacted by falling fuel prices on wholesale markets.  The single electricity market generation aspect of the electricity bill is not all about fuel but gas will drive 30% of the final electricity bill at the moment.  <br\/><br\/>I hope that helps explain how the wholesale price fits into the bills.  I will now hand over to Ms Laura Brien, who will take the committee through recent developments and recent price changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424251800,"counter":1392,"content":"<p>While there has been a great deal of information in the press recently about the 50% drop in oil prices, oil prices do not impact on the retail prices for either electricity or gas.  Oil-fired generation accounts for less than 1% of the generation in Ireland, so the 50% drop in oil price will not feed through into a drop in the retail electricity or gas prices.  Natural gas prices are what matters in this context.  They have the big impact.  About 95% of the gas consumed in Ireland comes from Great Britain, which is one of the most liquid and transparent wholesale markets in Europe.  In that context, the gas cost is out of Ireland's control.  We are a price taker in that we accept the wholesale price from Great Britain.  In the context of fuel price declines, gas prices have declined by about 18% over the last 12 months in euro terms.  They have declined a bit more in sterling terms, but since the euro has weakened against sterling, we get a correspondingly lower reduction in gas costs in Ireland.  While that 18% is significant, it is not the 50% we have seen on the oil prices.  The British price counts for about 50% or more of the cost of gas delivered in Ireland, the rest of which is the cost of delivery, that is, the cost of the network of pipes.<\/p> <p>  We have not seen a similar reduction in retail prices because of the decline in gas prices but this is partly because suppliers buy ahead at fixed-price contracts, a practice often referred to as \"hedging\", on both the electricity and gas side.  That is to provide greater retail price stability.  It works both ways.  It tends to take about six months for a change in fixed-price contracts to feed through into retail prices, so when the spot price is declining, the fact that there are fixed-price contracts means that there is a slower rate of decline that feeds through into retail prices.  Similarly, if spot gas prices were rising, we would see a slower response to a price increase.  The graph on slide 5 of the presentation, in which the red line reflects the euro value and the blue line reflects the sterling value, shows that while we have seen a decline in wholesale gas prices, headline sterling gas prices have dropped closer to 25%, while there has been just a 16% to 18% drop in euro prices.<\/p> <p>  How do Irish electricity and gas prices stack up compared to the rest of Europe?  The graphs here come from the most recent EUROSTAT report, which was published in December 2014.  We have highlighted Ireland in the graph on slide 6 so it is easy to see where we are with respect to the rest of Europe.  Domestic electricity prices, shown in the graph on the left, are marginally lower than the euro area average and business electricity prices are approximately the same as the euro area average.  We are in there with other European countries.  The difference compared to some of the lowest-cost countries is primarily explained by our generation mix.  The majority is gas, while those countries with coal-fired generation or hydro-generation have lower generation costs.  We also have a relatively low density population, which is dispersed, meaning that we have relatively higher network costs because we need more kilometres of wires to service a similar population.<\/p> <p>  Slide 7 shows recent trends in gas prices.  This is the same report that was published in December 2014 by EUROSTAT.  We are about 6% lower than the euro area average for domestic gas prices and around the average for business customers.<\/p><p>Our location on the periphery of Europe has an impact because, while we have the opportunity to buy at the British wholesale market price, we have additional transportation costs and the cost of networks to ship it primarily from Scotland to Ireland.<\/p><p> Members may also be aware of recent domestic price changes.  We have seen the reduction in gas prices feed through into wholesale electricity prices and they have, in turn, lead to reductions in the prices charged to domestic customers.  The prices listed apply to both the standard charges of each supplier and the discounted charges.  The reductions range from 2% to 4% on electricity and 3.5% to 4% on gas.  The CER welcomes the reductions and we think it important that they have applied to both standard and discounted charges such that all customers will benefit from lower prices.<\/p><p> The overview provided by Ms MacEvilly indicated that the CER does not regulate end-use retail prices for customers.  However, significant benefits come to customers from retail competition.  We regulate and oversee the terms and conditions offered by suppliers but we do not fix the prices for end users.  Strong competition and price deregulation has helped to deliver competitive prices and innovative products as well as more choice to customers.  We have also seen this by the entry of new competitors into the market over the past years.  Standard rates have declined and we have also seen an increased availability of discounted offers for customers who switch suppliers.  We think retail competition is working in Ireland, as evidenced by the switching rates.  This is the rate at which customers choose an alternative supplier in response to the offers available.  Switching rates in the Irish gas and electricity retail markets are high.  In the 12 months to the end of 2014, just over 16% of electricity customers switched suppliers and just under 16% switched in gas.  These are significantly higher rates than in other European countries.  They are also higher than our nearest neighbour, Britain, where the most recent data show 12% of electricity customers and 11% of gas customers switched. <\/p><p> Switching supplier is simple, fast and free and has no impact on the cost of supply.  All that is needed is the meter number and payment details.  It is easy to do it over the telephone or online.  For customers to get the best deal, we recommend shopping around.  The CER also credits two price comparison websites that provide lists of all available price offers.  People can also contact the suppliers to see if a lower tariff is available.  If they are happy with the existing supplier, there may be better offers than the standard tariffs.<\/p><p> The CER actively overseas customer protection through the licensing of suppliers and monitoring of their activities.  We do so on an ongoing basis and audit the operations of suppliers to make sure they are complying with terms and conditions of codes of practice.  We also actively monitor the operation of the market through examining market share and switching rates.  We also monitor the level of disconnections and report regularly on price plans.  We have a role with regard to customer complaints and overseeing how suppliers deal with customer complaints and follow-up where it is not appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424251800,"counter":1394,"content":"<p>This came about because of the fall in fuel prices and gas prices.

There seem to be good incentives to switch but elderly people, who are loyal to a particular brand or provider, do not switch as much.  The message today is that people do not switch as much as they should.  While it is easy, sometimes people do not take advantage of it.  Is it not better that there is a reduction in the base price rather than all of the funding available for switching?  My understanding is that when people switch they must enter a contract for 18 months.

We regulated prices for a while for a few years before stepping out of the role.  While the perception was there, the reality was that we had a single price change every year for Electric Ireland and Bord G&aacute;is and it looked at prices over a 12-month period.  While it may have been in people's consciousness that there were price increases, it was a single yearly price increase.  Things have changed in the market and we have stepped out of price regulation.  For domestic customers, suppliers tend to offer a price that is good for approximately one year.  However, they are more free now.  It works better in this case because instead of having to wait until September, which is running normally when they reprice for the year ahead, we have seen mid-term price reductions.  Electric Ireland reduced prices for electricity in November and other companies are looking at it in March and April.  Prices are moving down and it is correct that hedging and a deferral of price decreases means we have not seen them fall as quickly as they fell on the wholesale market.  We should continue to see the impact over the next few months.  We have been quite clear in signalling that we expect it to be the case, assuming all other things remain equal in the market.<\/p> <p>  If there are no other dramatic price changes, we will look to see further consideration of price reductions if possible by suppliers, having regard to market conditions in the coming months.  We are giving them that message.  When taking into account the euro component, the fall in gas price is 18%.  The graph displayed earlier by Ms Brien showed the difference between sterling and euro.  It showed the changing impact of the exchange rate between the two currencies over time.<\/p><p>The euro-sterling exchange rate has been moving against us over that period and that is having the impact we saw.<\/p><p> In terms of switching, we very much welcome the opportunity to speak to members, all of whom I know have taken a strong interest in this area.  The more we get the message out to customers that they should be active and should be looking for best value in what is an increasingly competitive market, the better.  I thank members for the opportunity to get that message across today.  We accept that sometimes customers may have concerns or may be loyal to their existing supplier but we would still say to them to call their existing supplier to see what better value that supplier may be able to offer them.  There are customers who do not switch around but who get the benefits of discounts through direct debit or online billing.  There may be other value their supplier can offer.  It is a feature of all competitive markets that it is the active customer who is willing to look around who is likely to get the best value.  That is the same in the electricity and gas markets.<\/p><p> In terms of the contracts, typically, it is an annual contract of 12 months.  We have seen other contracts come in.  I think Bord G&aacute;is Energy is offering a fixed contract over two years which is a new offering on the Irish market and which would help customers have certainty over their price for a two-year period.

There is huge frustration with the system given the reduction in oil and gas prices.  The CER is right that gas is the major component in terms of Irish energy prices.  People are asking why they are not seeing a reduction in the price of electricity, when they have seen a reduction in price at the petrol pumps.  They are asking what is wrong with the system and if the companies are creaming off the profits.  I have discussed this with some of the energy providers in recent weeks and they went through the hedge funding, how the purchases are made and so on.<\/p> <p>  In 2012, if I am not mistaken, the energy providers went to the CER looking for an increase in electricity prices of somewhere in the region of 6% but ended up getting 8%.  We accept they have hedged their bets and bought in at a particular price.  Obviously, the energy suppliers will buy now that gas prices are low and they will hedge now.  Will we see the 18% reduction reflected in the bills of ordinary customers and business people?<\/p> <p>  Another point I raised with the CER previously is that when one looks at the annual accounts of the energy providers, one sees that they are making massive profits.  Some of them end up with profits of &euro;500 million.  The perception is that it is being made on the back of the energy prices they charge for their product.  Perhaps Ms MacEvilly might gives us her thoughts on that.<\/p> <p>  If we accept hedging, we expect that if energy prices increase at some point in the future, there will be a six to 12-month period in which energy prices for consumers will not rise accordingly.  If the companies are telling us the truth, they will have six months to 12 months of energy bought at a lower price.  The price increase on the wholesale market is nearly always reflected within a very short period of time.<\/p> <p>  We are very dependent on prices in the UK.  When will the Corrib gas come on stream?  Will it have an impact on energy prices?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#T00200","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424251800,"counter":1400,"content":"<p>I will take the last question first.  The Corrib gas is certainly very welcome from a security of supply perspective.  It is hugely beneficial to our economy to have an additional indigenous source of supply.  However, that source of supply will compete against that very liquid competitive wholesale price in the UK, which Ms Brien mentioned.  We would not expect to see it having a material price impact.  The benefit is really around the security of supply.<\/p> <p>  We absolutely agree with the Deputy that the swings and roundabouts of hedging should ensure that customers get the benefits when the price is falling, even if it is over time, and are protected if prices start to rise rapidly or if they are volatile.  Hedging should protect them from that over a period.  That is something we will monitor as part of our market monitoring regime to ensure customers are protected, to the extent that hedging should protect customers.  Ms Brien can take some of the more detailed questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424251800,"counter":1401,"content":"<p>Many of the larger industrial customers are on wholesale pass through tariffs which means they get the immediate benefit of any drop in the wholesale electricity price.  They are already enjoying that.  The wholesale electricity price is approximately 12% lower than where it was over the previous year.  Those large industrial customers are already seeing a direct reduction in their bills as a result of that.  Small and medium-sized enterprises and domestic customers tend to be covered through the supplier hedging because they expect to get a fixed price for the year so that they know their prices will not change during the year.  That is why they enjoy but also suffer from the benefits of hedging.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the reduction in the gas price and how that would feed through into end retail prices, as we explained, the international price of gas probably covers approximately 30% of the cost of electricity so 30% of that 18% is 6%.  Ultimately over time, we would be looking at a reduction in the retail price of 6% or so.  We have seen a 2% to 3% reduction already.  However, once the impact of that hedging continues to feed through and assuming there is no change in the market conditions, there is potential for a corresponding or approximately the same level of reduction in the future to account for the impact of hedging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1424251800,"counter":1402,"content":"<p>Some 18% of the 30% is 6%.

A lot of the companies are vertically integrated in that they do not just have a retail arm but also have a wholesale arm.  When we look at profitability, therefore, we look at both the retail and wholesale elements of the organisations.  That is something that we are continually monitoring but there is no indication at the moment of a big jump in profitability.  Overall, profitability has probably been coming down in recent years.

I must say that I met officials from the commission recently to discuss this very matter and I found that meeting very helpful.  I went in with a fairly simplistic view of the commission's world.  I thought that the commission could tell companies the price they can charge per unit.  However, the commission described to me during that meeting, and again today, quite a complex algorithm used by the companies.  The commission's responsibility is to ensure that the algorithm is being applied correctly in order that, in comparison with other markets, customers are not being ripped off.  I would much prefer it to be as simple as my view of the world because we could probably protect customers' interests a lot better then.  However, it appears that this is not being done anywhere else either so there must be some reason for that.<\/p> <p>  I have raised the issue of the PSO levy previously, which contributes 8% to electricity costs.  I believe it is entirely unethical to apply VAT to that levy.  I understand that this is not the responsibility or fault of the commissioners and the Department of Finance argues that it is an EU requirement.  I do not care whether it is a European or national decision; it is entirely unethical.  It represents a tax on a tax and we should be seeking ways to change that.<\/p> <p>  I am glad we have clarification on the price taker issue.  It would be lovely if we, as a nation, were price makers.  That would be lovely.  Some people are suggesting that we should allow hydraulic fracturing in this country and argue that if we get gas in Ireland, the price of energy generally will drop dramatically.  Those arguments are generally made by people who have some vested interest in hydraulic fracturing.  The truth needs to be out there that, no more than with Corrib, even if we did have hydraulic fracturing in Ireland, we would continue to be price takers.  We need to understand the truth in that regard.<\/p> <p>  In terms of price comparisons, I look at different tables and see different things.  There are variations in terms of the European average price, median price and so on, which I have not got to the bottom of yet.  I will keep going at it until I understand it fully.  There does not appear to be one set of standard figures which indicates the costs to the customer - highest, lowest, average -  throughout the EU.  I will need to do more research in that regard.<\/p> <p>  As the commissioners have said, customers should be encouraged to switch providers.  Indeed, after my recent meeting with the commissioners, I appeared on the local radio station, Ocean FM and gave that advice to people again.  I believe that the rate of switching in the north west is very low, partly due to the availability of fewer options and partly because of the age profile of the population.  In many instances, people have been dealing with the same companies for many years and have a loyalty towards them.  There are discounts available to people who switch providers which means that the people who are loyal to companies are paying more.  That is the bottom line there and it is wrong.  As I pointed out at the aforementioned meeting, if 50% or more of customers switched every 12 or 18 months, as they would be entitled to do in line with contractual agreements, we would have price inertia and the model would not work.  The increase in one company would be offset by a reduction in another company and that would begin to balance out.  We would then have price inertia.  I believe it is an unsound model on which to move forward.  I spoke about the algorithm that the commission examines and its component parts and I believe we should be looking at those component parts to see if there is anything more we can do to question the companies about, for example, their levels of profit.  Is that part of the algorithm?  Do we care?  Is there scope within the companies to reduce the price to their customers?  We need to look at that algorithm and its various components to determine if there are areas over which we have no control or into which we have no input and to decide whether we should have.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#U00200","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424251800,"counter":1406,"content":"<p>First of all, I agree with the Deputy about the complexity of energy markets.  Every time one thinks one has a handle on it, one finds that there is another layer of complexity waiting for one.  Within that, however, the Deputy is absolutely correct to say that we must focus on the controllable costs within the overall calculation and at what we can do to drive down those costs.  That can be done through enhancing competition.  We are currently engaged in a redesign of our wholesale market, the I-SEM, by making the market more competitive and integrating it with the European market in order to drive down costs in the Irish market.  The aim is to ensure that the generators we are rewarding are delivering better services to the customers at lower cost.  That is one element of our work.  On the networks, we are currently involved in a price review to try to drive down costs and drive efficiencies within the network area.  That is something that we, as regulators, must continue to focus on because there is always more that we can extract in terms of efficiency, innovation and other cost savings in the market.  We must keep a strong focus on that and it is absolutely core to what we do.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the switching model, a scenario where 50% of customers were actively switching would be really welcome.  If that was to happen, it would force many of the suppliers to look at the issue of customer retention, which some are already doing.  The cost of retaining customers in an environment where many people are switching may be lower than the cost of attracting new customers.  Therefore, suppliers might start focusing their attention on retaining a loyal customer base.  That would help to even out the situation where the biggest benefits are only available to actively switching customers.  That said, there are loyalty programmes in place at the moment and some suppliers are trying to retain their loyal customers.  The reductions that Ms O'Brien referred to, for example, will be passed on to all customers on standard tariffs.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is also correct in his comments about the kinds of information we can give to customers to help them make informed decisions.

These are some of the things we are examining.<\/p> <p>  We do an annual audit of suppliers.  This year we looked at their marketing and customer sign-up practices, and the findings from the audit will drive some of the actions we take this year on revising some of the codes of practice.  We are looking at a range of options, particularly options related to transparency of information.  We are also considering whether we should require suppliers to inform all customers when they are getting to the end of a 12-month discount period so that they know they will move on to the standard tariff, as a jog to them, to consider switching again or look for better offers.

Micro-generation turned that on its head.  On a sunny Sunday afternoon, nobody is consuming much energy in Italy, as everybody is out enjoying themselves, but they have massive production because of all the solar panels on the roofs.  The distribution system is feeding energy back into the transmission system.  Micro-generation has a significant impact on the way the system is run and governed.  From our point of view, there is a cost element.  Our renewable policy in Ireland has been relatively cheap for what has been delivered to date.  We need to ensure that continues.  Obviously it is a matter for Government to decide on renewable energy policy, but our advice is to keep a very close eye on the cost of it all.

I understand that was not the case a few years ago.  The graphs set out the breakdown of the electricity prices.  Is the fact that the cost of domestic electricity is lower in Ireland related to the wholesale price of electricity, or is it because of competition in the domestic market?  How do we remain cost-competitive?  The cost of energy is crucial in attracting inward investment, which leads to job creation.<\/p> <p>  There is a great deal of debate on our renewable energy strategy whether it adds to the cost to the consumer.  The debate on wind energy is topical and centres on carbon emissions, REFIT tariffs and PSO.  Some groups are against wind farms and think it is not the best solution in terms of renewable energy.  They see wind energy as a flawed system, but in lots of cases they would not want nuclear power.  I was very interested to learn that the cost of using renewable energy in Ireland is less than in Europe.  I presume that is because we have the resource of wind.  Is the use of wind energy ramping up across Europe?  Can the witnesses address the physical structure of the national grid?  We have set a target of 40% for the use of renewable energy; is that reasonable, or we will we exceed our target?  I would like to hear some objective comments on wind energy, including its impact on carbon emissions and whether other renewable options such as biomass comparable favourably.  People cite the work that goes into building a wind farm, although obviously the resource is free after that, depending on how much the wind blows.<\/p> <p>  Can we discuss smart grid technology, not just in respect of new transmission and distribution lines but in terms of expanding the capacity of the existing transmission lines?  I understand that EirGrid has a few pilot projects, but it would seem that we encounter difficulties in building out the grid.  I know that in County Mayo a number of projects have been given planning permission, but there is a problem with the grid connection.  I am aware that Mayo Power Ltd. has a biomass plant in Killala and it is having problems with its connection to the grid.  All the ground work has been done in getting the statutory permission.<\/p> <p>  I know that we need to build out the national grid.  I wish to raise the contentious issue of Grid West.  The driver for building out that grid is to capture the wind.  Will the delegates comment on whether we will achieve our 2020 targets?  A point made in the debate is that we are generating energy for export when we are not hitting our domestic targets and that the rate of installed capacity for wind energy is not the rate we would like to see.  There is a debate on the use of DC or AC technology and whether we need to take out the wind as opposed to using it to meet the requirement of a business case that would need to connect into AC technology.  The issues that members face is that pylons have been erected in environmentally sensitive areas, and in County Mayo the most windy areas are the areas that are picturesque and environmentally sensitive.  I have attended a great many public meetings, and I know the Chairman, who lives in an environmentally sensitive area, has engaged with people as well, but at meetings I find the information has been lifted from the Internet.  I would like to see the Commission for Energy Regulation address the issues so that we are discussing the facts.  I believe all the facts have to be on the table to have a real debate.  I believe that EirGrid gave information only on overhead power lines and we had no data.  People came up with data on the logistics of underground power lines.  An expert panel was established and I hope it will address all the issues so that we can see all the facts.<\/p><p>I would like to make a final point about the Corrib gas project.  I know a question has been asked about security of supply in this context.  I know the gas price that is set is not just an Irish price.  It is a Europe-wide or international price.  When we are giving out exploration licences, could we stipulate that a certain amount of the gas taken off a field where there has been a find would be supplied to the Irish nation at a price that is more favourable than the market price?  Perhaps that is beyond what the market would allow.  Could the Government do such a deal, or would that be prevented by regulation issues?  Would the commission say \"No, we cannot interfere with the market in that way\"?  This relates to the question of whether we are getting value for money in respect of our own natural resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#V00600","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424251800,"counter":1414,"content":"<p>If the witnesses do not have answers to the questions the Deputy has asked about gas and electricity prices, they can revert back to the committee at some future stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#W00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1424251800,"counter":1415,"content":"<p>I am very hopeful, a Chathaoirligh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#W00300","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1424251800,"counter":1416,"content":"<p>They should feel free to give an answer now if they wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#W00400","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424251800,"counter":1417,"content":"<p>We will try our best.  Many of the questions that were asked are inter-related.  This is where the complexity alluded to by Deputy Colreavy comes into play.  All of these things interact with one another.  The first question asked by Deputy Mulherin goes to the heart of the issue.  Why are our prices now cheaper than they were a couple of years ago?  A number of major changes have taken place across the energy sector globally and particularly in Europe.  The move to renewables has been a key factor in that.  We need to look at current prices in the context of the sort of revolution that has gone on across Europe.  Germany is probably the country that stands out the most.  A high amount of extra costs has been put into renewable delivery across Europe.  Ireland's wind resource means that the onshore wind technology available in Ireland is probably one of the cheapest technologies available anywhere in Europe.  That has started to drive our prices relative to the other prices.  If one looks at the graph of the countries, one will see that countries like Germany, Spain and Italy, which spent a great deal of money on expensive technologies at an early stage, are at a slightly higher level of renewable penetration than Ireland, which has been able to deliver it at a much cheaper price by focusing on least-cost delivery of renewables in the form of onshore wind.  This is one of the reasons our prices have come down.  We are not the most expensive country in the way that we were.<\/p> <p>  A feature of the market is that high gas prices tend to be much more profitable for the generators.  There is a built-in extra cost to consumers when gas prices are high rather than low.  We are benefitting from lower gas prices.  As Ms MacEvilly was saying, we are trying to look at changing the way we have designed the wholesale market.  This is a European requirement.  Currently, the market does not comply fully with EU energy union requirements.  As part of that, we will seek to put a more flexible system in place as more renewables come in.  Wind has been least-cost in the past, but that does not necessarily mean it will be least-cost in the future.  More and more wind on the system adds extra costs.  It is a question of the law of diminishing returns.  To bring in more and more wind, we have extra network costs.  We need more flexibility from the generators.  The wind does not always blow.  When the wind is not blowing, we need to have extra capacity there to keep the lights on.  The cost of that increases with the levels of wind.  Some of the microgeneration technologies, such as solar technology, start to become more competitive in such circumstances.  They also have falling capital costs.  We constantly need to look at this in a cost framework.  While we have security of supply requirements and we need to consider the environment, cost is a major feature of our overall duty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021800002#W00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1424251800,"counter":1418,"content":"<p>What is the optimum amount of wind in the system?

From what we can see, it is certainly the case that there are enough connections in the system.  We have connections to connect much more than 40% of wind at the moment.  There is a question about each of those connections.  Each individual generator has been quite slow in terms of delivering the grid.  I think that has been a feature.  We are very aware of the sort of resistance, particularly locally, to many grid build-outs.  It is probably reasonable to presume that 100% of the connections in the system will not be delivered, but we should be on target to meet the 40% level.  There are risks.  I think the grid is one area of risk.  We need to make sure we consider the issue of curtailment.  We are finding that we are turning wind generators down, even at times when the wind is blowing, because of a lack of flexibility in the system.  We have a programme in place with EirGrid to try to address that.  This is one of the major wholesale market elements we are working on.  A number of different programmes are in place to try to address these issues, but the crucible of cost is a key factor in all of that.<\/p> <p>  When we were going through this issue previously, I think we identified that our network costs are more expensive than those of the rest of Europe.  Extra costs are added when projects are put underground.  The DC options are generally more expensive than the AC options.  The AC options are very limited because if very long AC lines are put in, technical problems will arise and the system will not work properly.  Throughout this process, as people look at this question and local community issues arise, we are very keen to ensure the cost element is not lost.

We are working on a new entry regime that would be designed to facilitate or give some incentive to future offshore developers to bring gas onshore to Ireland.  Where that could ultimately benefit the market in terms of price would be if we had a sufficiently significant offshore industry or production industry such that Ireland became a net exporter.  Corrib gas is welcome.  It brings circa 60% of our gas needs for the next ten years but certainly Ireland will not be an exporter.
