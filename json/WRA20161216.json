In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. <\/p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 members will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that have been recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. So far 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide, including 23 to the Limerick Division.

While it is the case, as advised by the Commissioner, that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises and, in that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of dedicated Community Garda&iacute; throughout the state.

Some actions involve strengthening structural and governance processes while others focused on changing organisational behaviour.  It should be noted that many of the changes overlap with the actions set out in the Civil Service Renewal Plan. <\/p><p>Much work has been done to address the recommendations regarding relationship management and oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The most significant is the establishment last January of the Policing Authority which represented a very far-reaching reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This is a major element of the comprehensive programme of justice reform that the Government is delivering.  In particular, the Authority brings a new and dedicated layer of public accountability to the administration of policing services and it also provides an engine to drive necessary changes in the policing system and its practices.  The goal is to ensure that the Garda organisation will be fully fit to meet the ongoing and emerging challenges of 21st century policing. <\/p><p>In addition to the policing area and running alongside the implementation of the major change programme, enormous progress has been made over the past 2 years on the Department's business agenda across very significant areas of public life.  Major issues addressed in this context include Child and Family Relationship Legislation, Marriage Equality Legislation, International Protection legislation and a single applications procedure, progressing the implementation of the EU Victims Directive, establishment of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) to meet Ireland&rsquo;s international humanitarian obligations, amongst many others.<\/p><p>Particular changes made in my Department include the following: <\/p><p>-  In the light of an extensive consultation process with staff, agencies and stakeholders, a new Culture and Values Charter was developed and published earlier this year with the objective of fostering a more outward facing, listening organisational culture.  These values are fed into all induction and leadership training and inform the way in which the Department communicates with staff and stakeholders.  A cross grade Change Team, led by the Secretary General, is working to ensure that the values are embedded in the organisation; <\/p><p>-  The Department&rsquo;s Management Advisory Committee has been reconstituted as a Management Board, new personnel have been appointed, both from within the Department and externally, and lateral mobility put into effect.  Following a competition, a Secretary General was permanently appointed in October last.  Robust supporting processes have been put in place to enhance leadership and oversight of the Department and wider sector and to facilitate more effective management and governance of the strategic objectives.  A Corporate Governance Framework for the Department was published last April;<\/p><p>-  Agency performance and governance arrangements have been formalised and strengthened through formal Performance\/Service Delivery Agreements and Frameworks<b><\/b>agreed with 24 key agencies including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na<\/p><p>-  Since March 2014, the Department has put in place revised systems and procedures to ensure that<b><\/b>all correspondence is handled appropriately which specifies that high priority correspondence is brought to the attention of the Minister and relevant officials and followed up in a timely manner; <\/p><p>-  An annual Strategic Plan was published in 2015 and again this year which draws together in one single plan all the strategic priorities across the Department.  Progress is monitored monthly and twice yearly progress reports are published;<\/p><p>-  Risk management processes have been significantly strengthened and the Department's Audit Committee which has a majority of external members has reviewed its processes.<\/p><p>The Department appointed a Head of Strategic Human Resources from an open competition in June 2016.  Following her appointment a process of workforce planning has been initiated with a view to identifying the resources required to effectively deliver on the Department's business objectives.  Training programmes were also initiated with a view to ensuring that both existing and new resources have the capacity and capability to meet the business needs.  Further work in the area of learning and development is planned for 2017, informed by the workforce planning process and Civil Service Renewal including developing leadership capacity and ensuring future needs at senior levels can be met through proactive knowledge management and development of expertise in specific areas. There will be a focus on developing the capacity of HR itself to meet the needs of the Organisation and developing a business partner model in 2017.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that these reforms have made a significant difference to the way in which my Department goes about its business and engages with stakeholders.  The focus through 2017 will be on ensuring that the organisation continues to focus on continuous improvement and that the change outlined above is embedded, sustained and further developed in the context of the wider process of Civil Service Renewal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600068#WRA00396","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Levels","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600068#WRA00472"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[40452\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600068#WRA00548","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the measures that will be taken to address the low burglary detection rate in County Mayo; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>I understand that the Deputy is referring to detection rates highlighted in the 'Garda Recorded Crime Statistics 2010-2014', which was published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) last week.  The first thing that needs to be said is that this publication provides an analysis of data up to the end of 2014 only, and it would be entirely incorrect to suggest that it represents an assessment of the current situation in relation to burglary or any other crime category.<\/p><p>In relation to the general issue of detection rates, it must be recognised that detection rates do vary according to the nature of the crime and that this is in line with international experience.  Detection rates are often found to be lower for certain offences, such as burglaries and some other property crimes, as these generally only come to light after the event and the offender has left the scene.  These offences are inherently more difficult to investigate than others such as possession of drugs, for example, where the offender is observed while committing the offence.  While our statistical system is not directly comparable with that of other countries, in the UK, for example, similar difficulties exist in detecting burglaries.  This is illustrated by Home Office figures which show that over 80% of burglary investigations in 2014\/2015 were concluded without a suspect being identified.  <\/p><p>I do of course share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that we do everything we can to protect communities from burglary and other crimes against householders.  Long before the publication of the recent CSO analysis, I initiated a broad ranging review of our response to burglary crime. <\/p><p>Operation Thor launched in November 2015 has led to a sharp decline in the rate of burglary crime. Indeed, the most current CSO crime figures, which are for the second quarter of 2016, indicate that in the first six months of this year there were 36%<b><\/b>less burglaries than in the first six months of 2015, underlining the impact of Operation Thor.  It is also worth noting that the CSO Quarter 2 figures for the Mayo Garda Division show a reduction in Burglary of 22%.  We have also seen the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b><\/b>2015.  These provisions are now available to Garda&iacute; in relation to prosecutions arising from the concentrated drive against crime which is being implemented under Operation Thor, which is supported by very significant investments in Garda resources.  The reduction in burglaries as a result of Operation Thor will not of course be indicated in the detection rate statistics  when they become available for the relevant period but the prevention of crime is always preferable to crimes having been committed which must then be detected.<\/p><p>If I might illustrate the scale of Garda activity against burglary and property crime &ndash; under Operation Thor we have seen 30,000 crime prevention patrols and in the order of 38,500 targeted checkpoints nationwide. There have also been in the region of 2,500 arrests and 2,900 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.<\/p><p>The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act was commenced a year ago and introduced the DNA database, which provides Garda&iacute; with investigative links (&rsquo;hits&rsquo;) between people and unsolved crimes; in particular burglaries.  It is anticipated that this should significantly assist in improving detection rates for burglary over the coming years.  So far, approximately 532 investigative links between people and unsolved crimes have already been uncovered, including 359 burglary cases.  In addition, the database links crime scene samples to each other and so far, 95 crime scene samples have been linked to other crime scene samples, demonstrating a link between two crimes or clusters of crimes committed by the same person in a particular area or locality.<\/p><p>I understand that the CSO will publish the next Quarterly Recorded Crime Statistics release before the end of this month.

I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 319 to DMR Divisions.  I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit the Detective strength across the Garda Regions including the DMR.<\/p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services countrywide including  in the Dublin region. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600068#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Levels","counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600068#WRA01900"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[40458\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600068#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the measures that will be taken to address a burglary detection rate of less than 10% in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":32,"content":"<p>I understand that the Deputy is referring to detection rates highlighted in the 'Garda Recorded Crime Statistics 2010-2014', which was published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) last week.

This includes mainstream access to health, education and social protection services.  While the operation of this system is kept under continual review, there are no plans to replace it with any other system at present.   I am satisfied that this system is in compliance with human rights obligations placed on the State by domestic and international law.  The State provided accommodation system is one of the central features of the State's asylum system.  I am also satisfied that the treatment of asylum seekers in this country is at least on a par with any other country and that the State provided accommodation system delivers a high standard of service and value for money to the taxpayer through coordinated service delivery to asylum seekers.<\/p>  <p>  The principal issue with Direct Provision is of course the length of time asylum applicants are residing in it - invariably as a result of the multi-layered processes arising from the Refugee Act which will shortly be replaced when the new International Protection Act comes into force.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that no person in the protection process is left without services or shelter at Christmas time or indeed at any other time.<\/p>  <p>  This is a system which facilitates the State in providing the essential and necessary accommodation and related services to all in the protection process who require it and which has provided accommodation to more than 56,000 people since its establishment.  It allows the State to provide such accommodation in a manner that facilitates resources being used in the most economic means possible while also delivering services (such as education and health) directly to those within the system.  That is not to say that there is not room for improvement.  The focus of my Department is not to end the State provided accommodation system which would leave protection applicants without the safety net of a comprehensive reception system but instead to improve and adjust the system to ensure it continues to respect the dignity of those who reside within it.  Having said that, I do not want to see any person residing in State provided accommodation for any longer than is necessary and significant efforts have been made by my Department in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group on Improvements to the protection process including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers provides a template for the development and improvement of a wide range of services being delivered to those seeking international protection. <\/p>  <p>  One of the key recommendations of the Report was the introduction of a single application procedure in the protection process.  The International Protection Act 2015, which will be commenced on 31 December 2016, provides for such a procedure.  My Department is currently preparing all of the steps necessary to commence the Act which responds to some 26 of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations and can be expected to positively address the crucial issue of the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process and by extension in State provided accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  On this particular point, significant efforts have been made to deal with those who are longest in the system and at this stage the vast majority of those who are over 5 years in the system and who do not have any impediments to progress, such as pending judicial challenges, have now had their cases processed to completion.  This has been a key achievement that has had a real impact on many people and families in the protection process. <\/p>  <p>  A transition Task Force was established in 2015 and put in place important supports to facilitate people with status moving into and integrating with the community.  The Task Force reported that 87% of people granted status had moved into the wider community within six months.<\/p>  <p>  Tangible progress in improving the daily lives of asylum seekers living in State provided accommodation while their application is being processed is also being made.  In January last, the former T&aacute;naiste announced an increase to the Direct Provision Allowance for children, the first such increase since the introduction of the payment some sixteen years ago. Prescription fees for all those in receipt of the Direct Provision allowance, including children, have also been waived.  The Minister for Education and Skills has also announced a second year of their pilot support scheme for students in the protection system for the academic year 2016\/2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, which is responsible for the management and administration of accommodation and ancillary services to protection applicants in State provided accommodation, is actively progressing the implementation of other recommendations in the Report around access to cooking facilities and the increase in living space for those who avail of State provided accommodation.  Pilot projects are being established and undertaken in a number of centres to realise these objectives and ensuring that those residing in the State provided accommodation continue to be treated with respect and dignity.<\/p>  <p>  RIA are also working on the development of standards for the provision and maintenance of services in accommodation centres, enhancing the complaints mechanisms for residents of those centres and the provision of ongoing diversity and equality training and awareness programmes across all centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600068#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600068#WRA02800"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[40429\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600068#WRA02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to amend the Refugee Act 1996 to allow asylum seekers here to work, particularly in view of the well documented negative effects of enforced unemployment, which according to the HSE can compound mental health issues with boredom, depression, sense of isolation and loss of self esteem; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>Section 9(4)(b) of the Refugee Act 1996, provides that applicants for international protection shall not seek or enter employment or carry on any business, trade or profession during the period before the final determination of their application.

There has been no change in the policy in this respect in the new Act.<\/p>  <p>  There is an effective visa and immigration system in place for those who wish to lawfully migrate to the State for employment purposes.

The Report instead sought to tackle the causes of delay.  The International Protection Act 2015 provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications, allowing all relevant matters to be submitted at the time of application for consideration.  This will significantly reduce the length of time that persons spend awaiting a decision on their protection application.  This will bring certainty of status at a much earlier stage to qualified applicants.  Any applicant subsequently granted refugee status is entitled to enter the labour market.

On conviction, the Judge will ask the person to produce their licence. The court will then record the details of the driving licence. Failure to produce the driving licence will be recorded and will constitute an offence.  The Judge will, of course, still retain the discretion, which already exists, to adjourn the case to a later date and allow the person to produce their driving licence or learner permit at that point.  In tandem with the new arrangements, it is intended that the wording of the summons will be changed to indicate that a person is required to bring their driving licence or learner permit with them to court and that failure to produce it to the court, if required under section 22, is an offence.<\/p>  <p>  I strongly support this amendment to road traffic legislation, as it will provide the necessary consistency in the courts to enforce road traffic legislation more effectively.

The significance of the MLR project is such that when the project is implemented, the linking of vehicle and driving licence databases will facilitate the consistent application of penalty points to driving licences, thereby improving the effectiveness of road traffic enforcement measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600068#WRA03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Levels","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600068#WRA04000"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[40446\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600068#WRA04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the measures that will be taken to address the low burglary detection rate in the Dublin western metropolitan region; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>I understand that the Deputy is referring to detection rates highlighted in the 'Garda Recorded Crime Statistics 2010-2014', which was published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) last week.

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. <\/p><p>The Dublin Region is served by members assigned to the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) which consists of 6 Garda Division including the DMR North and North Central Divisions.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the DMR on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 3,473 of which 214 were Detectives.  The number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the DMR North and North Central Divisions on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 1,274 of which 67 were Detectives.  When appropriate, the work of the Garda Divisions within the DMR is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>At the request of the Garda Commissioner earlier this year, the Government moved decisively to strengthen Garda resources to deal with gang-related crime in the Dublin area.  In particular funding was approved for the establishment of a dedicated Armed Support Unit for the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) in order to enhance armed support capability in Dublin and to free up the resources of the ERU. Following a selection and training process, the Armed Support Unit for the DMR is now fully operational and providing armed cover on a 24 hour basis.  <\/p><p>I am further informed that Operation Hybrid has been established to coordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address public concerns about community safety.  As of 20 October 2016, there have been 38 arrests and 5 charges brought in connection with the recent shootings.  In addition, 23 firearms have been seized and over 9,000 lines of enquiry conducted. In excess of 14,350 high visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units and a significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence is also being examined.

This process will involve the recruitment of some 3,200 new Garda members on a phased basis over the next four years, to ensure that the service is renewed and has the capacity to provide visible, responsive and effective policing to every community throughout the country. <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p><p>This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.

The Garda authorities also have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under road traffic legislation. <\/p>  <p>  I also understand that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces may be prohibited under local authority bye-laws. <\/p>  <p>  Despite the legislative provisions in this area, the Garda authorities have indicated that the use of quad bikes and scramblers by minors and youths in public parks has proven difficult to deal with from an enforcement perspective . Garda members are instructed not to pursue youths on quad bikes, scramblers, etc. owing to the inherent safety issues involved and the risk of serious injury or death.  Therefore the opportunity to actually bring these vehicles to a stop is rare. <\/p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have advised that the issue may be best addressed through a multi-agency approach.  In this regard, Garda&iacute; are working with local authorities, including park authorities, to examine other solutions, such as engineering solutions.  Enhanced fencing and bike gates are examples of engineering measures taken to restrict access to parks.  <\/p>  <p>  I do of course share the Deputy's concerns in relation to the public safety and anti-social issues associated with the misuse of such vehicles.  While I am happy to engage as necessary with the Minister for Transport in relating to the legislative issues, it is clear that all aspects of this matter cannot be addressed by legislation alone. In this regard, the Road Safety Authority may have a role in developing further responses in this area, in addition to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Communications","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[40310\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there is to be a review of Garda e-mail usage; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner has responsibility for decisions in relation to the allocation and use of Garda resources and I, as Minister, have no direct role in these matters.<\/p><p>I can inform the Deputy that I expect to receive a report in relation to e-mail usage from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the near future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB02000"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[40439\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has been delayed for over nine years in view of the fact that international agreements have the force of law to the extent determined by the Houses of the Oireachtas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.

The first thing that needs to be said is that this publication provides an analysis of data up to the end of 2014 only, and it would be entirely incorrect to suggest that it represents an assessment of the current situation in relation to burglary or any other crime category.<\/p><p>In relation to the general issue of detection rates, it must be recognised that detection rates do vary according to the nature of the crime and that this is in line with international experience.  Detection rates are often found to be lower for certain offences, such as burglaries and some other property crimes, as these generally only come to light after the event and the offender has left the scene.  These offences are inherently more difficult to investigate than others such as possession of drugs, for example, where the offender is observed while committing the offence.  While our statistical system is not directly comparable with that of other countries, in the UK, for example, similar difficulties exist in detecting burglaries.  This is illustrated by Home Office figures which show that over 80% of burglary investigations in 2014\/2015 were concluded without a suspect being identified.  <\/p><p>I do of course share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that we do everything we can to protect communities from burglary and other crimes against householders.  Long before the publication of the recent CSO analysis, I initiated a broad ranging review of our response to burglary crime. <\/p><p>Operation Thor launched in November 2015 has led to a sharp decline in the rate of burglary crime. Indeed, the most current CSO crime figures, which are for the second quarter of 2016, indicate that in the first six months of this year there were 36%<b><\/b>less burglaries than in the first six months of 2015, underlining the impact of Operation Thor.  It is also worth noting that the CSO Quarter 2 figures for the Wexford Garda Division show a reduction in Burglary of 34%.  We have also seen the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act<b><\/b>2015.  These provisions are now available to Garda&iacute; in relation to prosecutions arising from the concentrated drive against crime which is being implemented under Operation Thor, which is supported by very significant investments in Garda resources.  The reduction in burglaries as a result of Operation Thor will not of course be indicated in the detection rate statistics  when they become available for the relevant period but the prevention of crime is always preferable to crimes having been committed which must then be detected.<\/p><p>If I might illustrate the scale of Garda activity against burglary and property crime &ndash; under Operation Thor we have seen 30,000 crime prevention patrols and in the order of 38,500 targeted checkpoints nationwide . There have also been in the region of 2,500<b><\/b>arrests and 2,900 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.<\/p><p>The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act was commenced a year ago and introduced the DNA database, which provides Garda&iacute; with investigative links (&rsquo;hits&rsquo;) between people and unsolved crimes; in particular burglaries.  It is anticipated that this should significantly assist in improving detection rates for burglary over the coming years.  So far, approximately 532 investigative links between people and unsolved crimes have already been uncovered, including 359 burglary cases.  In addition, the database links crime scene samples to each other and so far, 95 crime scene samples have been linked to other crime scene samples, demonstrating a link between two crimes or clusters of crimes committed by the same person in a particular area or locality.<\/p><p>I understand that the CSO will publish the next Quarterly Recorded Crime Statistics release before the end of this month. I can assure the Deputy that I will be monitoring crime trends very carefully and will remain in close contact with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that we continue to provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary legislative and financial supports needed to tackle crime and protect people in their own homes.<\/p><p>And finally, underpinning the Government&rsquo;s approach is our commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000 and we are pressing ahead with our plans for accelerated Garda recruitment so that we can provide more visible front line policing and bring greater reassurance to people in their local communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[40420\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the date on which she will publish the equality\/disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.

In 2015, a number of Garda units were brought together to leverage their experience and expertise in investigating serious crimes against the person including sexual offences.  The Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB) is a specialist team dedicated to making sure each and every complaint relating to child protection, human trafficking and domestic and sexual violence is thoroughly investigated and handled correctly.  In addition, the GNPSB is are responsible for working with other agencies to manage sex offenders in the interest of community safety.  As part of the Garda Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016 -2021 Protective Services Units (PSUs) will be set up around the country with specially trained staff.  The PSUs will work with the Garda Victim Service Offices in their area to ensure that the needs of victims are adequately catered for.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government is making very significant investments in Garda resources, including the expansion of the Garda fleet, upgrading of IT systems and a commitment to increase overall Garda numbers to 15,000 through a programme of accelerated recruitment.  I am confident that all these measures will support enhanced responses to all forms of crime and support the implementation of the strategic approach to dealing with sexual offences which I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[40441\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on whether it is the cuts to disability services which has prevented the Government ratifying the convention in view of the lack of any barrier to ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities from a legal perspective and only from a policy point of view; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":105,"content":"<p>Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.

The issue of fines warrants for unpaid fines, in respect of fines imposed in 2015, commenced from mid-2015 and continued on a monthly basis as fines became due for payment.

The details are updated to the CCTS.  Currently a total of 15,285  warrants with a total value of over &euro;5 million await update to the CCTS.

The Courts Service has undertaken an extensive ICT development programme to enhance the CCTS to provide for the payment of fines by instalment and additionally to provide for the enforcement provisions provided for in the Act.  This enhancement of the CCTS is now in the final stages of testing and subject to satisfactory completion of testing, it is anticipated that the Courts Service will be in a position to commence issuing notices to fined persons to attend Court in default of recovery of payment of fine in the first Quarter of 2017. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB05300"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[40465\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the next meeting of the EU Home Affairs and Justice Ministers is due to take place; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>The Justice and Home Affairs Council met on 8 and 9 of December 2016.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Clare Garda Division, on 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 293.  There are also 7 Garda Reserves and 31 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. <\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 15 to the Clare Division.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end. <\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including Clare, in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB05900"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[40464\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB06000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the role her Department is playing to ensure that no hard border is reintroduced here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[40462\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600069#WRB06100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide an update on discussions her Department has undertaken on Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1332","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 57 together.<\/p>  <p>  Substantial preparations in relation to the impact of a UK vote to leave the EU on the Department's areas of responsibility  have been underway for some time now.

Under this programme, the Government pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State by the end of 2017, through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Jordan and Lebanon. <\/p><p>Under the resettlement strand of the IRPP, 519 persons out of the original quota of 520 persons displaced by the Syrian conflict have arrived in Ireland to date, well ahead of the EU Commission deadline for this programme.In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in  2017. Sufficient refugees to fill 260 places on this quota have already been selected during a selection mission to Lebanon in October 2016 and these refugees are expected to arrive in Spring 2017. A further selection mission to Lebanon will be arranged in coming months to select the balance of the 2017 quota. Ireland will therefore have accepted 1,040 refugees under this strand by the end of 2017.<\/p><p>Under the relocation strand of the IRPP Ireland was allocated a total of 2,622 persons by two Council decisions and these were apportioned between Italy and Greece.  1,089 of this quota is to come from Greece and 623 from Italy.  The balance of 910 has yet to be assigned by the Commission to either country but it is anticipated that the Commissions may take a decision in this regard in the New Year.  <\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware the relocation strand of the IRPP was slow to become active largely because of serious operational difficulties in Italy and Greece in establishing camps and hot spots and registering asylum seekers under the EU Programme.  In the case of Greece the programme is now fully operational and Ireland will deliver on its commitment by the deadline.  In the case of Italy, serious difficulties persist as the Italian authorities have taken a position that they will not allow security assessments on Italian soil by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of applicants for relocation.  There have been several attempts to resolve this issue including a bi-lateral intervention by me with my Italian counterpart.  Efforts continue to try to resolve the matter and I remain hopeful that a solution can be found.  <\/p><p>Ireland has, to-date, taken in 109 asylum seekers from Greece, mostly families, and a further 130 asylum seekers are to arrive in Dublin Airport tomorrow, Friday 16 December, 2016.A further 84 people have been assessed in Athens by the IRPP team and cleared for arrival and arrangements for their travel to the State are currently being made.  The IRPP team includes members of the Department of Justice and Equality, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC), an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, as necessary, representatives of other Departments and Agencies, such as Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  This week, IRPP officials are interviewing a group of approximately 80 people in Athens who, subject to Garda security assessments, are expected to be approved for arrival early in the New Year.  In all, this means that over 400 persons, mostly families with young children, will have either arrived in Ireland or been assessed for arrival by the end of 2016.  The intention is to sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its current commitment of 1,089 within the timeframe envisaged by the Council decisions.

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians . In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Areas that have been highlighted in the discussions include:<\/p><p>-  Implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;<\/p><p>-  Review of the Garda Protected Disclosure policy;<\/p><p>-  Plans to conduct a culture audit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;<\/p><p>-  Corporate governance arrangements and management structures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and<\/p><p>-  Arrangements for training and the professional development of members.<\/p><p>In addition, the Authority has approved a three-year Strategy for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has also determined the policing priorities for 2017 which will inform the content of the 2017 Policing Plan to be published before the end of the year.  It has reviewed and issued recommendations on the Garda Protected Disclosure policy and will also establish a Code of Ethics that includes standards of conduct and practice for Garda members.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that Section 62(O)(2) of the  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  Act 2005, as amended, requires the Policing Authority, within two years from its establishment, to submit to the Minister a report on the effectiveness of the Authority and the adequacy of the functions assigned to it.  In addition, under Section 61(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015, the Minister must, in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, not later than five years after the establishment of the Authority, review the operation of the legislation.<\/p><p>The sections of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Policing Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 which remain to be commenced contain provisions concerning the Policing Authority's functions in relation to appointment and removal of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The commencement of these sections is dependent on the regulations governing promotion and discipline in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being amended to reflect the envisaged role for the Authority.  My intention is to bring the Regulations to Government for approval next week and that the Authority will take over the appointment function by 1 January 2017.  Once this is done it will be a matter for the Authority to undertake its own selection competitions for appointments to these ranks.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600070#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Disability Authority","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600070#WRC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[40315\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600070#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the review of the role of the National Disability Authority; when the review will be completed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1262","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":159,"content":"<p>The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to review the role of the National Disability Authority.

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the <\/p><p>Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. <\/p><p>I am further informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. I expect that the Traffic Corps, like all Garda Divisions and policing activities will benefit from this accelerated recruitment which is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This investment will support the delivery of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 which sets key strategic objectives for Roads Policing and will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s road policing plans over the next 5 years. <\/p><p>Insofar as road traffic enforcement is concerned generally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Roads Policing Operations Plan 2016 incorporates a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies, and is being implemented by each Regional Traffic Superintendent. The focus of the Plan is on the most vulnerable road user categories of motor cyclists, pedal cyclists, pedestrians and learner permit holders.  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including speeding, driving while intoxicated, and use of a mobile phone.<\/p><p>Road traffic legislation is also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600070#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sentencing Policy","counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600070#WRC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[40423\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600070#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider legislating for the introduction of a sentencing council.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, judges are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  In regard to sentencing, the approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. <\/p><p>The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Committee website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  This system is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much support the initiative led by the judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information on sentencing via the website.<\/p><p>The report of the Working Group on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy, published in July 2014, considered the issue of developing sentencing guidelines.  However, the majority of the Review Group took the view that the primary role of developing sentencing guidelines is the responsibility of the judiciary and does not lie in bringing forward detailed statutory based guidelines.  It might also be noted that a Sentencing Council was not advocated by the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Mandatory Sentencing which was published in June 2013.<\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that in 2014, the Court of Criminal Appeal issued a number of judgments which addressed the question of sentencing and which acknowledged the many factors that can be considered in individual cases which undermine the usefulness of direct comparisons between one case and another.

The Authority has informed the Inspectorate that the review should take account of:<\/p><p>- the changing environments in rural, developing urban and suburban areas;<\/p><p>- the views of local communities;<\/p><p>- the allocation to and deployment of Garda resources at the local policing level, including the use of the Garda Reserve, Garda facilities and Garda equipment; and<\/p><p>- relevant recommendations made in previous Inspectorate reports.<table><tr><th colspan=\"3\"> Stations in Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Donegal that were closed under the Rationalisation Programme 2012 - 2013<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Year Closed<\/td><td>Division<\/td><td>Station<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>Sligo \/ Leitrim<\/td><td>Bunnanadden<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>Sligo \/ Leitrim<\/td><td>Drumkerrin<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>Sligo \/ Leitrim<\/td><td>Kiltyclogher<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>Cavan \/ Monaghan<\/td><td>Tullyvin<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>Donegal<\/td><td>An Duchoraidh<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>Donegal<\/td><td>Culdaff<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>Donegal<\/td><td>Dunkineely<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Sligo \/ Leitrim<\/td><td>Aclare<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Sligo \/ Leitrim<\/td><td>Ballyfarnon<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Sligo \/ Leitrim<\/td><td>Cliffoney<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Sligo \/ Leitrim<\/td><td>Cloone<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Sligo \/ Leitrim<\/td><td>Dromahair<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Sligo \/ Leitrim<\/td><td>Dromod<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Sligo \/ Leitrim<\/td><td>Easkey<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Sligo \/ Leitrim<\/td><td>Glenfarne<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Sligo \/ Leitrim<\/td><td>Keshcarrigan<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Cavan \/ Monaghan<\/td><td>Bawnboy<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Cavan \/ Monaghan<\/td><td>Redhills<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Cavan \/ Monaghan<\/td><td>Shantonagh<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Cavan \/ Monaghan<\/td><td>Stradone<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Donegal<\/td><td>Annagaire<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Donegal<\/td><td>Gleann Cholm Cille<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Donegal<\/td><td>Malin<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Donegal<\/td><td>Min an L&aacute;bain<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Donegal<\/td><td>Na Brocacha<br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600070#WRC03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Peace Commissioners ","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600070#WRC03300"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[40563\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600070#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will investigate the possibility of instilling in local Peace Commissioners the authority to verify RFA 2 forms for the application for inclusion in the supplement to the register of electors; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>Peace Commissioners are appointed under section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.

RIA make an offer of accommodation to persons within the protection process and it is entirely their decision whether they avail of it.

The main reason Ireland did not opt-in to this Directive was the provisions relating to the right to work for asylum seekers.  The Directive provides for asylum seekers to be given access to the labour market if a decision at first instance has not been taken within one year of the making of an application for asylum, which is contrary to national law.  Section 9(4)(b) of the Refugee Act 1996, provides that applicants for international protection shall not seek or enter employment or carry on any business, trade or profession during the period before the final determination of their application.  This legislation is being replaced by the International Protection Act 2015, which is expected to be commenced on 31 December, 2016.  There has been no change in the policy in this respect in the new Act. <\/p>  <p>  There is an effective visa and immigration system in place for those who wish to lawfully migrate to the State for employment purposes.  The key concern in this regard is that both the asylum process and the wider immigration system would be undermined by giving people who secure entry to the State, on foot of claims to asylum yet to be determined, the same access to employment as legal immigrants who follow the lawful route to employment. <\/p>  <p>  The McMahon Working Group considered this matter in detail and did not recommend a right to work as a remedy to the experiences of people remaining for long periods in a cumbersome and sequential applications process.  The Report instead sought to tackle the causes of delay.  The International Protection Act 2015 provides for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The new procedure will streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications, allowing all relevant matters to be submitted at the time of application for consideration.  This will significantly reduce the length of time that persons spend awaiting a decision on their protection application.  This will bring certainty of status at a much earlier stage to qualified applicants. Any applicant subsequently granted international protection status is entitled to enter the labour market.  This significant reform addresses directly the situation raised by the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600070#WRC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600070#WRC04200"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[40634\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600070#WRC04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda stations and the number of garda&iacute; in each in the Dublin south central metropolitan region on 30 November 2016.","asker":"1296","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[40635\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600070#WRC04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda stations and the number of garda&iacute; in each in the Dublin southern metropolitan region on 30 November 2016.","asker":"1296","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. <\/p><p>I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Region South (DMR South) and Dublin Metropolitan Region South Central Divisions, on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 541 and 620 respectively. There are also 31 Garda Reserves and 34 civilians attached to the DMR South Division and 48 Garda Reserves and 28 civilians attached to the DMR South Central Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including  52 and 63 to the D.M.R. South and D.M.R. South Central Divisions respectively. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the D.M.R. South and D.M.R. South Central Divisions, in the coming years.<\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.<\/p><p>The following table gives a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation to the number of Garda stations and number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the  D.M.R.

A person is liable to a fine of up to &euro;3,000 or 6 months in prison, or both for selling or supplying a &lsquo;mechanically propelled vehicles&rsquo; to a minor.

Under the Road Traffic Acts, any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may stop a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and demand production of a driver licence or learner permit. In addition, Garda&iacute; may inspect the vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation, which makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration, drive carelessly, or drive dangerously.  The Garda authorities also have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under road traffic legislation. <\/p>  <p>  I also understand that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces may be prohibited under local authority bye-laws. <\/p>  <p>  The joint statement highlights that tragically mishaps on these vehicles have resulted in the deaths of children in the UK and Ireland over recent years.

There are also 22 Garda Reserves and 29 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau.

ANPR works on the basis of an in-car camera, reading vehicle number plates using optical character recognition technology, which checks each vehicle registration number plate against PULSE to identify, for example, stolen or untaxed vehicles. It also includes a speed detection and video recording capability and is utilised for both roads policing and as an investigative and intelligence tool. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.

In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is very largely obviated.  This efficiency in the Garda vetting systems has been achieved by the deployment of the e-Vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.  The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the Garda National Vetting Bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.  Vetting checks are conducted by the Garda vetting bureau for each new vetting application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original Vetting Disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date.  Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process. <\/p>  <p>  There are certain limited circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant.  Section 12(3)(A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of an person to undertake relevant work or activities thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600071#WRD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600071#WRD03850"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[41009\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600071#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive notification of an application for citizenship.","asker":"1305","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":289,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the processing of the application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy is under consideration and a decision is expected to issue in the near future. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  <\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.

Following this review, in Budget 2017 I announced my intention to introduce a new, SME-focused, share-based incentive scheme in Budget 2018.\u00a0 Such an incentive will require the approval of the European Commission and my officials will commence engagement with the Commission to ensure that the incentive will comply with State Aid rules in advance of the next Budget.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also committed to introduce a PRSI scheme for the self-employed, and in Budget 2017 the Government announced the extension of access\u00a0to Invalidity Pensions to the self-employed. Invalidity Pension is a pension payment for people who cannot work because of a long-term illness or disability.  When someone develops a long-term illness it can cause serious financial repercussions. Gaining access to Invalidity Pension will provide the self-employed with a much stronger safety net to protect them in the event of injury or disablement.  The self-employed will gain access to Invalidity Pension on the same basis as employees from December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Also announced in Budget 2017, is the extension of Treatment Benefits to the self-employed on the same basis as employees.  The Treatment Benefit Scheme provides partial dental, optical and aural services to those who have made the required contributions.\u00a0 This extension will come into effect from March 2017.\u00a0 Treatment Benefit entitlements will be extended further from October 2017, providing additional dental and optical benefits.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, jobseekers taking up self-employment will be able to access the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance after 9 months, down from 12 months. Minister Varadkar, the Minister for Social Protection, can provide further information in respect of the above initiatives if required.<\/p>  <p>  Further to a commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department published, in July this year, an Income Tax Reform Plan containing a detailed overview of various policy considerations relevant to this reform, including the necessity to maintain the breadth of our income tax base and retain appropriate levels of taxation for high earners. The taxation of the self-employed is considered in some detail in this Income Tax Reform Plan, and the issues outlined therein will be borne in mind when considering\u00a0future reform of the income tax system as it relates to the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the plan was to inform all members of the Oireachtas of the issues and options which will underpin future income tax reform, and it is my hope that all members of the Oireachtas will engage constructively in debating options for future reform in this area.

Financial services is an area that is frequently identified in any discussion of Brexit. \u00a0Ireland has a successful track record of competing for, and winning, global foreign direct investment. One of the key pillars of that success is the growth of the International Financial Services (IFS) sector, in particular\u00a0over the past 30 years. Ireland is now recognised internationally as a leading global centre for internationally traded financial services.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2015, the Government launched the lFS2020 Strategy, a whole-of-government approach to further driving the growth and development of the IFS sector in Ireland. The decision in May of this year by An Taoiseach to appoint a dedicated Minister of State\u00a0with specific responsibility for financial services sends a clear and strong signal of the Government's long-established commitment to the further growth and ongoing development of the IFS industry.\u00a0 Implementation\u00a0of the IFS2020 Strategy and the annual Action Plans is driven by a public sector High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC). The HLIC, meeting on a quarterly basis,\u00a0is chaired by Minister of State for Financial Services Eoghan Murphy TD. Minister of State Murphy also chairs quarterly meetings of the IFS2020 Joint Committee, comprising of members of the public sector HLIC and senior IFS industry representatives. Brexit is now a standing agenda item at these quarterly meetings. Furthermore, a cross-governmental\u00a0financial services group (including the agencies)\u00a0is also chaired by my Department and all\u00a0this joined up work ultimately feeds into the\u00a0Cabinet Committee on Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is in a strong position to build on its successful track record and to compete for future mobile investments in the IFS sector.\u00a0In a post UK EU referendum environment, the Government will continue to implement the IFS2020 Strategy\u00a0to drive growth in the IFS sector.  The Government\u00a0will continue to promote the attractiveness of Ireland as a location of choice for mobile international investment and for talented people.  The IFS2020 Strategy combines long-term strategic thinking with the flexible tools to react to any domestic and international developments occurring over the period. There will be opportunities for Ireland arising from the UK's decision to leave the EU. The Government is keen to maximise those opportunities where possible.  The\u00a0IFS2020 Strategy, the long-term vision for international financial services, was developed and put in place long before the UK decision to leave the EU.\u00a0 However, it provides\u00a0a clear framework to maximise any opportunities that might arise from that decision particularly through the annual Action Plans. The annual Action Plans enable a tailored\u00a0response to deal with these challenges and opportunities as they arise. The IFS2020 Action Plan for 2017 was considered by the Joint Committee in December and\u00a0will be published in very\u00a0early 2017, following final\u00a0consultations with all key public and private sector stakeholders and noting by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Governor of the Central Bank\u00a0has previously indicated that where further resources are necessary due to an expanded universe of regulated and supervised firms, the Bank has the ability to effectively re-prioritise where it needs\u00a0to meet the increased level of demand and also to increase staff numbers as necessary. <\/p>  <p>  As part\u00a0of the promotion of Ireland as a location for financial services, a\u00a0key IFS2020 milestone is the hosting of the second annual European Financial Forum in Dublin Castle on 24th January 2017. Given the result of the UK referendum and the potential implications for the financial services industry, the Forum is an opportune time to bring more than 600 financial services executives and policy makers from around the world to Dublin.\u00a0 The themes of EFF 2017 will focus on the challenges and opportunities for the European financial system as both a source and a provider of capital.  The keynotes and panel sessions will have a\u00a0focus on Europe relative to the North American and Asian financial systems.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Over the last number of\u00a0months, Minister of State Murphy has\u00a0undertaken two significant visits to Asia and North America, as well as IFS engagements in London.\u00a0The main purpose of these visits was to promote Ireland as a destination for financial services investment and to launch the IFS Ireland brand in the Asian and North American markets.\u00a0Minister of State Murphy\u00a0will continue to promote Ireland overseas as the perfect European location for financial services investment as the IFS2020 Strategy moves into 2017, including\u00a0during upcoming visits to\u00a0Beijing and Hong Kong\u00a0in January 2017.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a IFS2020 Communications sub-group consisting of relevant departments and agencies who develop and promote plans and messaging on Ireland as a location for financial services.\u00a0 This Comms sub-group will work\u00a0both with private and public stakeholders to ensure that there is consistent messaging. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Budget 2017 is the latest step to make Ireland \"Brexit ready\". The\u00a0measures announced in Budget 2017 help protect Irish businesses from Brexit volatility, enable them to compete internationally, and make Ireland increasingly attractive for investment. Budget 2017 included a number of measures to respond to the challenges of Brexit, to mitigate future risks, and to maximise any opportunities that might arise. These include the reduced\u00a0capital gains tax to help entrepreneurs, the Foreign Earnings Deduction (FED) extension and amendment, and the extension of the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP). More information on these measures is available in the Budget documentation.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also provides for additional funding for the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Enterprise Agencies to help them address the challenges and opportunities arising from Brexit. This will help support the enterprise agencies achieve their growth targets across all sectors of the economy, including the IFS2020 target to create 10,000 net new IFS jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Input from all public sector and industry stakeholders in relation to financial services will continue to form a key part of the Brexit contingency planning joined up\u00a0process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600072#WRE02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Budget Contribution","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600072#WRE02300"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[40639\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600072#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his Department's current estimate of Ireland's EU budget contribution for 2015; when he expects this amount to be paid","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>Member State contributions to the EU Budget are based upon a formula which includes Traditional Own Resources (customs duties), a VAT-based payment and a residual balancing component paid in accordance with each Member State's share of EU Gross National Income (GNI).<\/p>  <p>Details on EU Budget payments and public sector receipts are published annually by the Department of Finance in the Budget Statistics bulletin which is available on the Department's website.

I\u00a0strongly reject\u00a0this characterisation of our tax rate.\u00a0 Interestingly, the report also\u00a0recognises the benefits of the 12.5% and does not seek for the rate to change, while it appears to ignore that beside the 12.5 % rate,\u00a0Ireland applies a\u00a025% rate\u00a0on passive income and 33% on capital gains.  The 12.5% rate is fully in line with OECD and international best practice of having a low rate and applying it to a very wide tax base.  The 12.5% rate is only available on trading profits where there is substantial activity in Ireland. Ireland's corporate tax policies are designed to attract real and substantive operations to Ireland.\u00a0 Ireland has not been and will never will be a brass-plate location.<\/p>  <p>  The Oxfam report also lists Ireland's tax incentives as being a feature of a tax haven.\u00a0 This is simply incorrect. Ireland has\u00a0a very limited number of targeted tax incentives that are fully in line with agreed international best practice.\u00a0 The Knowledge Development Box, which is singled out in the report, was the first such measure\u00a0in the world to be deemed fully compliant with OECD rules by the Forum on Harmful Tax Practices.\u00a0 While a number of countries not included on the Oxfam list have boxes which failed these rules and were considered harmful, Ireland's box was fully approved.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Oxfam report mentions Ireland in the context of profit shifting activities.\u00a0\u00a0I have\u00a0been clear that aggressive tax planning can best be countered by international tax reform.\u00a0 Profit shifting can only be carried out\u00a0where global rules applied in all countries are ineffective or misaligned.  This is why the BEPS project was needed and why the\u00a0BEPS recommendations now need to be implemented globally.  For this reason, Ireland is an active participant in global work to reform the international corporate tax system.\u00a0 We have implemented Country by Country Reporting, agreed the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and are working towards the implementation of the remaining OECD BEPS recommendations both domestically and internationally.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  I have no function in relation to the operational matters of the Board.  The Act provides that landlords in the sector must apply to register the tenancy of a dwelling with the RTB within one month of the commencement of the tenancy.  There are currently over 325,500 tenancies registered with the RTB, comprising over 174,500 landlords and over 516,500 tenants. <\/p><p>Security of tenure under the 2004 Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles.  Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four-year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.  Landlords and tenants may not contract out of any of the provisions of Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act and no lease, tenancy agreement, contract or other agreement may operate to vary or modify the provisions of Part 4 of the Act. <\/p><p>The entitlement to a four-year tenancy is a minimum entitlement for tenants after 6 months.  This does not prevent landlords providing for longer fixed-term tenancies should they wish to do so and there is nothing in the Act to prevent a landlord providing a tenant with more beneficial rights generally than those that are provided for in the Act. Where a fixed-term tenancy continues for more than 6 months then, subject to limited exceptions, the tenant acquires the right to a Part 4 tenancy in addition to any rights they have under their fixed tenancy agreement. <\/p><p>My Department does not hold or collate the data in relation to the number of tenancies that are subject to fixed-term agreements, Part 4 agreements or both.

JobPath supplements the internal case management capacity of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service and the Local Employment Service. Over the past year this additional capacity has enabled the Department to provide an intensive employment support and advisory service to over 60,000 long term unemployed jobseekers who would otherwise not have received such a service.  The JobPath service is provided by two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua, who have put in place a network of over 80 offices nationwide and who employ nearly 600 staff of whom some 400 are caseworkers. The JobPath companies will continue to engage with long-term unemployed jobseekers in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s online job vacancy service www.jobsireland.ie enables employers and jobseekers to search for prospective employees and jobs using skillsets and competencies as well as the traditional job type classifications.  Jobseekers can also search jobs by location. Once a jobseeker is registered, the service automatically matches candidates to job specifications and can notify both the jobseeker and the employer when a match is found.  <\/p>  <p>  During 2017, all jobseekers will be required to register on www.jobsireland.ie.  It is planned to integrate JobsIreland with my Department&rsquo;s Activation Case-Management system to enable activation teams to offer enhanced supports to jobseekers and monitor their job search activity.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has progressively rolled out its Intreo service to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis.  People with disabilities who present at INTREO Centres will be offered an interview by a case officer who will agree a personal plan with the individual.  Officers in INTREO Centres have received additional training to assist them in supporting people with disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will spend more than &euro;1 billion in 2016 on work, training and education places in support of jobseekers.  Expenditure and the number of schemes and participants increased significantly in recent years in a response to the high levels of unemployment which peaked at 15%. <\/p>  <p>  Schemes such as Community Employment (CE), T&uacute;s and RSS play an important role in helping jobseekers maintain work skills.  Erosion of jobseeker confidence and work skills, including soft skills related to team-working, communication, planning etc., is a significant issue over long periods of unemployment.  <\/p>  <p>  With the ongoing welcome reductions in the Live Register, issues such as the appropriate level of expenditure, the number of places and the criteria for participation on employment schemes are all being considered. I hope to be in a position to bring a Memorandum to Government on these matters in the coming weeks. If there are any changes to be made, consultations with stakeholders will be facilitated. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, with regard to rural communities, the Farm Assist scheme provides support for farmers on low incomes and is similar to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance. As part of Budget 2017, farm income and other income from off-farm self-employment is to be assessed at 70%, down from 100%, for Farm Assist, with additional annual disregard of &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and other children. There is also a &euro;5 increase in maximum weekly rate of Farm Assist and &euro;3.30 increase for adult dependants.  Invalidity Pension is being extended to the self-employed including farmers.  In addition entitlement to Dental and Optical Benefits is also being extended to this cohort.  It is also worth noting that 500 additional places under the Rural Social Scheme were announced which will increase the overall number to 3,100.  My Department intends allocating these places as early as possible in 2017 taking into account a number of factors. These include the number of places already allocated, the demand for new places in particular areas, work opportunities available in local areas and the numbers of farmers and fishermen and women in receipt of income support.  In allocating the additional places, the Government recognises the benefits the RSS provides for participants and their families, as well as the valuable contribution the scheme is making to the provision of services in communities across Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600077#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance Fund","counter":621,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600077#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":622,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[40832\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600077#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding the programme for Government commitment to introduce a PRSI scheme for the self-employed; the number of such persons covered by this new scheme; and the new entitlements, the PRSI rate and PRSI class that eligible persons can avail of and if the scheme is voluntary.","asker":"1221","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":623,"content":"<p>Self-employed people who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.

For the first time, this will give the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they have a serious illness or injury that prevents them from working without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  The self-employed will also benefit from the further increase in Earned Income Tax Credit announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, as well as the extension of entrepreneurship supports.

Staff also redeployed from other Departments in the context of Employment Control Framework targets set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>The table below details the number of staff who transferred into and out of the Social Welfare Appeals Office in the period from 2008 to date.<table><tr><th><\/th><th colspan=\"4\">Transfers into Appeals Office<\/th><th colspan=\"2\">Transfers out of Appeals Office<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Year<\/td><td>Internal transfer<\/td><td>Redeployed within DSP<\/td><td>Transfer from other Department<\/td><td>Redeployed from other Department<\/td><td>Internal Transfer<\/td><td>Transfer to other Department<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600077#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Data","counter":636,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600077#WRK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":637,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[40609\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600077#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of households by county currently in receipt of the rent supplement payment in tabular form; the number of households by county that have had their rent increased above the prescribed rent supplement limit for their area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":638,"content":"<p>The rent supplement scheme is supporting approximately 48,600 tenants at a total cost of &euro;267 million this year. A breakdown of rent supplement recipients by county is provided in the attached tabular statement. In recognition of the ongoing supply difficulties, my Department continues to implement a targeted case-by-case policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits. To date, approximately 10,600 persons at imminent risk of homelessness have been supported through increased rent supplement payments. There has been a significant reduction in these cases following the introduction of the increased rent limits from 1 July this year.  A county breakdown of these payments is provided in the tabular statement.The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020 and the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; which has committed to an accelerated target of 12,000 HAP tenancies in 2016.  Under HAP, responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need transfers to local authorities, under the auspices of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>From 1st December 2016, the HAP scheme is now operational in 28 of the 31 local authority areas. It is expected that HAP will be fully rolled out to the remaining Dublin administrative areas from 1st March 2017. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that HAP was first piloted in the Limerick area in early 2014 and there are now over 1,500 HAP supported tenancies in Limerick City and County. The number of HAP recipients in Limerick has exceeded the number of rent supplement recipients (973). In addition to the ongoing transfer of tenancies from rent supplement to HAP, the majority of new applicants in Limerick seeking State support towards their rent are being processed under HAP rather than rent supplement. This activity is reflected in the low number of increased payments provided under rent supplement in this area. <\/p><p>In tandem with the revised rental limits introduced in July 2016 and on-going transfers to HAP, my Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents may exceed the appropriate maximum limit ensuring where possible the threat of homelessness for tenants can be avoided. <\/p><p><b>Tabular Statement <\/b><\/p><p><b>Table 1: Rent Supplement Recipients by County as at end November 2016<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Recipients<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>CARLOW<\/td><td>624<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CAVAN<\/td><td>375<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLARE<\/td><td>438<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK<\/td><td>5,032<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DONEGAL<\/td><td>445<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DUBLIN<\/td><td>20,619<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GALWAY<\/td><td>2,564<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KERRY<\/td><td>1,555<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILDARE<\/td><td>2,631<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILKENNY<\/td><td>329<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LAOIS<\/td><td>872<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LEITRIM<\/td><td>283<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LIMERICK<\/td><td>973<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LONGFORD<\/td><td>403<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LOUTH<\/td><td>902<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYO<\/td><td>1,102<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MEATH<\/td><td>1,023<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN<\/td><td>197<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>OFFALY<\/td><td>582<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON<\/td><td>570<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SLIGO<\/td><td>297<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY<\/td><td>947<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WATERFORD<\/td><td>615<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH<\/td><td>1,308<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WEXFORD<\/td><td>1,973<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WICKLOW<\/td><td>1,940<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>48,599<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>Table 2: Total Cumulative Increased Rental Payments by County as at 12th December 2016<\/b><table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework<\/th><th>Awards under protocol with Threshold<\/th><th>Total no. of increased payments by County<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>CARLOW<\/td><td>72<\/td><td><\/td><td>72<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CAVAN<\/td><td>57<\/td><td><\/td><td>57<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLARE<\/td><td>60<\/td><td><\/td><td>60<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK<\/td><td>446<\/td><td>102<\/td><td>548<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DONEGAL<\/td><td>-<\/td><td><\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DUBLIN<\/td><td>4,000<\/td><td>2,484<\/td><td>6,484<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GALWAY<\/td><td>204<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>206<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KERRY<\/td><td>181<\/td><td><\/td><td>181<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILDARE<\/td><td>531<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>534<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILKENNY<\/td><td>135<\/td><td><\/td><td>135<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LAOIS<\/td><td>119<\/td><td><\/td><td>119<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LEITRIM<\/td><td>97<\/td><td><\/td><td>97<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LIMERICK<\/td><td>8<\/td><td><\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LONGFORD<\/td><td>307<\/td><td><\/td><td>307<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LOUTH<\/td><td>152<\/td><td><\/td><td>152<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYO<\/td><td>3<\/td><td><\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MEATH<\/td><td>423<\/td><td><\/td><td>423<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>OFFALY<\/td><td>64<\/td><td><\/td><td>64<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON<\/td><td>51<\/td><td><\/td><td>51<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SLIGO<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY<\/td><td>283<\/td><td><\/td><td>283<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WATERFORD<\/td><td>62<\/td><td><\/td><td>62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH<\/td><td>355<\/td><td><\/td><td>355<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WEXFORD<\/td><td>20<\/td><td><\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WICKLOW<\/td><td>359<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>362<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Overall Total<\/td><td>7,991<\/td><td>2,581<\/td><td>10,572<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600077#WRK02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Widow's Pension Eligibility","counter":639,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600077#WRK02300"},{"type":"question","counter":640,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[40610\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600077#WRK02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a response will issue regarding an overpayment of widows non-contributory pension to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1334","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":641,"content":"<p>Widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s and surviving civil partner&rsquo;s non-contributory pension is a means-tested payment.

This period is not covered by maternity benefit but a mother is entitled to a credited social insurance contribution for each week of unpaid leave that is taken (up to the maximum of 16). <\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question maternity leave and maternity benefit can be postponed for up to six months at the discretion of the mother in cases where the child is hospitalised. In these cases entitlement to maternity leave and benefit continues after the period of postponement for a maximum of twelve weeks. <\/p><p>Eligible parents can also avail of paid paternity leave at any time within the first 26 weeks following the birth or date of placement of the child. Paternity benefit is available for employed and self-employed people who are on from work and covered by contributions. Paternity leave and paternity benefit can also be postponed for up to six months in cases where the child is hospitalised. <\/p><p>A recipient of the one parent family payment can keep their main social welfare payment and receive a half-rate maternity benefit as well. A carer who was in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance payment and subsequently has an entitlement to maternity benefit is entitled to keep a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance payment along with their maternity benefit. Parents are also entitled to child benefit which is paid from the date of birth of the child.<\/p><p>Where an individual has insufficient social insurance contributions to qualify for maternity benefit, they may be eligible for another social welfare payment provided they meet the relevant contingency conditions.  For instance, new mothers who do not qualify for maternity benefit may be eligible for a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.  This scheme is considered a &quot;safety net&quot; within the overall social welfare system for eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. <\/p><p>These measures facilitate parental choice by allowing parents decide what options are best suited to their circumstances.<\/p><p>I hope this information is useful. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600077#WRK04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Applications","counter":666,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600077#WRK05000"},{"type":"question","counter":667,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[40752\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600077#WRK05100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when restoration of rent allowance might occur in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":668,"content":"<p>The Department has not, to date, received an application for Rent Supplement from the client concerned.

Within my Department, the key Divisions are the Ireland, UK and Americas (IUKA) Division and the European Union Division, both headed at Second Secretary General level.  Within the IUKA Division, there are teams focused on Northern Ireland and on wider British-Irish Relations, while the European Union Division contains a specific team focused on the EU-UK negotiations.  <\/p>  <p>  In effect, most branches of the Department at its headquarters in Dublin are involved in some way as part of the response to the UK exit, for example the Legal Division, the Trade Division and also the Policy Planning Unit.

EU issues are the sole focus of the Permanent Representation in Brussels, our largest diplomatic mission, and a major part of the work of our Embassies in all twenty-seven other EU Member States.  <\/p>  <p>  The configuration and scale of the State&rsquo;s diplomatic and consular network is kept under ongoing review by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600078#WRL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications Data","counter":696,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600078#WRL01500"},{"type":"question","counter":697,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[40502\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600078#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of passports issued by his Department from 1 January to date in 2016; the way in which this figure compares with 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":698,"content":"<p>The number of passports issued in 2015 was 672,760.

On 28 June, the European Council agreed that delivering rapid results in preventing illegal migration and returning irregular migrants requires an effective Partnership Framework of cooperation with individual countries of origin or transit. Draft &lsquo;Migration Compacts&rsquo; have now been drawn up for the first five priority countries identified.  These are all in Africa: Niger, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal and Ethiopia.  The objective of a Migration Compact is to improve cooperation on readmission and return of those not entitled to reside in the EU; to prevent irregular migration and counter smuggling and trafficking in human beings; to reinforce the current international protection system for refugees in the partner countries; and to address the root causes of irregular migration.  Human rights and humanitarian imperatives are at the core of the EU and Member States&rsquo; approach under the Partnership Framework.  The EU and its Member States are committed to enhancing human rights safeguards in all migration and mobility dialogues and cooperation frameworks with third countries and in migration-related agreements, processes and programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions within the EU and with the identified countries are continuing.  However, progress has been made, notably with Niger, where the fight against people-smugglers has stepped up, a dedicated agency to combat human trafficking has been established and the outgoing flow of migrants has decreased.  Negotiations with Nigeria are also moving forward, with a further round expected in December. <\/p>  <p>  We are supportive of the progress towards Migration Compacts to develop a comprehensive partnership between the EU and third countries, particularly in Africa, and we are working in particular with our EU colleagues on the new partnership framework for Ethiopia, one of the key partner countries for the Irish Aid programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600078#WRL02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Prisoners Abroad","counter":708,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600078#WRL02700"},{"type":"question","counter":709,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[40506\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600078#WRL02800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the recent efforts being made by his Department to secure the release of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":710,"content":"<p>I wish to assure the Deputy that securing this citizen&rsquo;s return home to Ireland continues to be a top priority for the Government.

The Taoiseach has raised the case directly and personally with Egyptian President el-Sisi on a number of occasions, including in face-to-face meetings, by phone and in writing.  Following the adjournment of the trial in November, the Taoiseach again contacted the Egyptian President and urged him to return this citizen to Ireland without delay.   <\/p>  <p>  I am also in regular contact with my Egyptian counterpart, Minister Sameh Shoukry, making clear the Irish Government&rsquo;s concerns and objectives in this case.  I spoke with Minister Shoukry on Tuesday 1 November, again restating very clearly the Irish Government&rsquo;s support for the Decree 140 application.  I also met my counterpart in New York during the UN General Assembly in September, having also raised the case during a visit to Cairo in June.    <\/p>  <p>  As well as pursuing the Law\/Decree 140 application, the Government also continues to explore each and every other possible avenue that might assist in securing this citizen&rsquo;s return to Ireland.  The Government, through our Embassy in Cairo, has been closely following the reports from Egypt about a new &lsquo;youth amnesty scheme&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, on foot of a request from the citizen&rsquo;s family, the Government has formally requested that the Egyptian Government consider him for immediate release.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach specifically made this request in a letter to the Egyptian President on 17 November.  I raised this matter and request also with the Egyptian Ambassador in Dublin on the same day.<\/p>  <p>  However, the details of this amnesty scheme remain very opaque and there are contradictory media reports about who might be eligible to avail of the scheme.  Our Embassy in Cairo is seeking further information and clarification about how it operates. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to engagement with the Egyptian authorities, the Government has also been engaging on an ongoing basis with other states who have had citizens in similar situations, with our European and international partners, and with the European Union.  I have engaged extensively with the EU High Representative, Ms. Federica Mogherini, who &ndash; at my request - has personally raised the case with the Egyptian Government. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government has been represented at every hearing in the case to date and our Ambassador was again in court to observe the proceedings at the most recent hearing, on 13 December.  Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both in Dublin and in Cairo, remain in ongoing contact with the citizen&rsquo;s family. <\/p>  <p>  His welfare while he remains in detention is also a high priority for the Government.  Diplomats from the Irish embassy in Cairo make regular consular visits to him in prison to monitor his wellbeing and to address any issues that arise in relation to his treatment or conditions of detention.

The continued denial of essential food, shelter and medical supplies to a civilian population under military attack is intolerable.  I also made the point that the EU needs to support practical steps to ensure the effectiveness of future accountability for war crimes committed in Syria.  Ministers agreed on the continued need for the EU to work to ensure that those committing these crimes do not enjoy impunity for their actions.<\/p>  <p>  We also discussed the conditions for EU support for a post-conflict Syria.

However we are concerned about the recent violence in Rakhine State, which began when attacks were carried out against Border Guard Police posts on 9 October 2016.  Security operations led by the Myanmar Armed Forces in response to those attacks.  Both civilians and security personnel have been killed with thousands of people displaced or losing their livelihoods.  Regular humanitarian assistance has been severely disrupted for many weeks and there are reports of a significant deterioration in the human rights situation in northern Rakhine State, including allegations of disproportionate action by the Myanmar Armed Forces.<\/p>  <p>  On December 9, Ireland through its Embassy in Bangkok, which is accredited to Myanmar\/Burma, joined a number of likeminded diplomatic missions there in a statement which expressed serious concerns about humanitarian aid access to the region.  The statement also addressed the recent attacks against security personnel in Rakhine State and allegations of abuse in the subsequent security operations.  We urged the security forces in Myanmar\/Burma to ensure protection of all civilians.  The creation of an Investigation Commission offers an important opportunity to investigate these incidents and allegations objectively and transparently, as well as expose acts of violence and abuse.<\/p>  <p>  The Government regularly highlights its concerns regarding conflict in Rakhine State and the minority Rohingya people at bilateral level and in the context of our membership of the EU and the UN. <\/p>  <p>  The third EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue took place in Myanmar\/Burma on November 22.  At the meeting, the EU similarly expressed concerns about the recent security and human rights situation in northern Rakhine state, reiterating calls for an independent, credible investigation into both initial attacks and subsequent actions, as well as for the urgent re-opening of humanitarian access to the populations in need.  These messages were also reiterated in bilateral meetings undertaken by EU Special Representative for Human Rights Stavros Lambrinidis with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Min Aung Hlaing, Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces, during Mr Lambrinidis&rsquo; visit to Myanmar\/Burma.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is of the view that the underlying root causes of tensions in Rakhine State must be addressed with long-term solutions led by the Government of Myanmar\/Burma.

In 2015, Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian funding amounted to more than &euro;142 million globally.  This level of funding is being maintained in 2016 and includes Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the European Commission&rsquo;s humanitarian action outside the EU, which has an annual budget of approximately &euro;1 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian response focuses on the most severe crises, often protracted over many years, including those which do not receive attention in the media.  The core objective of our assistance is to save and protect lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity, before, during and in the aftermath of such crises.  Our assistance is focused on where needs are greatest, providing support to the most vulnerable and hard to reach populations, and places key emphasis on gender equality and protection, including from gender-based violence. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Humanitarian Assistance Policy recognises the particular needs and vulnerabilities of women and girls in emergencies, noting that attention to gender equality must be an essential part of every humanitarian operation.  Ireland consistently prioritises the protection of women and girls in our humanitarian programming and advocacy work, including in our commitments at this year&rsquo;s World Humanitarian Summit, and through strategic partnerships with organisations such as the International Rescue Committee, which enable us to support dedicated gender-based violence prevention and response efforts in emergencies.  At the World Humanitarian Summit, which was convened in May by the UN Secretary General, President Higgins co-chaired a roundtable discussion on Women and Girls and delivered Ireland&rsquo;s national commitments to the protection and empowerment of women and girls in emergency settings. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is strongly committed to responding to the humanitarian needs of the Syrian people and those affected by ongoing conflict in the Middle East and in sub-Saharan Africa.  Since 2012, we have provided more than &euro;67 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria and the region.  We have provided over &euro;100 million for victims of crises across the Horn of Africa since 2012, including &euro;30 million for the South Sudan crisis alone.  In addition, Ireland continues to provide support to people affected by major crisis situations in Iraq, Yemen, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic. <\/p>  <p>  We continue to monitor each major crisis situation closely to ensure that our assistance is reaching those most in need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600078#WRL05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":733,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600078#WRL05200"},{"type":"question","counter":734,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[40789\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600078#WRL05300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he and his Department continue to engage with colleagues in the EU, UK, Northern Ireland and Scotland with a view to ensuring that, notwithstanding Brexit, Ireland retains full and unconditional access to the Single Market and the UK market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":735,"content":"<p>Since the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union, the Government has been very clear that Ireland&rsquo;s own position is unchanged: we remain a committed member of the EU and of the Eurozone.

Now, more than ever, our membership of the EU must remain at the heart of our engagement with the wider world.  Continued EU membership guarantees access to a Single Market of 500 million consumers and is vital to the economic well-being of the Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  In facing the challenges of the UK withdrawal from the EU, the priority areas for the Government also remain unchanged &ndash; this is about our citizens, our economy, Northern Ireland, our Common Travel Area and the future of the EU itself.  We continue to outline these priority issues at all of our meetings with EU counterparts &ndash; at both official and political level.  From an EU perspective, the Taoiseach, the Minister of State for European Affairs and I remain actively engaged with our European counterparts, as do other Ministers and senior officials.  At this critical phase, building on the round of contacts I have had since 23 June with each one of my EU counterparts, efforts are intensifying to ensure that an understanding of our priority issues is reinforced and factored into negotiations with the UK when these formally commence.  In the last few weeks, I have met with the Foreign Ministers of Poland, France and Belgium and I plan to meet more of my colleagues in the period ahead.  My officials have also had a range of engagements in recent weeks with their colleagues in other EU Member States and with the EU institutions, and these will continue in the weeks and months to come.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel, the Government continues to engage closely with the UK government and with devolved administrations across Britain and of course Northern Ireland.

These are co convened by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I, who attend then along with the First and deputy First Ministers and, where relevant to her portfolio, the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice.  <\/p><p>These review meetings are important in providing political direction and momentum for the full implementation of the Agreements. At the most recent review meeting, held yesterday, I am glad to report that is was clear that there has been sustained progress with the implementation of the Fresh Start Agreement over the last year, with each administration actively pursuing the necessary work to fulfil the respective commitments. <\/p><p>For instance the Joint Agency Task Force on cross border crime, launched in Dublin last year, has quickly become fully operational and is progressing its work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime and bring to justice those involved in it. The Task Force builds on existing operational arrangements to tackle organised crime, including that linked to paramilitarism, on a cross-border basis. The Task Force reports on its work to the two Justice Ministers within the framework of their regular meetings under the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Criminal Justice Co-operation, as provided for in the Fresh Start Agreement.<\/p><p>The Government is also meeting its commitments as regards infrastructure projects<font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>under the Fresh Start Agreement. This includes a contribution of &euro;25 million from the Irish Government in 2019 for the upgrading of the A5 Western Transport Corridor road project, which is in addition to the &euro;50 million previously committed. The Government&rsquo;s committed funding of &euro;2.5 million to the North West Development Fund has been provided and is to be matched by the NI Executive. Discussions are continuing at senior official level with the Northern Ireland Executive regarding co-operation on other infrastructure projects, including the Narrow Water Bridge project and the Ulster Canal and exploring financing options for future border infrastructure projects.<\/p><p>A key provision on the Fresh Start Agreement relates to the ending of the legacy of paramilitarism and there have been significant developments on this since the last Review Meeting in June. <\/p><p>Following on from a report by an Expert Panel, the Northern Ireland Executive published its Action Plan on Tackling Paramilitary Activity, Criminality and Organised Crime in July. <\/p><p>On 13 September, I signed an international agreement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to establish the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC).  The IRC will report annually on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.  These reports will inform future Northern Ireland Executive Programme for Government commitments through to 2021. The Government will shortly bring forward legislative proposals before the Oireachtas to establish the IRC in law, with the aim of getting the IRC established and beginning its work as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Following yesterday&rsquo;s review meeting both Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive announced the appointees to the Independent Reporting Commission. These Commissioners bring a wealth of experience and the broad range of skills necessary to allow as holistic an assessment of progress as possible. <\/p><p>The Government has appointed Mr. Tim O&rsquo;Connor a former Secretary General to the President and former senior official of my Department. Mr. O&rsquo;Connor is extremely well qualified to contribute to the work of the IRC and I am delighted that he has accepted this appointment. The other three appointees also bring a wealth of experience to the Commission. They are Mitchell Reiss - former US Special Envoy to Northern Ireland - and Monica McWilliams and John McBurney, both of whom served on the Expert Panel referenced above.  <\/p><p>The NI Executive and the British Government are also proceeding with implementation of their respective commitments under the Fresh Start Agreement. The Executive signed off on the 2016-17 Budget last December and the Welfare Bill implementing the relevant provisions in the Agreement passed into UK law on 25 November 2015. The UK Treasury has also approved the release of monies from the Stormont House Agreement funding to support integrated education. <\/p><p>The institutional reforms provided for under the Fresh Start Agreement have also been implemented, including the reduction in the number of Executive Ministries from 12 to 9 and the option for parties entitled to a place in the Executive to instead designate as part of the formal opposition in the Assembly.  This option was taken up by both the UUP and SDLP following the Assembly election last May. <\/p><p>In June, the Co-Chairs and members of the Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition Commission were appointed by the Northern Ireland Executive and the Commission is now progressing its work, as foreseen in the Stormont House Agreement and reiterated in Fresh Start. <\/p><p>On 6 December, the First and deputy First Minister announced the formation of a civic advisory panel, which was provided for under the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements.  The 6-person panel will consider specific issues relevant to the Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government and engage with civic society stakeholders. Reporting to the Executive, the panel may also propose subjects it wishes to consider.  <\/p><p>With regard to the establishment of a framework for dealing with the legacy of the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement but on which final agreement could not be reached during the Fresh Start Agreement talks, the Government remains committed to the full implementation of these commitments.<\/p><p>I am continuing to engage with the Secretary of State and with the Northern Ireland Executive and other parties in Northern Ireland, to see how we can to find a route to a final agreement on legacy issues. While there remain a number of outstanding issues, there is an urgent need to achieve progress - so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and support broader societal healing and reconciliation. I am therefore working to secure the necessary political agreement to get the legacy bodies established and up and running as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600079#WRM00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":752,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[40925\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600079#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the progress on the establishment of a civic forum in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":753,"content":"<p>On 6 December, the First and deputy First Minister announced the formation of a civic advisory panel, which was provided for under the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements.

In addition the OGP conducted an analysis of the 94 Framework Agreements it has in place which shows that 68% of Framework members are SMEs and 63% of the Frameworks had multiple lots, facilitating SME access.<\/p><p>Ireland's procurement reform programme has been successful in establishing new structures and building momentum but, of course, more needs to be done and the OGP, in line with the Programme for Government Commitments, will continue to refine the model.<\/p><p>Finally, I would point out that while the main driving force behind the establishment of the OGP has been the need to deliver better value and sustainable savings for citizens, great care has been taken to ensure this is achieved in a manner that fully recognises the important role SMEs play in the Irish economy and also taking account of wider societal concerns.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600079#WRM05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Programmes","counter":796,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600079#WRM05400"},{"type":"question","counter":797,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[40942\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600079#WRM05500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the total funding allocated for the INTERREG programme; the breakdown of the funding allocated by the EU and the Irish and British Governments; if all this funding is secure following the referendum on British membership of the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":798,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[40943\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600079#WRM05600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the total funding allocated for the PEACE IV programme; the breakdown of funding allocated by the EU and the Irish and British Governments; if all this funding is secure following the referendum on British membership of the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":799,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 and 285 together.<\/p><p>The PEACE IV and INTERREG IVA Programmes are co-funded by the Irish Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the European Commission through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).  <\/p><p>The breakdown of funding for the two programmes is as follows:<table><tr><th>Programme<\/th><th>Programme Total <\/th><th>Ireland ERDF<\/th><th>UK ERDF<\/th><th>Ireland Match Funding<\/th><th>UK Match Funding<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>INTERREG VA <\/td><td>&euro;282.76<\/td><td>&euro;71.23m<\/td><td>&euro;169.12m<\/td><td>&euro;12.57m<\/td><td>&euro;29.84m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PEACE IV<\/td><td>&euro;269.61<\/td><td>&euro;49.55m<\/td><td>&euro;179.62m<\/td><td>&euro;8.74m<\/td><td>&euro;31.69m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The outcome of the UK Referendum on EU membership obviously has implications for two programmes that are 85% funded by the EU.

These allocations are not annualised to allow greater flexibility over the course of the programming period to the Local Action Groups which manage the programme in each area.  In addition to the &euro;220 million in allocations detailed on the table, a further &euro;30 million in competitive funding is available over the lifetime of the programme for Cooperation projects, Artisan Food projects and Rural Economic Development Zones.

This shortage is repeated worldwide.  A number of developed countries have significant nursing shortage at present, and are in direct competition with Ireland for nurses in the international labour market.  I and my officials recognise the importance of recruiting and retaining nurses within the public health system as does the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has been focused on increasing nursing numbers over the past two years as the budgetary position has improved and is committed to ongoing recruitment of nurses and midwives.  The number of nurses and midwives employed in the public health system stood at 35,693 (WTE's) at the end of October 2016,  an increase of 159 on the end September 2016 figure; 530 more than the end October 2015 figure, and 1,289 more than the end October 2014 figure.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2016 the HSE set up a Project Group  to review nursing workforce planning, recruitment and retention.  The main objectives of this Project Group include identifying current recruitment black spots in a coordinated way and developing measures to incentivise and attract people to these essential posts, identifying potential for agency conversion and identifying employment opportunities for 2017 nurse graduates.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has continuously open recruitment campaigns in place (i.e. no closing date) to ensure that all eligible applicants for nursing posts can apply at any time to work in hospitals throughout the country.  It is running an open recruitment event from 28 to 30 December in Dr Steevens&rsquo; Hospital for nurses and midwives from all disciplines who are interested in working in the Irish Public Health Service.  Attendees can apply and interview for jobs on the day and get information on Nursing and Midwifery Board (NMBI) registration and Garda vetting requirements.  This will be followed by a series of careers events for nurses throughout 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Retention of the nursing staff employed by the HSE also needs to be addressed and this is recognised.  The HSE are in the process of analysing the data from exit interviews from nursing and midwifery disciplines to identify trends.  In addition to this the HSE will survey new starters to identify areas of improvement in orientation.  Providing a full induction can ease transition when taking up a new post and enable the new nurse\/midwife to get up to speed with the work environment, thereby supporting retention in the long run.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600082#WRP03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Positive Ageing Strategy Implementation","counter":960,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600082#WRP03100"},{"type":"question","counter":961,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[40540\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600082#WRP03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he will publish his implementation proposals on the national positive ageing strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":962,"content":"<p>New arrangements for the implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy (NPAS) are currently being formulated by my Department.

Structures will be implemented for engagement between relevant Government Departments and State Agencies and relevant stakeholders on how the Strategy&rsquo;s principles are being applied.  The revised arrangements were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy on 27 October 2016.  These new arrangements will now be communicated to stakeholders and arrangements made to commence implementation. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the NPAS implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative has been established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies to measure the impact of the Strategy and establish an ongoing system for measuring and reporting on Positive Ageing.  The Initiative aims to monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the goals and objectives of the NPAS.  This will be done primarily through the development of positive ageing indicators to be published every two years.  The Initiative is intended to provide evidence of the factors contributing to healthy ageing, including at local level and ultimately inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland.

All employees including medical staff are required to disclose and report incidents in line with the HSE's Safety Incident Management Policy.  Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making systems safer.  Open Disclosure is defined as 'an open consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event'.<\/p>  <p>  In  November 2015 the Government gave its approval to the drafting of provisions to support open disclosure of patient safety incidents.  This will be included in the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill which is due to be published before the end of the year.  Provisions to support open disclosure are to be included at Committee Stage and I have asked my officials to keep in close contact with the Department of Justice and Equality on this matter.  The legislation is part of a broader package of reforms aimed at improving the experience of those who are affected by adverse events.<\/p>  <p>  The background to the proposed legislation lies in the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance which recommended that legislation be enacted to provide legal protection\/privilege for open disclosure of adverse events to patients.  The provisions are therefore designed to give legal protection\/privilege for the information and apology made to a patient when made in line with the legislation.  The apology cannot be interpreted as an admission of liability and cannot be used in litigation against the provider.  This approach is intended to create a positive voluntary climate for open disclosure and will support the National Policy on Open Disclosure which was developed jointly by the HSE and the State Claims Agency in November 2013.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation builds on the joint development by the HSE and State Claims Agency of the National Policy on Open Disclosure (2013).  The HSE is progressing the implementation of the Policy across all health and social care services.  We all know that when error or harm is experienced by a patient, the trust and confidence of that patient and their family are compromised.  That is why honest, open disclosure and communication, which demonstrate empathy and sensitivity, are so essential.  The intent of this legislation is to provide certain legal protections for healthcare staff for open disclosure.  This will give further support to those staff in their communications with patients and family members if an adverse event occurs.  The Ethical Code of Practice set out by the Medical Council also makes clear the responsibilities of doctors in relation to open disclosure.<\/p>  <p>  The open disclosure provisions form part of a number of initiatives to improve the management of patient safety incidents.  HIQA and the Mental Health Commission are at an advanced stage of development of Standards on the Conduct of Reviews of Patient Safety Incidents which expand on the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare.  This set of standards along with the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events provided for in the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill and the provisions intended for open disclosure will provide a comprehensive patient-centred approach to preventing, managing and learning from incidents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600082#WRP06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Access","counter":998,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600083#WRQ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":999,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[40605\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600083#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the review of the use of county boundaries for access to health and social services.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1000,"content":"<p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commitment states the following: \"The use of county boundaries for access to health and social services will be reviewed independently, to ensure that the most efficient and cost effective service is provided to those who need it\".<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, I do not intend to pursue further structural reforms while the work of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare is ongoing.

Origin Green is a strategic priority in Food Wise 2025, the ten year strategy for the agri-food industry which includes a strong commitment to measure and monitor the sustainability credentials of the sector.  As part of the implementation of Food Wise, an Environmental Sustainability Committee has been established.  The implementation process will include evaluation and assessment of the delivery of sustainability and mitigation actions.<\/p>  <p>  We will continue to pursue our ambition to move towards carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600086#WRT00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":1194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600086#WRT01000"},{"type":"question","counter":1195,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[40490\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600086#WRT01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to ban wild animal circuses here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1196,"content":"<p>The conditions under which circus animals are kept and managed come under the scope of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which contains rules relating to the welfare of all animals and requires a person having an animal under his or her control to safeguard and not endanger the health and welfare of the animal. \u00a0My Department continues to engage with stakeholders, including circus groups, animal welfare organisations, in relation to the welfare of wild animals in circuses.

The allowable loss is the capital loss equivalent to the amount incurred by the person when the entitlement was acquired.  Where a claim for relief for an allowable loss is made, the amount of the loss can only be set off against other chargeable gains made by the farmer in that year or in any subsequent year.

Furthermore, there is no time limit within which the loss may be carried forward and set off against future chargeable gains.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the taxation question, it should also be noted that farmers who were eligible to receive a direct payment greater than &euro;100 in 2013 (e.g. under the SPS Scheme) and who submitted a valid Basic Payment Scheme application in 2015, were eligible to receive an automatic allocation of entitlements under the 2015 Basic Payment Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600086#WRT04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":1233,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600086#WRT04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1234,"qnumday":436,"qnumall":"[40674\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600086#WRT05000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total use his Department has made of the Government jet since coming into office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":1235,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[40691\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600086#WRT05100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total use his Department has made of the Government jet per annum from March 2011 to February 2016, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1236,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 436 and 437 together.<\/p><p>The information sought by the Deputy is publicly accessible on the website of the Department of Defence at www.defence.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600086#WRT05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Appointments to State Boards","counter":1237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600086#WRT05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1238,"qnumday":438,"qnumall":"[40720\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600086#WRT05400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the gender balances on each of the State boards under his remit.","asker":"1335","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1239,"content":"<p>There are twelve State Bodies under the aegis of my Department.<\/p><p>The information sought by the Deputy is outlined in the table below. <\/p><p>I am personally committed to achieving the Government target of 40% gender balance on the Boards of State Bodies.

The agreed text refers in particular to the need to tackle unfair trading practices.  Council took note of the fact that a regulatory approach at EU level could complement existing voluntary initiatives, and called on the Commission to undertake an impact assessment with a view to possibly proposing an EU legislative framework.<\/p>  <p>  In broad terms I welcome the provisions in the draft conclusions. The Presidency has reflected Member States&rsquo; concerns in relation to tackling unfair trading practices, where the need for an EU legislative framework proved to be one of the more contentious items during the discussions.  I welcome the call in the Conclusions for the Commission to provide legal clarity in relation to exemptions from competition law for producer organisations and co-operatives, and note the inclusion of references to the development of futures markets, which is something that is being actively pursued in Ireland.  I look forward to the Commission now acting on these Conclusions in the context of its future efforts to strengthen the position of the farmer in the food supply chain.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key elements in protecting the producer&rsquo;s position in the food supply chain is providing a means by which primary producers can strengthen their position when negotiating the sale of their produce.  The European Union (Beef Producer Organisations) Regulations 2016 S.I. No 49 of 2016 implement Commission Regulation No. 1308\/2013, which provides the basis for the recognition of producer organisations in the beef sector. The Regulation allows inter alia primary producers to collectively negotiate contracts for the supply of cattle for slaughter. In order to assist groups of primary producers who wish to become recognised Producer Organisations an application to the European Commission as part of the second amendment to Ireland&rsquo;s RDP has been submitted, which provides for the funding of start-up activities for Producer Organisations in the Beef Sector.  Funding will be provided for prospective POs to engage a facilitator to help with recruitment and start-up activities. Facilitators might be advisors, business planners, legal advisors, accountants etc. Advisors will fall into one of two categories; giving advice on setup of the PO&rsquo;s statues, fulfilling Department requirements etc, or advice on business planning and membership recruitment. Payment for advice in each of these areas will be capped at &euro;1,500 in accordance with the provisions of the RDP regulation. However, the PO is free to engage further advice at their own cost. Total expenditure will be capped at &euro;300,000.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected to have approval of Ireland&rsquo;s second amendment to the RDP in early 2017 and once this is received, funding will be made available to recognised Producer Organisations in the beef sector and arrangements for applications for recognition of Producer Organisations will follow.<\/p>  <p>  At major wholesale and retail level, the Consumer Protection Act 2007 (Grocery Goods Undertakings) Regulations \u00a02016 which were signed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, entered into force on 30 April 2016.  The Regulations are enforced by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). Since that date, all major retailers and wholesalers have nominated liaison persons for the purposes of the Regulations. The CCPC has engaged with key stakeholders and has held both bilaterals and a seminar with the main retailers and wholesalers \u00a0to raise awareness of the requirements of the Regulations. Annual compliance reports for the period 30 April - 31 December 2016 have to be submitted to the CCPC by the relevant retailers and wholesalers by 31 March 2017.

The regulation also provides that priority under the National Reserve is given to &lsquo;young farmers&rsquo; and to &lsquo;new entrants to farming&rsquo;. A new entrant is defined as a farmer who commenced their agricultural activity during the previous two years.

Preliminary analysis carried out by my Department shows there are some 3,900 farmers in this category.  An estimation of the cost of increasing the value of existing entitlements to the National Average for these 3,900 farmers stands at over &euro;12 million.<\/p>  <p>  There was no National Reserve in 2016 as all available funding had been utilised under the 2015 scheme.  In order to provide for a National Reserve in 2017 funding is required to replenish the Reserve.  EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the National Reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by clawback derived following the sale of entitlements without land. It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources in 2017 will be very limited.

The Plan targets a 30% increase in production derived from onshore close containment\u00a0recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS).  Considerable international developmental effort is being put into land based RAS systems.  A number of technological challenges need to be overcome to make RAS economically viable.  The National Strategic Plan identified the need for additional applied research and development to improve the performance of RAS in terms of reduced water usage, more effective treatment of return water in terms of key enrichment parameters, reduction of energy usage in water pumping and treatment, improvement of system reliability to avoid stock losses and animal welfare and disease management issues.<\/p>  <p>  BIM funded a 2015 study by the Irish Salmon Growers Association &lsquo;Potential for Land Based Salmon Growout in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) in Ireland&rsquo;.  The report describes in detail all technical aspects of RAS production and system design and operations. It also covers important biological aspects of land based salmon production. The Report states that its main aim is to assess the viability of land based salmon production in RAS under Irish conditions. This includes detailed information of capital expenditure and operational costs as well as the market situation for salmon. The report concludes that the capital cost of setting up a large scale RAS unit is very high and that there are still technical difficulties to be overcome to achieve reliability in land based facilities.<\/p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme, a new Aquaculture &lsquo;Knowledge Gateway Scheme&rsquo;\u00a0was launched in 2016.

My primary aim from the outset was to achieve an outcome that protected the overall interests of the Irish fishing industry while respecting the most up-to-date scientific advice for stocks of critical importance to our fleets. I am pleased that we have secured a good deal for Irish fishermen at the EU Fisheries Council that will support our fishing industry over the coming year and which is sustainable in terms of the fish stocks on which we are dependant.<\/p>  <p>  In order to inform negotiations at the December Fisheries Council, I had an assessment of the impacts of the Commission proposal for Total Allowable Catches and quotas for 2017 undertaken.  To facilitate and inform these deliberations, an open consultation process was put in place, whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In the run up to Council I had separate bilateral meetings with my French and Northern Ireland counterparts as the key players concerning stocks of interest to the Irish fleets. There were also meetings at official level with France, UK, Netherlands, Belgium and Spain in advance of December Council.  In particular, I worked closely with Michelle McIlveen of Northern Ireland and we submitted a joint proposal concerning our most important demersal fishery, prawns.  This joint paper was, I believe, instrumental in overturning the original commission proposal and producing a 9% increase in this very valuable stock.<\/p>  <p>  At the Council itself I had a series of meetings with a range of relevant Minsters and, of course, Commissioner Vella and the Slovakian Presidency.

I am focused on working with the industry to meet these difficulties in the months and years ahead.\u00a0 I have also established in my own Department a dedicated unit to consider the direct impact of Brexit on our industry.  Although it is still a serious situation, there has been a modest reversal in the decreasing Sterling exchange rate in the last two weeks, with Sterling now holding at around 84p to the Euro.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 underpins my Department&rsquo;s efforts through strategic investment in key areas, such as in its agencies and in the agrifood sector. As part of Budget 2017 I have secured an additional &euro;700,000 in funding for capital investments in the Commercial Horticulture sector.\u00a0 This will increase the budget for this scheme to &euro;5 million in 2017.  In addition, the Horticulture sector will have access to the &euro;150 million low interest cash flow support loan fund announced in Budget 2017, providing access to highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000, at an interest rate of 2.95%. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, along with the various State agencies, in particular Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland, is working closely with the industry to provide the necessary support and assistance. \u00a0Bord Bia is actively supporting the sector in the areas of Market Intelligence, UK consumer research and Quality Assurance.  They recently held a currency and negotiation workshop specifically targeted at the sector which I understand was very well received by the mushroom industry.\u00a0\u00a0In recent weeks, the CEO of Bord Bia and I have held a series of meetings with senior executives from the UK retailers, to highlight the obstacles that our producers are facing.  I understand that in recent weeks, representatives of mushroom growers have met with a more positive reaction from their UK Multiple customers, to their need for fair and reasonable returns for their produce from the marketplace.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Funding for a pilot programme on LEAN processes has been provided through\u00a0Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland.  The programme is commencing with 6 mushroom growers, to assess efficiency across all aspects of the business, including supply chain, innovation, marketing and logistics.  It is hoped that a template could be developed through this programme that will enable growers to optimise their production costs further. <\/p>  <p>  I would also draw attention to support being provided to the industry through National and EU Schemes. <\/p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007 &ndash; 2013 my Department implemented the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector.\u00a0 During this period my Department paid out over &euro;4 million in grant payments to mushroom growers which supported &euro;10.1 million in investment.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  To ensure ongoing support for the sector, my Department extended, under EU sanction, the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector to run until 31 December 2019.  In 2014 and 2015 a total of &euro;1.64 million in grant aid was paid to mushroom growers.\u00a0 The grant aid paid supported some &euro;4.1 million in investment by these growers. <\/p>  <p>  Under the 2016 Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector, my Department issued approvals in the amount of &euro;1.33 million in aid to growers in the mushroom sector, supporting &euro;3.3 million in proposed investment.  I have also\u00a0 provided a commitment to ensure that payments under this scheme are made as early as possible, so as to try to alleviate any financial pressure that growers are currently facing.<\/p>  <p>  In October, I arranged the payment of just under &euro;1.57 million to one of our mushroom producer organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600088#WRV00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Exports to Iran","counter":1321,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600088#WRV00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1322,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[40939\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600088#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the progress on the opening of the market for beef and sheep meat to Iran; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1323,"content":"<p>The Iranian market is open for the importation of beef and sheepmeat from Ireland as\u00a0we have agreed veterinary health certificates with Iran for both commodities.

A total of 24 landowners who classified themselves as non-farmers planted forests in Co Cavan so far during 2016; it&rsquo;s worth noting that 17 of these had addresses in Co. Cavan itself.  So far in 2016 there were no private institutional investors approved for payment under the afforestation scheme in the county.\u00a0 The total area planted by non farmers represented 53% of all new planting during the year which is above the national average. \u00a0It is difficult to determine however if the 24 non-farmer individuals already owned the land or if they had bought the land specifically to plant. It is worth noting that farmers are entitled to sell their land to the highest bidder and if forestry is improving the price that farmers can receive for their land then these landowners stand to benefit.<\/p>  <p>  According to the CSO Census of Agriculture 2010, the average farm size in Co Cavan is 26.4 hectares while the average forest established by non-farmers in Co Cavan since the launch of the new forestry programme is just 7.2 hectares.  This suggests that in situations where non-farmers are buying land for forestry they are not buying entire farms for this purpose.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016 alone, forestry payments worth over &euro;2.6m were paid by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to just under 430 landowners with Cavan addresses.

According to the latest national forest inventory total forest cover in the county is just 8.7% which is well below the national average which stands at 10.5%.

The scheme seeks to demonstrate the positive effects that making their homes warmer and more energy efficient can have on the health and wellbeing of people in energy poverty who are living with a chronic respiratory condition.<\/p><p>As it is a pilot scheme, eligibility is limited.  The operational area for the scheme was selected as Community Health Area (CHO) 7, following consultation with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  This CHO encompasses Kildare\/West Wicklow, Dublin West, Dublin South City and Dublin South West.  Within CHO 7 the need to build capacity in the local public health and\u00a0SEAI\u00a0teams, and establish communications on the pilot\u00a0with the local community,\u00a0meant that a further localisation was necessary and Dublin 12\u00a0and 24 were selected as the initial operational areas. <\/p><p>Within these areas the scheme was limited to people who:<\/p><p>- are\u00a0aged over 55;<\/p><p>- suffering from\u00a0a chronic respiratory condition;<\/p><p>- living in an owner-occupied or local authority home; &amp;amp;<\/p><p>- a member of the household is in receipt of the Fuel Allowance.<\/p><p>A dedicated HSE delivery team is in place and\u00a0is working with Local Authorities and local health care professionals (from physiotherapists to general practitioners, consultants &amp;amp; public health nurses) to identify participants.  Once referrals are received, the HSE team visits each eligible participant individually to guide them through the process.  Each participant in the pilot scheme is eligible for an extensive energy efficiency upgrade.  In each case the actual upgrade provided depends on an SEAI assessment of the home but is intended to make it much easier for the participant to heat their home adequately.  The value of these upgrades could be\u00a0up to\u00a0&euro;20k per home depending on the works to be carried out. <\/p><p>To date the HSE have had 339 applicants who meet the eligibility criteria across Dublin 12 (135) and 24 (204).  These applicants are at various stages of their application and referral process.  To date, 147 have already had their homes assessed by SEAI and upgrade works are in various stages of delivery.  Chronic respiratory conditions the HSE are seeing in the referrals include COPD, asthma, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis.  These conditions can all benefit from improved indoor air temperature and air quality.<\/p><p>With the additional resources I have made available to the scheme in 2017, the steering committee for the scheme, made up of representatives from my Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), the Department of Health and the HSE, determined that the area covered by the scheme could be expanded to cover Dublin 8, 10 and 22 and that eligibility could be expanded to cover families with young children.

I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. <\/p><p>During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.

ComReg monitors compliance in this regard by means of biannual drive tests and customers can\u00a0refer any complaints to ComReg who will investigate the service provider&rsquo;s compliance with its contractual obligations. <\/p>  <p>  Mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  The rate of demand for data services has however increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. <\/p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government, a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July, I established the Taskforce, together with Minister Humphreys, which aims to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.  The Terms of Reference of the Taskforce state that it will identify and recommend practical actions that can be taken to improve mobile reception and broadband access.  The Taskforce has already met approximately twenty times, with a number of helpful initiatives emerging in the areas of planning, local authority engagement, and consumer information and engagement. <\/p>  <p>  The Taskforce involves Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecoms operators.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008 -2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published\u00a0projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6 - 11% below 2005 levels, depending on whether additional policies or measures beyond those already in place by the end of 2014 are implemented.  On a cumulative basis over the period 2013 - 2020, Ireland is projected to\u00a0have a deficit of between 3 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2eq).  According to the latest\u00a0inventory published by the EPA in November 2016, GHG emissions for 2015 are estimated to be 59.84 MtCO2eq.  This is 3.7% higher than emissions in 2014.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As I indicated in both Houses of the Oireachtas last week, the\u00a0shortfall to 2020 projected by the EPA reflects our constrained investment capacity over the decade between 2008 and 2019 due to the economic crisis, including the impact of the troika programme and the EU fiscal governance requirements.  It now represents a significant challenge to be addressed.

Given that ComReg is independent in its statutory functions I have no role in this matter.<\/p>  <p>  I understand however, that licences issued by ComReg impose terms and conditions on mobile network operators &ndash; including minimum population coverage obligations.  ComReg monitors compliance in this regard by means of biannual drive tests and customers can\u00a0refer any complaints to ComReg who will investigate the service provider&rsquo;s compliance with its contractual obligations.  According to ComReg all licensees have exceeded their obligations under their respective licences to date. \u00a0However as mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets, the capacity of the network and proximity to mobile telephone antennas.<\/p>  <p>  There are three main infrastructure mobile providers\u00a0 - Vodafone, Eir Group (Meteor) and 3 Group (3).  In addition other operators provide services hosted on these networks including Tesco Mobile and Lycamobile.  Mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.  At lease one operator has\u00a0over 90% 4G population coverage in every county.  The rate of demand for data services has however increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, where mobile networks are not always delivering the services people expect.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government, a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July, I established the Taskforce, together with Minister Humphreys, which aims to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.  The Terms of Reference of the Taskforce state that it will identify and recommend practical actions that can be taken to improve mobile reception and broadband access.  The Taskforce has already met approximately twenty times, with a number of helpful initiatives emerging in the areas of planning, local authority engagement, and consumer information and engagement. <\/p>  <p>  The Taskforce involves Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecoms operators.  The\u00a0report of the taskforce and accompanying action plan will be concluded this month\u00a0and\u00a0will set out specific\u00a0timelines for the delivery of the recommendations and actions, including a key role for Local Authorities in supporting the rollout of telecoms infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys has also established two regional action groups to work with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies in helping accelerate the rollout of broadband and mobile services at local level. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band.  This will\u00a0provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. <\/p>  <p>  In my Department's estimates for 2017 I have secured an &euro;8m provision for RT&Eacute; to allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate\u00a0this spectrum, to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland, and particularly in rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband\u00a0services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment have not been fully demonstrated. <\/p>  <p>  The procurement process is underway and the three bidders in the process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution for rural Ireland.

Works on those roads are funded from the Authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  The Capital Plan published in September 2015 outlined proposed transport investment priorities to 2022.  The transport element of the plan was framed by the conclusions reached in my Department's Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  This report highlighted the importance of maintenance and renewal of transport infrastructure together with targeted investments to address particular bottlenecks and critical safety issues.  The Capital Plan provides &euro;6 billion for investment in the roads network in the period to 2022, with &euro;4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and &euro;1.6 billion for new projects.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As Minister I have to work within the annual allocations set out in the Plan and in this context the Capital Plan provides for a gradual build up in capital funding\u00a0towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works.  While there will be a modest increase in funding for regional and local roads in 2017, it will take some years\u00a0yet under the Capital Plan to restore \"steady state\" funding levels for land transport.  The primary focus\u00a0will\u00a0have to continue to be on the maintenance and renewal of public roads.  I do, however, expect that\u00a0local authorities will continue to be able to use a proportion of their Discretionary\u00a0Grant for the local improvement scheme in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The regional and local road grant\u00a0allocations for next year have yet to be decided but I expect to announce the details early next year.  Given funding constraints, my objective has to be to allocate funding to local authorities on as equitable basis as possible taking into account the\u00a0road lengths in each local authority's area of responsibility.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to\u00a0reiterate that State grants are intended to supplement local authorities' own resources.  In this context, I am emphasising to\u00a0Councils that the commitment of local authorities to contribute significantly from their own resources, towards the cost of improving and maintaining the regional and local roads network is essential.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the possibility of additional funding within the Plan period, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform\u00a0indicated\u00a0in his budget speech that\u00a0he is bringing forward the Capital Plan review. \u00a0 There is a strong case for additional funding for the transport sector\u00a0which I will make robustly.

On foot of 2015 export figures, there is immediate opportunity and potential for strengthening our foothold in existing established markets and for diversified export growth.  In 2015, sales to North American grew by 27%, Northern Europe by 8% and Asia-PAC by 11%. The focus on the Americas and Asian markets as is set out in the &lsquo;Programme for a Partnership Government&rsquo; and where Enterprise Ireland and its client companies see strategic opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Extra staff will be placed in EI&rsquo;s overseas offices with sectoral knowledge and expertise such as in engineering, food, life sciences and construction. This will drive export growth to other international markets where there are known opportunities and reduce reliance on the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the UK will continue to be a priority market due to Ireland&rsquo;s size, geographic proximity and cultural ties. In the UK market, EI is particularly working with companies who are most exposed in areas such as engineering, food, construction and timber. EI will focus on increasing international sales with existing buyers while also supporting companies to develop new strategic relationships and avail of emerging opportunities, particularly in the engineering and construction sectors. <\/p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s Irish based team will be enhanced with additional staff to provide various targeted supports and programmes to assist companies before they enter the market. Clients who are more prepared before entering the market and engage with in-market Enterprise Ireland teams, have a greater chance of sustained export success. Training and supports in terms of management capability, leadership, marketing\/sales skills, innovation and R&amp;D will help companies to build market share and create new market opportunities. EI will also deliver a suite of supports that help clients reduce supply-chain costs and drive efficiencies and cost reductions as a means of improving operating margins, thereby increasing competitiveness,.<\/p>  <p>  Other key elements of the 2017 drive for expanding our global export footprint include an enhanced programme of trade and investment missions and other trade promotional events.  These are all at the planning stage at the moment, but will cover various sector specific markets in the USA, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Spain, China, Australia, France, Germany, Nordics, to name but a few. There are also numerous Market Study Visits planned for 2017. These visits will enable client companies to experience the dynamics of a market, and provide more information to help with the decision on whether to progress to that market.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, EI will also rollout the &lsquo;Global Ambition Campaign&rsquo; which is a communications campaign to promote Irish companies and their products and services to international buyers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600090#WRXX02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Ireland Funding","counter":1478,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600090#WRXX02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1479,"qnumday":522,"qnumall":"[40798\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600090#WRXX02600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the total capital expenditure expended in 2016 and allocated in 2017 on Enterprise Ireland in tabular form, in view of the programme for Government commitment in this area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Gift vouchers that are not financial services products are covered also by the provisions of the European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 (S.I.

The issuer of a gift card which comes within the definition of electronic money must, at the request of the electronic money holder, redeem the monetary value of the electronic money at par value at any time.

In addition to Parts dealing with the consolidation and updating of the law on the supply of goods, digital content and services and on unfair contract terms, the draft Scheme contains a number of provisions for the regulation of gift vouchers, including a proposed ban on expiry dates in contracts for the supply of gift vouchers.  The responses to the gift card provisions raised a substantial number of issues, including concerns expressed by businesses about the impact of a complete prohibition on expiry dates and the need for  clarity and certainty in respect of the regulation of gift cards that come within the scope of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011.  While the present proposal is for a ban on expiry dates for gift cards that do not come within the scope of the Electronic Money Regulations, I am willing to listen to other views and possible approaches, such as a requirement that gift cards remain valid for a set period such as five years.<\/p>  <p>  While I am anxious to progress the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill, I have to take account of current European Union legislative proposals for Directives on consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and consumer contracts for the online and other distance sale of goods.  These proposals which were announced in May 2015 and published in December 2015 overlap very substantially with two of the main parts of the draft Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill.  Discussions on the digital content proposal at working party level have proceeded rapidly with a first reading of the proposal completed by April 2016 and agreement reached at the June Justice and Home Affairs Council on the basic principles of the proposal and on political guidelines for future work on it.  The principles and guidelines endorsed by the Council provided the basis for a revised text of the proposal prepared by the Dutch and Slovak Presidencies.  Working Party discussions over 12 meeting days during the Slovak Presidency have examined the revised text in detail.   In the view of the Presidency, these discussions made good progress and provided the basis for a policy debate on a number of aspects of the proposal at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 8-9 December.   <\/p>  <p>  The incoming Maltese Presidency has indicated that it aims to achieve agreement on a general approach to the digital content proposal in the first half of 2017.  In this situation, I have to consider the advisability of bringing forward a legislative proposal to the Oireachtas when a directly related and fully harmonised legislative proposal may be at an advanced stage of the European Union legislative process.  The wisdom of introducing legislation in the Oireachtas in 2017 if large parts of that legislation would have to be repealed or substantially amended within a relatively short space of time is obviously open to question . I will continue to review the progress of the two European Union proposals in the new year with a view to deciding the best course of action to take with regard to the Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill.      <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600090#WRXX03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Staff Data","counter":1493,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600090#WRXX03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1494,"qnumday":527,"qnumall":"[40660\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600090#WRXX03600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of vacancies in each functional area of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland; the percentage that vacancy rate represents of the staffing allocation for that function in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1495,"content":"<p>The number of vacancies in each functional area of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and the percentage that these vacancies represent with regard to the staffing allocation in that function, are outlined in Table 1 and Table 2 below.The recruitment process is ongoing to fill the current vacancies outlined in the tables thus enabling Enterprise Ireland and the IDA to bring new skills and expertise into the agencies to meet client needs. <\/p><p>In the case of EI, the agency has brought about a major reorganisation in recent years leading to major inflows and outflows of personnel from the various functional areas.

The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle long-term unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery through effective policies.  In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity.  I am working closely with the Minister for Social Protection to ensure we can provide every opportunity for those unemployed to secure a job.<\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, long term unemployment continues to fall.  The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 4.4% in Q2 2016.  At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 51.1% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012.  The number of long term unemployed in Q2 2016 was 95,900; this compares to 204,300 in Q1 2012.  Under the Programme for Government commitment to move 50,000 long-term unemployed at the start of 2016 into employment by the end of 2020, annual targets have been set.  Indications are that the 2016 target will be exceeded by year end.  <\/p>  <p>  A range of measures were introduced under previous Pathways to Work strategies for long-term unemployed people.  This included a structured process of engagement with long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact); wage subsidies in JobsPlus; the roll-out of a payment-by-results contracted employment services in JobPath, to provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers; and reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on a range of Further Education and Training (FET) and public employment programmes. <\/p>  <p>  A core focus of Pathways to Work 2016-2020 is on consolidating and improving the quality and consistency of reforms undertaken in previous strategies, with continued prioritisation of those long-term unemployed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600091#WRY01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1516,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600091#WRY01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1517,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[40842\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600091#WRY01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the total amount allocated in 2017 for export-led jobs growth across Ireland&rsquo;s regions in view of the programme for Government commitment of &euro;500 million to accelerate export led jobs growth across Ireland&rsquo;s regions over 2017-2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"question","counter":1518,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[40843\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600091#WRY01900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the total amount allocated in 2017 to fulfil the programme for Government commitment of an extra &euro;300 million in capital funding between Enterprise Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta over 2017-2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"question","counter":1519,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[40845\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600091#WRY02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the total amount allocated in 2017 to fulfil the programme for Government commitment of an extra &euro;200 million to the IDA over 2017-2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1520,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 535 to 537, inclusive, together. <\/p><p>Since my appointment as Minister in May of this year I have secured an additional &euro;100 million in funding for my Department's Vote for use in 2016 and 2017.

Within that context, and informed by its current three year Statement of Strategy 2016-2018, the Authority prioritises initiatives in those areas where there is greatest risk and the greatest potential to maximise its efforts to achieve a continued downward trend in workplace deaths, accidents, injuries and ill health, and to increase the safe use of chemicals.<\/p><p>The Authority has invested significant resources in recent years in enabling enterprises to achieve compliance in the simplest, most cost-effective manner.  The Authority&rsquo;s BeSMART.ie risk assessment and management tool for small enterprises has been developed and expanded for the construction and agri-business sectors.  The Authority also ran safety awareness campaigns relating to farming, construction, vehicle safety and fishing safety, along with promoting the BeSMART safety management tool to small businesses.<\/p><p>The Authority uses its non-pay allocation to cover a range of administrative ICT, accommodation, and other running costs, in addition to providing funding for information and awareness activities, including safety initiatives.  Consequently, the funding provision for particular programmes, including safety initiatives (see Table 1), fluctuates from year to year as the Authority decides how to prioritise its non-pay funding in order to implement its programme of work. <\/p><p>In 2015 the Authority&rsquo;s exchequer Grant was increased by &euro;250,000 during the course of the year (following re-allocations made in light of the Department&rsquo;s 2015 mid-year expenditure review) to facilitate special safety initiatives aimed at Agriculture and Construction.<\/p><p>In the current year the Non Pay budget decided by the Authority included a reduction in the provision for &quot;safety initiatives&quot; in 2016 in order to address other priorities in its programme of work for this year.  These included developments affecting office accommodation, a necessary business process review arising from the integration of the Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB) and the replacement of the current manual system used in the INAB accreditation process, as part of the development of a new Client Management System (a commitment in the Action Plan for Jobs, 2016). <\/p><p>In October 2016, I was happy to support the Authority&rsquo;s application to my Department for additional supplementary support (&euro;340,000) in the context of the Department&rsquo;s mid-year expenditure review and these additional funds were used exclusively for safety initiatives.  I also understand that in framing its budget for 2017 the Authority expects to be in a position to allocate some additional funding to safety initiatives resulting from some operational efficiencies achieved during 2016.<\/p><p><b>Table 1<\/b><\/p><p><b>Amount of money spent on safety initiatives, 2011 to 2016<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Estimated Spend on Safety Initiatives<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>&euro;1.567m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>&euro;1.907m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>&euro;1.595m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>&euro;1.154m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>&euro;1.776m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>&euro;1.297 m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Health and Safety Authority Inspectors carry out inspections across all work sectors and work activities that come under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (the 2005 Act) and the Chemicals Act 2008.

Other inspections can be part of a particular safety awareness campaign e.g. on manual handling, on slips, trips or falls or on compliance with the REACH Regulation.  The Authority produces a Programme of Work each year setting out its plan for all areas of its work, including inspection targets. <\/p><p>The number of workplace inspections carried out from 2011 to 2016 (13\/12\/2016) is set out in the following table. <\/p><p><b>Table 2 <\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Number of workplace inspections and investigations <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>15,340<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>13,835<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>12,244<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>10,719<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>10,880<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016 at 13 December <\/td><td>10,049<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>While the falling inspection rates between 2011 and 2014 in Table 2 can be attributed to the loss of inspection staff, the programme of inspections continues to be targeted at the areas of highest risk.

It is expected that 92% of this target will be achieved with an estimated 10,250 inspections and investigations being completed by the end of the year. <\/p><p>A range of administrative and organisational factors impacted on the Authority&rsquo;s ability to meet its 2016 target.  These included the retirement and resignation of inspectorate staff, and increasing demands in areas such as Freedom of Information.  Following the end of the moratorium on public service recruitment, my Department has given the Authority sanction to replace the number of inspection staff who have left the Authority in 2016.  These posts are currently in the process of being filled and I expect the additional inspectors to be recruited by the Authority early in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600091#WRY02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Site Visits","counter":1524,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600091#WRY02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1525,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[40854\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600091#WRY02600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the total number of IDA Ireland sponsored visits in each county in each respective month of 2016, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1526,"content":"<p>IDA Ireland maintains statistics of site visits by potential investors only on a quarterly basis.

These additional funds have facilitated a number of farm safety initiatives to be undertaken this year.  The initial internal allocation made by the Board of the Authority was accordingly boosted by a further &euro;140,000 specifically allocated to farm safety initiatives.  This has brought the total funding available to the Authority for farm safety initiatives in 2016 to &euro;384,000.  I do not have information at this stage on any decisions made by that Authority with regard to its discretionary spending on farm safety initiatives in 2017.  <\/p><p><b>Farm inspections and investigations 2011 &ndash; 2016<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Number of farm Inspections and Investigations<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>3,058<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>3,136<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>2,784<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>2,644<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>3,056<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016 at 11 December<\/td><td>2,048<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Visits to farms by inspectors include routine unannounced inspections to monitor compliance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 and with other health and safety regulations and to investigate fatal and serious farm accidents.  Typically in any one year there can be between 60 &ndash; 90 investigations on farms with the rest being unannounced inspections.  Each year the HSA carry out a two week intensive farm inspection campaign in April and this year over 500 inspections were carried out during that period.  Since 2014 the HSA has redirected some of its inspection resources to engaging directly with farmers on other accident prevention initiatives.  In 2016 HSA inspectors have participated in over 24 farm safety walks and presentations to farmers, many of which are organised by the farming representative bodies.  This has enabled the HSA to direct its message to over 2,000 farmers this year. <\/p><p>I am very concerned at the high level of farm fatalities since it goes without saying that safety in agriculture is a high priority for the Health and Safety Authority and for the Government.  Since mid-November of this year there have been four people killed on farms, with 19 deaths in total so far this year.  Many fatalities occur when farmers are doing jobs that are not part of their normal working day, e.g. maintenance or adjustment of equipment, maintaining or working on a building.  No other sector is experiencing that level of fatal accidents and it is greatly concerning to me that so many families are losing loved ones due to work activity. <\/p><p>The Health and Safety Authority has sought, in consultation with the Farm Safety Partnership - an advisory committee of the Authority that includes representatives from a wide range of key farming stakeholders - to broaden the type of contact with farmers and to find the most effective means to spread the message of prevention within the farming community.  I was pleased this week to have to take part in a Farm Walk near Kilrush in County Clare involving local farmers along with the HSA and Teagas.  This is one of the farm safety initiatives developed by the Farm Safety Partnership and it provides opportunity for farmers to see first-hand the dangers and learn how to minimise the risks to themselves and their families. <\/p><p>The Authority&rsquo;s Programme of Work for 2016 continues the emphasis on engagement with farmers through knowledge sharing groups.  Priority tasks for the current year include:<\/p><p>- implementation of Year 1 of the Farm Safety Partnership Action Plan, 2016 to 2018,<\/p><p>- continuing awareness campaigns through the media, events and advertising targeted at agricultural sector,<\/p><p>- promotion of good health for farmers,<\/p><p>- publication of information sheets,<\/p><p>- reviewing and updating the Code of Practice on farm safety<\/p><p>- developing an e-learning tool on tractor and machinery safety,<\/p><p>- focusing on child safety on farms through programmes at primary and post-primary school level,<\/p><p>- increasing awareness of farm safety throughout the sector.<\/p><p>- ESRI research on farm safety.<\/p><p>I commend the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association and the Farm Safety Partnership on their support for the 2016 Farm Safety Week 4 to 8 July.  This is the fourth annual Farm Safety Week, an initiative launched in 2013 aiming to cut the toll of accidents which continue to give agriculture the poorest record of any occupation in Ireland.  I particularly welcome this joint initiative which brings together the farming organisations from North and South and from the United Kingdom as well as the UK Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive, the Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive for Northern Ireland and the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority, Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600091#WRY04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":1540,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600091#WRY04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1541,"qnumday":545,"qnumall":"[40994\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600091#WRY04200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the urgent need to provide additional job opportunities throughout counties Cavan and Monaghan; the proposals her Department and the State's industrial promotion agencies have to assist in job creation and in the maintenance of existing employment; if she will direct the agencies to implement specific strategies for areas such as counties Cavan and Monaghan which will be impacted adversely by the British decision to leave the European Union; if her attention has further been drawn to the difficulties facing many local small, medium and large enterprises that are heavily reliant on the Northern Ireland and British market, taking into account currency fluctuations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1542,"content":"<p>The North East\/North West (NE\/NW) Action Plan for Jobs is stimulating job creation across the region, including counties Cavan and Monaghan, by facilitating collaborative initiatives between the public and private sector, and through the provision of new competitive funds, awarded through Enterprise Ireland to support the regional enterprise projects.<\/p>  <p>  The core objective of the NE\/NW Action Plan is to have a further 28,000 at work in the region by 2020.

The programme is managed by the Centre for Effective Services and Pobal on behalf of the funders.  The aim the programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches in areas of disadvantage in Ireland to improve outcomes for children, in particular children and families living in poverty.  The focus of the work under the ABC Programme covers: Child Health &amp;amp; Development; Children&rsquo;s Learning; Parenting; and Integrated Service Delivery.  <\/p>  <p>  There are 13 sites across Ireland participating in the ABC programme.  Eight of these are based in Dublin: CDI Tallaght; Preparing for Life; Youngballymun; Clondalkin Behavioural Initiative; Better Finglas; Dublin Docklands and East Inner City; Grangegorman and Ballyfermot.  The remaining five sites are located in Cork; Louth; Bray; Limerick and the Midlands. <\/p>  <p>  Prior to the ABC Programme, the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) ran from 2007-2013 and it funded the following three organisations which transitioned into the ABC programme: Youngballymun, Childhood Development Initiative Tallaght, and the Preparing for Life Programme Darndale.<\/p>  <p>  The Centre for Effective Services is responsible for designing and managing the evaluation of the ABC Programme.  It is guided and advised in the planning and implementation of the evaluation by the Expert Advisory Group (EAG). <\/p>  <p>  The three strands to the evaluation are:<\/p>  <p>  1.

Sections 1 to 5 are standard provisions in relation to title, citation, regulations, definitions etc.  Section 28 relates to corporal punishment and removes the common law defence of reasonable chastisement in relation to same.<\/p>  <p>  (ii) Section 18 (Part III) and Sections 20-26 (Part IV)  were commenced on 1 May 2016. Section 18 of the Act is a technical amendment to ensure that the Child and Family Agency is a specified body for purposes of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. Sections 20-26 deal with establishing the Children First Interdepartmental Implementation Group (CFIDG) on a statutory basis and expanding the Group to include all Government Departments.<\/p>  <p>  As the Act imposes obligations on certain individuals working with children and on relevant service providers, I think it is vital that all individuals and sectors are fully prepared and ready to implement the legislation before it is commenced. Therefore, in relation to those provisions of the Act which have not yet been commenced, I have recently signed off on a proposal for phased and structured preparations for implementation which will allow for full commencement of the Act by end December, 2017. I have brought forward this date from end February 2018, as previously stated in my response to PQ 33699-16 of 8 November 2016  .

In this regard, Budget 2017 secured a capital spending allocation of &euro;74 million, representing an increase of &euro;7 million on the 2017 Defence allocation contained in the 2016-21 capital investment programme.  This allocation will facilitate the investment necessary to ensure that the Defence Forces have the equipment and infrastructure to deliver on all their roles as set out in the White Paper.<\/p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me, and the White Paper on Defence published in 2015 recognises that there are several new and or enhanced platforms to be procured. Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered over the period of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning priorities planning process. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of the White Paper, a detailed Capability Development Plan is being developed which is building on the work completed as part of the White Paper process.  This Capability Development Plan will dovetail with the work of identifying and agreeing a new Equipment Development Plan and the required funding requirements for upgrade programmes and for new equipment projects that will be implemented for the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  The Army will continue to retain all-arms conventional military capabilities, and the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.  There will be a focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles and the most cost effective option of upgrading or replacing the current fleet will be pursued.  A small number of armoured logistical and utility vehicles will be procured for force protection. <\/p>  <p>  The Air Corps will see the Cessna fleet replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks. The aircraft specification is currently being prepared and it is expected that the tender competition will be initiated and advertised on the e-tenders website in the near future.  The two CASA 235s Maritime Patrol Aircraft are due for replacement in 2019. The CASAs will be replaced with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft to enhance maritime surveillance and to provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks.<\/p>  <p>  The current Naval Service Ship replacement programme has already seen the replacement of three Naval Service vessels.  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet. An agreement was recently reached for the provision of an additional ship for the Naval Service to be built to the same specifications as the three newest vessels.  Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, the Defence capital envelope for the period 2017-2021 allocated under the Capital Spending Plan is &euro;392m.  The capital funding allocated will play a vital role in ensuring that the priorities identified in the White Paper can be met.  The duration of this capital funding plan is particularly significant in allowing for strategic medium-term planning so critical in the Defence environment which will allow for significant investments in equipment over the coming years<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600092#WRAA03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Missions","counter":1593,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600092#WRAA03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1594,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[40582\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121600092#WRAA03600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the status of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in UNDOF and the UN decision to reoccupy the area of separation; the strategic concerns that exist for Irish deployment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":1595,"content":"<p>The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) was established on 31 May 1974 by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 350 (1974), following the agreed disengagement of the Israeli and Syrian forces in the Golan Heights in May 1974.
