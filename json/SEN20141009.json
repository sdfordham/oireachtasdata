In 2009, the Labour Court held that home help workers were entitled to a gratuity of 4.5 weeks of pay per year of service in lieu of their pension entitlements.  There were two Labour Court recommendations.  In 2011 the Government indicated that it would pay the gratuity in 2012.  I have written to the new Minister for Health on four occasions since he was appointed to his position, but all I have received is a series of acknowledgements.  Home help workers are low-paid workers and many of them are on the minimum wage.  They play a very important role in our health service by helping to ensure that people can stay in their homes.  I do not think anyone would want to treat these workers in this way, but I cannot even get a response on the matter.  If one considers the situation across the country, one could calculate that the bill for paying what is due to them is probably &euro;8 million.  This is a once-off payment.  I understand the Minister will be in the House in a couple of weeks' time to deal with health legislation.  I ask the Deputy Leader to flag with him my intention to raise this issue or, alternatively, to facilitate half an hour before or after the debate if the issue is not appropriate to the legislation.  I have previously raised the issue on the Adjournment, but if the Minister could spare 15 or 30 minutes for a quick debate, we might be able to make progress on it.<\/p><p>I have repeatedly raised the issue of fampridine or Fampyra, the multiple sclerosis drug which since 1 July has not been available to many multiple sclerosis sufferers.

It is welcome news, particularly for the capital, given its serious housing shortage.  We have a duty to look after people who are most in need.  Adequate and affordable housing is a basic need in society.  The EIB has a great record throughout the UK and in the Netherlands in this area, but this is its first time to venture into Ireland.  The programme, which will last from 2014 to 2017, will provide approximately 2,400 housing units and fund the retrofitting of some existing housing stock.  This balance is to be greatly welcomed, particularly for the capital city, with which Senator Darragh O'Brien and all the rest of us will be concerned.  The details of the investment will be developed in a short time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900003#B01000","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1412847000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I have a question for the Deputy Leader in regard to the announcement by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the revision of the model for ministerial appointments to State boards.  As we are all aware, this revision was prompted by the questions raised by Members on both sides of Seanad &Eacute;ireann about the lack of transparency in the past.  According to his announcement, the Minister wants to provide us with a credible, transparent and robust appointments model, and the information will contain a number of things, including terms of appointment, gender balance and other diversity provisions.  In specific regard to the terms of appointments, will the revised model provide for comprehensive information and rationales for the remuneration given to chairs and board members?  We do not have a comprehensive list of how much State board chairpersons and directors are remunerated.  I have a partial list thanks to the research carried out by our great Library and Research Service team over the last couple of weeks, and I happy to offer it to the Minister or his Department.  However, we should have a comprehensive list and, more important, the rationale for any diversity of remuneration on various boards.  For example, the chair of Bord Bia receives &euro;20,520 and the chair of Horse Racing Ireland receives &euro;21,600, while board members receive &euro;12,600.  In the arts sector, the chair of the National Gallery receives &euro;8,978.  All of the board chairpersons of arts bodies receive approximately that amount.  The chair of the Adoption Authority of Ireland receives &euro;63,000.  The Mining Board pays daily fees of &euro;582.97.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority pays remuneration of &euro;20,520 to its chair.  I selected these random examples to demonstrate the degree of diversity that exists.  I am not necessarily saying that board members on other bodies do not have comparable qualifications or provide comparable amounts of time to their boards.<\/p> <p>The biggest surprise in my research is from the Department of Education and Skills, where there is only one board and chair in receipt of remuneration, namely, the HEA at &euro;7,695.  No other chairs or members of State boards in the Department of Education and Skills are remunerated.  We must raise questions with regard to the rationale for that and the importance of people who contribute their time and qualifications to State boards in relation to education.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to debate these issues with us prior to the publication of his guidelines.  We need comprehensive information on remuneration and its rationale.  The Leader must raise with the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues the question of why State boards in the education sector are not remunerated.<\/p><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me a little extra time.

It presents the port area and Dublin Bay, including Bull Island, as an amenity and environmental facility for the citizens.  That harmony between the port company and the citizens is much to be welcomed.

We have had a number of reports this week which have focused on housing generally and social housing in particular.  On Tuesday, the Governor of the Central Bank opened a consultation process on proposals to restrict mortgage lending.  We also had Dublin City Council announce that social housing waiting lists have gone up to 20,000 in its functional area, which is an increase of 3,000.  Yesterday, the ESRI asked the Government to spend an additional &euro;500 million in the budget on social housing while today the Nevin Economic Research Institute requested the Government to spend billions not millions of euro on social housing construction, arguing that it will help the economy to grow.  All of this is welcome.<\/p><p>Housing is in crisis and that can only be resolved by robust construction.  However, even if we had shovel-ready projects and bulldozers in the field, it would take 12 to 18 months to create an appreciable improvement in supply.  In the meantime, we have a serious problem on the ground, particularly in view of the growing needs of those presenting as homeless.  I ask the Leader to put it to Government that in the forthcoming budget we must commit whatever funds are necessary to deal with the problem of homelessness.  Given that so many people on social welfare and low incomes are depending on the rental market in the meantime for their housing, I ask for measures to be put in place to stop exorbitant rent increases taking place.  In particular, I ask the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, to increase rent supplement limits to ensure that families can find and keep rental housing until longer-term issues of housing supply are resolved.<\/p><p>While I am happy that we will soon have a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, when he announces his strategy on social housing, I would also like to see a debate on rental housing.  The reality is that one in five families is living in rental housing and depending on private landlords with little or no security of tenure.

I draw the Government's attention to a development in France where the French postal service, La Poste, has arranged that postmen will not just deliver letters and parcels but will undertake to visit homes, particularly the homes of the elderly, to check gas meters and do other work not associated with the postal service traditionally.  The concept is a very good one.  A number of local authorities have undertaken to engage with the post office so that postmen have a chance to visit residents and check things like gas meters.  I mention it because residents do not pay for the service and any cost is met by councils.  We must be imaginative enough to think and challenge the various roles we have.  There are certainly criticisms and towns and villages are losing some of the essential elements they have had in the past, including Garda stations and post offices.<\/p><p>We had a very good debate in the House a couple of months ago on defibrillators and their placement around the country in State and health buildings and elsewhere.  The Minister accepted the concept but asked HIQA to undertake a health technology assessment.  It did that two weeks ago and has said it wants responses back by the end of next week.  It is a reminder for us to see what we can challenge and question to enhance the report.  The use of defibrillators saves many lives.  The figure as to how many provided by HIQA is questionable as it believes a limited number will be saved at a very heavy cost.  That can be challenged, but it is not challenged as much as discussed.  The whole country should have an input into the report, submissions on which have been requested by the end of next week.  It is a very short period, but it is enough to make sure we get that in.<\/p><p>Senator Zappone referred to the work she has done identifying payments to State board members and chairmen.  We introduced and discussed a Bill here, which was not accepted, which sought to provide that chairmen and members of State boards should not be paid.

The report sets out how health services outside the acute hospitals will be organised and managed.  It involves, among other things, the establishment of nine community health care organisations and the development of 90 primary care networks averaging a population of 50,000 people, with each community health organisation having an average of ten networks to support groups of primary care teams and enable integration of all services for a local population.  This will see the reform of social care, mental health and health and well-being services to better serve local communities.  This is a very significant development and it would be appropriate to have the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, attend the House as soon as possible to tease out the report to ensure past mistakes are not repeated.

The fact that the European Union has confirmed the nuclear installation, which will cost an astronomical &euro;65 billion and will be subsidised by the British Government to the tune of &euro;20 billion, will go ahead, puts paid to the notion that British consumers or the British Government were ever going to purchase Irish wind energy through the notional export of wind from Ireland.  That project has been hanging around on life support for the past number of months, but we can honestly say today that the UK Government has pulled the plug on it once and for all.  There will be no export of wind energy from Ireland to the United Kingdom, which has instead taken the nuclear option.  This is a significant issue for Ireland and our economy.  Effectively, we will now import nuclear energy through the interconnector to fuel and generate power for Irish homes, farms and factories.<\/p><p>We can no longer remain in denial on this.

I will speak in defence of seconding it.  For people of my generation - those who thankfully grew up at a physical distance of 100 miles from but still very much politically in the shadow of the Northern Ireland conflict - those folks who espoused reconciliation and compromise are unsung heroes who were the true peacemakers.  They were the people who were actually advocating peace without ever having advocated war in the first place.  One of the leaders of that movement was the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  For many people of my generation who were not politically involved but just looking at it from the outside, he was a person who embodied many of the best impulses we should see in Irish politics and somebody who tried to move past his own incredibly heavy familial Civil War burden to try to take a more all-encompassing view of what we needed to do to fix our country.  Where others were preaching internecine warfare, he preached reconciliation.  Where others were preaching one or other version of the sectarian head count they thought should determine the shape of the political structures on or in different parts of the island of Ireland, he tried to work out ways of getting compromises between those who saw those.<\/p><p>Here we are four leaders later.  The occupant of the same position Dr. FitzGerald held is our Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny.  I mean no offence to any of my colleagues in any other party because I think all of the parties have moved on enormously in the past several years but it is a subject of profound sadness to me to think that his party is locked in a head-and-neck poll with people led by those who were preaching a very different vision ten, 20, 30 and 40 years ago.  The Taoiseach bears a very particular responsibility for the credibility of Irish constitutional politics and I must say that he has let it down over the past several weeks by his failure to deal with several critical issues relating to the political reform he promised.  It still sticks completely in my craw that we have visit after visit after visit to this House by Ministers who when asked a direct question either do not answer or are economical with the truth.  It is very hard for us to criticise others for dishonesty about their history when we cannot look our own Taoiseach in the eye and ask him to be honest about more recent history.  For that reason and in the context of the failure to deliver Seanad reform and meaningful political reform, I second Senator Mullen's amendment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900007#F00400","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1412849400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>The Senator has already seconded it.

On this occasion, I am not talking specifically about the charges although they are areas we all want to discuss as usual.  We might ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House so that we could discuss with him the schedule of capital projects that would have been planned by the various local authorities in the context of their water and wastewater treatment and the fact that given that responsibility for all of these plans comes under the remit of Irish Water, there is very real concern and a good bit of anecdotal evidence to suggest that projects that were expected to begin in the short term are now very much on the long finger because of the very significant cost base that Irish Water runs on.<\/p><p>In Sligo what is referred colloquially as the bundle scheme relates to villages I am sure people are aware of - Grange in north county Sligo, Strandhill, which is west of Sligo town and Tubbercurry, which is south of Sligo town and is the country's second largest town.  These villages have all been waiting for some considerable period for a new sewerage treatment plan.  The previous Government made available a 90% subvention for those programmes to go ahead.  They have yet to go ahead.  Sligo County Council needs them to go ahead.  We are in a position to move on them but it is now the case that Irish Water is long fingering them.  The populations of these villages throughout the country face the difficulty of having to pay for water in the first instance.  We saw how in the context of the Roscommon-Leitrim by-election, the Government has postponed costs, and rightly so, for the people of Roscommon because they have dirty water.  We have substandard sewerage treatment facilities in Grange in north county Sligo, Strandhill west of Sligo town and Tubbercurry in south County Sligo.  Now that they are paying for everything, people are entitled to know when these works will be carried out.  They were ready to go pre-Irish Water.  Now that we have Irish Water, the matter seems to be pushed very far down the list and I would like some clarification on that.  I know that a specific case might be more appropriate to Adjournment Matters but I know that there are examples of this in every local authority area and the Minister ought to give us an indication as to who is in charge, what the timetable for events that were planned is and when people can expect work and improvements on the ground.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900007#F00600","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1412849400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator MacSharry.

This would facilitate Members who are often engaged in committee business, which is scheduled around the D&aacute;il sittings.  Those changes were agreed in principle at the CPP but a further CPP meeting needs to take place to agree to implement the change.  That may facilitate attendance by more Members.  I agree with Senator O'Brien that it is up to all group leaders or Whips to raise this with our own groups in order to ensure Members are in the House in a timely manner.  We have a rota in operation in our own group but it is still difficult to get Members to come at 10.30 a.m., or at 2.30 p.m. on a Tuesday.<\/p><p>Senator O'Brien also asked about home help gratuities and the issue of the payment of gratuities owed.  If he could e-mail me the details, I will be happy to write directly to the Minister.  I know the Senator has written to the new Minister about this issue and has had no response.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is in the House the week after next on the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill but he is also due in the House on 4 November for a general debate on health care.  That is probably the more appropriate date to raise the matter with him.<\/p><p>The Senator also raised the issue of Fampyra, the drug for MS patients, which he has raised on a number of previous occasions.  I believe all of us would agree it is a huge concern that a drug which appears to have greatly improved quality of life for many people is now on hold, effectively.  I am told the HSE received a revised application from Biogen Idec for the drug on Friday, 25 July, and that application is currently being assessed in line with agreed procedures.  Although I am aware Senator O'Brien has been given that answer before, as of 1 October, that is the most up-to-date information I have.  Again, if the Senator can send me the details, I will certainly write to the Minister.  It is an issue that can be raised with him on 4 November if it has not already been raised.  Senator Conway also raised this matter on the Adjournment earlier this week.<\/p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan welcomed the boost for social housing being provided by investment from the European Investment Bank.  I believe all of us would agree that is hugely welcome given the housing crisis at present.  As Senator Coghlan noted, this is the first time the bank will invest in a programme like this in Ireland, so it is hugely significant and should, when it comes on stream, help to ease the housing crisis .<\/p><p>Senator Zappone called for a debate on the new model of ministerial appointments announced by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, earlier this week, which has received Cabinet approval.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is going to provide a more detailed proposal in a memorandum to Government next month.  We might usefully have him in this House after that on public reforms generally.  In fact, I had asked on this issue myself and I know the Leader's office had already, following my request, sought a debate with the Minister, Deputy Howlin, on a revised system of appointments.  I am told we hope to secure that debate for November so all the questions can be answered then.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Zappone for putting on record various points about remuneration.  I understand very many State boards have no remuneration at all for membership and many people serve on State boards in an entirely voluntary capacity, which also needs to be acknowledged.  Of course, semi-States are in a different position.  It is a good idea to try to lay out all of that in detail.  Senator Zappone also asked about Committee Stage of the Seanad reform Bill and I can certainly make inquiries as to when that is likely to come before us.<\/p><p>I believe we all agree with Senator Barrett that stress tests on the Irish banks should be brought to a speedy conclusion.  Senator Barrett also reminded us about the issue of infill in Dublin Bay.  We could have a debate on that at some point or it could be tabled as a matter on the Adjournment.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden welcomed the announcement of the European Investment Bank funding.  She noted the housing crisis and the increase in waiting lists, particularly in Dublin city council areas, and that the ESRI and the Nevin Institute have today asked for greater investment in social housing.  I know Senator Hayden has been seeking a debate on this for some time.  She has specifically asked for a debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, on the private rental sector.  I will certainly seek that debate and I suggest the Senator might also communicate directly with the Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, on her proposals for changes in the budget on measures to reduce homelessness through, for example, controlling rent increases and examining housing supplement payments.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn raised a very interesting and creative idea about the use of the postal service to ensure greater supports for elderly people living alone, and I believe we would all like to hear more about that.  He also raised the issue of defibrillators and the life-saving help they have provided.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins welcomed the investment by the European Investment Bank.  He also asked for a debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on community health care organisations and the restructuring of the health care.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is in the House on 12 November to deal with another aspect of her brief, which is suicide and mental health funding.  We can ask her to come in on another date to deal with the issue of community health care reorganisations.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh called for a debate on the nursing profession in light of the very worrying recent increase of &euro;50 in the fee, which has been raised with us by nurses and nursing students.  I would be very happy to try to facilitate that debate.  It might be part of a broader debate or, if we cannot get a specific debate on it, it is something the Senator can raise with the Minister of State, Deputy Varadkar, when he is in the House on 4 November.<\/p><p>As we know, there have been huge changes to the nursing profession in terms of the professionalisation of nursing.  We have an excellent school of nursing in Trinity College, if I can give a small plug to that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900008#G00100","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1412850000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>With respect to the nurses, they deserve a stand-alone debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900008#G00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1412850000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I will certainly seek that but, as we are unlikely to get it before 4 November, the Senator could also raise it on that date with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.<\/p><p>Senator Whelan raised the issue of wind energy, which he has raised in this House before.  He noted the game-changer of yesterday's decision on the nuclear plant proposed for Somerset in England.  I would agree with him that has huge implications for Ireland and I am happy to seek a debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, broadly on energy and in that context.<\/p><p>Senator Norris called for a full debate on Seanad reform and referred to a particular appointment.  I do not intend to get into any discussion on the merits or otherwise of any particular individual.  However, I thank Senator Whelan for explaining to me that expressions of interest were sought for appointments to the board of RTE and others, the communications committee scrutinised these, as has been reported, and then, having scrutinised CVs at length, the committee made recommendations to the Minister for him to consider.  He has until February 2015 to affirm those appointments or do otherwise.  I stress that no appointment has been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900008#G00300","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1412850000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>It is all being done in secret.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900008#G00400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1412850000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>It is important that we do not abuse parliamentary privilege by casting aspersions.<\/p><p>Senator Daly welcomed the smoking in cars legislation.

That is the specific question many people had focused on in terms of Seanad reform.  It has been over a year since the referendum result, and it was Senator Zappone who noted that anniversary on 3 October.  It would certainly be good to hear what has happened in the interim and what is proposed.

However, I wish to raise a number of technical matters that I would like to tease out with the Minister of State.  The first arises on page 6, line 19, concerning the area of land which would be designated as a forest.  The minimum area indicated is 0.1 hectares.  Some people would have back gardens of that size, so I feel it is quite restrictive for anyone living in rural Ireland.  It is a very limited definition of what a forest would be.  I suggest therefore that the figure should be increased to 0.5 hectares and five metres in height.  That would exclude any kind of garden of a reasonable size.  I have therefore moved this amendment to try to improve the piece of legislation before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900010#J00600","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1412850900,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  This an important debate and we had a good discussion on Second Stage also.  The amendments I have tabled are entirely in the spirit of the last debate.

I hope so.<\/p><p>An area of 0.1 hectares is 100 square metres.  Many trees are of great value to the landscape for noise abatement and climate change, which would not be covered by the Bill.  My amendment No. 2 therefore seeks to extend the scope.  One hundred square metres is a very high threshold, but we need to protect trees that grow in smaller clusters up and down the country as part of a general appreciation of the role that trees have.<\/p><p>I noticed that in the National Development Plan 2007-2013, 19 lines were devoted to forestry in a 300-page document.

It is appropriate that we are discussing the Forestry Bill.  We should all mark this day in our own way.  With the co-operation of the Department of Education and Skills, a thousand trees have been sent to various schools.  Tomorrow I will visit my local school in County Tipperary and plant a tree.  If anybody has a free hour tomorrow he or she should plant a tree in their own area.  One thing I have learned about forestry is that people in the Oireachtas have a great interest in the environment, and trees are part of the environment.  I invite everybody tomorrow, whether in his or her own back garden or in a school, to plant a tree to mark the occasion and, perhaps, to bring it to the attention of younger people in the environs where one lives.  I thought I would take the liberty of making Senators and everybody else aware of National Tree Day.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 38 are being taken together.  In regard to amendment  No. 1, for international and national reporting requirements, Ireland has defined that a forest area is at least 0.1 hectares, as described in the Bill.  We are committed to using the same forest definition for reporting to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Changing the definition would mean that all carbon stocks previously reported to the UN would have to be revised, as well as estimates provided to the EU in relation to projected levels of carbon sink activity.  The 0.1 hectare threshold is also the minimum area for which consent is required for all proposed afforestation projects, as described in Ireland's European Communities (Forest Consent and Assessment) Regulations 2010. <\/p><p>The area definition should also take into account that this Bill describes trees as being either inside or outside a forest.  If the area definition is raised, this would mean that all areas below 0.5 hectares could be removed without a licence and without a requirement to replant.  From Ireland's perspective, with historically low levels of forest cover, it is important to record as many forests as possible.  Reducing the threshold would facilitate deforestation and the potential loss of biodiversity.  In many cases these small woods interlink and adjoin the massive network of hedgerows in Ireland and are an integral part of our landscape.  My Department has provided grant aid since the early 1990s for broadleaf woodlands at the threshold of 0.1 ha.  In addition, many important areas of woodland along rivers and valleys are small in size and any upward movement in the threshold could result in these woodlands being deforested with no replanting.<\/p><p>The alternative proposal as outlined in amendment No. 2 would have the effect of lowering the definition of forest to include all trees found in groups below 0.1 hectares and would include the majority of individual trees.  From a regulatory and implementation point of view, it is not practical to regulate the felling of every tree in the countryside.  Landowners must be allowed to manage individual trees on their holdings in accordance with good agricultural practice based on the exemptions outlined in the Bill.<\/p><p>With regard to amendments Nos. 4 and 38, the terms &quot;woodland&quot; and &quot;forest&quot; are interchangeable and are used to describe groups of trees growing in close proximity.  While there are no hard and fast rules, the word &quot;forest&quot; is used internationally to describe trees which are either broadleaf and or coniferous in character.  I have, therefore, decided to stay with the terminology &quot;forest&quot; as it is commonly used within the national and international context.  The terminology &quot;woodland&quot; is generally used in Ireland and Britain to describe broadleaf woodland.  This Forestry Bill is about groups of trees which include broadleaf and conifer species.  I therefore do not accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900011#K00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412851200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1412851200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<blockquote><br \/>In page 7, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:&quot; &quot;woodland&quot; means land under trees under 0.1 hectare with a tree crown cover of more than 20 per cent of the total area, or the potential to achieve this cover at maturity.&quot;.<\/blockquote>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I welcome the news about Tree Day.  It is also the centenary of Avondale, which I think was founded in 1904 when we first got involved in forestry education, so trees have been important for a very long time.  In regard to my amendment, what the Minister of State has said encompasses the spirit of the amendment.  The preface states that the Bill seeks to promote forestry in a manner that maximises the economic, environmental and social value of forests, which includes woodlands, within the principles of sustainable forest management, and to confer particular powers on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We want to maximise the value of this asset.  That was the purpose of the amendments.  I welcome the Minister of State's explanation and I will not press the amendment.

They are to promote knowledge and awareness of forestry; to promote educational training in forestry and related matters; and to promote research on  forestry and related matters.  These are all very important functions which will, effectively, determine the future outcome of the forestry resource, both private and public.  Are there plans to develop forestry?  Is the Department looking at ways to do so?  Does the Minister anticipate it will be developed down the road?  Have we a vision of where we want Coillte and the forestry complement to be in 20 years time?  There are 2030 objectives for afforestation cover in the country.  What are the other objectives?  How many schoolchildren do we want to see in forestry over the next ten years?  Do we want to see an increase?  Do we want to see additional walking routes developed in forests?  Do we want our forestry resource to play an important and integral role in combatting obesity? <\/p><p>Coillte is the largest owner of land in the country and, therefore, has a key role to play.  It is a pivotal semi-State organisation.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's thoughts on the issue.  I am not pressing him on it today.  We must consider what must happen in five, ten and 15 years time and set the standard now.  Apart from the standard of planting, we must look at other standards and decide how best to use the resource and ensure everybody can share in it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900012#L00700","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1412851800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>It is no harm to take the opportunity to echo a lot of what I said in my Second Stage contribution here.  It is always very important to lay out our vision for the future.  There is great potential for forestry in Ireland and we need to mark out a roadmap.<\/p><p>When the Government came to power it decided to see whether Coillte needed to be sold or retained as a national asset.  That was a brave decision and was welcomed by everybody across the political divide.  In general, the public at large welcomed the fact that Coillte would stay in State ownership and that the vast resource would be used for the benefit of people.  It was important to link what Coillte has with tourism, the environment, schools and to get people to understand the industry more.<\/p><p>I have travelled up and down the country and had an opportunity to visit a huge number of Coillte and private sites.  Let me address the Coillte sites.  I realised that there is an opportunity for tourism in every parish and county, particularly along the western coast and part of the eastern coast.  Some counties have a lot of forestry and there is also great potential in terms of walkways.  We all know that tourists want to come here to enjoy walks in the fresh air so we should have more organised walks on Coillte lands.  There are great opportunities to develop this tourism sector.<\/p><p>Last Tuesday I was in Galway and met the acting chief executive of Coillte.  We spoke at length about the potential of linking Coillte with tourism projects and I found the organisation was very much on board with the idea.  That is a roadmap of where Coillte is going.  I could talk about this issue for hours because it is such a fantastic forestry project.<\/p> <p>The forestry programme that is currently under discussion is out there for public consultation, and the stakeholders are now making their observations.  Many changes will take place and we must go to Brussels before the end of the year.  We hope to have that new programme ready for 1 January 2015.  Land review policies are also under discussion.  Some180,000 acres of land could be planted.  A review is taking place and the hen harrier issue is part of that.  I have been in constant consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  We met only last week, and may meet again next week.  Last night I met a group of people who were concerned about the delay in allowing that land to be planted.  There are huge opportunities there.  Dr. Nuala N&iacute; Fhlatharta, head of the forestry development department at Teagasc, is chairing a group that is trying to make land availability clearer and give direction on the issue into the future.  I hope to have that report to hand before the end of the year.  If we have that to hand, we will put a bigger forestry programme in place.<\/p><p>Broadly, there are huge opportunities for employment.

That is an example of what is being done with forestry.  In ten years time, forestry will be in a great place.  People I meet in forestry and with connections to it are very committed.  They are not whingers, they are not giving out about rural Ireland, they are simply committed to doing their job and doing it well.  They are passionate about growing their trees and growing them well.

With this amendment, I seek to add that the Minister, in addition to all his other duties -  which go right through the alphabet as far as &quot;k&quot; - would &quot;undertake the protection of woodlands on areas less than 0.1 hectares&quot;.  The Minister has already communicated his enthusiasm for that and we look forward to his report in January.<br\/>I am informed by botanists that we have a problem with woodlands in Ireland.  Native woodland is dominated by the mainly broadleafed, native tree species.  It is a semi-natural habitat with historical and ecological links to the original wild woods that preceded it.  It is a vital reservoir of biodiversity, as well as being of high cultural significance and amenity value.  That covers less than 1% of the land area and the remainder is the plantation forest, which is dominated by non-native coniferous trees and now covers about 10% of the State.  Its direct commercial value as timber is far greater, but its biodiversity, cultural and amenity value is far less than that of the native woodland.  It is native woodland on the sites less than a hectare that is of concern.<br\/>I think the Minister is already there in spirit, but it may be necessary to state in legislation that that is one of the things for which he as Minister will be looking out.  I know he is already looking out for it, but the problem, as defined to me by some botanists, is that we have put many resources into the 10% and the 1% is really valuable.  If much of it is in units of less than 0.1 hectare, society as a whole will support the Minister in that it should be under his care.  There is a duty of care here.  I do not think it imposes any particular obligations on the Minister, but within his strategy statement, so to speak, the protection of woodlands should also, in view of biodiversity and climate change, have the benign attention of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900013#M01100","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1412852400,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I will address amendments Nos. 7 and 9 together.<\/p><p>The purpose of defining an area threshold of 0.1 hectares is to ensure that the felling of small groups of trees is regulated by licence.

As stated previously on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, this Bill is about striking an appropriate balance between protecting the national forest resource and allowing individual trees to be felled without a licence in certain circumstances.  The removal of the facility to allow certain trees to be exempted from a felling licence would not provide an appropriate balance.<\/p><p>I would also point out that I have made a number of amendments to section 19 on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il which recognises the importance of certain types of individual trees which will now require a felling licence.

What happens if somebody has been on one of these committees and the committee wants to bring him or her in because it is not happy about the way the committees are working or some of the decisions that have been made?  There are those who would love to get people from Uisce &Eacute;ireann to appear before a committee to investigate some of the issues that are going on there.  We do not know whether something similar could happen on one of these committees which would result in a wish to being people before an Oireachtas committee and question them.  Would they be able to use this section to say that they cannot disclose any information or discuss what happened because there is sensitive information there and they are not authorised to do so by the Minister?  In the spirit of openness and transparency, could we be tripping ourselves up in the future?  Could people use this as a get-out clause if we want to investigate the work of the committee that the Minister of State is talking about?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900015#O00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1412853600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>That is not the intention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900015#O00300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1412853600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>It never is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900015#O00400","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1412853600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I know it never is, but the intention here is that sensitive information cannot be given out.

That is what concerns me here.  In respect of encouraging private investors, there seems to be much red tape and administrative burden placed on anybody who is thinking of getting involved in business, no matter what business we are talking about.  I hope the Minister of State could outline to me what sort of forest management plan he is talking about.  Is there a danger that the management plan would force the investor to resort to the work of specialists - for example, to complete a survey of the land?  Could they do that on their own, or would the Minister of State be able to give a rough cost and timeframe for the completion of a forest management plan for an average-sized forest?  I have full confidence in the Minister of State but I am worried that some future Minister might have a different attitude.

Is it possible to have such sites tidied up within one year rather than having scrubs and stumps?  Wicklow, the Garden County, is one of the most scenic counties.  Can foresters make a contribution to its beauty by replanting felled trees quickly?  Is there an obstacle that prevents them from doing so?<\/p><p>Section 17(5) states &ldquo;In considering applications for a licence, the Minister may consult any person whom he or she considers to be appropriate&rdquo;.

Examples might include a forest owner proposing to remove a small area of forest for the creation of a sports ground for a local village or the felling of trees to prioritise the conservation of a protected species.  Although the power to attach conditions is provided for in this Bill, the felling licence application process allows for the owner's objectives to be included in the licensing process.<br\/>With regard to amendment No. 20, the specification of a level of maturity of trees to be replanted can be accommodated within the standard conditions for tree planting.  Therefore, there is no need for this amendment.

My preferred approach is to retain the current wording, which states &quot;within such period as may be specified&quot;, and for this reason I do not accept this amendment.

My amendments delete the lines giving exemption to a tree in an urban area and within 30 m of a building.

We suggest the addition of the clause \"or is not a hedgerow of historical, ecological and\/or landscape\" value.  The reason for this is obvious, as there are remnants of ancient woodlands which may have a rich biodiversity.  There is variation between hedges, with many delivering significant benefits under many headings, with poor quality hedges delivering relatively less value.  Hedges have historical, ecological and landscape significance.  They should be protected, which is why we are suggesting this addition to the section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900018#R00600","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1412855400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>With regard to amendment No. 23, the exclusion from the felling licence system of trees in urban areas does not involve any change of policy on the part of the Department.  It is a continuation of the position that pertains with the 1946 Forestry Act.  The rationale for exempting trees within urban areas is primarily based on public safety concerns, which remain valid in the context of this Bill.  It is open to local authorities to place tree preservation orders on individual trees or groups of trees which it considers worthy of preservation for amenity or environmental reasons, including veteran trees.  The experience generally is that people are responsible for and protective of trees within their communities and there is no evidence of widespread abuse of this provision.  Similarly, the purpose of having an exemption from the felling licensing system for trees within 30 m of a building is health and safety; again, it is a continuation of the position that pertains under the 1946 Act.  If a tree adjacent to a building is in a dangerous condition, immediate steps must be taken to remove the risk to life and property.  In such cases, it would be totally irresponsible to require an application for a licence before removing the tree.<br\/>With regard to amendment No. 24,<b><\/b>although the Bill vests responsibility for licensing of tree felling in the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, there are cases where other public and State authorities, in the performance of their statutory functions, must be empowered to remove trees without having to obtain a felling licence from this Department.  It is important to stress that the exemption only applies to cases where they are performing those statutory functions.  In this context, it is also important to point out that for the purpose of this provision, Coillte Teoranta is not regarded as a public authority and must apply for a license when felling trees.<br\/>With regard to amendment No. 25, in the case of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the exemption relates to lands held or managed on his or her behalf for the purposes of the Wildlife Acts.  To require a felling licence in such cases would be an unnecessary imposition on a body which is charged with the protection of flora and fauna on those lands, the achievement of which may, in whole or in part, require the removal of trees.  With regard to amendment No. 26, I do not believe it is either practical or advisable for landowners to first obtain the opinion of the local authority or the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which I presume is what is meant by the national heritage authority, before dealing with trees which have become dangerous to users of the public roads because of their age, condition or due to ground stability.<\/p> <p> Senators will recall that during the storms earlier this year trees and branches fell onto public roads throughout the country.  This provision is intended to allow land-holders or owners to respond to such occurrences in a timely manner without the requirement to first apply for a felling licence or to wait for an inspection from a local authority roads engineer.<\/p><p>I do not believe that the exemption will lead to the widespread felling of roadside trees.  However, in response to concerns raised by stakeholders to the effect that the exemption was too broad and could lead to widescale removal of trees, I made an amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il imposing an additional requirement on landowners to ensure that only trees they reasonably consider to pose a threat to public safety on the grounds of their age and condition can be removed without a licence.  The provision is intended to supplement but not replace section 70 of the Roads Act 1993, which already allows a local authority, in its capacity as a road authority, to serve a notice on a landowner requiring him or her to fell, cut, lop, trim or remove roadside trees it deems hazardous or a potential hazard.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett has also tabled amendment No. 27.  The purpose of the exemption contained in section 19(1)(m)(ii) is to regularise a situation that many people have unfairly found themselves in whereby they have applied to a local authority in good faith for planning permission to build, for example, a dwelling house, the construction of which involved the removal of one or two trees.  In many cases, the permission came with conditions requiring the replanting of a greater number of trees for landscaping or screening purposes and only later have they discovered, as they were about to begin construction works, that they also needed a felling licence for something for which they sincerely believed they had already received comprehensive approval from the State.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh has tabled amendment No. 28.  The protection of hedgerows of historical, ecological or landscape significance was raised during consultations with environmental stakeholders.  I introduced amendments on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il to address some of these concerns in so far as it is practical and appropriate to the Forestry Bill.  These amendments are reflected in section 19(2) and extend protection for certain classes of trees.  However, the Bill is not about regulating the alteration or removal of hedgerows in general.  The Wildlife Acts and the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) Regulations 2011 deal with this issue.  Furthermore, there is no national register of hedgerows that are deemed to be of historical, ecological or landscape significance.  In the absence of such a register it would be up to the landowners to decide if a tree was in a hedgerow of historical, ecological or landscape significance and to determine if a felling licence is required to cut or remove a tree, and this is highly subjective.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900018#R00700","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412856000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412856000,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 24 to 27, inclusive, not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1412856000,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 28:<blockquote><br \/>In page 19, line 21, after &ldquo;ground&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or is not a hedgerow of historical, ecological and\/or landscape&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900019#S00400","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412856000,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412856000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Section 19 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412856000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Section 20 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1412856000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>SECTION 21<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1412856000,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 are related and may be discussed together, by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900019#S00900","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1412856000,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 29:<blockquote><br \/>In page 21, line 11, to delete &ldquo;or modified&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>This deals with preservation orders.

There is a special need to develop degree programmes.  There are some in Waterford and Limerick as well as UCD, but it looks like an area of education where we have taken our eye off the ball.  The purpose of the amendment is to draw attention to the need to build up third and fourth level education in forestry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900020#T02300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1412856600,"counter":259,"content":"<p>The development of third and fourth level education in forestry is highly desirable and something that my Department is happy to endorse and encourage.  However, the responsibility for these areas lies within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I take on board the points Senator Barrett has made.  There is a lot of opportunity for people to get involved in forestry, and there are many courses.  Some are already provided at UCD, Waterford Institute of Technology and indeed Ballyhaise College in Cavan.  In olden days there was more training.  I support what Senator Barrett is saying and I see major opportunities for young people to train and get a job for life in forestry.  We spoke earlier in response to an overview of where the forestry industry is going and the potential there.  We need trained people and people who are good to go out and advise landowners.  One of the issues that needs to be addressed by everybody is the change whereby landowners go from dairy or beef into forestry.<\/p> <p>They need assurances from trained people with knowledge of the business.  There is a lack of knowledge among many of those involved.  Recently, I attended an open day event organised by Teagasc in west Limerick and was amazed that people came to me to say they did not know about certain aspects.  They had questions to ask and much information was given.  As people must be trained, there are huge opportunities in that regard.  I, therefore, endorse what the Senator said.

We learned a lot, as he did, when his predecessor as Minister of State, the late Shane McEntee, appeared in the Chamber.  At the time we were concerned about ash dieback disease.  The section deals with invasive species.  I am asking that the Minister report to the Oireachtas on the elimination of destructive diseases such as ash dieback disease and the destruction of forests by the invasive species rhododendron, which represents a major threat to all of the work by the Minister of State and his predecessors.  My botanical friends are seriously concerned that the ash could disappear as the elm did before it.  There is also a serious problem with beech which is invasive in mature native oak woods in many locations such as Laragh, Rathdrum, Killarney National Park and Lismore.  There is a major problem in the offing with the lodgepole pine which is invasive in bog and heathland habitats in Connemara and County Mayo.  Coillte's wild Nephin wilderness area contains a large amount of lodgepole pine which is regenerating freely.  The rampant rhododendron problem occurs in the national park in County Mayo and Killarney.  Senator Paul Coghlan is seriously concerned about it.<br\/>The GAA took its eye off the ball and allowed a shortage of ash to develop.  The disease was to be found in imported ash from central Europe.  We are all trying to develop a forest that is sometimes invaded by the vermin the Minister of State mentioned and sometimes by invasive species that threaten to destroy much of what is of value.  This will undo much of the work done in Irish woodlands.  Some procedure such as that the late Shane McEntee had brought forward in respect of ash would allow us to see how our native woodlands are faring with the various threats to their continuation in this valuable part of the environment.  We need to put in place a mechanism whereby the invaders can be attacked and the House informed of a serious national issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900021#U00400","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1412857200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I have no difficulty in discussing these issues, particularly ash dieback, with Members of the Oireachtas.

This is to affirm the status of Coillte because of the fears raised about the possibility of a merger, particularly by the union IMPACT.  The Coillte branch of the union has made representations to the Oireachtas committee.  The union has expressed the view that the merger of Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte could leave the State forestry company as a small and relatively weak voice within a much larger company focused on energy production.  There was a fear that the rebalancing of company priorities, following a merger, would be likely to divert wood to energy use rather than maintaining its most economic advantageous use.  This clearly would seriously weaken the economic base of Coillte.  The fear is that its focus and <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>as a forestry company could be affected.

It is intended to support the development of a modern forest sector which operates in accordance with good forest practice and with a view to protection of the environment.  The Bill is about forestry and good forest practice.  I emphasise that it is not about Coillte.  Its provisions are applicable to both public and private forest owners.<\/p><p>The Government decided in June 2013 that an analysis be undertaken of a merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na.  It decided on 24 June 2014, on the basis of an in-depth analysis undertaken by NewERA and the relevant Departments with an input from both companies, that both companies should work towards a partial merger of their businesses, focusing on the areas in which there was an overlap between the two companies.  A joint venture between the two companies will, accordingly, be formed to manage their common business activities in biomass, wind energy, shared services, and recreation and tourism.  My colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, considered the analysis and jointly concluded that a partial merger approach to ensure synergy was the best approach at the time and this approach was subsequently agreed to by the Government.<\/p><p>A restructuring of Coillte, overseen by NewERA and the relevant stakeholder Departments, also formed part of the Government's decision in June 2013 and I understand proposals in that regard are being worked on.  While preliminary work has commenced on implementation of the recent decision on the formation of a joint venture between Coillte and Bord na Mona in the areas mentioned, pending its completion and the outcome of the restructuring of the company, it is premature to state there is a need to review the 1988 Act to redefine Coillte's objectives and operations.

If, however, somebody is going to commit his or her land to forestry for life, he or she will want to have some certainty in respect of the matter.  As I understand it, the grounds on which a licence may not be granted relate to the protection of the environment; the ensuring of good forestry practice; the preservation of amenities; public health or safety; protection from flooding; and preservation of water quality.  These are pretty much all-encompassing in the context of forestry.  If a licence is not granted on the basis of the reasons to which I refer, I understand that compensation will not be paid.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the position.  In light of the fact that there has only been one occasion on which a licence has not been granted - the Minister of State may be aware of other instances - I do not understand why this section is being included in order to cover something which is unlikely to happen.  I am of the opinion that the inclusion of the section will create doubt among members of the farming community, particularly if it is the case that someone might object to an area of forestry being cut down because he or she believes it to be an amenity.  If a felling licence is refused in such circumstances, the land of the farmer involved will be covered in trees which he may have been hoping to use to fund his pension or develop his farm.  He will be stuck with an area of forestry which he cannot fell and in respect of which he cannot maximise the return from his investment.  The farmer in question will end up losing money and will not be compensated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900022#V00700","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1412857800,"counter":278,"content":"<p>On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il there was lengthy discussion in respect of the need for the Bill to provide for payment of compensation in circumstances where an application for a felling licence is refused.  In light of the concerns expressed, I sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General.  The advice I received was to the effect that there would be a risk of a finding that the provisions of the Bill permitting refusals of licences would be unconstitutional if they failed to provide for compensation.  Section 32, for which I received Government approval, gives effect to this legal advice to provide for compensation where it is legally necessary to do so.  While the outright refusal of an application for an approval or a licence is infrequent, there are, and will continue to be, instances where an approval or a licence may be refused by the Minister, usually for reasons of environmental protection.<\/p><p>It is intended that compensation will be provided through regulations to be made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be required in this regard.  The proposed amendment limits the circumstances in which compensation will be payable.  In the case of refusal of a felling licence or a forest road licence, compensation will be limited to the depreciation in the value of the trees that is attributable to the deterioration in the quality of the timber as a consequence of the refusal.  This is similar to provisions included in Northern Ireland and UK legislation.  Restrictions on the payment of compensation are also listed, including where a licence is refused for environmental reasons.  Licences will not be refused without good reason and my Department will endeavour to work with landowners in order to explore all possible options before considering outright refusal.  I hope this clarifies the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900022#V00800","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1412857800,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  He referred to regulations outlining the grounds on which compensation will either be paid or not paid.  However, the legislation specifically refers to the grounds on which an official may refuse an application for a licence.  As stated earlier, these are the protection of the environment; the ensuring of good forestry practice - which is open to interpretation; the preservation of amenities - An Taisce could decide that an area of forestry is an amenity and should be preserved and could be successful in lobbying accordingly; public health or safety - this has often been used as an excuse for many organisations to do very little; protection from flooding; and preservation of water quality.  In the context of the latter and as the Minister of State is aware, soil is often disturbed when trees are being cut down and this can have an effect on watercourses and an impact on water quality.  In that context, we are all aware of the ongoing debate with regard to water basins.  Every forestry is located close to a stream or some other watercourse, so there is going to be an impact.<\/p><p>The Minister of State indicated that the Attorney General has stated that compensation could be paid.  I may be wrong but section 32(6) appears to run contrary to that and indicates that compensation will not be paid if a licence is refused on the basis of the grounds listed.  I cannot identify the circumstances in which compensation might be paid because there is little scope for an application to be refused on grounds other than those contained in the subsection.  If a licence is refused and even though the Attorney General has indicated otherwise, it would appear that the farmer involved will not be able to seek compensation.  I am just trying to save people from being obliged to make trips to the High Court.  If section 32(6) could be removed and replaced with a provision which states that the matter will be dealt with by means of regulation, that would be something.  When the regulations are drafted, it will not be possible to cater for circumstances where compensation should be paid because the matter will already have been dealt with in primary legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900022#V00900","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1412857800,"counter":280,"content":"<p>The amendment presented on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il was drafted, reviewed and approved by the Office of the Attorney General and had regard to an examination of existing legislation on the Statute Book and commentary in the High Court in respect of a recent case.

She was tenant liaison officer with the council in September 2003 when she was first asked to accompany a neighbour of Ms Cummins to the offices of the local authority solicitors to help take out an injunction against Ms Cummins.  She refused, believing it morally unethical to provide the services of the council's legal team to a private citizen.  She also refused to sign off on a statement made by a former neighbour of Ms Cummins which was to be used in evidence in the council's eviction case.<br\/>The lady in question, Ms Grace, believed the statement was an off-the-record solicited rant from an unreliable witness, made years after she had left the flat, who did not want it used in court.  The statement was used to paint a picture of Ms Cummins' alleged anti-social behaviour.  Six months after the first incident, Ms Grace was let go.  She had been the council's first liaison officer, a role she had developed over seven years, and funding was obtained to expand and develop the role and three positions were created.  <br\/>I have a number of questions on this issue.  I raised the issue with the Leader previously and he suggested I raise the matter on the Adjournment.

This tragic case has been the subject of an inquest.  I am certain it has been difficult for all concerned and intend to deal with the issue as sensitively as possible and avoid going into unnecessary detail.<\/p><p>This case concerns the repossession of a social housing dwelling and, as with any such matter, responsibility for action in this instance rested with the housing authority.<\/p> <p>The repossession was undertaken on foot of a court decision.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to comment on the action taken by the housing authority in that regard.<\/p><p>In so far as general provisions and procedures relating to issues concerning the performance of functions by local authority officials may be relevant to the case in question, the position is that local authorities have put in place a multi-stage procedure for dealing with customer complaints, including those relating to the conduct of officials, the first of which is discussing the complaint at the point of service, as it is usually the quickest and most efficient way of addressing the matter.  If a complainant is still unhappy with the outcome of the first stage, a formal complaint can be made to the authority's customer services officer.<\/p><p>If matters have not been resolved following engagement with the local authority, it is, of course, open to a complainant to bring the matter to the attention of the Office of the Ombudsman.  Furthermore, Part 15 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides a legislative basis for the local government service's ethical framework.  It places a statutory duty on &quot;every member and every employee of a local authority and of every member of every committee to maintain proper standards of integrity, conduct and concern for the public interest&quot;.  Codes of practice for employees and elected members are underpinned by Part 15 of the Act.<\/p><p>Each local authority has an ethics registrar and any breaches of the ethical framework should be reported to that person.  Where an ethics registrar becomes aware of a possible contravention of Part 15 of the 2001 Act by an official, he or she is obliged to bring the matter to the attention of the chief executive, or to the cathaoirleach of the local authority in the case of a contravention by the chief executive.  The chief executive or the cathaoirleach is obligated to take action, which may include investigative or disciplinary procedures, referral of the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions, or any other course of action considered appropriate in the circumstances.<\/p><p>It is appropriate that any complaints regarding the provision of a service or the performance of a function which, it is claimed, is not in accordance with the rules, practice or policy of the organisation or the generally accepted principles of equity and good administrative practice, are first dealt with locally in accordance with an authority's customer complaints procedures, and that reports of non-compliance with the ethical framework are dealt with as provided for by Part 15 of the 2001 Act.<\/p><p>Responsibility for local authority staff and their conduct rests with the chief executive, who in turn is accountable to the elected members for the performance of executive functions to implement council policy.  It is relevant to note in this regard that the governance and oversight role of the elected council has been strengthened in a number of respects by provisions in the Local Government Reform Act 2014.<\/p><p>In the context of the case in question, I have been informed that a detailed report on the matter was presented to the elected members of Galway City Council on 28 February 2005 and was the subject of a lengthy debate in regard to the handling of the case.  I understand that the report informed members fully of the details of the case and specifically acknowledged that the actions of officials were open to review by the members of the council.  The report was considered by the elected members.  The record shows that although it was proposed that &quot;an Independent Review of the case be carried out by someone from outside the Authority&quot;, this proposal was not adopted, but the council adopted a motion &quot;that the City Council accept the recommendations set out in the City Manager's Report&quot; by a margin of ten to four, with one abstention.<\/p><p>Regarding the question of a possible independent investigation in regard to the handling of the matter in question by Galway City Council, the main statutory provisions relating to the holding of local inquiries are contained in sections 83 to 86 of the Local Government Act 1941.  These provide for the undertaking of further inquires if it is considered to be warranted.  However, in this case, taking particular account of the decision of the elected members of Galway City Council in regard to the report presented to them, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is of the view that consideration of an independent investigation in accordance with the provisions of sections 83 to 86 of the Local Government Act 1941 is not warranted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014100900023#W02200","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1412859000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the answer on behalf of the senior Minister, but I totally reject that answer.  What we see here is the local authority investigating the local authority, when we have had many calls for other organisations in this State not to investigate themselves.  I also have evidence that one of the individuals involved in this case has given a leadership talk about how to run local government, in which he stated that, when dealing with difficult cases:<blockquote><br \/>- Identify the 'Loss' and structure your argument accordingly<br \/>- Keep close to your adversaries<br \/>- Focus on the message - not the messenger<br \/>- Manipulate the debate<br \/>- Have an anchor<br \/>- Be Relentless<\/blockquote>That was definitely the tactic used in the Br&iacute;d Cummins case.
