The Protocol seeks to maintain full alignment with those rules of the Single Market and Customs Union that are necessary to protect North South cooperation, the all-island economy and the Good Friday Agreement, as well as avoiding a hard border.  This is the backstop and the draft Protocol makes clear that this must be in place unless and until another solution is found. In order words, it must be an &lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; solution. <\/p>  <p>  The UK has accepted that a legally operative version of the &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; for the border will be included in the Withdrawal Agreement, in line with paragraph 49 of the Joint Progress Report agreed last December, and that all the issues identified in the draft Protocol reflect those that must be addressed. <\/p>  <p>  The draft Protocol includes elements on the rights of the Good Friday Agreement in Article 1 and provisions on wider North-South cooperation in Article 8 which are important for the normal daily life of people on this island.

In addition to my own contacts, Minister of State for European Affairs, Helen McEntee TD, has met with her Greek, Estonian, Swedish, Norwegian and Portuguese counterparts. The Taoiseach has met with the Prime Ministers of Belgium and Spain, and also met with other EU leaders at the Western Balkans Summit in May. The Taoiseach and I met with both the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator for the Article 50 negotiations, Michel Barnier, when they visited Ireland last week. I met with Michel Barnier again in Luxembourg on 26 June in the margins of the General Affairs Council. Further to my own engagement with Mr Barnier, officials from my Department, and in particular from the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the EU in Brussels, continue to have very regular, almost daily engagement with Mr Barnier and his team.In all of these contacts, the Government continues to be assured of the continued support of our EU partners in addressing the unique issues posed by Brexit for the island of Ireland. The solidarity of the EU27 has been crucial in securing commitments and guarantees from the UK on the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border. <\/p><p>Mr Juncker confirmed the Commission&rsquo;s support for the Irish position in his address to the Oireachtas last week. Michel Barnier has also been firm in his support and has consistently made clear that without a backstop, there can be no Withdrawal Agreement. He has also made clear that <i>&ldquo;this is an EU issue, not only an Irish issue&rdquo;.  <\/i><\/p><p>As concerns the future EU-UK relationship, I welcome that the Guidelines adopted by EU leaders last March which reaffirmed EU&rsquo;s desire to establish a close partnership with the UK.  At the same time, the Guidelines also place an important emphasis on the need to ensure a level playing field, stressing that any future agreement must be based on a balance of rights and obligations. The commitment that the EU is willing to revisit its position should the UK&rsquo;s approach evolve is also of particular importance to Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700069#WRA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dublin-Monaghan Bombings","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700069#WRA04100"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[28008\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700069#WRA04200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the progress made to date with his British counterparts regarding release of files concerning the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and other legacy issues; and if the setting up of an historic investigation unit here will receive support.","asker":"1366","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>The implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings is a priority for the Government, as highlighted in the Programme for a Partnership Government. The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.   I met with Justice for the Forgotten in April to hear their views and update them on the Government&rsquo;s continuing engagement on legacy issues, including with the British Government on the D&aacute;il motions.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government. <\/p>  <p>  I am actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from my Department. I have consistently underlined to the British Government that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin and Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and I have emphasised the urgent need for such a response.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request in relation to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Historical Investigation Unit (HIU), the HIU is one of the institutions provided for as part of the legacy framework of the 2014 Stormont House Agreement, the prompt establishment of which is supported by the Government.  The Government has welcomed the launch of the UK Government&rsquo;s consultation on Addressing the Legacy of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Past on 11 May, which includes draft legislative provisions for the establishment of the HIU.<\/p>  <p>  The Stormont House Agreement sets out that the HIU will take forward outstanding investigations into Troubles-related deaths in Northern Ireland, from the Historical Enquiries Team process and the historical investigations of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The HIU is being established in response to concerns about shortcomings with the investigation of outstanding Troubles-related deaths, which are unique to Northern Ireland. There is no provision under the Stormont House Agreement for a similar body in this jurisdiction. The investigation of crime, including unresolved, Troubles-related crimes, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Authorities will fully pursue any new or additional evidence or information presented to them in respect of such crimes.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has committed to putting in place the necessary additional provisions for the HIU to co-operate with relevant authorities in this jurisdiction.  The drafting of legislative proposals for consideration by the Government and Oireachtas in this regard is advancing, led by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality are meeting with Justice for the Forgotten on 4 July to hear their further views on the implementation of the legacy framework provided for under the Stormont House Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains determined to see progress on the establishment of the Stormont House Agreement institutions, on legacy inquests in Northern Ireland and on all outstanding legacy issues, including the three all-Party Motions adopted by this House on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  <\/p>  <p>  Progress on these issues is crucial in order to meet the legitimate needs and expectations of victims and survivors and to contribute to broader societal reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700069#WRA04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Sanctions","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700069#WRA04400"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[28009\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700069#WRA04500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to support a boycott (details supplied) which specifically targets illegal Israeli settlement goods under international law in view of the recent killings in Gaza by Israeli state forces.","asker":"1366","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>The question of boycotts and sanctions has been discussed on many occasions in the Oireachtas.The Government does not support boycotts on Israel. I believe that such actions would be ineffective and counterproductive. They would impact indiscriminately on Israelis, including those who agree with our views on the resolution of the conflict, as well as potentially isolating Israelis from the kinds of interactions where diverse views on these issues are expressed. Successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs have taken this view.    The question of products made or grown in settlements, which are not a part of Israel, is a separate issue. Ireland and the international community regard the establishment and growth of these settlements as illegal under international law, and the EU has taken action to make a distinction between settlement goods, and goods from Israel. In the past, the EU has reached agreement on measures on labelling of settlement products, exclusion of settlements from access to EU research grants, and non-acceptance of Israeli certification for some settlement products. Since Ireland is part of the single market of the European Union, all action in relation to how trade with settlement goods is managed is governed by such actions at EU level. Regrettably, there is at present no political consensus in the EU on stronger action in this area. <\/p>  <p>  These issues were discussed in the Seanad earlier this year in the debate on the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill, a debate which I expect to be resumed next month. In my contribution to that debate, I stated that I respect the motives of those supporting the Bill, but I also explained why the Government opposes it. First and foremost among these reasons is the fact that external trade is an exclusive EU competence. I also set out in that debate my belief that, even if it were possible under EU law to take unilateral action on settlement goods, taking such a step at this moment would not be helpful to the objective we all share, that is, the end of the Israeli occupation and the achievement of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.<\/p>  <p>  It is important also not to over-emphasise the issue of settlement products, which are of limited economic significance in themselves. Settlements are a political, not an economic project. Most settlements do not export anything, and the volume of settlement goods arriving in Ireland is thought to be extremely small.<\/p>  <p>  I have made very clear the Government&rsquo;s strong views on the recent actions of Israeli forces in Gaza &ndash; in public statements, here in the Oireachtas, and directly to Israeli authorities.

Three years of war have had devastating consequences for civilians, with allegations of violations of human rights, international humanitarian law, and significant loss of life.  Three quarters of the population are estimated to require some form of humanitarian assistance.  I, and officials in my Department, have been monitoring the state of affairs in Yemen with growing anxiety, particularly in recent days as the military operations around the port and city of Hodeidah have escalated. According to the United Nations, a majority of humanitarian supplies and the vast majority of commercial supplies entered Yemen through Hodeidah and the nearby port of Saleef.  Any interruption of this flow would lead to further suffering for civilians in Yemen.  Humanitarian access is a critical issue, and I have consistently called on all parties to the conflict to ensure that the people of Yemen receive the assistance they urgently need. Commercial access is equally important, since a population of over 20 million people cannot survive on aid alone.  Officials from my Department consistently relay my strong concerns on humanitarian access to the Saudi and UAE Embassies in Dublin, including most recently this month, when they specifically raised the importance of ensuring respect for international humanitarian law, and also a consistent flow of essential goods, even as military operations are ongoing in Hodeidah.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has provided &euro;15.5 million in bilateral humanitarian assistance to Yemen since the conflict began in 2015. Of this, &euro;4 million was contributed in March this year alone.   Ireland also provides global funding to a number of organisations which are particularly active in Yemen including the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). <\/p>  <p>  I believe that only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through a negotiated end to this conflict. Ireland fully supports the work of Martin Griffiths, the new Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General for Yemen, and his team, in particular his efforts to engage all parties to the conflict to come back to the negotiating table. I hope that peace negotiations can be re-launched soon. On Monday, the UN Special Envoy, who is working intensively in the region, spoke with the Foreign Affairs Council via video link, to brief us on his efforts.

With a view to achieving this goal, negotiations have been continuing between the EU and the UK to close the remaining gaps on the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including through detailed discussions on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.   The draft Protocol is an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement and addresses issues unique to the island of Ireland. Agreement has already been reached between EU and UK negotiators regarding the Common Travel Area in Article 2, which will allow free movement of Irish and UK citizens between Ireland and the UK to continue.  <\/p>  <p>  Agreement has also been reached at negotiator level on Part II of the draft Withdrawal Agreement.

This will address the situation of non-Irish citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, the EU and UK negotiating teams published a Joint Statement, which set out the progress made since the March European Council.

In that regard, the Taoiseach discussed the issue with President Trump in the Oval Office last March and also in his meetings on Capitol Hill during this year&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the exchanges over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, I had previously raised the issue with then-Secretary of State Tillerson when I visited Washington DC in February, and with senior Congressional figures. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Special Envoy to the United States Congress on the Undocumented, Deputy John Deasy, has also been very active on the issue, and is due to travel to Washington D.C. again shortly for meetings with key contacts.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, our Embassy in Washington DC continues to engage on an ongoing basis with the Administration and with contacts on Capitol Hill. <\/p>  <p>  The Embassy, as well as our six Consulates across the United States, also works very closely with Irish immigration centres which support the needs of Irish citizens in the United States.

At the global level, the Member States of the United Nations came together in 2016 and unanimously adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which expressed a shared political will to address large movements of refugees and migrants in a more coordinated and humane manner.

The Government of Ireland recognises that trafficking in human beings undermines the fundamental principles of human rights law and that it can only be tackled through global cooperation, partnership and a victim centered approach. At EU level, human trafficking is prohibited by Article 5.3 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Human Rights.  EU Directive 2001\/36\/EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims was agreed in 2011 and has been transposed into domestic law by all EU Member States, including Ireland.  Article 20 of the Directive outlines the role of the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator who is responsible for improving coordination and coherence among EU institutions, EU agencies, Member States and international actors in addressing human trafficking.  She is also responsible for developing existing and new EU policies to address human trafficking.In 2017, the EU adopted a new Communication to address human trafficking and committed to implement a new set of priorities, building on the 2012-2016 EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings.  The Communication&rsquo;s cross cutting priorities aim to provide a stronger response to trafficking though coordinated and consolidated actions by relevant authorities and organisations. The two cross cutting priorities are: the establishment of a sound knowledge base &ndash; understanding the nature, scale and costs of trafficking is key to ensuring appropriate action; and supporting anti-trafficking priorities in the EU and non-EU countries. <\/p><p>At an international level, the United Nations continues to lead on combating human trafficking across the globe. The UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children was the first international treaty aimed at comprehensively defining and addressing human trafficking and was ratified by Ireland in 2010. The Protocol has a threefold purpose: to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, paying particular attention to women and children; to protect and assist victims of trafficking; and to promote cooperation among States Parties in order to meet those objectives.<\/p><p>The Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2010.  It includes concrete actions to prevent trafficking in persons, protect and assist victims, prosecute related crimes and strengthen partnerships among Governments, civil society organisations and the private sector, including the media. The Action Plan provided for the establishment of a United Nations voluntary trust fund for victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, managed by United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. <\/p><p>During the 72<sup>nd<\/sup>session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2017, a high level meeting took place on 27 and 28 September to review progress on implementation of the Plan.  The General Assembly adopted, by consensus, a political declaration aimed at combating human trafficking with member states, including Ireland, reaffirming their commitment to the Plan.<\/p><p>The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has also worked towards integrating a human rights based approach into the fight against human trafficking. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has developed Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking that aim to assist those involved in anti-trafficking to integrate a human rights based approach into their responses. The Human Rights Council also addresses human trafficking through resolutions that address the issue both directly and indirectly. For example, at the 37<sup>th<\/sup>session of the United National Human Rights Council in March of this year, the Council adopted a resolution on the rights of the child in humanitarian settings which specifically addressed issue of human trafficking of children.  At the 35<sup>th<\/sup>session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in June 2017, the Council adopted a resolution on the protection of human rights of migrants which addressed, <i>inter alia<\/i>, victims of human trafficking. Both resolutions were cosponsored by Ireland. At the 32<sup>nd<\/sup>session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in June 2016, the Council adopted a resolution entitled Protecting Victims of Trafficking and People at Risk of Trafficking, Especially Women and Children in Conflict and Post-Conflict Situations, which was also cosponsored by Ireland. <\/p><p>Finally, among the special procedures of the Human Rights Council is the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, who is mandated to take action on violations committed against trafficked persons; undertake country visits; and to submit annual reports on the activities of the mandate.  Ireland has supported the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, most recently in 2017 through co-sponsorship of a resolution extending the mandate of the office for a further three years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Peace Process","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[28349\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the structures operational in the context of a peace process in the Arab-Israeli situation with particular reference to the need to establish a respected body capable of dealing with complaints from both sides; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":195,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[28350\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if efforts are being made by the international community to encourage the restoration of a peace process in the Middle East with a view to addressing the concerns of the Palestinian authorities, Hamas and Fatah, pursuit of the two state solution and the need to establish dialogue with the Israeli authorities rather than allow a war to develop which will have serious consequences for all involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":196,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 103 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s policy on the Middle East has always been based on the belief that the two sides would need a degree of international assistance and pressure to reach a peace agreement.

From an international perspective there are a number of special envoys to the peace process, including a UN special coordinator, an EU Special Representative, a US special envoy, a Chinese special envoy, to name but a few. The Office of the Quartet also works as a bridge between the parties supporting Palestinian economic and institutional development and empowerment, a key factor in achieving a two-state solution.

The Conclusions also stated that the EU is determined to strengthen and intensify its engagement at all levels to support the region's political, economic and social transformation, including through increased assistance, based on tangible progress on the rule of law, as well as on socio-economic reforms, by the Western Balkans.There is a recognition that this is not only a strategic investment in Europe's security and prosperity, but that it can also contribute greatly to the long term stability of formerly war-torn areas in that it helps create a political environment conducive to bilateral issues being resolved, as we have witnessed recently in the agreement between Athens and Skopje in regard to the name-issue. As a demonstration of the EU&rsquo;s commitment, the European Commission recently adopted a strategy for &lsquo;A credible enlargement perspective for and enhanced EU engagement with the Western Balkans&rsquo;. In this Strategy, the Commission sets out clearly the actions that it will implement over in the short to medium term to boost the transformation efforts in the Western Balkans in areas of mutual interest. These actions are set out across six flagship initiatives which range from strengthening the rule of law, reinforcing cooperation on security and migration and expanding the EU Energy Union to the Western Balkans, to lowering roaming charges and rolling out broadband in the region. In addition, the Strategy  underlines the need for the EU to be prepared to welcome new members on the condition they have met the rigorous criteria for doing so.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that the Commission proposal for the new Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance fund (IPA III) for the 2021-2027 period, envisages a 13% increase (to &euro;14.5 billion) compared to current funding, and also seeks to make this fund more strategic by clearly anchoring it in the context of the Western Balkans Strategy.<\/p><p>Over the longer-term,  there is a recognition in the EU that enlargement is a geostrategic investment in a stable, strong and united Europe based on common values and that a credible accession perspective is the key driver of transformation in the region and thus enhances our collective integration, security, prosperity and social well-being. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Issues","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD02200"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[28352\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which Ukraine, Georgia and Armenia continue to be positively supported by the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":202,"content":"<p>The Eastern Partnership Initiative provides a framework for cooperation between the EU and six countries in the EU&rsquo;s Eastern Neighbourhood, including Ukraine, Georgia and Armenia. The aims of the Eastern Partnership are to promote peace and stability in the region and to enhance economic and political integration between the participating countries and the EU. The model of cooperation with each of the participating states has been tailored to meet their needs and priorities and those of the EU. At the fifth Eastern Partnership Summit in Brussels in November 2017 a revised Eastern Partnership multilateral architecture was adopted to contribute to the goals of the partnership particularly by supporting the implementation of the &ldquo;20 Deliverables for 2020&quot; which sets the future priorities for the initiative<b>.<\/b>This roadmap identifies a range of short and long-term milestones aimed at developing a stronger economy, governance, connectivity and society to make tangible and pragmatic improvements to the lives of citizens in partner countries.  The Eastern Partnership is viewed as an important tool for promoting peace and stability in the region, in the context of an unpredictable Russia and the conflict in Ukraine.  While Ireland is aware of the wider geopolitical considerations at play in the region, we have sought to emphasise the importance of ensuring that the EU&rsquo;s values continue to guide our approach and that the Eastern Partnership continues to incentivise reform and progress.<\/p><p>The EU is committed to assisting Ukraine in delivering its ambitious and wide-ranging programme of reform and has provided unprecedented levels of support. This assistance includes loans, budget support, humanitarian aid, and technical assistance as well as important trade preferences, granted under the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement which came into force in 2016. In addition, the EU is helping to reform the civilian security sector through its Advisory Mission to Ukraine.<\/p><p>The EU continues to support efforts by the OSCE to secure full implementation of the Minsk peace agreements, which provide the basis for a comprehensive settlement of the four year conflict in eastern Ukraine. On a visit to Ukraine in March, EU High Representative Federica Mogherini reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s unwavering support for Ukraine&rsquo;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and called on all parties to the conflict to support the vital work of international humanitarian organisations in meeting the needs of the local populations living in close proximity to the contact line as well as the large numbers of Internally Displaced Persons. <\/p><p>As with Ukraine, the EU remains committed to its political association and economic integration with Georgia and the successful implementation of the Association Agreement, including its Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. The EU has praised Georgia's reform efforts while underlining the need to ensure sustainability of the changes which have already taken place including on democratic development and fundamental freedoms, on constitutional and parliamentary reform, and anti-corruption reforms.<\/p><p>The EU also fully supports Georgia's territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. The appointment in November 2017 of a new EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus and the crisis in Georgia, as well as the EU Monitoring Mission are visible and substantial signs of the Union's commitment to helping Georgia address its security challenges.<\/p><p>The European Union continues to have positive relations with Armenia, which receives considerable funding from the EU, with up to &euro;170 million allocated for the period 2014-2017. This was focused on supporting private sector development and driving reforms in the areas of public administration and justice. In the margins of the 2017 Eastern Partnership Summit, Armenia signed a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement with the EU which facilitates political, economic and sectoral cooperation. By intensifying political dialogue and improving cooperation in a broad range of areas, the Agreement lays the foundations for more effective engagement with Armenia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Relations","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD02500"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[28353\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he can positively influence the international situation now leading to a multiplicity of trade wars which will negatively affect persons particularly in smaller countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":205,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[28354\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the degree to which the international community remains alert to the dangers of trade wars which can result in severe hardship and starvation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":206,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together. <\/p><p>The Government regards the question of possible disruptions to international trading relationships as a matter of concern and is working with its EU partners to promote Ireland&rsquo;s interests.

for example Chapter 7 of the Consumer Protection Code deals with claims processing and Appendix 3 of the Minimum Competency Code 2017 outlines the competencies required when handling claims. <\/p>  <p>  As part of its consumer protection mandate, the Central Bank challenges firms to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements. \u00a0Any evidence of poor conduct may result in increased supervisory engagement or where appropriate, enforcement action, up to and including involuntary revocation of a regulated firm&rsquo;s licence.\u00a0 The Central Bank&rsquo;s powers derive primarily from legislation, e.g., the Central Bank Act 1942 and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD05700"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[28395\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700072#WRD05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if e-car charging points are provided at his Department's buildings in Dublin or in other locations;

This is the reason why I established the Working Group in March 2017 to develop a plan that would safeguard the future of the Castlebar campus. <\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group was published in December 2017. It provides a wide-ranging assessment of the context within which the Campus is currently operating, and outlines a proposed vision for the future of the Mayo Campus. The Working Group recommendations are primarily for GMIT to implement, including those with regard to course provision at the Castlebar campus. <\/p>  <p>  One of the recommendations of the Sustainability Plan is that the Digital Media programme be re-pitched, in collaboration with industry, for the 2018\/19 academic year. I understand that this recommendation has yet to be implemented by GMIT. In the interim GMIT retained the programme it as\u00a0a CAO offering for 2018\/19. However, predictive analysis carried out by GMIT determined that there was an insufficient number of applicants to make the programme viable. On that basis GMIT have taken the decision to suspend the programme for the 2018\/19 academic year.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While GMIT took the decision to withdraw\u00a0this course, it should be noted that the institute\u00a0has\u00a0reinstated other programmes at the Castlebar campus for 2018\/19\u00a0- Sustainable Building Technology and the Heritage related programmes of History and Geography and Culture &amp;amp; Environment - subject to a viable number of applicants. <\/p>  <p>  The Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations will be implemented over the next five years, over the period 2018-2022.

whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. <\/p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015. <\/p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing.  <\/p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to progress the setting up of the DSS and to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the DSS to begin.  Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought into operation on 17 October 2016 some provisions of Part 8 of the Act relating to advance healthcare directives. The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to advise in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives.<\/p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  The Director is also working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the Decision Support Service can be up and running as quickly as possible. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible. My Department has received an outline implementation plan from the Director which contains monthly milestones for realisation of the objective of an active DSS.

A significant factor in the rising cost of insurance, identified in both the first and second reports of the Working Group (on (i) motor insurance and (ii) employer's liability\/public liability respectively), is the impact of fraudulent insurance claims. As such, the reports include a number of recommendations relating to insurance fraud.<\/p>  <p>  An initial roundtable was convened by the Department of Finance in late 2017 to listen to the views of all of the key stakeholders in relation to insurance fraud. Additional fraud roundtable sessions have been convened this year to progress a number of specific recommendations contained in the Working Group&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance&rsquo;, published in January this year. Recommendations 11 and 12 of the report relate to the production of statistics by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service on complaints, investigations, prosecutions and convictions relating to fraud within the personal injuries area. My Department has liaised with the Garda authorities in relation to the production of these statistics, and I am informed that the necessary Pulse update is anticipated to be in place by the end of June 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 13 of the same report recommends that Insurance Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions agree a set of guidelines in respect of the reporting of suspected fraudulent insurance claims. While guidelines were published in 2004, the Working Group noted that these have only been used to a very limited extent over the years and proposed that a new set of guidelines should be developed, using the 2004 protocol as a starting point.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the intention to use the existing guidelines to inform the drafting of new, fit for purpose guidelines, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na produced a draft document which was communicated to Insurance Ireland. The draft document proposed a number of changes to the section of the existing guidelines concerning the station or section within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to which a formal complaint should be made. Insurance Ireland signalled its agreement with the changes proposed at the roundtable session of 26 March. It was agreed that further consultations with stakeholders regarding the proposed guidelines would take place, including with insurance providers not represented by Insurance Ireland; two such consultations have already been held and the next meeting of the Roundtable, scheduled for later this week (29 June 2018), will aim to finalise the new guidelines in the context of the feedback received in these consultations. Agreement on the new set of guidelines is expected to be completed on time in Quarter 3 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The fraud roundtable process also intends to examine the follow-on procedure in circumstances where fraud or exaggeration is identified in court or acknowledged by a judge. Recommendation 12 of the Working Group&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance&rsquo; proposes that where an application under Section 26 of the Civil Liability Act 2004 is successful, this fact should be communicated to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the Courts Service. I understand that the fraud roundtable is currently engaging with the Courts Service in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that the Department of Finance issues regular quarterly updates on its website in relation to the implementation of the respective reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, the latest (fifth) of which was published on 11 May 2018; the quarterly progress update for Quarter 2 will be published next month and will refer to the current status of all the recommendations from both reports. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700074#WRF04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":336,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700074#WRF04700"},{"type":"question","counter":337,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[28266\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700074#WRF04800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties being experienced by Kuwaiti persons trying to obtain short stay visas for Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":338,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that visa applications received from residents of Kuwait are processed by the Visa Office in Abu Dhabi.

The Working Group, chaired by Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Michael D'Arcy TD, is undertaking a review of the factors which are influencing the increased cost of insurance, and brings together the relevant Departments and Offices involved.  The Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance was published in January 2018 and is available on the website of the Department of Finance. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is the lead in relation to Recommendation 6 of the Report which aims at amending the wording of section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to ensure that defendants are notified of a claim having been lodged against them. The intention is not to interfere with the discretion of the courts to deal with cases appropriately but to assist in enhancing the effectiveness of the statutory requirement for a plaintiff to serve a notice in writing on the defendant stating the nature of the wrong alleged to have been committed by him or her. <\/p>  <p>  Among the amendments recommended to be made to section 8 is a reduction from two months to one month in the statutory time period for a plaintiff in a personal injuries action to serve a notice in writing on the alleged wrongdoer stating the nature of the wrong alleged to have been committed by him or her. In the view of the Working Group, this may be justified by way of being in alignment with data protection legislation which provides that data shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is obtained. This is relevant for personal injuries cases where CCTV may have captured relevant footage. Generally, the retention period for data protection purposes is one month, beyond which retention is only permitted in certain circumstances, including for example, in the context of an investigation. <\/p>  <p>  In keeping with the relevant recommendations and timelines of the Working Group the relevant amendments to section 8 are under preparation at my Department so that a suitable legislative vehicle can be availed of for their timely introduction and enactment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700075#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Fraud","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700075#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[28160\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700075#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if amendments to sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability Act 2004 will be considered in order to make it a matter of routine that misleading insurance claims are reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>The issues raised by the Deputy are among those being considered by the Cost of Insurance Working Group that was established by the Minister for Finance in July 2016 and is chaired by Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy TD.  The objective of the Working Group is to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of insurance, and recommend short, medium and longer term measures to address the issue of increasing insurance costs, taking account of the requirement for the need to ensure a financially stable insurance sector.  A significant factor identified by the Working Group in its reports, which are available with action updates on the Department of Finance website, is the impact of fraudulent insurance claims. <\/p>  <p>  In its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance published in January 2017, the Working Group reviewed sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  It noted that the number of recorded prosecutions and convictions for the offence of false evidence in section 25 is very low and that this suggests a need for further co-operation between the insurance industry and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Working Group noted its understanding that while the majority of the initial applications in respect of fraudulent actions under section 26 were refused it would appear from more recent reported judgments that more claims are now being dismissed following a successful action under section 26.  The Working Group concluded that it is satisfied that sections 25 and 26 do not need further review. <\/p>  <p>  However, a number of other measures are being taken by way of ensuring that sections 25 and 26 can have their intended effect in relation to insurance fraud. Key to this approach has been the convening of a roundtable by the Department of Finance in late 2017 to listen to the views of key stakeholders in relation to insurance fraud and which has met several times since to progress a number of specific recommendations contained in the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s Report of January 2018 relating to the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance. Recommendations 11 and 12 of that report concern the production of statistics by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service on complaints, investigations, prosecutions and convictions relating to fraud within the personal injuries area. My Department has liaised with the Garda authorities in relation to the production of these statistics, and I am informed that the necessary Pulse update is anticipated to be in place by the end of June 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 13 of the same report recommends that Insurance Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions agree a set of guidelines in respect of the reporting of suspected fraudulent insurance claims. While guidelines were published in 2004, the Working Group noted that these have only been used to a very limited extent over the years and proposed that a new set of guidelines should be developed, using the 2004 iteration as a starting point.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the intention to use the existing guidelines to inform the drafting of new, more fit for purpose guidelines, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na produced a draft document which was communicated to Insurance Ireland. The draft document proposed a number of changes to the section of the existing guidelines concerning the station or section within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to which a formal complaint should be made.  Insurance Ireland signalled its agreement with the changes proposed at the fraud roundtable session of 26 March. It was agreed that further consultations with stakeholders regarding the proposed guidelines would take place, including with insurance providers not represented by Insurance Ireland. Two such consultations have already been held and the next meeting of the Roundtable, scheduled for later this week, will aim to finalise the new guidelines in the context of the feedback received.  Agreement on the new set of guidelines is expected to be completed on time in Quarter 3 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The fraud roundtable process also intends to examine the follow-on procedure in circumstances where fraud or exaggeration is identified in court or acknowledged by a judge.  Recommendation 12 of the Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance proposes that where an application under Section 26 of the Civil Liability Act 2004 is successful, this fact should be communicated to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the Courts Service. I understand that the fraud roundtable is currently engaging with the Courts Service in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  As I think the Deputy will appreciate from these developments, a concerted policy approach is being taken with the support of the Cost of Insurance Working Group to address the issue of insurance fraud.  This is being done by means of a series of mutually reinforcing measures that will include the type of enhanced Garda reporting that the Deputy has raised.  At the same time they are intended, in their collective implementation, to give greater effect to the existing provisions of sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700075#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":365,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[28161\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700075#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to establish an insurance fraud unit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":366,"content":"<p>Recommendation 26 of the &lsquo;Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance&rsquo;, published in January 2017, relates to exploring the potential for further cooperation between the insurance sector and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to insurance fraud investigation.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains close contact with local and senior management in Irish Rail and other transport providers.

This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and Part 13 of the Act which provide for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.<\/p>  <p>   While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle this problem head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone. Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians of our young, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding. These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by society in general. We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700075#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":370,"content":"<p>Question No. 165 answered with Question No. 152.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700075#WRG02400"},{"type":"question","counter":372,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[28399\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700075#WRG02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if e-car charging points are provided at his Department's buildings in Dublin or in other locations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":373,"content":"<p>My Department does not have e-car charging points in any of its Departmental offices.

This includes markets that are growing as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Enterprise 2025 Renewed strategy published in March 2018 sets out targets for export growth and diversification within the indigenous exporting base, with ambitions to increase exports as a percentage of total sales of Irish owned companies from 52 percent to between 55 and 60 percent by 2020 and increase Enterprise Ireland client exports beyond UK markets from &euro;14.1 billion to &euro;17.4 billion by 2020. The strategy also targets a 50 percent increase in the number of FDI investments from non-US markets by 2020.   <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched its Eurozone Strategy as a key element of its supports to help companies diversify their export markets. In particular, it aims to increase exports to the Eurozone by &euro;2bn per annum by 2020, equivalent to 50 percent increase. This would represent one of the most significant shifts in Enterprise Ireland supported client exports into the Eurozone and is particularly important in the context of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, Ireland Connected, supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.  Enterprise Ireland delivered an impressive programme of international trade events in 2017, giving Irish companies the opportunity to meet with potential buyers and network with key influencers in countries around the world.  In total, 57 internationally focused trade events were organised by Enterprise Ireland in 2017 including ministerial-led trade missions to Canada, Singapore, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and a major trade programme as part of the State visit to Australia and New Zealand.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to 2018, the programme of ministerial-led trade missions and events has been finalised and published by Enterprise Ireland, with 70 Ministerial-led trade visits planned to 33 different markets, including to date missions to the USA, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Poland and Czech Republic. Missions to EU markets will be a priority focus for the 2018 programme, together with missions to key markets where the EU has or is negotiating free trade agreements.  As part of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ldquo;Promote Ireland&rdquo; Programmes, Ministerial visits around the world were organised to ensure that we use this exposure to maximise the promotion of Ireland's trade, tourism and investment interests. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in June 2018, the Government formally launched the &lsquo;Global Ireland &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025&rsquo; initiative. Global Ireland will support efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism, as Brexit becomes a reality. It will ensure that Ireland is better positioned to build the alliances necessary to advance its interests and defend its positions in a post-Brexit EU, while also helping to secure our deep and positive relationship with the UK and its constituent parts into the future. Under the Global Ireland initiative Enterprise Ireland will further increase the diversification of client exports into new markets, with the ambition that 70% of exports will go to markets beyond the UK by 2025.<\/p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors.  The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  In this regard Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The EU&ndash;Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) entered into force provisionally from the 21st September 2017.  Irish companies may now take advantage of the all-important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.  CETA presents new opportunities for Irish business and professionals to work and provide services in Canada.<\/p>  <p>  On the 21st April 2018, the EU and Mexico reached an agreement in principle on a new trade agreement that will be part of the broader Global Agreement.  The Agreement will provide a platform to increase Irish exports to Mexico, the current total value is just over &euro;2 billion per year with total imports of nearly half a billion euros per year.  It will further remove industrial tariffs and important agricultural tariffs.  This will be significant for Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector especially for dairy, pork and poultry products.  Ireland is a significant exporter to Mexico of powdered milk and milk derivatives but there are currently significant barriers both to increasing powdered milk exports and to commencing exports of fresh dairy produce.  There are many exciting opportunities in Mexico for Irish businesses including manufacturing, automotive, engineering, telecommunications, ICT, aerospace, software and service and manufacturing technology.  The Agreement will also open up public procurement markets to Irish businesses and remove technical barriers to trade which will reduce the costs of entry to the Mexican market.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is continuing its negotiations with Mercosur and recently announced the successful conclusion of negotiations of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.

This is particularly important in the context of Brexit and the need to support companies to diversify their product and market bases.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo; supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.\u00a0 Enterprise Ireland delivered 57 internationally focused trade events in 2017 including ministerial-led trade missions to Canada, Singapore, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and a major trade programme as part of the State visit to Australia and New Zealand.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to 2018, the programme of ministerial-led trade missions and events has been finalised and published by Enterprise Ireland, with 70 Ministerial-led trade visits planned to 33 different markets, including to date missions to the USA, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Poland and Czech Republic. Missions to EU markets will be a priority focus for the 2018 programme, together with missions to key markets where the EU has or is negotiating free trade agreements.\u00a0 As part of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ldquo;Promote Ireland&rdquo; Programmes, Ministerial visits around the world were organised to ensure that we use this exposure to maximise the promotion of Ireland's trade, tourism and investment interests. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in June 2018, the Government formally launched the &ldquo;Global Ireland &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025&rdquo; initiative, which is the most ambitious renewal and expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s international presence ever undertaken, including the objective of opening at least 26 new diplomatic missions and expansion of our agencies including the overseas networks of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Board Bia. Global Ireland will support efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism, as Brexit becomes a reality. It will ensure that Ireland is better positioned to build the alliances necessary to advance its interests and defend its positions in a post-Brexit EU, while also helping to secure our deep and positive relationship with the UK and its constituent parts into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically, Global Ireland 2025 aims to strengthen our presence in the United States, including a new flagship &lsquo;Ireland House&rsquo; &ndash; a hub for diplomacy, trade, business and cultural promotion in Los Angeles, and expanding our presence elsewhere in the Americas. It will also expand our presence in the Asia-Pacific region, including a new flagship Ireland House in Tokyo. It also strengthens our presence in North and West Africa, and in the Middle East and Gulf region as well as augmenting diplomatic and agency presence across our main European markets. <\/p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies and embassies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors.\u00a0 The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more.\u00a0 These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland.\u00a0 With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.\u00a0 In this regard Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  The EU&ndash;Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) entered into force provisionally from the 21st September 2017.\u00a0 Irish companies may now take advantage of the all-important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.\u00a0 CETA presents new opportunities for Irish business and professionals to work and provide services in Canada.<\/p>  <p>  On the 21st April 2018, the EU and Mexico reached an agreement in principle on a new trade agreement that will be part of the broader Global Agreement.\u00a0 The Agreement will provide a platform to increase Irish exports to Mexico, the current total value is just over &euro;2 billion per year with total imports of nearly half a billion euros per year.\u00a0 It will further remove industrial tariffs and important agricultural tariffs.\u00a0 This will be significant for Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector especially for dairy, pork and poultry products.\u00a0 Ireland is a significant exporter to Mexico of powdered milk and milk derivatives but there are currently significant barriers both to increasing powdered milk exports and to commencing exports of fresh dairy produce.\u00a0 There are many exciting opportunities in Mexico for Irish businesses including manufacturing, automotive, engineering, telecommunications, ICT, aerospace, software and service and manufacturing technology.\u00a0 The Agreement will also open up public procurement markets to Irish businesses and remove technical barriers to trade which will reduce the costs of entry to the Mexican market.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is continuing its negotiations with Mercosur and recently announced the successful conclusion of negotiations of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.\u00a0 The agri-food sector, in particular will see benefits from access to Japan&rsquo;s highly valuable export market, with improved access for beef, pork, cheese and processed agricultural products.\u00a0 In addition, the EU&rsquo;s trade deal with Singapore is hoped to come into force by the end of the year, creating further opportunities across a diverse range of sectors for Irish-based enterprises.\u00a0In May 2018, the Trade Council of Ministers adopted a decision authorising the opening of negotiations on free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand, as well as adoption of the respective negotiating directives for the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new FTA&rsquo;s giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.\u00a0Ireland continues to actively articulate its trade interests at EU level at the Trade Council and through collaboration with like-minded Member States, in addition to active participation and representation at the World Trade Organisation.

The objective is to deepen our understanding of how Ireland can best take advantage of these opportunities, and ensure that our businesses are prepared to access new markets.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I and my colleague Ministers of State in the Department as well as Ministers across Government, avail ourselves of numerous opportunities to meet international Government colleagues, industry groups and individual companies during each year to promote our trade growth, diversification and FDI strategies. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700075#WRG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":387,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700075#WRG04100"},{"type":"question","counter":388,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[28388\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700075#WRG04200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if e-car charging points are provided at her Department's buildings in Dublin or in other locations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":389,"content":"<p>Accommodation for my Department is provided by the Office of Public Works (OPW) in buildings which are either State owned or leased by OPW on our behalf.

In this regard, my Department is currently finalising an implementation plan in response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report, with a focus on the initial three year period.\u00a0 It is my intention to bring proposals to Government before the summer recess and to publish\u00a0the implementation plan shortly thereafter.\u00a0While I accept that this is later than originally envisaged, it is important that we get it right.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have already acted on several of the specific recommendations proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare report. A Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office is being established in the Department of Health and a provision of &euro;1 million was made available for the Office in Budget 2018. This office will be tasked with implementing a programme of reform, as agreed by Government, arising from the Sl&aacute;intecare Report. The process for the appointment of an Executive Director to lead the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office has been managed independently by the Public Appointments Service. This has been a thorough process involving a national and international executive search. An appointment will be made shortly. <\/p>  <p>  An independent board for the HSE is being established as recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare report. The General Scheme of a Bill has been published and it is hoped that legislation will be enacted this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Report recommended the removal of private practice from public hospitals. I have established an Independent Review Group to\u00a0examine how private practice can be removed from public hospitals. It will report later this year.<\/p>  <p>  A public consultation on the geographical alignment of Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations has recently been completed and responses are being analysed.\u00a0This will inform work on broader health service structural reform as recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Government has demonstrated significant commitment to invest in our health and social care services since the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report. Funding for new initiatives in Budget 2018 were closely aligned with proposals in Sl&aacute;intecare. In addition, funding of &euro;10.9 billion has been ear-marked for health projects in the National\u00a0Development Plan.

The most recent CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions data shows that in 2016 the at-risk-of-poverty rate was 5.6% for those aged 16 years or over with a principal economic status of &lsquo;at work&rsquo;.  This was a reduction on the 2015 figure of 5.8%.   Eurostat data (calculated on a basis that differs slightly from the CSO measure) suggests that in-work poverty is relatively low here; the Eurostat estimate for Ireland in 2016 is 4.8%, as compared with the EU average of 9.5%.<\/p>  <p>  Consistent poverty refers to people who are both on relatively low incomes and experiencing deprivation.  The consistent poverty rate in 2016 was 8.3 per cent for the overall population, down from 8.7 per cent in 2015.  Numerically, 395,000 people were in consistent poverty in 2016, based on the 2016 Census population figure of 4.76m.    An analysis of consistent poverty rates by principal economic status shows that the consistent poverty rate was lowest among those who were at work (1.9%).  <\/p>  <p>  The full impact of the recovery is not reflected in these 2016 figures for Ireland.  Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports has continued to fall.  With these improvements, the Government was in a position to introduce a range of welfare increases from 2016 onwards.  Measures include increases in core weekly rates for working-age adults, child benefit, income disregards for lone parents, rent limits for housing support payments and new initiatives to make work pay, such as the Back to Work Family Dividend. <\/p>  <p>  Income supports play an important role in addressing poverty.  The Working Family Payment (WFP)   (formerly known as Family Income Supplement (FIS)) and Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) are important in-work supports for this group.  WFP is an in-work support which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings with children.  It is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  The BTWFD is a targeted scheme designed to further improve the incentive to take-up employment or self-employment for welfare recipients with children.  In 2016, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate for people of working-age from 33.6% to 16.5%.  This equated to a poverty reduction effect of 50.9%. <\/p>  <p>  Recent budgets have been forward looking, allocating limited resources in a prudent way, to make sure that everyone benefits from the recovery.  The focus of these budgets has also been on the provision of services rather than simply on income supports (e.g. extension of the School Meals Scheme and the Single Affordable Childcare Scheme).<\/p>  <p>  The Social Impact Assessment of Budget 2018 show average household incomes increasing by 1.1% (&euro;11.40 per week).  They also provided greater rewards for working, with over 80% of the unemployed substantially better-off in work and almost 25% of the working population experiencing a reduction in their Marginal Effective Tax Rate   with little to no impact predicted for a further 69% of the working population. <\/p>  <p>  The improvement in the economy, together with the welfare measures referred to, are likely to have supported a reduction in poverty since the period in 2016 to which the SILC publication refers.  This improvement is expected to continue with further rises in incomes and living standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700079#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"One-Parent Family Payment Data","counter":608,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700079#WRL02900"},{"type":"question","counter":609,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[28089\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062700079#WRL03000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons in receipt of one parent family allowance by county in tabular form;

The intention was that this investment would be off-balance sheet and in Budget 2015,\u00a0the Government announced that &euro;400m of public investment would be made available, including the proceeds from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is, to provide 2,000 homes. The objective was that this investment could leverage private sector finance from the EIB, ISIF, pension funds, credit unions and other financial institutions.<\/p>  <p>  A structured, formal process was put in place to facilitate engagement with these bodies.\u00a0 A body called the Social Housing Investment Proposals Clearing House Group was established in 2015\u00a0to examine and consider proposals and to meet with the companies, groups and institutions involved. However, despite a detailed investigation of options to use the available funding in this way, including a high level of engagement with potential social housing providers and potential financiers of social housing, no new model could be identified that would, of itself, be capable of providing and\/or financing social housing on an off-balance sheet basis and that would be capable of utilising the available funding.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In response to this outcome, it was decided\u00a0to\u00a0modify the original commitment in relation to the &euro;400m funding to provide &euro;10m per annum, indexed for inflation, over a longer period (20 years), which could be used to secure the development of a pilot affordable rental scheme, as envisaged in Rebuilding Ireland. Provision was made for &euro;10 million to be allocated to my Department's Vote in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore and taking account of the work and analysis of the Clearing House Group, it was subsequently considered that it would be more constructive to use the existing social housing funding and support mechanisms and, where appropriate, make adjustments to those mechanisms, in order to provide a framework with more realistic prospects of harnessing private investment in an off-balance sheet manner.<\/p>  <p>  This approach resulted in the design of an alternative delivery mechanism, the Enhanced Long-term Leasing Social Housing Scheme, which was launched on 31 January 2018.\u00a0Funding is in place to support the delivery of this new scheme and the principal objective of the scheme is to encourage larger levels of private investment in social housing, while ensuring that the resulting leasing arrangement is off-balance sheet in respect of Government expenditure.
