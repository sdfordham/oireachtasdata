He also implied that because the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation did not stay in the talks, the same concession was not being made available to newly qualified nurses.  According to the Irish National Teachers Organisation website, new teacher entrants will begin a process of equalisation.

If we are prepared to acknowledge that a proposal is unfair and is discriminatory, how can it be alleviated with the spin over the past couple of days?  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, asked people to swallow hard as this is the best deal that could be done and it is the last time the Government will go to the cupboard, however bare it is.

One of these is the promise of the Taoiseach to the late Mr. John Cunningham, former editor of the <i>Connacht Tribune<\/i>, when he said the shortfall in funding for the Galway Hospice Foundation would be addressed and there would be support for expansion.  The commitment was given by the Taoiseach to the late Mr. Cunningham before his death in November 2011, and it was renewed by the Taoiseach some months later when he said:<ul><br>In due course you can take it that John Cunningham's words meant a lot to me that night when I was out there (visiting John at the hospice) with Deputy Brian Walsh.  I tend not to forget things like that.  If you like, in a personal sense, to me, it was his last request and it is one that I would like to see we can stand over.<\/ul><\/p> <p>It is appropriate that I put that on the record because it is a matter of great concern to the Galway Hospice Foundation, the Cunningham family and others in Galway that there still has not been movement on this important and sensitive commitment.  It is important that there would not be a cut in funding, as is feared, for Galway hospice this year.  There is talk of a cut of between 1.6% and 5% but that must not happen.  Galway hospice does a great deal of work.  It has never received capital funding and it is being forced to draw on its own reserves.  It does considerable funding of its own to cover its home-care services.  Funding from the HSE, which amounts to 70% of it funding, covers its inpatient services.  The hospice hopes to expand and it must be allowed to do that and not have to cut back.  We should remember that hospice care saves the State a great deal in what it would otherwise have to spend caring for people in hospitals.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach was sincere when he made that commitment but it is important that he or his office would communicate with the Cunningham family and the hospice and that the Government's will would be made known to the HSE, through the Department of Health, in this instance because it is important that some promises be kept.<\/p><p>I am conscious of the time and I will postpone until tomorrow the other comment I was going to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600004#C00500","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361890200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I am also conscious of the time constraints and I will be brief.

Last December, I promised when the report of the advisory group on tax and social welfare on child and family income supports was published that we would have a productive discussion on the issues involved.  The report is a major contribution in a difficult policy area which has been examined on many occasions over the past 30 years.  I thank the chair of the group, Ms Ita Mangan, and the members for their excellent work.  The report maps out the various alternatives and provides an impact assessment of what reform might bring.  Crucially, it sets out the practical requirements of any reforms for families and the public administration system.  The Government will have to consider in depth these issues, and others which the report was not tasked with addressing, before arriving at any decisions.<\/p><p>I will begin with some context.  The Department of Social Protection provides a very wide range of income supports to families and their children through the social protection system.  Their importance is underlined by the fact that the Department will spend well over \u20ac2.8 billion this year on various child-related payments.  This accounts for approximately 14% of the total \u20ac20 billion social protection budget.  In turn, child benefit accounts for two-thirds of expenditure on child and family income supports, being paid to 609,000 families in respect of 1.16 million children.<\/p><p>In the budget I maintained child benefit as a universal payment at high rates despite pressure to cut it by much larger amounts.  As Senators know, child benefit is not the only payment the Department of Social Protection makes in respect of children.  The Department also provides child income support payments to low-income families through additions to the main social welfare payments.  Qualified child increases, or the amounts paid to dependent children, are paid in respect of 516,000 children.  The family income supplement, for which people at work on low incomes qualify, is paid in respect of 57,000 children.  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is paid in respect of 377,000 children.<\/p> <p> One of the very important contributions of the report is that it considers these payments in the round, rather than separately.  While people refer to it as a report on child benefit it is actually a report on child income supports of which child benefit is obviously an extremely important and most costly element.  As I said, one of the important contributions of the report is that it considers these payments in the round.  It sets out two primary objectives of these important supports to family and children.  First, they assist all families with the costs of raising children.  Second, they play a role in reducing poverty in households with children.  These objectives are particularly significant during a time of recession and high unemployment.<\/p><p>The effectiveness of these payments in addressing these objectives has been called into question by various reports.  Although Ireland spends significantly more on cash benefits than other OECD countries, better outcomes are obtained elsewhere for similar or even lower levels of spending.  Put another way, we have very high levels of direct payments such as child benefit yet our system is less effective at reducing child poverty.  Cash support payments for children are only one part of the jigsaw in addressing the issue of child poverty.  We have discussed the issue of cash income versus family supports, such as pre-school support, on a number of occasions in this House.  Equally important issues include how we design income supports for adults; how we support parents in taking up employment; and what services we should provide.  I will return to these issues in a minute.<\/p><p>With regard to cash supports, a key challenge is how to achieve a greater degree of targeting while improving poverty outcomes and employment incentives.  That was why, in line with commitments in the programme for Government, I established the advisory group on tax and social welfare.  It was requested to examine a number of specific issues and make cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.  The group prioritised the area of family and child income supports.  I was pleased to publish this report last week after having reflected on its content with my colleagues in Government.  The group's report makes important recommendations as to how child benefit could be maintained as a universal payment while at the same time reforming the system to better target those who most need these supports.<\/p><p>First and foremost, I welcome the group's firm recommendation that the universal nature of child benefit be maintained.  Since becoming Minister for Social Protection I have strongly defended the universality of child benefit because the State must value every child and support families.  The fact that every family receives child benefit, regardless of their employment status, also ensures that there is not a disincentive for parents to work.  One receives child benefit whether one is in work or not.  There is also what the report terms the &quot;intra household distribution of resources&quot;.  It is a fact that children's and women's rights groups have frequently called for the universal element of child benefit to be maintained.  One of the reasons is that payments are usually made to mothers - 96% of child benefit payments are made to mothers currently - and in households where income is not shared this can be an absolutely vital financial resource for the caring parent, usually the mother.  It is my absolute conviction, for those and other reasons, that we should maintain child benefit as a universal payment and I am very glad that the group found likewise.<\/p><p>With regard to its other findings, it should be noted that the group concluded that there is no one perfect method to target child and family income supports.  It is true that some members of the group found that taxation of child benefit is an attractive reform option.  It was recognised that the approach, being limited to just child benefit alone, does not contribute to a better overall design of the child and family income support system.  For this and other reasons there was a strong preference expressed by the group, in its report, for another approach based on a two-tier payment system.  That proposal has been discussed on many previous occasions.<\/p> <p> Under this approach the advisory group suggests rebalancing and integrating child and family income support payments as follows.  First, a universal first-tier payment in respect of all children, which would replace the current child benefit payment but will be a child benefit payment as we now know it.  Second, a child income support supplement or second-tier payment for low-income families, which would replace the current qualified child increases as well as family income supplement.  The group felt this would allow for a rationalisation of the overall child income support system while minimising work disincentives and allowing for better flexibility in the targeting of support for different household types.<\/p><p>As I have indicated, the Government has made no decision at this time on the core recommendations of the report, given the complexities of the issues involved.  These include fiscal, operational and legal considerations and the implications for reforms in terms of child poverty and employment incentive outcomes.<\/p><p>The advisory group's report was primarily concerned with the issue of income supports for children and their families.  The role that services might play in improving outcomes for children is another crucial consideration, although this aspect was not considered in detail by the group given that its focus was primarily on the tax and social welfare systems.<\/p><p>In this regard, I am conscious that countries - particularly in Scandinavia - that spend significantly more on child-related services and supports, tend to have better child poverty outcomes than other OECD countries, including ourselves.<\/p><p>The Government's response, therefore, cannot be limited to child benefit or the child income support system alone.  We must also consider the crucial issue of services.  In the budget, for example, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I, announced another 6,000 after-school child care places.  We also announced a series of other initiatives concerning children from less economically advantaged households, which we discussed at the time of the budget.  They are being funded out of the child benefit reductions in the budget.<\/p><p>This was a highly progressive step towards better services for children and I am anxious that we should continue this progress as a society.  That is why I would like to see the debate on this report include a discussion on how income supports and services might be balanced to achieve better child poverty outcomes.  In the same vein, the Government response to the issue will have to be multi-faceted, addressing more than just the cash payments issue.  It will also have to consider the fact that significant savings have already been made to the child benefit budget in particular.<\/p><p>The response will have to consider the other pressures on families right now.  I am acutely aware, for instance, that many families on what we would term middle-incomes - that is, good incomes and good salaries - are struggling, particularly because of crippling mortgages.  There is a whole group of such people in the 35 to 50 age group, many of whom have three children.  They may have bought a family residence at the height of the boom.  Child benefit is a very important source of cash income for such households.  In some of those households one parent may have had a good business, perhaps in construction, but that is now gone.  <\/p><p>In some cases, people are relying on child benefit to pay or contribute to the mortgages they took out during the boom time of high prices.  That is why I say it is not a case of framing a stand-alone response to this report.  Importantly, as the report itself notes, any changes would not necessarily have to be implemented over a single budget or in a single year.<\/p><p>I have also asked the senior assistant secretary in charge of operations in my Department to commission an outline of how reforms will be implemented and the time-lines involved.  I have said elsewhere, and wish to reiterate it now, that the minimum implementation time for this is 18 months, if all goes smoothly.  This support is for 600,000 families whereas recent ones were only for 60,000 third-level applicants, and they ran into difficulties.<\/p> <p>One must allow a little headroom for perhaps taking a little longer.  Consequently, what is now needed is an extensive debate on the issues both in the report and related to the report.  To this end and in addition to this evening's debate in the Seanad, the advisory group's report will be considered in a few weeks' time by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  I look forward to hearing the views of Oireachtas Members and indeed the views of other stakeholders as part of a broader public debate.<\/p><p>Last week, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor, unveiled the social investment package, which is an array of measures to build growth and social cohesion.  The package includes a recommendation on fighting child poverty.  Speaking on that issue, the Commissioner stated, &quot;Reducing inequality at a young age by investing in early childhood education and care must be a shared commitment of all our national governments&quot;.  It is a firm commitment of the present Government, which is the reason it is worthwhile spending a considerable amount of time in debating this issue to get it right.  One study the advisory group also is undertaking specifically relates to the use of tax credits.  I do not have that report as yet and it obviously is particularly important in the context of family income supplement, which is a very valuable payment to those families which seek and receive it.  Again, however, down through the years, there have been many critiques of its effectiveness and the strength of its take-up, because one must avail of it via one's employer and some people may not wish their employer to be aware they are in receipt of family income supplement.  Consequently, I look forward to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600008#G00300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361892300,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire and welcome her to the House yet again.  It is interesting that the Minister concluded her presentation by referring to a quote from the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion in which he stated that investing in early childhood education and care must be a shared commitment.  The Minister noted it is a firm commitment of the present Administration.  However, I suggest to the Minister, with respect, that while this may be a firm commitment of the Minister, I am not so sure the evidence indicates it is a firm commitment of the present Government because all that has happened under the present Government and its predecessor has been a slash-and-burn approach in terms of child benefit reductions.  I am grateful to one of those who served on the Minister's committee, Mary Murphy, who wrote a critique on this issue that was published in <i>The Irish Times.<\/i>  I also watched her appearance on the &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot; television programme with great interest on the day the Magdalen report was published.  When pressed by Vincent Browne, she was highly consistent regarding the savings that were being made.  I understand that were these proposals to be implemented, the figure being mentioned at the time of the report's publication was approximately &#8364;200 million.  She used a very interesting term - I am sorry I did not think of it myself - when she stated the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was hovering like a vulture over the Department of Social Protection.

Expenditure on child benefit under the previous Administration decreased from \u20ac2.5 billion to \u20ac2.1 billion, which is a decrease of half a billion euro, from 2009 to 2011.  During the period in which the advisory group was pursuing its work, child benefit was cut by a further \u20ac70 million in the 2012 budget and \u20ac140 million in the most recent budget.  This comprises a further \u20ac210 million or another words, more than \u20ac700 million has been cut from child benefit since 2009 with absolutely no reform of any sort.  However, I compliment the Minister on at least setting up this committee because as I stated earlier, I have deep respect for the Minister's reforming views, at least it is a start.  As has been observed, these cuts were just that, namely, cuts and not reforms.  There were no compensation measures to soften the blow and this has been the reason there has been so much anger over these particular proposals arising from the Mangan report.  Speaking personally and perhaps not necessarily for a position taken by my party, I have thought for a long time that there is an urgent need to reform the entire area of child benefit.<\/p> <p>It looks like a cycle that commenced in the boom years, which increased child benefit year-on-year, to the extent that at some point it became astronomical yet no distinction was made between those who could afford not to take child benefit and those who needed it.  Although successive Governments from 2002 to 2007 and beyond did implement a capital programme of enhancement of child care provision, which was the envy of all and much good money was spent from 1997 onwards of which we have seen the benefit, there does not seem to have been an appetite for reform of the child benefit system.  The view seemed to be that we should just keep shovelling out more money in child benefit in order to ensure that everyone would be happy.  However, the cost of living increased \u2013 it went through the roof \u2013 and in many cases child care costs became even more expensive than mortgage repayments.<\/p><p>The latest survey on living and income conditions shows that from 2009 to 2011, consistent child poverty increased from 8.7% to 9.3% and child deprivation rates rose from 25% to 32%.  More than 100,000 children now experience consistent poverty.  Ireland is the only OECD country with above average child cash transfers but only average child poverty rates.  The Minister referred to that in terms of the Scandinavian model.  I know where she is coming from in that regard.  I agree with her.  One thing that could be done almost immediately would be to introduce a second year of the early childhood care and education scheme.<\/p><p>I accept the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, has already spoken on the record on the matter.  She also set off a timebomb when she suggested that child benefit money should be redirected into a different area such as support services rather than having universal payment.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, shares the view.  Such an approach could be implemented on a staggered basis but it is not something that could be done with the current fiscal problems that face the Government.  That is the main reason most of the commentary on the report has been negative.  All one can see is not reform but more cuts and the money disappearing into the black hole of the Exchequer in order to shore up the deficit.  Surely the Minister will be faced in the coming months with yet more demands from her Department, which is a big-spending Department, to address the removal of another \u20ac2.5 billion to \u20ac3 billion from the economy in the next budget.  The Minister has said on record that the promissory note money should be used, but as we all know, even if it could be used, the money will not come on-stream until next year.  The budget must be framed for 2014 in the coming months under the Estimates.  I have no doubt that the hovering vultures of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will come to her Department to demand more money on the basis that it has not given enough.<\/p><p>It is a sad reflection on society in general, not on the Minister personally or the Government, that in 2010 one quarter of children lived in jobless households.  The total of 56% of Irish adults in jobless households with children compares with the EU average of 24%, which is a scandal.  The central proposal in the Mangan report was to retain universal child benefit and to develop a new second-tier payment to replace child dependant additions.  A flexible model was proposed on which the Minister has gone into detail in her presentation.  Unfortunately, I do not have time to go into detail on the proposal.  According to Mary Murphy, the illustrative figures in the Mangan report of \u20ac25 per week for child benefit and \u20ac38 per week for the second-tier payment have been &quot;roundly and justifiably critiqued&quot; as too low.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister well in terms of what she is attempting to do but I do not believe that what will happen in the short term is what she is setting out to achieve.  I do not expect the proposals to be implemented, but if they are, I urge the Minister to fight to maintain the \u20ac200 million rather than let it disappear into the budget on the basis of having \u20ac200 million less to pay back to whoever it is we are supposed to pay it back to.  I wish the Minister well in that regard.  I hope she will be back in this House to tell us more about her reforming initiatives in that regard because such changes can only be implemented on a piecemeal basis.  That underlies the problem of the recommendations in the Mangan report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600011#K00500","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361892900,"counter":65,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome to the House.  I thank her for bringing the report before us as we have been awaiting it for some time.  The debate about child benefit is an important one.  For a long time the payment has gone specifically to the mother for the benefit of children.<\/p> <p>The question we face is if we should continue with it as it is, where everyone gets the same amount, or should we target it to people according to need.  In principle, I support a universal payment because it sends a strong message to society that we value children and we must never lose that.  We have seen that we have a history of shame in this country where we have not valued children.  Let us not forget that.  The report states that clearly as well.<\/p><p>Child benefit might be a universal payment but that does not mean all children or families should get the same amount.  There are two major proposals: the two tier system or the tax system.  Initially, I favoured a two tier system but I have since studied the topic and I am now coming down on the side of taxation.  There are 90 people in the Letterkenny office that delivers child benefit and that is a lot of people.  The Minister is working with limited resources and trying to do the loaves and fishes every year.  When setting up this new system, we must ensure the system is fair so those who deserve child benefit get it.  The Revenue Commissioners should be able to take care of this because once it is set up, it should be easily processed through the taxation system.  I agree it will be difficult to set up - look at what happened with SUSI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600012#L00200","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361893500,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I did not mention that once.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600013#M00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1361893500,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I am mentioning it now.  We must learn from that and do it correctly.  By leaving child benefit as a stand-alone office in Letterkenny, is this transactional service not a waste of time that could be moved through the taxation system?  I am not saying these people in Letterkenny should not have jobs or be in the system, but they would be better deployed in places like MABS and community welfare.  I spent some time with MABS yesterday and it is so squeezed it is on the verge of disaster.  I know 15 more people have been appointed nationally but the Galway office alone could use 15 people there is such demand.<\/p><p>The two tier system would provide for anyone earning under \u20ac25,000 to get a top-up and I support that in principle because people need a certain amount  of cash to be able to live.  The cost of living here is very high.  It is clear, however, as the Minister acknowledged, that the middle class is being screwed for working hard.  The middle class pays all the bills and any system that is set up, be it two tier or taxation, must have allowable essential deductions.  We must decide if a mortgage of \u20ac200,000 is allowable.  A family with an income of less than \u20ac25,000 might live in local authority housing so the family who went out and paid for their home must be given credit for it.  There must also be essential deductions for ESB and food.  In a way, a person on \u20ac50,000 or \u20ac60,000 may have less net income after mortgage and expenses while a person on social welfare automatically gets benefits such as the medical card, which is worth a fortune.  I meet families in the squeezed middle who are skipping doctors and, in particular, dental appointments.  A teenager in a family could need dental work costing \u20ac2,000.  The mother would be on to MABS wondering how to take care of that, and trying to deal with the bank through the MARPS process, which I am on record as saying is not working.<\/p><\/a> <p>Ulster Bank has advised the family, through the mortgage arrears resolution process, to travel to Ballymena to have their teeth done.  A family of five has been told it is excessive to spend \u20ac200 per week on food.  Another person I know was told to sell the car and buy a bicycle to travel to work, even though it is not possible for the person in question to travel to work by bike.<\/p><p>We need joined up thinking on this issue.  The system must be fair and cost as little as possible.  The Minister should use departmental staff in the child benefit section in Letterkenny to establish a fair system.  I do not understand the reason 90 staff are required in that section given that it will be possible, under the proposed new system, to operate child benefit through the taxation system.  I propose that the Minister eliminate the administrative side of the section by adding child benefit payments to existing social welfare benefits or, in the case of families on low to middle incomes, by making the payment through the taxation system.  The savings achieved should be used to provide a small top-up to low income families, that is, those who qualify on the basis of allowable essential deductions, and the remainder - approximately \u20ac200 million - invested in better child care and after-school services, specialist services for children with ADHD and dyslexia and creative centres for those children whom the education system does not reach.<\/p><p>Two years ago, I did a study of early school leaving for the Oireachtas, which showed that in some cases money spent early in a child's life delivers a return at a ratio of 9:1, in other words, every euro spent delivers a \u20ac9 return in later life.  A 2006 report from the UCD Geary Institute attests to the importance of early investment to society as a whole, while a 2011 OECD report, Doing Better for Families, shows Ireland is second only to Switzerland among OECD countries in respect of the cost of child care.  Poor children benefit from universal services.  Let us stand together on this issue and ensure we get it right as to do so will change society for the better.  We need to eliminate wasteful administration and make better use of staff across the public service.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600013#M00300","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361893800,"counter":70,"content":"<\/a> <p>I welcome the Minister and thank her for keeping her promise to bring the report before the House.  This is a welcome report as it provides us with a strong evidence base, thus allowing us to move from an anecdotal discussion to one based on evidence.  I understand this debate will be the first in a series of discussions in the Seanad on this report.  I note also that other Senators in my group, including Senator Zappone, would like to speak on the report.<\/p><p>We are all too aware of the serious impact that six successive budgets have had in reducing social welfare payments.  These cuts have created a greater risk of poverty and deprivation and increased consistent poverty rates, especially child poverty.  Time does not allow me to address in detail the issue of child poverty.  My colleague, Senator Mooney, spoke about the European Union statistics on income and living conditions, the SILC figures, which show that between 2009 and 2011, consistent child poverty rates in Ireland increased from 8.7% to 9.3%, while child deprivation rates rose from 25% to 32%.  The recent Children Rights Alliance report card gave the Government an &quot;F&quot; grade for child poverty, stating there had been &quot;retrograde steps in targeting children and families.&quot;  For the second time in a row, the budget cut the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and four consecutive budgets have reduced child benefit.  <\/p><p>All Members are concerned about child poverty and I do not claim any of us has ownership of the issue.  However, when we speak of child benefit the focus is often on children's early years, an area of which I am strongly supportive, whereas we also have figures to indicate what is known as inter-generational transmission.  This means that when a child experiences poverty in the teenage years, the problem tends to persist into adulthood.  We need to be cognisant, in addressing the issue of child and family income support, of the need to take account of the entire age spectrum of children.<\/p><p>The Mangan report examined six options, generally involving either taxation of child benefit or a two tier system.   I welcome the Minister's statement that she will examine outcomes for children and the use of tax credits, which is an issue the Seanad can debate at a later date. <\/p> <p>We need to address the stigma associated with the family income supplement.  We have all agreed that employment is good but we need to ensure we have a system that encourages people to enter the workplace, as appropriate.<\/p><p>I very much welcome the unanimous agreement on universality.  There should be some form of universality in our approach.<\/p><p>I was very surprised to see Appendix 3, the pre-budget progress report that warned against making across the board cuts in November 2011.  By way of clear warning, the group said that if the Government is to decide to reduce child benefit rates, any such reduction should ensure that there are sufficient resources available within the child income support budget for the future implementation of an integrated universal supplementary payment.  It also states the consequences of an uncompensated reduction in the child benefit rate would be significant in terms of child poverty.  We have seen that in the EU-SILC figures.  We have not seen how the changes could have influenced child poverty in the past year and a half.<\/p><p>I really welcome what the Minister said today and I listened very carefully.  I noted her focus on outcomes for children and her questioning of what we are about.  While we can examine the original intention of the child benefit payment, the fundamental question we need to ask, before asking whether there should be taxation or means testing, concerns the function of child and family income supports.  What does our policy require them to deliver?  Is it to invest in and contribute towards healthy, well-educated and secure children, which in turn is an investment in healthy, well-educated and secure adults who are less likely to be dependent on social welfare?  We have some really tough decisions to make but I believe child poverty can best be tackled by investment in services, not just investment in payments.<\/p><p>We need to ensure there are wrap-around services to ensure healthy and secure childhoods.  There is no shortage of services requiring investment.  Many colleagues will mention affordable and accessible quality childhood services.  I refer to the second year of the early childhood education programme, after-school services, universal health care and schoolbooks campaigns, such as those advocated by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or the youth work sector.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned taking some of the savings and putting them into the Children Plus initiative.  Only 11% of the savings from the budget went into the initiative, from which children benefited.  Some 89% went to the general Exchequer, with no benefit for children.  The European Commission's recommendation of last week on child poverty and well-being, &quot;Investing in children: breaking the cycle of disadvantage&quot;, states the required strategy should be an integrated one based on a three pillar approach.  The first is access to adequate resources, the second is access to affordable quality services, and the third is a child's right to participate.  These are the pillars we should be discussing when examining child and family income supports.  We need to ensure we have the three pillar approach.<\/p><p>I acknowledge there are tough decisions to be made.  Having listened to the Minister's speech, my question is on the scope of our discussions.  Are we looking purely within the remit of the Department of Social Protection?  If so, we must get into means testing, taxing and examining tax credits.  Can we really look at the outcomes for children, the delivery of services and redirecting, as the Minister stated?  We need to ensure we do not take away the safety net.  We need to ensure the required services are in place before any further reductions are made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600014#N00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361894100,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House today with the report, as she promised.  As she stated, it requires extensive debate.  I am very disappointed over the time allocated for this debate, that is, an hour.  Only 20 minutes remain of that hour.  However, the report is to be before the Oireachtas committee where I will have time to discuss it in more detail.  I hope it will return to the House for other Senators to make suggestions and proposals that might be taken on board.<\/p><p>The advisory group on tax and social welfare was established in June 2011 in line with commitments contained in the programme for Government.  I commend the Minister on honouring that commitment.  The review was long overdue.  I know the public wanted this review because it is generally felt there are many people in receipt of child benefit who do not really need it.<\/p> <p> The terms of reference of the advisory group required that all its work be carried out in the context of ensuring that the income support and tax systems incentivise people to take up work and contribute to a reduction in poverty, particularly child poverty.  The report deals in detail with child benefit.  It is some time since it was published.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify if the group has concluded its work.  I had expected the report to include recommendations on the family income supplement, qualified child allowance and so on.

While I welcome the additional 6,000 child care places provided following the reduction last year in child benefit, I believe more needs to be done in respect of child care, in particular after-school child care.   As I have stated previously - I do not apologise to anyone for saying this - I come from and live in rural Ireland and know how hard it is for parents in rural Ireland to access child care, much of which is based in urban areas.  We need to move to the provision of after-school child care in the school setting as often working parents cannot take time off work to take children from schools to child care facilities in towns five or six miles away.  This issue needs to be addressed.  I have discussed this matter with some local schools and they are willing to consider the provision of after-school care in the school setting.<\/p><p>We are all agreed that child benefit should be paid universally.  The Minister mentioned in her speech that 96% of child benefit payments are made to mothers in the home.  I have come across mothers in the home whose income on paper looks good but who are not getting the benefit of this payment.  In some cases, it is being left over the bar of local establishments.  Child benefit is important income for mothers.  Traditionally, mothers remained in the home caring for their children and viewed this payment as a payment to them.  <\/p><p>The group concluded that the two most feasible options are the taxation of child benefit and a two-tier child and family income support payment approach, its preference being the two-tier option.  I am aware that Fianna F\u00e1il proposed a two-tier option to the troika and as such assume it will support the two-tier system approach.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600016#P00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1361894400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Not without reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600016#P00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1361894400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Senator Moloney without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600016#P00500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1361894400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I have previously expressed my doubts about the taxation approach.  I believe it would be hard to implement and could, in some cases, be grossly unfair.  For example, a couple with three children and a gross household income of \u20ac50,000 per annum might appear to most people to be fairly well off.  However, following tax, PRSI and USC deductions and mortgage payments this might not appear as attractive.  As stated by the Minister in her speech, many, if not most, middle-income earners are putting their child benefit payments towards meeting mortgage repayments.  A taxing of child benefit could in some cases result in a person being liable for higher taxation.  Child benefit in respect of a person in the higher tax bracket would be taxed at 41%.  Could a person in a household who is not earning but in whose name the child benefit is paid be liable for tax under the individualisation scheme?  How will separated persons be dealt with?  To my mind, the taxation approach would be messy and complicated.<\/p> <p> Looking at examples Nos. 4 and 6 in the report, based on three children, it states that someone with an income of \u20ac27,000 would lose \u20ac1,012 in a year, while someone on \u20ac100,000 would lose \u20ac2,066.  There does not seem to be any equity there as the person on \u20ac100,000 has an income almost four times that of the person on \u20ac27,000 but loses only twice the amount of child benefit.  The two-tier system, if it is to be implemented, must take cognisance of disposable income in the household.  It is widely believed that anything below \u20ac25,000 is on or below the poverty line but I believe that this base line is much too low.  As I have already pointed out, gross pay of \u20ac50,000 may look attractive but, in reality, disposable income is much less.  After all deductions, including mortgage payments, household bills and so forth, there is often not much money left in a household with three children.  Some households may have a student at third level and must earn \u20ac42,000 or less, gross, to qualify for a full grant.  For such households to lose a large chunk of their child benefit would be a huge financial blow.<\/p><p>I know we will have an opportunity to dissect this report further at meetings of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection but I ask the Minister to bear in mind that when a person applies for a medical card, his or her mortgage, medical expenses, travel to work expenses, child care costs and so forth are taken into account.  If the Minister is considering the two-tier system, I ask that such expenses be taken into account and that the threshold figure for a top-up would be net of all of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600016#P00600","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361894700,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and also welcome the report from Ms Ita Mangan.  It is wonderful that we are discussing this today.<\/p><p>I disagree with the principal of universalism and draw attention to page 74 of the report where it records people on a gross salary of \u20ac250,000 receiving \u20ac3,360 in child benefit.  I cannot think of a less worthy use of \u20ac3,360 than to give it to somebody who earns a quarter of a million euro.  I do not know why that became a principle and it is not for me.  I believe that resources should be given to those who need them most.<\/p><p>The Minister is praised, and rightly so, on page 42 of the report as being the most generous dispenser of child benefit of all of the countries studied.  When one adds the four payments, the rate in Ireland is \u20ac360 per month, in Germany it is \u20ac325, in Canada it is \u20ac215 and in Italy, to which we are being compared today, the rate is \u20ac130.  In fact, if one looks at the OECD-IMF statistics, one sees that we have a social benefits to GDP ratio of 21.9% compared with an OECD average of 17%.  There is a lot of money in here.  We must, with income redistribution, have one set of people who pay in and another set who take out.  We cannot have a system where everybody is a beneficiary and nobody wants to pay in.  That is the basic flaw in universalism.<\/p><p>The second area where the report's authors erred is on the question of the taxation of social welfare.  Social welfare is money.  It buys things and I cannot see why one would tax work harder than one would tax welfare.  In fact, on page 29, the report says that some members of the advisory group considered that the taxation of child benefit remains &quot;an attractive option&quot;.  The report also notes that &quot;the degree of matching of DSP data from the child benefit file with Revenue data on households (in the order of 87%) indicates that the taxation of child benefit might be less technically difficult than previously thought&quot;.  We can get the two systems to talk to each other, according to page 29 of the report, which claims that we are 87% of the way there.<\/p><p>The other concern I have is the way the report treats family income supplement.  It is quite worrying to read that two thirds of people on family income supplement would be worse off under the two-tier system.  That would be a regressive step.  I am also worried about the point raised on page 36 regarding the dislike of the family income supplement system among voluntary organisations.  It is money that is paid to low-income workers and that is what we are trying to encourage.<\/p> <p>When the Minister was last in the House, she referred to the building up during the Celtic tiger boom of a permanent underclass based on doubling the number of people in receipt of disability and invalidity payments.  Is the reason for our child benefit payments seemingly having less impact the idea that it is being paid to people who are not working?  The Minister was critical of our development during the boom.  Mr. Dan O'Brien wrote strongly on the matter in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>recently.  We have not addressed the question of why this was allowed to happen in a booming economy or why we have twice as many people in receipt of invalidity and disability payments as any other EU country, something that has led to there being households in which no one works.<\/p><p> I am concerned by the report's attitude to the family income supplement, FIS.  As outlined on page 28, two thirds of parents in receipt of FIS would lose between &#8364;1 and &#8364;100.  Less than 20% would gain &#8364;1 to &#8364;50.  I do not see the point in proceeding with that type of system.  Why are advocates, whose sincerity in tackling poverty I accept, so critical in their submissions, which have a go at the FIS?<\/p><p> We can integrate the two computers.  We are 87% of the way there.  We must tackle the disability-invalidity sector, which has grown rapidly and is producing households in which no one works, as the Minister mentioned.<\/p><p> On page 46, the report states that 19.5% of children live in taxpayer units with incomes of less than &#8364;20,000 and 80% live in units of less than &#8364;80,000.  These figures should be more modulated.  If we are aiming for a redistributional system, a large gap of 300% is too much.<\/p><p> The report contains many ideas, but I will not infringe on the Cathaoirleach's patience.  I thank the Minister for laying the report before the House.  I am sure that this is the start of a most interesting debate.

Rather than being concerned about the significant amount being spent on social welfare, we must be concerned about how we can get the money to do it.

We urge the Minister to disregard the proposals in the report as they would be deeply damaging and will add further strain to low and middle-income earners.  Far from achieving efficiencies or protecting the most vulnerable, they will only exacerbate child poverty.  Child poverty is on the increase in the State, going from 6.3% in 2008 to 9.3% in 2011, and we know it is continuing to rise.  We have seen evidence of hardship on a daily basis on the street and in constituency offices.  These recommendations will further impoverish lower and middle range earners who are being constantly squeezed.<\/p><p>The Government continuously points to the fact that high earners receive child benefit as an argument to cut or tax the payment.  If the Government is intent on tackling high earners, it should take on board Sinn F\u00e9in's proposals for a third tax band of 48% on incomes over \u20ac100,000.  This would return more to the Exchequer than any cut or tax on child benefit.  People have said that the well-off should not get awards but these people never argue that such high earners should be taxed more.  I do not understand such a line of thinking, and if we want the wealthy to pay their way, tax is the obvious choice.  I would expect the application of Senator Healy Eames to Sinn F\u00e9in in this regard, as she will join us on the taxation model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600019#S01500","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1361895300,"counter":107,"content":"<p>The party has some good ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600019#S01600","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1361895300,"counter":108,"content":"<p>The ideological opposition to taxes begets this attitude.

I thank the Members for the invitation to once again have the pleasure and honour of addressing the Chamber on the first two months of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  Ireland formally took over the Presidency on 1 January but, in reality, the Government has been in intensive Presidency mode since I last addressed the Seanad in late October.  Throughout November, the Government had a busy schedule of visits by committees and by party political groups from the European Parliament culminating with the meeting between the Government and the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament.  In December the Cabinet approved the Irish Presidency programme, and the T\u00e1naiste launched the Trio Presidency programme in Brussels with our partners from Lithuania and Greece.  The Irish programme, For Stability, Jobs and Growth, which has been laid before the Oireachtas, was formally launched in early January in advance of the visit to Dublin by the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy.  The College of Commissioners also visited Dublin on 10 January for the traditional start-of-Presidency meeting between the European Commission and the Government.<\/p><p>The Government also hosted a visit to Dublin by over 60 members of the Brussels press corps.  This provided members of the Government with the opportunity not only to discuss Presidency issues but also to send key messages about Ireland's economic recovery to a wide international audience.  It is important to note that those journalists were from the leading publications in every member state and from candidate countries and that this generated a huge amount of features and promotional pieces in a wide variety of those leading publications across the European Union and beyond.<\/p> <p>Following the Taoiseach's address in mid-January to the European Parliament plenary on the priorities of the Irish Presidency, Irish Ministers made 27 presentations to European Parliament committees on the Presidency programme.  The programme has also been presented to our partners in other member states and I have addressed the Committee of the Regions and the European economic and social committee on our priorities. <\/p><p>In all our engagement with partners we have stressed that we want our Presidency to reflect the best elements of Ireland's six previous Presidencies.  It will be citizen-focused, impartial, business-like and results-driven.  Similarly the Irish Presidency programme contains ambitious but not unrealistic goals aimed at promoting stability, sustainable economic growth and jobs across Europe, and all of our priorities are centred around delivering a better Europe for our citizens.<\/p><p>The positive reaction to our Presidency priorities from partners in other member states, from the European institutions and from European civil society has been encouraging.  I am also grateful for the support that we have received from this House.<\/p><p>One of the core objectives of the programme is to promote stability and confidence in Europe's economy through measures such as the banking union proposals and effectively implementing the EU's enhanced economic governance measures.  This is necessary to provide a stable foundation of sustainable economic recovery and employment creation.  We are making good progress in this regard.<\/p><p>The Government has also identified a range of proposals designed to stimulate growth and job creation.  These include several important Single Market proposals, improved support for research and innovation across the EU, unemployment measures, particularly for young people, and widening access to education and training.  We are working intensively across all Council formations to deliver on these priorities.  I welcome the news from the European Commission last week that Ireland has topped the latest EU Internal Market scoreboard for transposing EU legislation into domestic law.  It is only the second time a member state has got a perfect score and it is a first for Ireland.  It shows that we are taking our EU responsibilities seriously and I would like to express my thanks to this House for the role it plays in scrutinising and debating EU related legislation.<\/p><p>Our Presidency objectives clearly reflect national political priorities but they also reflect concerns that are shared by people across the European Union.  This is why making progress on these goals over the coming four months is essential for Ireland and for Europe.<\/p><p>We also want to ensure that our efforts leave a strong, positive legacy in the coming years.  We all know how important it is for Ireland to maintain excellent relations with our partners and to demonstrate our commitment as a serious and engaged member state.  We believe the effective management of the Presidency can challenge the negative perceptions about Ireland that resulted from the crisis and can show that Ireland is a capable and credible international partner.<\/p><p>We have almost reached the one third stage of the Presidency.  While we face challenging months ahead and there is no room for complacency, the Government is broadly satisfied with progress made to date.<\/p><p>Let me summarise what we have achieved so far across several Council formations.<\/p><p>On 8 February the European Council reached agreement on the multiannual financial framework, MFF, for 2014 to 2020.  It agreed an overall amount of \u20ac960 billion in commitment appropriations.  While the overall size of the MFF has been reduced by 3.5%, importantly, CAP and cohesion spending were largely protected.  Negotiations were difficult, but the outcome is a compromise with which member states are broadly satisfied.<\/p><p>Ireland did well.  We protected our CAP allocation and secured a special allocation of \u20ac100 million for rural development.  We also secured a special allocation of \u20ac100 million from cohesion funding for the Border, midlands and western region, which had been due to take a significant drop.  I am particularly glad that we were able to secure \u20ac150 million for the PEACE programme which has supported such valuable projects in Northern Ireland and in our Border counties.  There is a new youth employment initiative which will provide funding for regions with youth unemployment rates above 25%.  This, unfortunately, includes both Irish regions, and I will return to this later.<\/p><p>Initial estimates are that Ireland will remain a net recipient for the lifetime of the new MFF.  We should contribute about \u20ac10 billion and receive about \u20ac12 billion.<\/p> <p>The European Parliament's assent is needed before the MFF can be adopted.  It now falls to Ireland as President to gain this assent and we aim to conclude negotiations in Council on a new MFF regulation, based on the outcome of the European Council.  We intend to do that in April and to formally present the regulation to the European Parliament.  However, as holders of the Presidency we will need to engage well before that with the Parliament.  Obtaining the Parliament's assent will be very challenging.  I am confident, however, that with goodwill on all sides we can reach agreement on this before the end of our Presidency.  I am pleased to say the Government has already initiated contacts with the European Parliament as part of our preparations for that crucial which will probably take place in April.<\/p><p>Timely implementation of the MFF is critical to underpin recovery across the European Union on programmes ranging from Horizon 2020 to the COSME programme to support our SMEs to cohesion and regional funding.  Last week the Presidency helped to broker an agreement with the European Parliament on the so-called &quot;two-pack&quot; economic governance legislation which is designed to improve budgetary and economic co-ordination among euro area members.  The adoption of the proposals is a Presidency priority and will contribute to our objective of promoting greater stability and confidence in the euro area through more effective economic and fiscal co-ordination.  <\/p><p>The Presidency is also committed to ensuring the effective implementation of the European semester, the European Union's new system of economic and budgetary co-ordination, which we see as the key tool in restoring economic stability in Europe and creating the conditions for sustainable growth.  The European Council will conclude and evaluate the first phase of the European semester when it meets in mid-March.  It is important that national parliaments play their part in the European semester process.  After the March European Council recommendations will come from the European Commission specific to each member state.  In terms of accountability and legitimacy it is essential that national parliaments play their role in assessing those countries' specific recommendations and feeding in to the process before the ultimate European Council in June.<\/p><p>Remaining on economic and financial issues, at the first meeting of the ECOFIN Council last month, which was chaired by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, a decision was taken to move forward on an enhanced co-operation basis for a financial transaction tax.  Ireland will not be one of the participating countries but we are committed, in our role as Presidency, to act as an honest and impartial broker in the discussions.  <\/p><p>The Presidency has seen welcome progress on the trade front.  As Members will recall from the programme and our discussions here in late October, promoting the European Union's exports through enhanced trade agreements is an important Presidency priority for Ireland.  With 90% of global economic growth taking place outside the European Union, it is essential that we seek to develop trade with key external partners.  In our programme, we placed particular emphasis on making progress on a trade agreement with the United States.  <\/p><p>On 12 February, President Obama called for a transatlantic trade and investment partnership.  This has been welcomed by the Presidency and all European Union leaders.  The Government will do all it can to secure its goal of achieving a formal Council mandate for the start of negotiations on an agreement.  Our aim is to do that before the conclusion of our President.  If we can do that it will be a hugely significant achievement because it is something that has alluded the European Union and the US not just for years but decades.<\/p><p>The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will chair a meeting of EU trade Ministers in Dublin in April which will focus on driving this process forward in addition to other trade related issues.  The potential benefits of a future partnership agreement are simply too great to ignore.  It is estimated, very conservatively, that a successful conclusion could lead to annual benefits of more than \u20ac150 billion to the European Union and the United States economies.  There is a huge raft of academic work which shows that the potential is much greater than that.  Therefore, it is an exciting opportunity and one that we, as Presidency, are embracing.  <\/p><p>The Presidency will also seek to build on the progress on concluding an EU-Canada free trade negotiation agreement.  <\/p> <p>Similar negotiations are also under way with several key Asian partners and Japan, Korea and others are very much on our priority list.<\/p><p>Remaining for a moment on international issues, the Government, in preparing the Presidency programme, also placed a strong emphasis on development and humanitarian issues, reflecting Ireland's commitment to fighting global hunger and poverty.  At the recent meeting of EU development Ministers chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, agreement was reached on the resumption of \u20ac250 million in EU funding in 2013 to support democracy and peace in Mali and to provide assistance to displaced Malians to ensure they have access to food and other basic services.  This is a very important positive step for the region and for Mali in particular.  I am also looking forward to the conference being hosted by the Presidency with the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice to seek solutions to the challenges of hunger, nutrition and climate change which affect the world's poorest regions disproportionately.<\/p><p>The Single Market is a key Presidency priority and I am very pleased to note the signing of the unified patent court agreement last week.  The agreement will provide European SMEs and other businesses with a central one-stop shop for registering and protecting patents and with improved and more cost-effective access to patent protection at European level.  The EU-US trade agreement I mentioned earlier took decades to achieve, as has the unified patent court agreement.  We cannot claim all the credit for it and must acknowledge the work of previous Presidencies to get it to this point.  It was an historic day when the Minister, Deputy Bruton, signed it on behalf of the Irish Presidency.  It is a very important leap forward for the Single Market protecting and encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship in the European Union.  The Presidency is working on other outstanding issues under the Single Market Act I to promote economic competitiveness and growth.<\/p><p>Bringing down barriers which hinder citizen mobility across the EU is also an important Presidency focus during this European Year of Citizens.  In addition to advancing a number of legislative proposals we are engaging in dialogue with citizens over the coming months about the rights we enjoy as EU citizens.  I hope through this initiative we can spark a broader debate about what it means to be part of the European Union and how we would like the Union to evolve in the coming years.  I want this debate to continue well beyond the Presidency and the European Year of Citizens.  As many Senators are aware, in January we held the first dialogue in Dublin City Hall with approximately 200 citizens present.  I and the Vice President of the European Commission, Viviane Reding, were in the hot seat and the event was very successful.  More recently, the T\u00e1naiste attended the second citizens' dialogue in Cork.  I look forward to the next meeting in Galway, which I will attend on behalf of the Presidency and the Government, and many such meetings will take place in the coming months.  I intend to try to engage personally at all of the events, if I can, and to encourage participation by Members of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament and the Commission.  It will be a good opportunity for citizens to challenge and question and engage with public representatives and leaders at national and European level.<\/p><p>Not surprisingly, one question raised at these events is what are we doing to tackle unemployment, particularly youth unemployment.  As Senators recall from my pre-Presidency meetings in the Seanad, the Government considers youth unemployment levels in Ireland and across Europe far too high and if we do not address them they will have very negative consequences for our families and communities and for society.  This is why we have made tackling the issue a key focus for our Presidency.  On 7 and 8 February the Ministers, Deputies Burton and Bruton, met their EU colleagues in Dublin to address unemployment issues and to assess ways of addressing youth unemployment more effectively.  This was at the informal Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs, EPSCO, Council which took place.  One of the main proposals discussed was the youth guarantee, which is aimed at ensuring that young people who are not working or studying receive an offer of employment, continuing education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship.<\/p> <p>Based on discussions at discussions at the meeting we are hopeful that agreement will be reached at the EPSCO Council meeting due to take place later this week in Brussels.<\/p><p>As I mentioned earlier, the European Council has also agreed on a \u20ac6 billion youth employment initiative fund as part of the multi-annual financial framework for 2014-20.  The funding is aimed at regions with the highest rates of youth joblessness to help get young people back to work.  The Irish Presidency will work intensively to secure the European Parliament's consent to the 2014-20 budget to ensure that these funds can be mobilised without delay.  Work has already begun in the European Commission in terms of firming up the proposals.  <\/p><p>Food quality and security is of critical importance to Ireland from both a consumer perspective and as one of our major export sectors.  All Senators will agree that the recent revelations on the mislabelling of food products are simply unacceptable.  Following the initial discovery in January by the Irish Food Safety Authority, the pan-European scale of the problem has become apparent.  This is why the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as chair of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, responded swiftly to address the issue and called a meeting of EU agriculture Ministers with the Commission, which agreed on a control and testing system for all member states in order to reassure consumers.  The issue was also under consideration at the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council yesterday.<\/p><p>The issues that I have highlighted are just a sample of the work that the Presidency has led over the past seven weeks in nine Council meetings, five informal Council meetings, many other high level meetings and countless working groups, which are being led and chaired by senior Irish officials in Brussels and some of them in Dublin.  All of the meetings that the Presidency chairs now have one thing in common - to make progress and to drive forward the agenda.<\/p><p>On a personal level, I invited my counterparts from other member states to an informal ministerial meeting - obviously European Affairs Ministers - to focus on the question which is the fourth strand of the so-called EMU process.  I fear the fourth strand can be overlooked.  I am referring to democratic legitimacy and accountability in the European Union.  I do not need to remind the House of the importance of the topic as we move towards closer integration at EU level in response to the crisis.  Everything that we do must be underpinned by a consciousness and willingness to enhance and support democratic legitimacy and accountability.  <\/p><p>I welcome the engagement of the Oireachtas on these issues.  I welcome, in particular, the parliamentary dimension of our Presidency which contributes in no small way to the democratic process in the Union.  I know that the House has already had the COSAC chairpersons meeting because I attended part of it.  Yesterday, the chairs of the finance committees of the EU member states and the European Parliament met in Dublin yesterday.  I also took the opportunity provided by the informal meeting of European Affairs ministers to invite to Dublin my counterparts from the EU candidate countries and also from the potential candidates of the western Balkans.  Ireland has always made clear its belief in the role of the enlargement process for securing peace, stability and prosperity in Europe.  We remain firmly supportive of the enlargement process.  As Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, I am pleased to have the honour of dealing with all of the candidate countries and working on the enlargement file which is important.  We must remain focussed on it even though we have our internal concerns in the European Union at present.<\/p><p>I continue to meet my counterparts at bilateral level at EU meetings and in other EU capitals.  I am the Council's main representative at debates at plenary sessions of the European Parliament in Strasbourg and we have had two very busy sessions in January and February.  My practice of coming here and debating in the Seanad has stood me in good stead because at my last session in Strasbourg I had 20 hours of plenary debate which was intensive and stimulating.  It was also a great opportunity for Ireland, during its Presidency, to lead the debates.  <\/p><p>It is clear that since the introduction of the Lisbon treaty, one of the key roles of the Presidency is to represent the Council at the European Parliament and to negotiate on its behalf in order to reach compromise on the legislative agenda. <\/p> <p>Senators will be aware that since the Lisbon treaty, almost every policy area is now dealt with by way of co-decision.  That means that, as important as Ministers may think they are, they are no more important than members of the European Parliament with whom we have a two-track process.  It is crucial that the Irish EU Presidency works constructively and fruitfully with the European Parliament in order to progress, otherwise we would meet roadblocks along the way.  It is important for us to have that strong working relationship in order to progress our priorities.  More often than not, I am fortunate to be in the hot seat in dealing with the European Parliament on behalf of the Presidency.<\/p><p>I would like to outline some of the key tasks and challenges that face the Irish Presidency over the coming months.  I have mentioned that securing agreement on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, with the European Parliament will be one of the major challenges facing the Presidency.  It is new territory because we have not had this task in the past.  It is a real challenge for us and one that we cannot take for granted, yet I am confident of a successful outcome.<\/p><p>In parallel, we will also be focusing on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, Horizon 2020 and the Structural Fund.  Most crucially, the Presidency will also push for agreement on banking union proposals to ensure the commitments made last June will be delivered upon.  In addition to working to advance the Single Market and digital economy proposals identified to drive growth, the Presidency will also work intensively to secure a Council mandate for EU-US trade negotiations.  I referred to these earlier.<\/p><p>We look forward to making good progress on these issues as we face into the remaining four months of our Presidency.  I would like to thank this House once again for its support to date.  I hope that I will have an opportunity to return here later in the Presidency - maybe at the two thirds stage - with more positive news on our Presidency objectives and the progress we are making.  I hope that when I return at the end of our Presidency, all Senators will be able to agree with me that we have had a successful Presidency.  It will have helped to elevate Ireland's standing, not just in a European context but also globally.  The Irish EU Presidency will genuinely deliver positive steps towards growth and job creation for the whole of the European Union and particularly for our own citizens here in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600020#T00700","speaker":"1036","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361897400,"counter":121,"content":"<p>On behalf of those on the Opposition benches, I extend a warm welcome to the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton.

The highlight so far has been the fact that the negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework 2014-2020 are on track.  The Irish EU Presidency has played an important role in this decision and we have supported this vitally important development.  First and foremost, the Irish EU Presidency is about using our leadership role in the pursuit of stability, jobs and growth in Europe.  The Government's policy programme for those six months was set out in the details of what exactly we wished to achieve.<\/p><p>President Obama's recent State of the Union speech was very significant.  It is certainly something for the T\u00e1naiste to grasp with open arms, given the enormous financial potential of the US and EU economies and the \u20ac150 billion worth of trade between both blocs.  It is particularly significant that Ireland exports 90% of its products and services.  I know that the US-EU trade negotiations are not starting until mid-year, but preparations are required and Ireland has to discuss them with its EU partners.  I hope the starting point will be on St. Patrick's Day when the Taoiseach meets with President Obama in the White House.  It will be an opportunity to bring forward the debate on trade.  When the US-EU trade talks are completed they will involve the largest trading bloc in the world.<\/p> <p> Moreover, I refer to the uncertainty regarding the future of Britain's membership of the European Union.  While ultimately it is to be hoped they will remain within the Union - I believe that to be the wish of the Irish Government and people - the Prime Minister's offer of a referendum in 2017 or thereabouts undoubtedly has created uncertainty at present.  Consequently, for multinational companies that are planning ahead for 40 or 50 years, Ireland now is an even more attractive location as, apart from Britain, it is the only English-speaking country of the European Union's 27 member states and this is an opportunity.  Moreover, our time location in relation to the United States and Europe is also crucial.  The IDA and Enterprise Ireland certainly will be maximising their efforts to attract further investment into the country because their success in attracting overseas industry undoubtedly has been phenomenal.  Ireland is such an attractive location because of the quality and education of our workforce.  In this context, I note the development regarding PayPal in Dundalk, as well as other such companies which are establishing themselves in Ireland.  The great majority of major multinational companies are based here, including their headquarters for Europe, which of course gives us a great status.<\/p><p>A further advantage is Ireland's stability.  The current negotiations are ongoing and the workers must decide for themselves what is of greatest benefit for themselves and the country but the existence of such negotiations and our ability to negotiate agreements instead of taking to the streets is a great indication of Ireland's stability.  It makes it very attractive for multinational companies which are giving consideration to Europe.  They can see what is happening in Greece or in Italy at present, which creates great doubts, while Ireland has a stable democracy.  We had a change of government two years ago and, in due course, there will be other changes in the future.  However, the point is we still have stability.  When I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce with responsibility for trade and marketing, we could go abroad and make the point that Ireland had a tax rate of 12.5%.  We could state this had been guaranteed by successive Governments and there would be no change in that policy when that happened.<\/p><p>Finally, on another issue that arose, the Minister of State is aware that I was in Brussels at the end of January and early February.  I had not been there for some time and the Ceann Comhairle addressed a meeting, as did Deputies Ciar\u00e1n Lynch and Hannigan, which was very useful.  The issue of youth unemployment is crucial and one aspect that has been considered by the European Union was the establishment of a European Union peace corps for young people.  Its purpose would be to use their skills and ability over a period in Europe and to provide some of the current funding for Third World countries through the provision of labour.  It would be in the form of intellectual labour, workers, designers, engineers, architects, builders, plasterers and all the trades to maximise and make use of these skills.  It has been tried and if she gets an opportunity, the Minister of State might look up the research that has taken place within the European Union.  The Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Sean Barrett, highlighted this point when he spoke and I thought it was a very useful contribution.  As President in the European Union, I ask the Minister of State to examine the files and perhaps talk to some of the Commissioners on this subject to ascertain whether this possible proposal can be moved further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600025#Y00200","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361897700,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I join with my colleague, Senator Leyden, in welcoming the Minister of State to the House and to thank her for a highly comprehensive report on progress being made to date under the Irish Presidency.  I compliment her on how well she always represents our country and to marvel at the significant workload she is carrying on behalf of the country.  Members are having this discussion today against a backdrop of much instability in recent months throughout Europe.  There is concern that the political situation in Italy may cause some instability throughout Europe.  In a country in which there is a strong Government and real political stability, the prospects of a hung parliament in Italy or another election do not excite anyone in this Chamber.<\/p> <p>One of the most significant achievements, which was overshadowed in particular in this House by the debate we had in early February on the promissory note, was the agreement reached on 8 February on the multi-annual framework for 2014 to 2020.  There was much relief that the overall amount of \u20ac960 billion was agreed and approved.  While there is a reduction of 3.5%, most importantly, funding for the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the Cohesion Fund, which are of particular interest to this country, was largely protected.  As the Minister of State said, we did well, protected the CAP allocation and secured a special allocation of \u20ac100 million from the Cohesion Fund for the Border, midlands and west region.  That is of great significance.<\/p><p>The theme of the Presidency is stability, jobs and growth.  The most pressing priority for this country is the creation of employment.  We lost approximately 250,000 jobs in the private sector in the three years prior to the Government taking office.  We have made some progress in the past year and a half in rebuilding our reputation abroad and convincing multinationals that this country is a good place to do business.  We are starting to get our public finances in order and meeting the targets set by the troika.  We are reducing the cost of public services, including the cost of Government and politics.  That is a key plank of our recovery.<\/p><p>Our Action Plan for Jobs 2013, announced in recent days, must be the platform on which our economic recovery is built.  The action plan follows on from the 2012 plan, which has been pretty successful, and it is hoped it will improve supports to business, help reduce costs further, improve finance to business and support research and innovation.  During 2013, a total of 333 actions will be addressed across 16 Departments and 46 agencies.  The plan has significant elements such as the JobsPlus scheme, which commits the State to provide \u20ac4 to an employer for every euro spent on job creation for the long-term unemployed.  In terms of ICT skills, we will provide an additional 2,000 graduate level professionals in 2013, and by 2018 we will lead Europe in terms of ICT graduates as a percentage of all third level graduates.<\/p><p>Many significant measures are outlined in the plan.  Another point of interest is the investment of \u20ac300 million in seven world-class research centres, which was announced in recent days by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State at the same Department, Deputy Sherlock.  It is the most significant announcement of its kind ever made in this country.  It involves \u20ac200 million of new Exchequer funds for seven world-class research centres over the next six years, three of them based in NUI Galway, and a \u20ac100 million co-investment fund generated by 150 industry partners.  Such funding will address the considerable unemployment issues we face in this country.  I very much welcome the Minister\u2019s announcement that \u20ac6 billion will be made available to tackle youth unemployment in countries where it is in excess of 25%.<\/p><p>I wish to raise one or two issues that the Minister of State might address.  I accept that this country has set enlargement as a key priority and has committed to advancing the process for all candidate and prospective countries.<\/p> <p>Ireland will oversee the final monitoring report on Croatia.  Will Croatia join in July?  Significant progress will be made with Serbia and Montenegro and perhaps we could get an update on the progress being made with the Turkish discussions.  There is grave concern among the Bosnian community in Ireland that Bosnia is not on the Government priority list for the Presidency.  Keeping Bosnia Herzegovina on the priority list is crucial to prevent further conflict and division that would impact negatively on the wider Balkan region.<\/p><p>I welcome the efforts being made to introduce an EU-wide card that would simplify the process of having qualifications recognised for all EU citizens working in other member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600026#Z00200","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361898300,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Both Senator Leyden and I are wearing the EU Presidency colours and I want to put on record my thanks for this beautiful scarf.  The Minister of State outlined great progress and I thank her for the deep respect she shows for this House.  It is much appreciated.  I was particularly thrilled to hear about the deal she is working on with President Obama.  Should the Minister of State need any extra help on the negotiating team, I have a really good American accent and I know how Americans do deals?<\/p><p>I want to focus on the commitment that the Presidency will be citizenship orientated.  The Minister of State launched the European Year of the Citizen and spoke at the Brussels conference to note the 20th anniversary of the introduction of EU citizenship.  I have heard the Minister of State express the hope that people reach a better understanding of the rights and opportunities they enjoy as citizens of the Union and find out how to overcome the obstacles to using those rights.<\/p><p>Again, like Senator Leyden, I was recently in Brussels but I was chairing the European Parliament's legal affairs committee workshop which explored the question of whether EU citizens enjoyed free movement, and we examined a particular area that is an obstacle to the free movement of citizens: the recognition of civil status documents and the effects of such documents in other member states.  As the Minister of State is aware, civil status registration is the way in which countries keep records of births, deaths and marital status of their people.  Changes in the form of cross-border living and working have developed quickly since the start of the European project, but change at a legislative level to respond to this new way of living and working has been slow.  EU citizens and their families face a patchwork of civil status rules across the EU.  It is worth noting that more than 12 million people study, work or live in a member state of which they are not nationals.  When the recognition of civil status is hindered or unduly cumbersome, citizens of the EU are unable to avail fully of their right to freedom of movement.<\/p><p>An estimated 350,000 cross-border marriages take place in the EU every year.  That estimate demonstrates that this issue affects significant numbers.  Many Irish people travel to Rome to get married.  The Italian authorities, however, require that a couple get a letter of freedom from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirming they are not already married.  This letter is sent to the Irish embassy in Rome which then sends it on to the Italian civil authorities.  If an Irish person living in Italy wished to marry a person from another member state, the process is even more complicated.  An Irish citizen marrying a Belgian national living in Italy would face problems because Belgium does not issue letters of freedom so the couple would have to go to court in Italy to get married in the country where they live.<\/p><p>I know from a personal perspective that lesbian and gay people are particularly affected by these barriers.  If a same-sex couple are civilly married in Spain, have a family and move to Ireland, the marriage is recognised as a civil partnership but they lose parental rights to the children.  In Spain, the children have two parents but in Ireland they only have one parent.<\/p><p>As community law stands at present, regulation of civil status remains within the competence of the member states.  Despite this, they must comply with EU law, particularly treaty provisions on a citizen's freedom to move and reside in the territory of member states.<\/p> <p> The European Union's priorities for developing an area of justice, freedom and security for the five years are set out in the Stockholm programme.  The European Commission has announced proposals for European legislation in this area in 2013.  The first proposal relates to the free movement of documents by eliminating legalisation formalities between member states.  This may cover cases similar to the examples I cited.  The second relates to recognising the effects of certain civil status records in order that the legal status granted in one member state can be recognised and have the same legal consequences in another member state.  The European Parliament has expressed support for the Commission's plan by way of resolution.<\/p><p>Many of the problems posed by cross-border living can be addressed through legislation.  I understand the Minister of State will consider this issue in some of the Strasbourg debates.  However, the practical problems posed by such circumstances require a more innovative approach.  The International Commission on Civil Status, ICCS, which made a presentation at the conference I chaired, seeks to address problems concerning the personal status of people involved in cross-border situations.  It has developed and is piloting an information technology platform for the international communication of civil status data by electronic means.  The ICCS data exchange platform would make it easier for citizens to prove their personal and family status and make international requests for civil status data simpler to carry out.  It would also help to combat fraud, which is a key concern.  This is a new frontier in EU living.<\/p><p>I have with me a briefing document from the president of the ICCS, Mr. Duncan Macniven, which I would like to share with the Minister of State and her officials.  Mr. Macniven pointed out to me that as a result of advances in this technology, practical measures have become available to support freedom of movement.  What is needed, however, is the political will to apply these measures more widely than is currently the case.  For this reason, I ask the Minister of State to investigate these issues as part of the priorities of the Irish Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600028#BB00200","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361898600,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Minister of State for not wearing my Presidency scarf and thank her most sincerely for giving me one.

It is welcome to have her address the Seanad, especially given her experience in dealing with issues of national and European importance in her role as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  She is a great ambassador and Irish people can be proud to have her representing our interests in Europe.  Her visit to the Seanad is also timely given that Ireland currently holds the Presidency of the European Union.  Many Ministers and officials have visited and many more will visit Ireland in the next four months.<\/p><p>This is the seventh time Ireland has held the responsibility of Presidency and it is undoubtedly a major honour for the country.  The 2013 Presidency comes as we celebrate the 40th anniversary of our accession to the European Economic Community in 1973 and is rooted in the commitment to the European project we have shown since we joined the EEC.  As we mark the 40th year of membership, we should reflect on the remarkable changes that have taken place as a consequence of our membership.  I speak in terms of infrastructure, as well as culturally, politically and economically. <\/p><p>My colleague, Senator Mullins, stated recently that the Republic did not have a motorway when we joined the European Union.  We need only look back to 1973 and consider what we have attained as a consequence of EU membership.  In 1973, Ireland' wealth level stood at only 60% of the European average, while today, despite the effects of the economic crisis, our level of prosperity is above the EU average.  In the early 1970s, more than 50% of our exports went to our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, whereas today we trade services and goods globally, which is a fantastic achievement for such a small country.  European Union economies such as Germany have also become important markets for our exports. <\/p><p>For the purpose of this discussion, I will focus on the priorities and aims for the Irish Presidency, which will, I hope, help shape and contribute to European growth and recovery in the years ahead.  The Presidency has already made significant strides towards reassessing our debt burden.  Within two short months of assuming the Presidency, the Government was able to facilitate an easing of the country's debt burden through a deal on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note.  Commentators and other political parties did not believe such a deal was possible.<\/p> <p>This is a matter that other political parties and commentators believed was never possible.  It is certainly a very welcome departure.  We now need to continue to highlight the importance of Ireland's debt problem and keep pushing for a deal on our sovereign debt.  All in all, it is fair to state our priorities during the Presidency can be summed up by the words \u201cstability, growth and jobs\".  As a country, we have gone through financially turbulent times, exacerbated only by a world recession.  However, we must realise that in great adversity opportunity knocks, and now is the time that the EU can display its strength and stability and show we have the ability to foster growth, even in these much-maligned times.  We must show that once we secure steady growth, we can foster any employment opportunities and contribute to our people handsomely.<\/p><p>The best example of Europe's ability to confront such trying and testing issues is that of Ireland.  Undoubtedly in the recent past, Ireland has gone through peaks and troughs in terms of growth.  In the 15 years or more prior to 2008, we were the envy of Europe with our unprecedented economic growth, fuelled by too many resources being devoted to the property sector.  This must now be admitted.  Irish banks had continued to adopt a flaithi\u00falach approach to lending, which culminated in the then Government guaranteeing their borrowings, thus inextricably linking our sovereign debt to our bank debt.  The cost has been considerable to the country as a whole.  In 2010, as we all know, we were forced to seek a bailout from the European Union and IMF.  In fairness to the Union, it was willing to pony up the funds at the time.  There is no doubt that Ireland has taken a huge hit as a consequence of what occurred and as part of the effort to save the European economy and its banking sector.  That should not be forgotten by European decision-makers.<\/p><p>As a consequence of the decision made by Ireland at the time in question, its citizens have continued to suffer greatly, and that must be acknowledged.  We have taken a huge hit and played our part in trying to sort out the economic malaise.  Taxes have increased and expenditure has been severely curtailed in the country.  We must look at the daylight at the end of the tunnel.  This should manifest itself as relieving the burden of our bank-related debt.  We have shown that there is a path back from the crisis.  We have really taken the hard medicine over recent months and years.  It is not an easy path.  The Irish are very resilient and will continue to be so.  It must be acknowledged that, in the interest of the Union, we can be the poster boy of the continent and show other countries that they can also come through an austerity programme successfully, gain the confidence of international lenders and take back fiscal independence while remaining within the Union.<\/p><p>As a citizen, I yearn for the day that the term &quot;PIIGS&quot;, referring to Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain, will become &quot;PIGS&quot;.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State, the Government and all representatives from our parties in Europe are striving to achieve this goal.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister of State will take into consideration parts of my submission and work towards reaching the goal we all yearn for, namely, a return to fiscal independence in EU matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600029#CC00300","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361899200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I wish to share my time with Senator Barrett.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  I am delighted to have her on board.  I usually try to wear colourful ties.  The Minister of State's is quite colourful and I was very happy with it.  I am ashamed to say I am not wearing a colourful tie today.  I should have thought it out.<\/p><p>The Presidency is a great opportunity for us to restore our reputation, which has been damaged.  As Senator Higgins said, it has been hit in recent years.  I am delighted the Minister of State is on board doing something about it.<\/p><p>I will concentrate on one topic, namely, trade.  The EU-US deal on trade is one on which we should concentrate.  I noted such a deal could add 2% to European GDP.  If so, it is worth concentrating on.  However, there are some obstacles, one of which is the CAP.  The protection of our farming community will make it very difficult to strike a deal.  Under CAP, we have allocated \u20ac370 billion for the next seven years.  That is a trade barrier against the United States to a very large extent.  It is to protect EU farmers against trade from the United States.<\/p> <p>We differ in a number of areas.  Irish consumers differ from American consumers.  While Irish consumers do not like GMO products, American consumers have no concerns in that regard.  It is unlikely we will be able to get over this issue easily.  I do not envy those involved in the negotiations in this area.  Similarly, American people do not take issue with hormones in their beef or with rinsing chickens with chlorine but Irish people do.  I do not know how this is going to be addressed.  I would welcome if the Minister could identify how these types of challenges will be handled.  The US banned the import of European beef following the mad cow disease outbreak in 1996.  I regularly visit the United States and food outlets there.  There is no doubt they are unwilling to handle beef on that basis and do not understand how we can.  <\/p><p>On trade, the T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, stated that he will be seeking to expand humanitarian aid programmes.  However, before expanding are we focusing development aid in the right area?  It is extremely concerning on the broader level that according to a European parliamentary report only 46% of European aid meant for developing countries actually goes to low income states while Turkey, which is a relatively rich country, is among the five top recipients of European aid.  Surely this is not right.  Can we change the situation with our European Presidency?  Surely, this is a ridiculous situation about which the European Parliament should itself be doing something.  <\/p><p>We must during the recession also look at what is happening to aid across the European Union.  NGOs argue that so-called good aid such as long-term budgetary support goes first while bad aid, such as trade sweeteners, remain.  I believe this is a challenge that is losing Europe its good name.  I believe also that we can do something about it and should do so during our Presidency of the European Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600030#DD00200","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361899800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

It might have made sense a long time ago.  If we have the same climate and environment as New Zealand why do we not engage in the same type of agriculture?   World food prices are rising.  Let us work towards free trade and participate in the development of the Union.<\/p> <p>The fear is that subsidies capitalise in higher land prices, which make it difficult for young farmers to get into agriculture.  When the subsidies were removed in New Zealand, land prices fell and young people did get into agriculture in that country.  If the Seanad exists to make points that might not be made in the D\u00e1il, it may be beneficial.  I may be the only Member of the Oireachtas who believes the CAP deserves a good looking at.

There is a capacity of 55,000 whereas the volume of traffic is about one tenth of that.  Professor Patrick Honohan pointed out that one must move to project appraisal at some stage, and not just macro-economic modelling of the result of EU funds.  We are short of finance for so many projects.  Let us achieve the best value for the funds we receive from the Union.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister of State every success in Washington on St. Patrick's Day.

The Minister stated the potential financial benefit for both economies would be in the order of &#8364;150 billion.  It is important for the creation of jobs and generating growth that we grow businesses in which jobs can be created.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State referred to funding to deal with youth unemployment, with particular emphasis on training and ensuring potential employees are upskilled so they can take up jobs.  It was outlined in a number of debates over the past six to 12 months that companies coming to Ireland find it difficult in some cases to get all the staff they require to take on available jobs.  This is because of the skills shortage.  We are now responding to that and will continue to do so.<\/p><p>  This is an important time for Ireland in terms of influencing how the Union develops.  We play a very active part in this regard.  Already, we have a major role in developing the Common Agricultural Policy over the coming six to seven years.  It is important now that we influence policy designed to develop the economy in each of the 27 member states, soon to become 28 member states.  In doing so, we must help to grow trade between the United States and the European Union so jobs will continue to be created and Irish citizens will not have to leave to find employment, not only in other parts of Europe but also farther afield.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600032#FF00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1361900400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Cuirim c\u00e9ad mile f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire.

She is doing an exceptionally effective job for us and I wish her well.  Any Irish person who has any sense of pride in us as a people must feel pride when we hold the Presidency.  Each time we have held the Presidency, we have delivered on our obligations very effectively and with great panache.<\/p><p>On that point, and without elaborating on the bigger European policies, I believe the Presidency presents an exceptionally good PR opportunity, considering all the various representatives coming from Europe in respect of all the various aspects of European activity.  It is beneficial for them to see this good, developed country.  We have had an opportunity to lay claim to being one of the most civilised countries, in terms of antiquity, in Europe.  Some may regard this as a small country on the periphery of Europe but historically we have always been a part of Europe.  This is not lost, not only on academics but also on those who take an interest in where we have come from.  Therefore, there is a PR opportunity.  We are availing of it exceptionally well.  All the foreign representatives, on leaving Ireland, will see that we are a country that is playing a role.<\/p><p>Europe has been good for Ireland but Ireland has also been good for Europe, particularly during the recent turbulence and in the face of the challenges we are encountering.  In time to come, many people, not only economists, will say the manner in which we have responded to the required austerity measures will have helped stabilise the euro.  That can only help us.<\/p><p>In times of recession, the human condition does not always respond negatively as it often responds positively.  When we talk about the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, we do so in light of the difficulties faced by America, in addition to those faced by Europe.  In times such as these, one pools one's resources, potential and vision.  This is vital.<\/p><p>The main message that will have to come not only from the European Presidency but also from the Union as a whole will concern how the individual is being helped.  There are two aspects of the Minister of State's address of which I took particular cognisance.  Her address was a very fine all-embracing one and it was exceptionally well crafted.  We have always been well represented in Europe, both by political leaders and officials.  The two areas on which we need to focus, which are not really the major issues but important nevertheless, are youth unemployment and world hunger.  If we do not succeed in helping young people, they will become an adult generation instilled with a sense of helplessness and hopelessness.  This will have an impact on their countries.<\/p><p>Consider the subject of world hunger.  During the time of the Great Famine in Ireland, an Indian tribe called the Choctaw decided to send money to help.  One can imagine how deprived it was at the time.  When we were commemorating the famine, representatives of that tribe visited Mayo.  The tribe's compassion and help are remembered to this day.  If Europe helps those who are deprived in the world at present in the same way, which is difficult, it will be remembered.  It is not just a question of thinking about Europe's challenges.  Very often, one can offset terrorism and violence by showing future leaders and relevant countries that we are civilised, want to help them and want to be in partnership with them.  I hope the Minister of State can make progress in those two areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600032#FF00300","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1361901000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The theme of the Irish Presidency is stability, jobs and growth.  I would like first to focus on the European Commission economic winter forecast and the statement therein that the eurozone is expected to remain in recession, with a 0.3% contraction in 2013, which is  disheartening.  Words such as \"sluggish, weak, vulnerable, modest and fragile\" are frequently mentioned throughout the 140 pages of charts and analysis of the forecast.  It also makes reference to a headline rate of 11% unemployment across the eurozone and a sharp increase in long-term joblessness, which is of concern across the EU, with some 45% of people in the EU, and one in two people in eight countries, now unemployed for more than one year.<\/p><p>In the foreword to the winter forecast Marco Buti, head of the Commission's economics department, acknowledged the grave social consequences resulting from the unemployment crisis.  It is, however, more dangerous than that.  The Commission paper concedes that long-term unemployment is associated with lower employability of jobseekers and lower sensitivity of the labour market to economic upturns.  I acknowledge the emphasis being placed on the youth guarantee by the Irish Presidency and the proposed discussions around that issue later this week.  <\/p><p>There are no additional resources provided in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 and only scant reference therein to youth unemployment.  How does the Irish Government propose to match EU funding to address the issues of youth unemployment and employment?  The Minister of State mentioned in her speech that the Irish Presidency had brokered an agreement with the European Parliament on the two-pack.  Under the compromise by the Irish Presidency, the Commission will set up an expert group to examine the creation of a redemption fund, as well as a system of euro bills to replace short-term sovereign debt.  The purpose of the redemption fund, which is the brainchild of the German Council of Economic Experts, is to pool all sovereign debt from eurozone countries above the 60% threshold in the Stability and Growth Pact.  I would welcome if the Minister of State could provide further details of that proposal, the Irish position on the redemption fund and details of the expert group which is to be established.<\/p><p>As regards what is going on in the European Parliament, the EU executive is supposedly drawing up legislation for the end of 2013 aimed at loosening the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact to allow governments to invest in public infrastructure projects.  Perhaps the Minister of State can advise how it is proposed the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact are to be loosened.  On Structural and Cohesion Funds - I have raised this issue previously with the Minister of State in committee - can the Minister of State advise if macroeconomic conditionality is still on the table in respect of Cohesion and Structural Funds, what position Ireland is taking in this regard and if it is opposing attachment of such conditionality to European funding, in particular for countries experiencing severe recession and already subject to many cutbacks?  I understand this issue is currently under discussion in the European Parliament.  However, I would welcome if the Minister of State could provide more detail on macroeconomic conditionality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600033#GG00100","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1361901000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>Like other speakers I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend her on the impressive start to our Presidency of the European Council.  There is not much point in my repeating what has been already said.  Obviously, the central theme of our Presidency is cohesion, job creation and so on, which are themes that percolate throughout the European Union in terms of importance.<\/p><p>As already stated, youth unemployment is a significant problem not only in Ireland, but in many of our European counterparts.  Significant percentages of youth unemployment exist.  Ireland is a small country, a drop in the vast oceans of a diverse Europe.  However, that drop can have a ripple effect, in terms of influence, throughout Europe.  I am always proud of how influential this small nation is in the European Union.  Ireland punches way above its weight in terms of achievement within Europe.  <\/p><p>I would like to focus on setting best practice.  For too long, people have been quoting international best practice and saying that Ireland should emulate what is being done by other countries.  I believe that as a society we have the capability, track record and creativity to set best practice, including international best practice.  We have already demonstrated this through initiatives such as the smoking ban in workplaces.  Ireland was the first European country to introduce such a smoking ban.  A similar ban is now in place in the vast majority of European countries.  That is one example.  Another is the current controversy we are currently experiencing in terms of horsemeat and the labelling of food products.  In this regard, I point our European colleagues to the fact that what is now a European crisis was identified by Ireland, through its advanced inspection and labelling systems.  In my view, when it comes to food labelling we already operate to best practice.  Under the stewardship of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, our systems will be fine-tuned to ensure best practice prevails throughout Europe.  Ireland will be the fore in this regard.  They are two examples of where Ireland has made significant advancement in best practice.  <\/p><p>I would like consideration to be given to our setting best practice on a much wider scale.  Ireland's reputation and confidence has been battered as a result of a tremendous recession, probably the worst we have experienced in a long time.  We need to use this experience to set best practice in the financial services industry, in terms of our tourism product, clean environment, quality housing, corporate governance and the elimination of corruption throughout business and in the public sphere.  There is much work to be done.  It is hoped the Ireland's Presidency of the European Council will be the beginning of a new chapter in which Ireland will become, through the use of  talent, experience, ability, energy and its proven track record, one of the outstanding nations of the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600033#GG00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1361901000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate.  We have already had a number of debates on Ireland's Presidency of the European Council, one third of which has almost passed.  We look forward to progress being made.<\/p><p>This is the year of the European citizen.  What will be the response of Irish and European citizens when the Irish Presidency ends?  Irish Presidencies, since the first headed up by former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave in 1975, have been successful from a management perspective and the delivery of the tasks set.  However, Presidencies come and go and people quickly forget about them.  The answer to the question, &quot;What will Irish and European citizens remember about this Presidency in six months' time?&quot;, will be definitive in terms of our workload and progress.  All politics is full of jargon.  The language of politics, in particular European politics, is generally full of jargon.  Our former colleague and political director extraordinaire, Eoghan Harris, described it as the jungle of jargon.  How can we ensure this language impacts on the people?<\/p><p>The phrase &quot;jobs, growth and stability&quot; is often mentioned.  It is a slogan that must become a reality.  From what we have heard today, and since the commencement of the Presidency, much is being done in this regard.  However, a project that must receive maximum attention and must be at the core of the Presidency's work is, as mentioned by Senator Quinn and others, the development of EU-US trade.  The freeing up an economic space wherein trillions of dollars of economic activity can be created will lead to growth, jobs and stability.<\/p> <p>That is the yardstick by which we judge the progress we are making.  While the European Council meetings, ministerial meetings and draft papers are all very important, the results can only be judged in terms of growth, stability and jobs.  In a sense, it is quite amazing that it is only in recent years that we are giving sufficient attention to this US-EU free trade arrangement.  It should have happened decades ago.  In the context of two massive world trading blocs, both with very solid political and economic systems , it is quite unbelievable that such barriers have been allowed to exist.  That has to be the main task of this Government and the Presidency.<\/p><p>I was very taken by the comments of one of my colleagues regarding the Taoiseach being in the United States on St. Patrick's Day, which illustrated the fresh, innovative thinking which often comes from the Seanad rather than the D\u00e1il.  On that day in the White House, the Taoiseach should not just be Enda Kenny, Prime Minister of Ireland but also Enda Kenny, President of Europe, speaking not just for Ireland but also for Europe.  He should talk about the hundreds of thousands of jobs that can be created across the European continent and particularly in this country.  Of course, for every dollar of US investment in Europe, a very significant proportion will inevitably come here.  We must try to free up trade between the US and Europe, which is a big task.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's comments on this matter but we can always have a bilateral meeting about it later if needs be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600033#GG00300","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361901600,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I was going to suggest that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600034#HH00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1361901600,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire St\u00e1it go dt\u00ed an Teach.  As part of the drive for stability, jobs and growth, the Irish Presidency will prioritise bilateral trade agreements with key partners, including the United States of America.  Is any such thing happening with Canada?  Such agreements should deliver positive benefits for all involved and provide newer and greater opportunities.  God knows, opportunities for our young people, many of whom have been out of work for a considerable time, would be most welcome.  The Presidency will also work with renewed purpose on further enlargement of the European Union and will encourage the development of democratic and peaceful societies in the Union's eastern and south-eastern neighbourhoods.

I will try to respond to all of the points made.  There was a lot of overlap in the contributions, with almost everyone highlighting the potential of the free trade negotiations, particularly those involving the United States.  I am really enthused and encouraged by the energy and optimism that exists in this Chamber about the potential for that agreement.  I also welcome Senator Zappone's offer of support for those negotiations and we may come calling on her if we need a friendly American accent to assist us.  The potential is indeed great and many speakers have mentioned it.  However, I do not underestimate the challenge, which is not just confined to agriculture.<\/p><p>  Interestingly, in the last couple of months I have had some very positive discussions with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA.  Ireland is the biggest <i>per capita<\/i> beef exporter in the world, and at the moment we cannot export our beef to what should be a huge market for us, namely, the United States, in particular its east coast.  The IFA is very enthusiastic about the opportunity.  Of course, that is not to say that it will not enter into discussions with some degree of caution, as one would expect any sectoral representative organisation to do, but it certainly sees the opportunity and potential that exists.  I am really enthused by that.  I do not know that the IFA can speak for all of the farmers of Europe but the potential is certainly great and Ireland is really well positioned to take advantage of that.<\/p><p>  There are many potential obstacles, however, as with all aspects of regulation.  Potential pitfalls lie in the digital agenda and in the realm of data protection.  These are issues we are trying to progress within the Single Market at the moment.  In a sense, we must sort out our own house first and we are making significant progress on the digital agenda.  In terms of the EU's internal negotiations, there are a lot of US firms based here which have their own concerns which they are actively bringing to the table in all of the institutions and, indeed, among the member states through lobbying, which is the norm in EU policymaking.  It is interesting because now we must also deal with these issues with potential trade negotiations with the United States in mind.  It is a massive undertaking.<\/p><p>  It is very ambitious to think that we will agree a mandate at EU level by the end of the Presidency but this is our opportunity.  Ireland is a country with a particular relationship with the US and a particular interest in attracting investment from there.  We also appreciate the potential from opening up these markets, unlike other larger countries in Europe which do not have economies as open as ours and which are not as open-minded as we are about trade.  In that context, it is up to us to really push this agenda.  If we miss this opportunity, the whole process might be slowed down again, which would be unfortunate.  Once we get to the point where we have a mandate, we can then get into the negotiations.  Of course, that will also take time.  I was speaking at an event last night alongside a representative from IBEC.  We were discussing how long this process might take.  Normally a free trade agreement, FTA takes a minimum of 18 months to negotiate and I would expect that a US FTA would take slightly longer, because of the scale and complexity.  We really need to inject impetus into this process now so that we can reap the rewards in two or three years time, which must be our goal.<\/p><p>  To answer Senator Brennan, FTA negotiations are under way with Canada.  There are some complications and, needless to say, agriculture is part of those complications, but I am optimistic that we will reach an agreement that will deliver results for Europe and Canada.  Our relationship with Canada is strengthening all of the time.  There are an awful lot of young Irish people in Canada at the moment, as we are all very well aware, and we can harness some of the opportunities that exist there as well.<\/p><p>  Senator Zappone asked about free movement, which is so complex.  We have taken our eye of the ball somewhat in terms of some of the priorities we have been pursuing for the last decade, particularly with regard to the Stockholm programme.  With the financial, banking and economic crises, some of these issues have slid down the agenda.  The Irish Presidency will be prioritising the Schengen package and the asylum package, which are two massive areas where we are trying to make progress.  We must deal with the question of Romania and Bulgaria entering into Schengen.  We are not part of the Schengen area but others are very anxious to get into it.  That is really where the focus is for us at the moment.<\/p><p>  The point Senator Zappone made is excellent in respect of the recognition of documents and the recognition of civil status.  These are issues we have all come across in our dealings with constituents.  We all know of European citizens living in Ireland or Irish citizens who have moved to other countries and the issues they face can be hugely complex.  There is no doubt that we must simplify that process and the idea of a data exchange platform is the future and is the way to do it.  It is also the way to do it with safeguards and protections for data and also for citizens' rights.  I take on board what Senator Zappone has said and will communicate her views to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, who leads on these matters for us.  His agenda is extremely full as it is but I recognise and share the concerns of Senator Zappone that if we are to deliver on genuine free movement of people in Europe, we really must tackle this.<\/p><p>  Connected to that, of course, is one of our Single Market priority files concerning the recognition of professional qualifications, on which we have made great progress already in our Presidency.  We hope we can bring that to a conclusion by the end of the Irish Presidency, which will mean that young professionals from Ireland and all other member states will have their qualifications recognised much more easily in other jurisdictions.  It is incredible that Europe, which has free movement of people, has the lowest mobility rate of any region in the world.<\/p> <p>Some of this has to do with language barriers and so on, but much could be done to free up the system and realise our shared goal of the free movement of people.  The issue is on our radar.<\/p><p> A number of Senators raised the question of enlargement.  As I am leading the Government side on this matter during our Presidency, I am engaged with it.  We are happy that some files are progressing quickly, but others have unfortunately slowed down.  Often, a slowing is due to domestic situations in member states.  It is not always in the control of the Presidency.<\/p><p> At my informal meeting with European affairs Ministers in Dublin in January, I mentioned that I had invited all of the candidate and aspiring candidate countries to send their European integration Ministers and-or chief negotiators.  They are usually the same people.  The aspiring candidates of the western Balkans are Albania and Bosnia, the latter of which was mentioned in this debate and has been raised with me in this House and at the European affairs committee.  I am conscious that the Oireachtas is engaged on the question of Bosnia.  I visited the country last summer.  Everything is happening.  There has been a high-level dialogue and engagement with Bosnia-Herzegovina has occurred at all levels to try to keep it focused on a path towards the EU.  This is not easy, as there are many internal difficulties, but we are giving every support that we can, as is the European Commission.<\/p><p> Likewise, we had hoped for a Commission progress report on Albania in April, but Commissioner F\u00fcle has announced that he will not issue a progress report because of the proximity of the Albanian elections.  This is the right decision, as there have never been free and fair elections in Albania.  Before we can consider granting candidate status, we need it to demonstrate that there can be such elections.  Unofficially, the decision has been to postpone the report.<\/p><p> On the other hand, I am optimistic about Serbia and Kosovo.  Prime Minister Da&#269;i&#263; was in Dublin last week.  I met him in Belgrade last autumn.  We have engaged intensively.  The Taoiseach has personally encouraged the Prime Minister and his Administration to engage fully in the high-level dialogue with Kosovo.  The Belgrade-Pristina dialogue is being chaired by Baroness Catherine Ashton, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  There have been strides.  It is exciting.  The region is delicate and there are many sensitivities, including in terms of the issues between Kosovo and Serbia.  The leaders of both have engaged fully in the process and significant steps have been taken.  I am optimistic that, when the Commission issues its report in April, it will recommend opening negotiations with Serbia and launching negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement with Kosovo.  It will be an historic decision and I am confident that it will be taken under the Irish Presidency.  It will probably be taken at the June European Council meeting.  We are working hard to ensure that we deliver on it.<\/p><p> Turkish accession negotiations have been stalled for a number of years and there has been no progress.  The Irish Presidency has achieved a breakthrough, as we have managed to get agreement from France, which had blocked a range of chapters, to unblock chapter 24 on regional policy.  We have begun taking steps towards unfreezing negotiations with Turkey.  The country is an important strategic partner for Europe, including in geopolitical security terms, and is seeing economic growth.  It is an important country.  Whatever the outcome of the negotiations will be, we must strive to bring Turkey closer to Europe and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  I am pleased to report that the Irish Presidency is making progress on this front.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600034#HH00700","speaker":"1036","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361902200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I am afraid that the Minister of State is out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600035#JJ00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1361902200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I have covered many of the points that have been raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600035#JJ00300","speaker":"1036"},{"type":"speech","time":1361902200,"counter":155,"content":"<p>What of a peace corps?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600035#JJ00400","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1361902200,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Although the idea is neither on the EU's radar nor a current proposal, it has a great deal of merit.

I have raised it because a replacement bus service for west Cavan has recently discovered that it cannot accept free bus passes, as the service will be considered a new applicant.  Local representatives and residents are arguing that the route does not necessarily constitute a new application, as a different company is providing a rural community with the same route that was recently removed by Bus \u00c9ireann due to cuts.  The Department of Social Protection has stated that it is not in a position to consider applications for additional routes to the free travel scheme, as the scheme's expenditure has been frozen at 2010 levels in line with the National Recovery Plan 2011-14.<\/p><p>What provision is being made for people who had been availing of the free travel scheme under Bus \u00c9ireann, but who cannot avail of the free travel scheme following the removal of the route and the subsequent replacement of same by alternative providers?  I have discussed the matter with many of the people in west Cavan and elsewhere who have been affected by such a scenario, in that they are no longer able to use their bus passes because spending on the scheme has been capped at 2010 levels.<\/p><p>Entitlements to free travel have been whittled down by cutbacks.  The ability of people in rural Ireland to travel affordably is being diminished.  Considerable relief was expressed in the communities of west Cavan when the removed bus services started to be offered through an alternative arrangement.  However, that the free travel scheme will not extend to them is a harrowing blow.  The company that has stepped in to provide this vital rural service in west Cavan is a part of a group and is a reputable provider of rural and interurban services that are no longer offered by Bus \u00c9ireann.  In many areas, such companies are often the only suppliers of public transport.<\/p><p>Given the fact that the services in question are licensed, the company should be empowered to operate the free travel scheme on the same basis as Bus \u00c9ireann.  The routes are the same but the operators are different.  In many parts of the country, including along these routes, people would not have effective access to free travel without the services of such companies.<\/p><p>I wish to highlight the problem of rural isolation, which could easily stem from this issue if transport is not affordable.  People can be dependent on others to get them to neighbouring towns to avail of services, an occurrence that has become increasingly common since the removal of services from towns.  People, particularly in rural, isolated communities like west Cavan, must travel longer distances.<\/p><p>The removal of the free travel scheme for people on the routes in question could further reduce access to services for people in rural Ireland.  For this reason, will the Department of Social Protection consider an amnesty or the like for the service providers who take up the mantle of rural services dropped by Bus \u00c9ireann so that they can access the free travel scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600035#JJ01300","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1361902200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection.

In many instances we do not get a line Minister in here and I appreciate his interest in this area.<\/p><p>I have argued this matter with a previous Minister, former Deputy Noel Dempsey, for many hours in the Seanad.  For the past ten or 12 years, the Bantry Harbour board has been a success story and it should be left as it is.  It is an unusual model, and apart from the oil storage and facilities on Whiddy Island, there must also be consideration of Garinish Island, which is a tourist interest, of inland fishermen and of the people still living on Whiddy Island.  It encompasses approximately two thirds if not three quarters of all the Bantry Bay area, which is the second finest bay in the world.  It is approximately eight miles deep and an average of eight miles wide in most areas.  It has taken the biggest oil tankers ever built into the harbour and it was successful in retaining the entire British admiralty fleet at the time of the 1796 invasion.<\/p><p>There are a few points worth making.  Its current structure is a low operating cost model, with no tax paid on profit.  Members, at their own volition, get no payment whatever and all profits are retained and spent locally.  The board has local control, with many users' interest in the bay being properly looked after.  Its key focus is improving the marine infrastructure deficit in the inner harbour, which is an historic problem going back decades.  It has a healthy bank balance somewhere in the region of \u20ac1.5 million.  Its net worth and balance sheet has grown eight-fold in the past ten years, with \u20ac4.5 million spent in the past seven years on the development of Whiddy slipway, the Abbey Point slipway, commercial pontoons, pier raising at the main pier, land acquisition, derrick purchase and the surveys and planning costs for the inner harbour master development plan, of which I am sure the Minister is aware.  The master plan can be rolled out over the next number of years subject to income availability from the oil shipping being protected.<\/p><p>The best way forward is to continue the harbour where it is, spending the money on local infrastructure and capital investment.  I am expressing the fear of a vast majority of people in the greater Bantry area, including fishermen, harbour users, yachtsmen and oarsmen, etc.  A plan was afoot prior to the Minister's arrival at the Department to have the Port of Cork assume control of Bantry, subject to certain conditions, and we are afraid that the greater interests of the people in the Bantry area will not be properly serviced and funding will be taken from the Whiddy oil process.  I have absolutely no doubt if the board had a deficit of \u20ac1.5 million, the Port of Cork would walk away.  At times the authority appears not to be interested in Bantry but I am afraid of conceding any big issue.<\/p><p>After many years, the Bantry Harbour board was established under a former Minister, former Deputy Peter Barry, and it is working very well.  It has a low cost and is efficient, and it is making money.  When the process is not broken, why should we fix it?  I have very deep-rooted views on the matter as my forefathers going back to before the Great Famine were fishermen in Bantry Bay.  I know most of the inlets and outlets there for good or bad.  I am deeply concerned that if the Port of Cork takes over the running of the area, it will have a negative impact on many other interests.  It may be good for the oil terminal and similar development but there are also socioeconomic and tourism interests to consider, as well as the welfare of inshore fishermen.  There is also substantial fish farming in Bantry Bay and the fear is that down the road other interests will suffer and the community will be negatively affected if Bantry Harbour board is in any way taken in charge by the Port of Cork.<\/p><p>Perhaps I have gone on a tangent but I wait anxiously on the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600036#KK00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1361902800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Before calling the Minister I welcome a former Member of the D\u00e1il and Minister to the Gallery, Mr. Noel Davern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600036#KK00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1361902800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  Policy relating to regional harbours, published in the Government's ports policy statement in 2005, is that the continued operation of harbours under the outdated provisions of the Harbours Act 1946 is unsustainable on the grounds of good governance.  It proposed that harbours would best achieve their potential through their transfer to local authority ownership or, in the case where harbours had significant commercial traffic, consideration would be given to bring them under the control of a port company.  My Department has worked with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government over the last number of years to progress the transfers.<\/p><p>The transfer of harbours is consistent with the following objectives: reduction in the number of State agencies and public bodies; strengthening corporate governance of significant State assets; unlocking amenity value of the assets to the benefit of local communities; and enabling the repeal of the outmoded Harbours Act 1946.  Twelve from a total of 13 harbours have now successfully transferred.  Fenit Harbour transferred to Kerry County Council on 1 October 2011 while Baltimore, Kinsale and Arklow harbours transferred to local authority control on 1 January 2012.<\/p><p>Bantry is now the only remaining harbour operating under the Harbours Act 1946.  The core business of Bantry Harbour is the oil storage and transhipment terminal on Whiddy Island.  The Phillips 66 oil facilities on Whiddy Island are privately owned.  Aquaculture, fishing and tourism are prevalent in the harbour and a number of cruise liners also visit the harbour each year.<\/p><p>The KPMG review of regional ports and harbours, published in 1999, recommended that the harbour authority merge with the Port of Cork.  It was of the opinion that amalgamation with Cork Port would provide access to port expertise, marketing, strategic development planning and the skills required for the regulation of navigation, ship and port security requirements, pilotage, safety, emergency response, pollution, etc.  Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners are currently the responsible authority under the Harbours Act 1946 for the control, operation and development of Bantry Harbour.  Their main role relates to jurisdiction over the waters, such as pilotage, responsibility for safety and navigation and so on.  The operation of large oil tankers, bulk carriers and cruise liners in and out of the bay requires specific expertise. The Port of Cork currently provides a harbour master's service on a contractual basis to assist in this regard.<\/p><p>Work commenced in 2012 to examine the requirements necessary to transfer the harbour.  The harbour commissioners established a sub-committee to examine this issue and officials from my Department have been working with both the Port of Cork and the harbour commissioners on the transfer.  During these discussions, the Port of Cork has clearly indicated that it is positive about the transfer and willing to work with the Department and the harbour towards this objective.  Cork Port already has a very good professional relationship with Phillips 66 through the oil refinery in Cork harbour.  It also has a contractual arrangement with Bantry to provide professional expertise and a harbour master to bring in large oil tankers and cruise liners into the bay.  This is an absolute requirement by the company to operate the business in Whiddy to help mitigate the risks of maritime accidents, environmental damage, etc.<\/p><p>I met representatives of the harbour commissioners in July 2012 and more recently this month in Dublin.<\/p> <p>It is my intention that the transfer should take place with the co-operation of the stakeholders concerned.  A positive discussion took place and a number of issues were clarified.<\/p><p> As the Senator is aware, provision was included in the Harbours (Amendment) Act 2009 to allow the transfer of Bantry Harbour to the Port of Cork to take place.  That Act provides that a public consultation must be completed before any transfer and, in section 18(2)(<i>d<\/i>), it outlines how that consultation should take place.  I intend to hold a public consultation over the next month or so on the proposed transfer of Bantry to the Port of Cork, as required by the legislation.<\/p><p> In relation to the future and the independence of the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, the board was appointed in 2009 for a five-year period which will end in October 2014.  Similar to the legal position that pertained in relation to the transfer of other regional harbours, should the harbour transfer before that date the board will stand dissolved on the date of transfer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600036#KK00400","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361903400,"counter":171,"content":"<p>It seems that what I feared is likely to happen.

The school, which is a community college, has 60 places in transition year, 84 pupils applied and their son was turned down for a place.  In junior certificate year, the pupils are asked to complete an application form for transition year and, I understand, the headmaster and teachers decide who wins out in the selection process.<\/p><p>Transition year is very important and too advantageous to pupils to allow a local headmaster and teachers to decide who is selected for it and who is left out.  Such a system is open to abuse, favouritism, discrimination and prejudice and should have no place in the world we live in today.  I understand the pupils were marked by their ten teachers on a scale of zero to ten.  The issue is one of equality, transparency, favouritism, discrimination, prejudice and the rights of children.<\/p><p>The parents who spoke to me are disappointed and their son is also disappointed that of the 18 in his class who applied 16 got places, he being one of the two who did not.  No child should have to be made feel that way at school and we must do all we can to safeguard the well-being and welfare of all our children.  <\/p><p>If there is insufficient funding for the school to offer all its pupils transition year it should not be offered to any.  However, if the Minister for Education and Skills wants his schools to offer a limited number of transition year places, they should be offered on a fully transparent and random basis.  Some schools, for example, have a lottery system where parents are invited to attend.  <\/p><p>Who gives these people the right to say which child is suitable and which child is not?  That decision is much too important to give to people who are close to the issue.  There is a clear conflict of interest when teachers are asked to decide between a colleague's child and nobody's child.  A lottery is clearly a good solution.<\/p><p>Children doing the junior certificate examination are at a vulnerable age and undermining their self-esteem and confidence in this manner is extremely dangerous.  I highlight the current suicide problem in the country.  We owe children a much higher duty of care.  If a child were to self-harm as a result of being depressed or let down by such an unfair system we would regret it.  <\/p><p>Schools should have a policy on transition year.  Some schools make that policy public but they are not required to do so.

I thank Senator Henry for raising this issue.  It affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the situation with regard to the funding for the transition year programme.<\/p><p>Transition year is a one year programme, available to all second level schools.  It is designed to act as a bridge between the junior certificate and leaving certificate programmes.  The Department of Education and Skills provides teaching resources and additional grant aid to schools that offer the transition year programme.  A teacher allocation is given to each school offering the programme, based on a pupil teacher ratio of 18.25:1 for DEIS schools, 19:1 for schools in the free education scheme and 21:1 for fee-charging schools.  Approximately 1,700 whole-time equivalent teaching posts were allocated to schools in the 2012-13 school year in respect of transition year at an estimated cost of \u20ac109 million.  Schools in the free education scheme also qualify for payment of a transition year grant of \u20ac95 for each pupil participating in the programme.  The cost of transition year grants in 2012 was \u20ac2.7 million.<\/p><p>Schools are free to devise a flexible modular programme within an overall framework set out by the Department.  Each school designs its own programme within set guidelines to suit the needs and interests of its students.  In establishing its own distinctive programme content, the school takes into account the possibilities offered by the local community interests.  The cost, therefore, of the programme is dependent upon the particular circumstances in each individual school.  Schools are conscious of any additional costs being imposed on parents in the current economic circumstances and seek to minimise these.  Schools may seek voluntary contributions from parents, provided it is made clear to parents that there is no compulsion to pay and that a child's place in the programme is not dependant on a willingness to make a contribution.  This is, of course, a key requirement for all recognised schools in the free education scheme.  Such schools must not operate a charge, in whatever form, that is in effect a mandatory fee and that is contrary to the principles of the free education scheme.<\/p> <p>While the transition year grant has not been reduced in the lifetime of this Government - it was reduced from \u20ac100 to \u20ac95 per pupil in January 2011 - overall resources to second level schools have.  I fully acknowledge that this reduction is challenging for schools.  In respect of transition year, schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources.  The management authority of each school also carries responsibility for making decisions regarding participation in the transition year programme in that school.  Approximately 75% of schools participate in the programme.  In some schools, the programme is compulsory for all students.  In those that offer it as an option, circumstances may arise where it is necessary to limit the number of students who can avail of it.  In cases where restrictions apply, schools should have clear procedures regarding how places are allocated to students.<\/p><p>Transition year offers students an opportunity to mature and develop without the pressure of an examination.  It also provides an opportunity for students to reflect on, and develop an appreciation of, the value of education and training in preparing them for the ever-changing demands of the adult world of work and relationships.  Given the scale of our economic crisis, there is no scope to introduce new or additional funding measures to assist schools in providing the transition year programme.  I thank the Senator for the opportunity to respond to the House and to clarify matters regarding the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600037#LL00700","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1361904000,"counter":179,"content":"<p>The Minister stated schools should have clear procedures regarding how places are allocated to students.

The physical condition of the building has deteriorated considerably in recent years and there has been no investment in it.

Under section 78 of the Act, a library authority may take such measures, engage in such activities or do such things in accordance with law, including the incurring of expenditure, for the provision of library services as it considers necessary or desirable.  A library authority may, in particular, arrange for the provision of premises and facilities, including mobile facilities, for the library service, as it considers appropriate.<\/p><p>In 2008, my Department requested library authorities to provide details of priorities for library development within their.area.  In its response, Galway County Council ranked a new branch library in Tuam branch as its main priority, followed by projects at Ballinasloe, the replacement of a mobile library and two delivery vans, and fit-out of a new branch to be constructed at Mountbellew .  In 2010, my Department provided funding of \u20ac460,000 to Galway County Council towards the new Tuam branch library and a further \u20ac250,000 for a new mobile library.  In 2011, I announced a new library capital programme to support the continued development of the library service in Ireland within budgetary constraints through the local authorities.<\/p><p>Following detailed consideration of the various library priorities communicated to my Department, I included the offer of grant aid in 2011 to Galway County Council of \u20ac250,000 or 75% of eligible costs towards the Ballinasloe library project.  The funding was provided to allow the council to engage consultants and a design team to prepare this project for Part 8 planning.  Of this grant offer, \u20ac115,297.87 was drawn down by the local authority.  Due to the constraints on funding provision, it was not possible to offer grant assistance beyond 2011.<\/p><p>Galway County Council's proposal is to refurbish and develop the former Convent of Mercy building and adjoining chapel in Ballinasloe for use as a branch library.  The estimated total cost of the project is \u20ac3.252 million.  The council engaged consultants and work proceeded on a detailed design for the project.  A planning application for the project was submitted to Ballinasloe Town Council in mid-2012.  It is open to the local authority to proceed with this project using its own resources, which would be a good way for it to demonstrate its commitment to the project.  Available funding for 2013 of \u20ac5 million is expected to be fully committed to ongoing library projects.  Since 1999, my Department has provided \u20ac123.5 million towards the development of infrastructure and stocking of the library service in Ireland, including the projects I mentioned in east Galway.  There is no doubt that this has helped local authorities to develop a good library infrastructure in the country and to provide excellent library services to the public from junior infants to college students and from preschool children to senior citizens.  I regret that the additional resources the Senator is requesting are not available from central funds to advance the Ballinasloe project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600038#MM00400","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1361904000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply, although I am disappointed.

The county council is committed to the project and there is huge support in the town for it.  Ballinasloe Town Council is particularly supportive of this project.  Given that as far back as 2007, there was an expectation that this project would proceed, I ask the Minister to re-examine it with a view to giving the go-ahead to allow it go to tender.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013022600038#MM00500","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1361904000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Many things were in anticipation as far back as 2007.  We were in a different financial and economic climate at that time and we have had to make considerable adjustments to the capital and current expenditure programmes of the State to meet our troika requirements.  Unfortunately, the library programme is not immune to that.  I am delighted that Ballinasloe Town Council is interested in progressing the project and I understand it has considerable capital resources in its account.  It is open to a local authority to examine the feasibility of proceeding with a project out of its own resources.  The \u20ac5 million that will be spent through the library programme this year is for ongoing projects.
