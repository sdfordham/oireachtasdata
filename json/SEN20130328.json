Rather than it being diffused, it appears to grown further legs where the Minister, the Garda Commissioner and other authorities have got involved and that those involved will be disciplined.  That is regrettable.  I ask the deputy Leader to make contact with the Minister for Justice and Equality, even at this late stage, to diffuse the row.  There is no need for it.  The Garda has a very difficult job and a limited set of tools with which to highlight its concerns.  In the confines of its own conference this was done.  I am not necessarily condoning what they did but to move to a disciplinary process, following what happened, will not endear the Government and the authorities to the Garda or contribute to morale at a time when it is at an all time low.  We should seek to build bridges and ensure the Garda has everything it needs to carry out its difficult job on our behalf.  I do not believe any disciplinary action should be taken against the four gentlemen who, in the final analysis, were raising issues of genuine concern to their members.<\/p> <p> This week a year ago, D\u00fan U\u00ed N\u00e9ill Barracks in Cavan closed with the transfer of 120 Army personnel from the Border county of Cavan to Athlone.  At the time, my colleague who is attending another meeting, Senator Wilson, warned of the potential for dissident activities increasing as a result of the removal of the security which was offered by the Army barracks and personnel there.  Indeed, we have seen in recent weeks where two cars on the Border of Fermanagh and Cavan were picked up loaded with explosives.  As none of us need be reminded, the G8 summit takes place in Fermanagh later this year and it is vitally important that security is provided on both sides of the Border for that.  I wonder whether the Leader could inquire as to what aspect the Army will take in the preparations for that, and highlight that D\u00fan U\u00ed N\u00e9ill Barracks, had it still been open, would be an obvious location from where to carry out this work.<\/p><p>I ask the Deputy Leader to inquire of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in terms of its visa issuing procedures, that it would interline with its British counterparts, in particular, in the context of the G8.  It has come to my attention this morning that the substantial Russian and Chinese delegations making inquiries to base themselves south of the Border in preparation for the G8 summit are being hampered seriously by the authorities, both in Britain and in Ireland, who are responsible for issuing visas for this purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800002#A00500","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364466600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I listened carefully to Senator MacSharry on the matter of the garda\u00ed.

It seems that many of the contracts for sale that were to be processed by IBRC prior to its liquidation will now be held up for four months, and possibly longer, as a result of the appointment of this liquidator.  They seem to have the view that they must reappraise all the sales and go through all those proposed contracts.  Obviously, this is holding up a significant amount of sales that were approved and which may not go ahead because of the delay.  There are those who want to buy some of the homes.  There are commercial property and business is being held up.  A significant tranche - billions of euro worth of property are involved in this - will be delayed as a result of the liquidator's actions.  I ask that the Leader bring in the Minister for Finance, or at least get an explanation, and organise a debate as to why the economy is being held up by the actions of the liquidator.  This involves a delay in people's lives and the slowing down of the economy.  We want the economy to move forward, yet, through the actions of liquidators, instead of allowing sales and contracts - ones that have been approved and in some cases, signed by one of the parties - to go through, they will be stalled.  We could see those sales collapse at a loss not only to those involved, but also to the taxpayer.  I ask the Deputy Leader to organise a debate on that issue.<\/p><p>I support my colleague's call for an inquiry into why the visas for Chinese and Russian delegates visiting Ireland will be delayed.  We have one of the most appalling visa processes in the Western world.  Instead of encouraging investment from BRIC countries, the Government discourages it by the visa process.  I ask the Deputy Leader to organise a debate or get the Minister into the House to explain why officials from China and Russia will be put through a tortuous visa application process in Ireland.  Instead of making it easier and encouraging trade with and visits to Ireland, the Government is discouraging it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800003#B00900","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1364466600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I join my colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan, in welcoming the good news announced yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that all dogs will be microchipped.

The Irish Arts Review and other people engaged in the arts have launched a campaign to return the window to Ireland for The Gathering event to celebrate a gathering of our greatest Irish writers.  The window depicts 15 Irish writers.  It was commissioned in 1926 by the Irish Government for the League of Nations headquarters in Geneva in order to showcase Ireland.  It is the best piece of stained glass that has ever been designed.  We all know about Harry Clarke's stained glass windows and many of them are located in churches and so on.  The Geneva Window depicts Irish writers and brought together the best Irish writers.  Unfortunately, after it was commissioned there was controversy when the then President saw it because of Liam O'Flaherty's depiction which included a scantily clad but not nude women but these days we are able for it.  The window should be returned to Ireland for The Gathering, although we may not be able to afford to purchase the window.  The Clarke family treasured the window until 1988 when it sold it to the Wolfsonian Foundation in Miami.<\/p> <p>Yesterday, we were talking about philanthropy and foundations, and I congratulate the Independent Senators for bringing that matter before the House.  It was Mr. Mulcahy at the <i>Irish Art Review<\/i>who started this campaign to try to get the window back.  We owe it to all Irish writers to be included in our own Gathering because it is the most iconic work of visual art to have come out of Ireland in the 20th century.  Harry Clarke died at the tender age of 41 and this was his last masterpiece.  It would be great if we could get it back here.  Obviously, we cannot afford to buy it back, but perhaps we could get it back for The Gathering.

I believe, however, that certain elements of the Government have started to behave in an extraordinarily arrogant fashion.  The blame may not be all on one side, but I was very surprised when the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, dragged his wife into the equation.  I do not think that was wise.  In terms of the well-being of the State it is essential to have good relations with the garda\u00ed.  Everything that is being done by the Government, however, appears to have provoked them further.  Nonetheless, I believe the garda\u00ed have acted with a fair amount of dignity.<\/p><p>I also feel that there is an unnecessary curtailment of freedom of speech.  In this situation, to arraign four senior members of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na before a kind of star chamber is not appropriate.  It is even worse to hear that a member of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na who was going about his business, doing his family shopping in Ratoath - and who was approached by an electioneering party, including the Taoiseach, and then expressed his mind to the leading politician in this country - is also under investigation.  That is outrageous.  I ask the Leader if the Minister for Justice and Equality can attend this House to give an undertaking that no procedures will be taken, particularly against an individual - that is, the garda in Ratoath - who was approached and canvassed by the Taoiseach.  The garda then explained to him what he felt.  He has every reason to feel aggrieved, as many other sections of society have.  <\/p><p>I was with a number of Members of both Houses at a briefing of the front-line services and garda\u00ed were literally in tears because they have no money.

Certain elements wanted the camps moved along quickly, while others said they had a right to protest peacefully.  In a civilised society that is a principle we should hold dear.  What the four garda\u00ed did at the AGSI conference was a form of peaceful protest.<\/p><p>My understanding is that members of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na were not part of the Croke Park I or II negotiation system.  They were handed a piece of paper telling them about the conditions they would have to accept.  It is perfectly acceptable that garda\u00ed, on whom we depend to defend our communities and work on our behalf, should be able to have some form of protest.  I also note that it is something parliamentarians use on occasion.  When the Gaeltacht Bill was being debated last year in the D\u00e1il, Opposition politicians of all hues used the peaceful protest of walking out on the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley.  I do not see the difference between the politicians who walked out there and the garda\u00ed who walked out in protest at a Minister at the AGSI conference.  I find it a bit rich that Deputy Niall Collins of Fianna F\u00e1il has asked the garda\u00ed in question to apologise.

This is particularly galling for taxpayers who have bailed out banks to such a large extent.  It is a pity that the banks were not more meticulous when they were handing out large loans.  They should have better checked out people's creditworthiness and the sustainability of business plans that were put forward by some developers.

However, I would like to know how RTE management could have allowed such obscene salaries that could take a 30% cut yet still be huge.  How could that have been allowed to happen in this country?

One of the most enlightening and informative aspects of the visit was the newly developed digital department which is now relaying programmes on RTE Player and iPhones and tablets, not only in this country but among the Irish diaspora.  There is a strong response from the diaspora to the service being provided.<\/p><p>I accept to some extent the critique of RTE by Senator Mullins.  I would be the last to defend some of the large salaries being paid but one must keep in mind that RTE is a national broadcaster that is competing with some of the largest multinational media organisations, in particular the Murdoch organisation.  Great credit is due to RTE and those involved in the production of programmes.  People vote with their feet both in television and radio, as they do in politics, and the top ten programmes consistently come out of RTE.  I suggest a note of caution to Senator Mullins, through the Chair, on his critique of RTE and his call for a reduction in the licence fee on which it depends to a great extent because of the downturn in economic activity and, consequently, a reduction in advertising revenue.  One of the areas we visited yesterday was the \u201cFair City\u201d set.  I discovered that more than 300 actors are employed by RTE at one level or another ranging from speaking parts to non-speaking parts, from major parts to ones of lesser importance.  Currently, of 1,500 members of Irish Equity, almost 1,000 are out of work.  When one considers that RTE employs 300 actors, it puts in perspective how important it is not only as a producer of television and radio programmes and digital output but also as a major employer.  I caution that when one is being critical of RTE - it has been a favourite sport for decades to toss RTE around, so to speak - to recall that it provides not only a valuable public service to radio and television but it also provides meaningful employment.  One should be cautious in suggesting that its income should be in any way restricted.<\/p><p>That is not to say that the work of local radio stations is not to be encouraged.  I declare an interest in that I present a programme on local radio and I know how difficult it is for the local radio sector currently because, like RTE on a micro level, it has to engage with local suppliers and finds it very difficult to raise advertising revenue.  We must nurture and encourage all sectors of the media in this country but I would be cautious in my approach.  While being critical of RTE and unwilling to defend the salaries, which relative to the wider economy are extraordinarily high, at the same time there is another story within RTE that needs to be aired on occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800006#E00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1364468400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Following on from Senator Mooney, what amazed me about the figures for RTE is how some among the top ten earners in RTE work every day for the same money as others who have only one show a week, amounting to less than 30 shows.  I am perplexed at how those numbers are arrived at, and I would welcome a debate with the Minister who could provide a more in-depth analysis.<\/p><p>I wish to raise the issue of the Garda in the context of the Personal Insolvency Act.  Most people are aware that a member of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na is disallowed from being declared bankrupt.  I have not been able to ascertain whether a member of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na is entitled to avail of the Personal Insolvency Act.  It is a legitimate question in that when someone is declared bankrupt, his or her assets and liabilities are analysed and dispersed according to the court assignee.  In effect, that is what is happening in line with the Personal Insolvency Act by agreement with the banks.  I do not know whether the Garda is excluded from the legislation.  If it is excluded, a change must be made to allow it to be included as a matter of urgency.  The omission could have slipped through undetected by me and everyone else.  It is a real concern.<\/p><p>The anger I have witnessed from members of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na relates to younger members who have bought expensive houses at the height of the property market.

I spoke a little about some aspects of it yesterday.  Not only does it increase the standards of science and medicine, and the standards of research, but it also improves clinical outcomes for patients and has positive and beneficial effects for the economy.  My concern is that one aspect of the system \u2013 I am sorry for getting a little bit technical \u2013 which has worked relatively well looks like it is about to undergo a substantial change.  It is probably putting it too strongly to say I am troubled but I am a little in the dark about it, namely, the situation with respect to the ethical research committees which exist in hospitals.  Every hospital must have an ethical research committee.  In this country when a new trial involving a new drug or medication of a research nature is being introduced it must have the approval of a statutorily constituted ethics committee.<\/p><p>The 2004 European clinical trials directive had many negative features but it had one positive one, namely, that the verdict of any legally constituted ethical research committee in a hospital applied in every other hospital in the country.  One does not have to apply individually.  We have a two-step process for the approval of clinical trials in this country, which is correct.  There is a national regulatory approval system conducted by the Irish Medicines Board and a second layer of approval is conducted on an ethical level.  The remit of ethics committees is to ensure the research is ethical.  That constrains the enthusiasm of doctors who have an academic self-interest and sometimes of companies that have a financial self-interest.  Until now, the ethical research committees, which operate in response to statute and are regulated, answer to the Minister for Health, but apparently as part of the new health information Bill there is a suggestion that they will in some sense be answerable to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  Not alone would that not be optimal, it would not be appropriate because HIQA is also the body which has direct responsibility for assessing the cost of treatment in this country and directly or indirectly makes critical decisions and gives the Minister advice on which drug should be used on the grounds of health economics.  It is a colossal conflict of interest for it to be responsible also for clinical research and I believe we need to have a different structure for it.<\/p><p>At present I run international research trials which recruit patients across different countries.  Ireland has an extremely good reputation for having a professional and efficient clinical trials approval process which is streamlined and works relatively quickly.  The United Kingdom in contrast, from where much of the intellectual inspiration for HIQA has come, has perhaps the worst reputation in Europe and as a result my British colleagues are exasperated at their inability to make high quality clinical trials and new treatments available to patients who are often in desperate situations.<\/p> <p>The baby and bathwater spring to mind here but the more appropriate way to look at this is to ensure we do not develop an unnecessary solution to a problem that does not exist.  The Minister should keep his eye firmly on this.  This is the sort of thing people think is very technical and people in the Department will be able to handle this but it really needs careful consideration and consultation.  I propose that in this Chamber we would schedule a debate on this critically important sector of the economy and health sector, biomedical research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800006#E00400","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364469000,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Before calling Senator Bacik, I join other Members of the House in wishing Jimmy Walsh, the journalist from <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, well in his retirement.

The idea of an apology and an invitation from the GRA to the Minister to its AGM, as Deputy Collins suggested is a good one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800007#F00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1364469000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>The Minister might apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800007#F00500","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1364469000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Senator MacSharry also raised the issue of the closure of barracks in Cavan in the context of the G8 summit in Fermanagh, which we all welcome because it will be a great boost for the region, not just north of the Border but in the immediate vicinity south of the Border.  I am sure security arrangements are in hand in respect of that summit.<\/p><p>The Senator also raised the issue of visas, particularly in respect of the Russian and Chinese delegations to the summit.  I had not been aware of any particular difficulty but it would be good for us to debate unnecessary visa restrictions in a more general sense because in the year of The Gathering, we do not want to put unnecessary obstacles in the way of people who wish to come here.<\/p><p>Senator Coghlan also raised the issue of the garda\u00ed and complimented the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on his proposals for microchipping of dogs. It is a welcome proposal from the point of view of animal welfare.  Senator Comiskey raised the more serious issue of the horrific mauling to death of a 14 year old girl in England.  Microchipping offers safeguards for people in general because it makes dog owners more accountable and will have positive implications in rural areas where sheep worrying is an issue and in urban areas will have an impact on dogs fouling pavements, a less serious matter but annoying nonetheless.  This move will make dog owners more accountable and be of benefit to animal welfare.  I also welcome the Minister's announcement that he will work with veterinary practitioners to ensure dogs can be microchipped for as close to cost as possible.<\/p><p>Senator Daly raised the issue of the IBRC and the liquidator, and called for the Minister for Finance to come to address this, as did Senator Hayden.  He also called for a debate on the visa issue, and I have asked for that to be arranged.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett mentioned the Minister for Education and Skills proposals on the reform of the points system, where he said he is impatient but not reckless, which Senator Barrett sees as a good combination.  I complement Senator Barrett on the excellent reception and debate at the Hist, which Senator Norris chaired and which I spoke at.  It was an outing for the Trinity College Senators to the oldest debating society in Ireland, and a great evening was had by all. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800007#F00600","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1364469000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>There is woman auditor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800007#F00700","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1364469000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>She is a law student and a very capable auditor.

The Minister is not threatening that, or suggesting that courses should be abolished, he is saying the points race should be streamlined to ensure less multiplicity of courses.  Reforms are in train in Trinity College and other colleges on that.  The idea is to make the system better for students rather than reducing choice.<\/p><p>  Senator Hayden welcomed the extension of the period for the fuel allowance by the Minister for social protection, which is very welcome given the terrible weather we have been having.  She also called for a debate on fuel poverty, which I will ask the Leader to arrange.  She very kindly mentioned the report published by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality published yesterday on penal reform which I authored.  I hope we can debate that report before the summer.  There is good coverage in the newspapers today about some of the recommendations in the report and a welcome editorial in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> calling for the report to be implemented.  It makes some sensible and practical recommendations for reducing prison numbers and bringing about a greatly improved penal system.<\/p><p>  Senator Hayden also called for the Minister for Finance to attend the House for a debate on banking, as did Senator Daly.  I have made that request but I would point out that we had a debate on banking in July with the Minister and only 12 Senators took part.

The latter concluded a deal with their management counterparts which was facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission.  Their representatives chose to stay in the talks, as did the Prison Officers Association which represents another disciplined force and conducted parallel negotiations.  The POA is different to the extent that it is represented by ICTU.  However, owing to the unique issues which arise in the Prison Service, it was able to conduct parallel negotiations on behalf of its members.  No one suggests prison officers and members of the Defence Forces were disadvantaged by sectoral talks.  It is disappointing that the GRA and AGSI chose to leave the process as they may well have shaped the outcome of the talks in the best interests of their members, as other comparable unions and associations did.

I agree with him that it is galling for taxpayers to read the prescriptive advice that appears to have been given in the guidelines.  He also raised the issue of salary levels in RTE and called for a debate on value for money for the television licence.  Perhaps that issue would be best discussed in the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  Senator Mooney referred to a visit yesterday to RTE by members of the joint committee and noted the good work done by the public service broadcaster.  No one could defend the salary or fee levels in RTE.  Part of the problem is the current pay structure in place because the figures published recently do not refer to salaries but fees that are negotiated, sometimes on an annual basis, with incorporated companies representing individual presenters.  While the fees are excessive and disproportionate, there is clearly a process under way of negotiating them downwards.  I welcome the significant cuts in fees and I am sure we will see them negotiated further downwards.  The matter would be best addressed by the joint committee which may well invite RTE management to come before it to explain how the process of negotiating fees is undertaken. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800008#G00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1364469600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Fees have declined by 30% over the past three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800008#G00500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1364469600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>That is correct and I anticipate further reductions.

primary purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the increases in motor tax rates and trade plate licences contained in the financial resolution on motor tax passed by the D\u00e1il on budget day, 5 December 2012.  The new rates applied in respect of motor tax paid after budget night for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  The Bill confirms the increases in motor tax contained in the financial resolution, namely, an increase of 7.5% applied across most categories of vehicle, and to trade licences, in particular in relation to the engine capacity of pre-2008 cars and commercial vehicles.  The average increase for vehicles taxed on the basis of CO2, namely, cars manufactured from 2008 onwards, is 19.8%.  These increases will raise some \u20ac86.5 million extra in 2013.<\/p><p>In budget 2012, the Minister for Finance announced a review of the carbon banding applying to vehicle registration tax and motor tax, with a view to having a revised taxation structure in place for this budget.  The Government's twin priorities have been to ensure the continuation of the positive environmental impact on vehicle emissions and the protection of the tax base.  Under the new motor tax structure, the A band is now split into four bands which correspond with the restructuring carried out by the Minister for Finance for VRT purposes.  There is also an additional zero emissions motor tax category to provide an additional incentive for electric vehicles.  Band B has been split into two 10g bands.<\/p><p>The revised banding recognises that ever more fuel efficient cars are becoming available and allows for the continuing differentiation of the environmental incentive in favour of the most environmentally friendly vehicles.  The reduction in tax for electric vehicles recognises there are no emissions at the point of use of these vehicles.  <\/p><p>These changes ensure a strong environmental incentive remains in place for purchasers of new cars to buy the clean option and for the motor trade to place the cleanest options on the market.<\/p> <p>The restructuring also responds to the challenge of maintaining the motor tax base because, while the move to lower emission cars is welcome from an environmental perspective, it has represented an increasing loss of income to the Local Government Fund for the funding of local services.  Since the introduction of the CO2-based system in 2008, the number of vehicles taxed on the basis of CO2 has increased by about 5% year-on-year.  The CO2 fleet is now just one quarter of all cars on the road, and 90% of these are taxed at the three lowest bands.  In 2012, for the first time, over half of all new car purchases were at the lowest rate of tax.  As the number of vehicles based on CO2 has increased, with their attendant low rates of tax for the most energy efficient bands, receipts from motor tax have shown a parallel decline, from \u20ac1.06 billion in 2008 to about \u20ac950 million in 2012, if no increases in rates had taken place in the budget.<\/p><p>Once the older cars are all replaced by cars taxed on CO2 over the next 15 years or so, it is estimated that total motor tax from cars would fall by more than 40%, if the taxation structures remain unchanged.  In the current economic circumstances, and given the need to maintain a diversified and stable taxation system, this loss of income must be addressed with a gradual rebalancing of the rates paid on the old engine capacity system and those paid on the CO2 based system.<\/p><p>In 2012, \u20ac46.5 million of motor tax income was transferred from the Local Government Fund to the Exchequer.  This year, an amount of up to \u20ac150 million will be similarly transferred.  This is more than the increase expected from the tax changes, but is a necessary measure towards the reduction of the national debt.  The payment, which will not be made until late 2013, will have regard to the balance in the fund when all commitments to local authorities have been met.  The projected income from motor tax in 2013 is in excess of \u20ac1.1 billion, and accordingly the balance of funding available to local authorities will be some \u20ac960 million, even if the full amount were to be transferred.<\/p><p>I confirm the Government remains committed to supporting the Local Government Fund which will retain the bulk of the income from motor tax to be used to fund local services.<\/p><p>The Bill contains six sections and a Schedule.  Sections 1 and 8 are procedural.  Section 2 sets out the rates that will apply to licences taken out for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.  Section 3 is a technical amendment to raise the annual tax threshold above which owners of certain categories of vehicles can obtain a half-year or quarterly disc.  Section 4 sets out the new motor tax rates for most vehicles.  Section 5 provides for the increase to apply to vintage or veteran vehicles.  Section 6 provides for the increases that apply to trade plates and replacement trade plates.  Section 7 provides for the transfer from the Local Government Fund to the Exchequer.  The amendment limits the transfer to a maximum of \u20ac150 million and is confined to 2013 only.<\/p><p>This is a short Bill with the purpose of giving permanent legal standing to the increases in motor tax introduced by the financial resolution passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 5 December 2012.<\/p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800008#G02800","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364470200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>We will now proceed with the debate.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.<\/p><p>The Fianna F\u00e1il Party is opposed to the Bill on the basis that in our view it is a continued Government attack on motorists struggling to make ends meet.  Financial incentives were put in place in 2008 and this encouraged drivers to switch to fuel efficient cars with low CO2 emissions.  It was a core feature of efforts to tackle climate change.  We suggest this Bill exacerbates last year's increases and further erodes the progress made in placing environmental concerns at the heart of public policy.  It penalises those motorists who took the decision to use environmentally-friendly cars by shifting the goalposts in the middle of the game.  It is interesting that in defence of this proposal, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, points out that the amount of tax that has been generated since 2008 has reduced and the number of vehicle taxed on the basis of CO2 has increased by about 5% year-on-year and that a quarter of all cars on the roads are CO2 cars of which 90% of these are taxed at the three lowest bands.  This is the reason receipts from motor tax has shown a decline from \u20ac1.06 billion in 2008 to \u20ac950 million in 2012.<\/p><p>I suggest it has more to do with the downturn in the economy rather than anything else.  The Society of the Irish Motor Industry has said that new car sales are down 10,000 on last year and it has always said that more tax will be generated from increasing the sale of cars rather than increasing taxation.  I am sure the Minister will see some merit in that argument because when the scrappage scheme was introduced and then extended there was no question that not only did it maintain jobs in the motor industry but there was an increase of employment in the motor industry because there was a subsequent increase in car registrations.  I know that every Government sees the motor industry as offering an opportunity to generate income from the low hanging fruit.  The proposals contained in the Bill mean that not all the money will be ringfenced but that some of the money raised from the increase in taxation will transfer to the central Exchequer.  We, on this side of the House, have always said we support any measures that will try to stimulate and improve the economy and we support any measures that will try to get us back to eliminate our budget deficit and get us back on an even keel.  However, some elements of the fiscal policy and taxation that the Government pursues are open to question, in particular taxation in the motor industry.<\/p><p>The motor industry is very sensitive and is critical to the economy.  I know there is an argument that Government should not necessarily support the increased sale of cars as we no longer manufacture cars.  We must import all of the cars sold here and we should not necessarily be stimulating car sales.  However, car sales provide valuable employment not only in the area of direct sales but also trickling down into the care and maintenance of cars.  I am not going into all the detail of this short Bill, but we believe that the continuing targeting of environmental-friendly cars on top of last year's changes is a regressive move.  In our pre-budget submission, we earmarked an overhaul of the motor taxation system that would yield the \u20ac100 million increase the Government is seeking in this legislation but would not rescind the environmental platform that Fianna F\u00e1il built up while in government.<\/p><p>Our vision for the motor taxation regime is one that recognises the fact that motorists contribute approximately \u20ac4 billion to the Exchequer through taxation, VAT and excise duty.  They need a fair transparent system that allows them to make long-term decisions on car purchases without the fear the Government will hike up their taxes in the near future.  It is very sad that the people who are being attacked now are those who purchased cars from 2008 onwards.  From a cursory look at the cars in the carpark in Leinster House, one will note that the vast majority of cars were registered in 2007 to 2012.  We suggest the decision to incentivise low CO2 emission vehicles is having a real impact on Ireland's efforts to contribute to tackling climate change.  Some 88% of new vehicles since 2008 have been purchased in the A to C bands.  The switch was taken on the basis of the financial incentives provided.  The Government is now jeopardising that progress.  The connection between the rate of tax and the CO2 emissions was at the heart of the introduction of CO2 based bands in 2008.  It ensured a link existed in the motorist's mind and more importantly in his or her wallet between driving an environmentally-friendly car and paying a low motor tax rate.  The Bill further erodes that connection.  It downgrades the importance of environmentally sound practices at the heart of broader public policy.  The Government Members will agree there is a need to continue to tackle climate change.  I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's response in this area, considering that we think this will increase environmental damage.<\/p> <p> One of the groups lobbying against this measure has suggested that, on the basis that people had bought in good faith, the tax could be applied to new cars rather than current ones.  AA Ireland claims that there is no way to dress up the situation and that the increased tax will push up the cost of living for car owners, affecting almost every household in the country.  There would be some justification for an increase from next year onwards.  Mr. Conor Faughnan went on to assert that drivers of older vehicles would feel harshly treated, as pre-2008 cars are already highly taxed and are not luxuries.  In many cases, ordinary motorists can barely afford to keep them on the road.<\/p><p>This is a disappointing development.  The Government has not managed to justify the increases as a means of advancing environmental friendliness.  It is a smash and grab, another opportunity to raise some money.  I appreciate that the Government needs every penny it can get, but it could have looked for it from someone other than motorists.  Fianna F\u00e1il tabled alternative proposals in its pre-budget submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800009#H00300","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364470800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

In pure monetary terms, cars with greater emissions will continue to be more highly taxed.  Eco-friendly cars saw an unwelcome tax increase of \u20ac92, but the owners of cars with lower or no emissions will see their tax bills decrease again.  The emission-free cars bought since 2008 or the electric cars bought prior to that will see their tax bills decrease by almost one quarter to a flat rate of \u20ac120 per year.  We must encourage the use of electric cars.  I have raised this matter with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We must engage with it further.<\/p><p>As less tax will need to be paid on environmentally friendly cars, people will be encouraged to buy cars with smaller engines that produce less carbon.  We have done what was necessary.  Many countries that have rolled out the new electric car technology have introduced incentives.  We use some, but not all, of those.  A greater uptake of charging points around the country is required.  We could also offer free parking for electric cars.  They are not ideal for all long journeys, but we should encourage them for city commuting, where most CO2 is produced from transport.  Also possible are financial incentives at the point of sale and education campaigns so that people can understand the benefits of owning electric cars.<\/p><p>The Government has made available alternatives to travelling to work by car.  For example, people can avail of rail or bus taxsaver commuter tickets, which were established as an incentive to use public transport.  I will not go into the details, but it makes savings for people who use Luas, DART, Dublin Bus and Bus \u00c9ireann services.  It incentivises people to switch to public transport and reduce traffic congestion.  Car pooling is another measure.  It should be extended throughout the public service, including Leinster House.  Savings arise because tickets are not subject to tax or PRSI, in that employees are only required to pay tax or PRSI on the money portion of their salaries.  The Leap card introduced by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is another incentive.<\/p><p>One must consider the balance when introducing an incentive and whether CO2 can be reduced using other methods.  Any increase in taxation is unwelcome.  The last CO2-based system was introduced in 2008 and has led to a major decline in motor tax receipts.  Although the previous Government's stated intention was to ensure that the switch would be revenue neutral, we found out that it actually incurred a significant cost.  The tax base shrank by nearly 50%.  From where will we get this money?<\/p><p>Technology is improving.  As mandated by the EU, a greater proportion of cars are more efficient.  This is welcome.  A mechanism to drive further environmental improvements through taxation will not always be available, as the scope for results has tightened.  However, European legislation constantly raises the bar in respect of CO2 emissions.  This is only right.  The engines currently being used by the motor industry across Europe are what are called Euro 5 engines.  Vehicles in this category meet all CO2 limits set down by the EU, but most manufacturers have engines that comply with Euro 7 standards, which are Ireland's standards.  They have lower emissions and more fuel efficient vehicles are surpassing the current levels required by the EU.  Our cars are becoming more environmentally friendly.<\/p><p>Changes have been made and the A1 band has an 80g\/km ceiling, but the Minister of State has addressed this point and I will say no more.  We are refreshing the signal to the market that maximum ambition in reduction in emissions continues to be the aim.  Despite the negative impact on the public finances, other methods of raising funds are available, for example, different forms of taxation.  If a judgment was based on a vehicle's open market selling price, OMSP, the revenue would increase by \u20ac12 million in one year.  However, this avenue has not been chosen.  If every vehicle in the country made zero emissions, we could consider basing our tax rate on the OMSP.  There is a great deal to be said for this approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800010#J00400","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1364470800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  According to the briefing document, the increases in the CO2 bands A and B are 53.8% and 44.2%, respectively.  The average change is approximately 7.5%.  We established the system to try to reduce emissions, but it would also reduce revenue by 40%.  It has become an unfortunate feature of our circumstances that, in the taxpayer's dealings with the Exchequer, it is a case of heads the Exchequer wins, tails the taxpayer loses.  Similarly, development levies and stamp duties were ignored in respect of the household charge.  We try to be environmentally sensitive.  When that works, we increase charges.  Broadly, I accept what the Government is trying to do in terms of cars.  The situation poses the Exchequer's revenues a considerable difficulty.<\/p><p>On Committee Stage, I will discuss how, according to page 6 of the briefing document, the assessment of motor tax on commercial goods vehicles is governed by the unladen weight.  I will ask the Minister of State to examine this proposal.  The key element is not unladen weight, but laden weight per axle.  Vehicles of the same unladen weight can do substantially different damage to infrastructure.  Some cause potholes and some do not.<\/p> <p>The &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle rewards people who reduce emissions and in the same way we could have a &quot;potholer pays&quot; principle if we changed the way in which we tax heavy goods vehicles.  That is the reason I tabled the amendment.<\/p><p> There is the issue of using tax as payment for roads.  We ignored cost-benefit analysis from the Economic and Social Research Institute in building motorways with a capacity of 55,000 vehicles per day on routes that in some cases had less than 10% of those vehicles on them.  It was massive over-investment for which the motorist and road user is being asked to pay.  Mr. Peter O'Keeffe at An Foras Forbartha Teoranta was doing cost-benefit analyses of roads in the late 1960s and the late Mr. Garret FitzGerald recommended the reading of an article by Mr. O'Keeffe in <i>Administration<\/i>in 1964.  I did some work with Mr. John McCarrick, the Kildare county engineer, on the evaluation of the Naas bypass.  We had the analysis to know when road investment is worthwhile and when it has the level of traffic to justify investment, but in the era of easy money from Brussels, we ignored that analysis, which left debt liabilities but not enough activity to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio.  In future, any construction of motorways should be accompanied by tolls and studies to prove the roads are worthwhile.  Nevertheless, everyone would like if a motorway could be financed from a common pool and there were no charges.<\/p><p> There is a need for a greater link between the kind of economics Mr. O'Keeffe and Mr. McCarrick had combined with engineering to ensure we put the money into good and worthwhile projects rather than precipitating the difficulties in the national finances.  We could reduce substantially the number of potholes caused by wrongly configured heavy goods vehicles in the country if we moved to a taxation system based on the axle load of a laden vehicle rather than the unladen weight of a vehicle. The current system was inherited from history but why would potholing ever cease if we did not design a tax system rewarding vehicles that do not cause potholes while penalising the vehicles that do?  The Minister has the ability, in the schedule of taxation to tackle the problem and I hope that will be done in the next year.  Much of the research that would assist in moving to a more environmentally and economically sensible way of configuring our road freight fleet has already been done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800010#J00500","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364471400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I generally speak after Senator Barrett in debates like this and I always tend to start by picking up on something he mentions.  The weather, more than vehicles, is responsible for causing potholes in my area.  We are now in the last week of March and every day this week we have looked out at snow falling, which is unprecedented for this time of year in this country.<\/p><p>This Bill is a piece of housekeeping that must be done following the budget, and we must implement the legislation today.  I am a little amused by the pot of gold that Fianna F\u00e1il continually identifies rather than dealing with the legislation before the House.  To the best of my knowledge, nobody has ever found a pot of gold in this country, although we have had many fairies.  If it exists, the Opposition Senators might tell us where it is because I would love to be able to find money today so as not to have to implement legislation like that before us today.  I would like to be able to solve the problems generated by the party to which I have referred.<\/p><p>I would like to start on a positive note by welcoming the idea of motor vehicles being registered on a biannual basis.  The motor industry has sought such an initiative for many years as everyone tries to get a car as early as possible in January in order to get the best value from it.  It is a bit like planning an under-age hurling team in that if all the players could be born on the first day of the new year, it would make a big difference to when they can play.  This will help the industry in many ways and I welcome the Bill's publication.  Currently, 80% of new car sales take place in the first quarter so we will see a massive difference because of this Bill, which will even out the motor industry's sales.<\/p><p>The rise in vehicle registration tax, VRT, will increase the price of new cars and used cars as a result.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?  I welcome the changes in bands but for some reason, band G was not touched at all this year.  The system is based on emissions but as I understand it, the band would mainly contain bigger cars.  People have referred to the number of bigger cars in the lot outside Leinster House and, generally speaking, people with bigger cars have more money.  One would imagine we could take a little more from them rather than what is being done in the legislation.<\/p><p>Another issue has been brought to my attention by a number of people this week and I have been concerned about it for many years.  People are cash-strapped and in many cases are only able to tax a car on a quarterly basis.  The difference between taxing a car on a quarterly as opposed to an annual basis is 12.5% on a small car such as a Daewoo Matiz.  Senator Barrett, as a statistician, may be interested in that, as it is a substantial amount for anybody who cannot afford to go beyond the three month tax period.  The tax is \u20ac199 for the year but it works out at \u20ac224 if it is done on a quarterly basis.  Can we do something to make that fairer either in this legislation or further down the road?<\/p><p>There is also the matter of the local government fund, which will be affected by this Bill.  As the Minister of State indicated, it will decrease from \u20ac1.1 billion to \u20ac960 million.  There is a critical point below which the local government fund cannot go.  Senators Keane and Harte and I are very much aware that at this stage, everything that can be adjusted downwards has been hit, so I ask the Minister of State to take that into account.  In this week we saw three employees of Cork County Council suspended because they saw a big pothole when they were returning from work and like any good employee, they stopped to repair it.  A safety inspector was travelling behind them and as a result, the three gentlemen have been suspended.  I fully appreciate that there must be a health and safety regime, which should be paramount, as there have been deaths of employees in local authorities on the roads.  Nevertheless, I have learned that safety auditing on any individual piece of road work can run to 8% of the cost of the work, which is a substantial amount of money.<\/p><p>I made some checks with our own engineers this week on what was required for one year of work in the area I served as a councillor.<\/p> <p>It required one qualified employee to spend one week surveying sites and conducting the audit on the work.  There is a significant amount of red tape involved in safety audits.  One cannot do anything now without 8% or more of the money coming out of the audit.  Surely savings can be made on this and we need to review the legislation that has brought us to the point where a pothole cannot be filled without conducting a safety audit.  This is what resulted this week.  I would like the Minister to review this, although it is not directly related to this legislation.  The Local Government Fund is being trimmed to the last and we must examine where the money is being spent.  Are we over legislated in this area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800011#K00200","speaker":"1162","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364472000,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House with which he is familiar and to which he is a frequent visitor.

However, I would like to raise a few issues.<\/p><p>I refer to the fact that a substantial amount of this money will transfer to local authorities.  It may well be that they need it but why we are paying a property tax?  How many times will we be taxed in the same way for the same purpose?  We are supposed to be given delivery of services and that is alleged to be the reason for the property tax, apart from the fact that we had our arm screwed out of its socket by the ECB, IMF and all the other gangsters.  Bin collections have been privatised and something peculiar will be done with water services.  What services are we getting, given we are paying for them through road tax, as I said during the discussion on the property tax?  How many times can we be bled for the same purpose?  There is an element of chicanery in this that I do not like.<\/p><p>There is then the question of the polluter pays principle.  That is implemented to a certain extent in the carbon emissions elements of legislation but not through the tax code.  When Mr. Gormley was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, he agreed with me when I made the point clearly to him that the appropriate thing to do if one is serious about pollution is to put the tax on petrol because then users pay directly proportionate to the amount of pollution they emit.<\/p><p>Senator Landy mentioned the issue of big cars out in the car park and he said people who had big cars could afford them.  There may be an element of truth in that but I would put that in the context of the Minister's statement about all older cars being replaced by cars taxed on carbon emissions.  Why should it be an ambition to remove older cars?  That sounds like a version of Government supported planned obsolescence.  I say this with particular feeling because one of the largest cars in the car park is mine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800012#L00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1364472000,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I did not know that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800012#L00300","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1364472000,"counter":142,"content":"<p>The tax on vintage cars was the only one that was not increased.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800012#L00400","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1364472000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>It is beautiful Jaguar XJ6 3.1 litre for which I paid \u20ac5,000.

The Bill provides for increases in duties and motor taxation.  We again are listening to populist politics from the Opposition.  They would not introduce a motor or property tax but if that were so, they would have to increase income tax.  This would mean we would have to take the money out of people's income tax and every service would be free.  Almost 90% of the Local Government Fund is generated from motor tax and it is equalised when distributed to the various local authorities.  For example, the local authorities in Dublin and Cork have a large rates base and a significant proportion of the motor tax they collect is allocated to smaller local authorities to make sure they have the funding to deliver the services they have to deliver such as water and waste services and maintenance of roads and parks.  That is what the Local Government Fund and motor tax are about.  In other words, we do not want to go back to 1977 when a Government entered office and abolished motor tax and rates.  Now we have had to reintroduce property tax and increase motor tax rates to fund the country because it was bankrupted five years ago due to a lack of efficiency in spending.<\/p><p>The legislation will deliver more money for local authorities because they will have access to a wider tax base through property tax, water charges and increased motor taxation.  Local moneys will stay in local areas to fund local services.

If that system remained in place, there would have been a 40% reduction in receipts in 15 years.  That would not be sustainable because we would be unable to fund our local services.  Car emissions are lowering with the advent of new technologies and continuing research in the motor industry.  It was ludicrous to encourage people to change to a lower emissions car which attracted a lower motor tax rate, although this was during the Celtic tiger era when money as plentiful.  However, many younger people now own second hands car which were made prior to 2008 and they cannot afford to change.  As a result, they are paying high rates of motor tax to drive a 1 litre or 1.4 litre car to subsidise those driving cars much larger 2 litre or 2.5 litre cars that were bought post-2008.  They pay half the tax young people pay for driving older cars.<\/p><p>I support the Bill.  I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Senator Barrett.  As he said, cost-benefit analyses should have been done because some motorways should not have been built as they were not cost efficient.  However, motorways were one of the positives from the Celtic tiger era.  Road fatalities have reduced as a result of the motorways and improvements in our road network generally.  It is important that local government continues to be funded.  Almost \u20ac1 billion of the yield from motor tax goes back to local government, with 30% for local roads, 60% for general purpose while the remaining 10% goes to the Exchequer.  Unfortunately, \u20ac46.5 million was taken by the Exchequer last year while, this year, \u20ac150 million will be taken to balance the books to get the country back up and running again.  Tonight will be historic, as the bank guarantee ends at midnight.  That is another step on the way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800012#L01200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1364472000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  When the Bill was taken in the Lower House, my party colleague, Deputy Dessie Ellis, acknowledged the need to review the system of motor taxation.  He outlined a number of alternatives to what is proposed in the Bill.  He highlighted that there was a need to review the system and to future proof it by redesigning the motor tax bands to reflect carbon emissions, engine capacity and vehicle value.  That, in turn, would make the system more progressive and would place a lesser burden on people because motor tax could be raised in a fairer and more environmentally sustainable way, which the Bill does not provide for, and that is the reason we oppose it.<\/p> <p>The Minister is aware that Irish society is heavily dependent on the use of cars, probably more so than our European Union neighbours.  That is due, in part, to the failure to invest in a meaningful way in public transport provision which has led to us being reliant on a car to get to the shops, the post office, the Garda Station and to take children to school if one lives outside the catchment area.  The failure to properly integrate the existing public transport provision has meant that in those places where the need for public transport is greater, such as Dublin, many people simply do not have the choice of travelling every day journeys by a means other than a car.  This issue is particularly acute in some rural areas, especially in my county where regular public transport is not an option for many people and they have to rely on a car.  As a result, the increased taxes on a private car will have a disproportionate impact on people and will have a massive impact on hundreds of thousands of struggling families who depend on the car to get to and from work, to take their children to school and go about their daily business.  Increases in excise duty mean that people are already paying up to \u20ac400 more per year on fuel than three years ago.  Motorists pay 23% VAT on petrol and diesel, in addition to other taxes and duties.  The increase in motor tax for ordinary motorists will make life much harder for people.  There is too much of a burden on motorists without targeting fuel inefficiency when we should be moving towards that.  Perhaps the Minister will respond to my comments in terms of reviewing and future proofing the motor taxation system and the system he envisages for the future.  <\/p><p>The Bill will impact negatively on struggling families and struggling business especially the providers of small goods and services, thus affecting trade and jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800012#L01300","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364472600,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  There are a couple of very important points to be made in the debate.  I have been in the insurance industry for many years.  There is a social aspect to motor taxation as there is a social aspect to tax on alcohol as both are products that can cause death and suffering.  We have to be cognisant of that fact.  In Donegal there are a couple of lobby groups and politicians who, one week, call for the abolition of vehicle registration tax, saying it is illegal, and the next week the county councillors say young people need to be educated in motor vehicle safety.  Those recommending the abolition of motor taxation or vehicle registration tax are basically saying that young people can get a bigger car cheaper and they expect them to be responsible.  As an insurance broker I would have had a father or mother come to my office asking to have little Johnny put on their insurance, saying he was very careful and would only go out in the evening with his father to drive.  I knew little Johnny was going around the street with the dust rising behind the car.  We have a responsibility to families.  There is a social tax aspect that has to be added to motor taxation as well as a revenue generation aspect.  If there was no motor taxation and no vehicle registration tax, while others call for cheaper insurance for young people, the scenario would be that every young person would have a car, the result of which would be more devastation on the roads.<\/p><p>As in the case of alcohol we have to put in place a certain social tax aspect for revenue generation that will discourage young people who do not need a car to be on the road.  We must balance that with putting people off the road because motor taxation is too expensive, especially in country areas where there is no public transport worth talking about.  It may be a debate for another day as to how to tax motor vehicles in such a way as to discourage young people from using them, while at the same time there is a need for revenue for the repair of potholes in areas such as Donegal and the road cleaning services.  The debate on emissions is important and we cannot get away from it and, therefore, we have to balance it correctly.  We do not have a choice.  There are groups, especially in Donegal, who have called for cheaper vehicles for young people to get on the road but that is not helpful.  A motor vehicle is a dangerous weapon as it can and does cause damage.  <\/p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800013#M00200","speaker":"1144"},{"type":"speech","time":1364472600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  I compliment the Minister on his work and recognise that this is a procedural Bill.  Quite simply, we need the revenue.  There has been a fair attempt, in difficult circumstances, to distribute the liability evenly.  Safety and other elements were raised by the previous speaker.  I would like to see us take a more innovative approach as I do not see any difficulty with young people being on the roads <i>per se<\/i>.  To increase motor taxation to such an extent as to disincentive driving would be a negative approach while at the same time I see where the Senator is coming from.  I am driving since I was 17 years of age and it has enhanced my life.  That I have driven for so long and in safety is positive.  I would like to think the Government could bring forward a strategy for younger drivers who are in that zone where they could be more of a danger on the road without it being financially punitive but perhaps that is the only way.  It is a discussion we could usefully have in the House on another day.<\/p><p>  I commend the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800013#M00300","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1364472600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I thank all the Senators for their contributions.  As we are taking Committee and Remaining Stages today, I will not delay the House.  Many of the points made make sense in their own right.  When we examine what we have to do as a country and how we have to fund the road network and local government we have no choice but to do what we did in the budget.  The key point is the relationship between car emissions and the tax to be paid.  The lower the motor vehicle emissions, the less motor tax one pays.  Notwithstanding that, motor taxation has increased for everybody.  At the heart of what we are doing is ensuring the environmental benefit will continue.  The reason for the increase is that more people are driving more environmentally friendly cars and the tax base was going down.  If that was to continue for the next 15 years, we would lose at least \u20ac0.5 billion and there would be no sustainability in terms of road repairs and safety issues.<\/p><p>The last point made was in regard safety for young people.  While it is a fact that young people suffer greatly as a result of the accidents in which they have been involved, I agree with Senator Noone that we have to deal with the safety issue.  The Department  and the Oireachtas work with the Road Safety Authority to ensure roads are safer and that young people, in particular, are educated and understand what happens as a result of irresponsible driving.  The number of roads deaths has decreased significantly in recent years.  During the period when I was the Opposition spokesman on transport, I recall Noel Dempsey, former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, saying that the Road Safety Authority message works.<\/p> <p>The agency is brilliant at getting its message across and has total credibility.  May it go from strength to strength in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney raised the issue of climate change.  The heads of a climate action and low carbon development Bill were published in February 2013 for consideration by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  As part of the response to meeting our climate change obligations, the NESC secretariat was asked to look at the longer-term agenda and to focus on developing a basis for a socioeconomic vision to underpin an effective national transition to a low carbon future by 2050.  The final report of the secretariat was released on 26 February for consideration by the joint committee.  The committee is dealing with that report and is the main forum within the Oireachtas for dealing with climate change issues.<\/p><p>The question was asked as to why the motor tax increases for CO2 emissions vehicles are higher.  While the level of increases for the lower CO2 bands in the last two budgets have been higher in percentage terms than for the rest of the fleet, they must be viewed against a structure that left the bottom rates very low.  Even after the two budgetary increases, the average payment for owners of vehicles taxed on the basis of their CO2 emissions is \u20ac315 per annum which is significantly lower than the average of \u20ac511 for owners of pre-2008 cars.  It must also be remembered that while the introduction of the CO2 bands was designed to encourage a switch to lower emission vehicles, the changes were also introduced on the second principle of revenue neutrality, which has not happened.  As I said earlier, there has been a significant loss of motor tax income in recent years, which is why we had to increase the tax rates.  Motor tax revenue receipts dropped from \u20ac1.6 billion in 2008 to \u20ac1.1 billion in 2011.  Had that trend continued, receipts this year would have been in the order of \u20ac954 million.  That level of income would make it impossible for us to provide what is needed.<\/p><p>Motor manufacturers are meeting the climate change challenge by developing cars with even lower emissions, and long may that continue.  Senator Landy asked about the increase in the G band, which went up from \u20ac2258 to \u20ac2350.  While this is the lowest increase in percentage terms, at 4.1%, it amounts to \u20ac92, which is the highest amount of money in any band.<\/p><p>Senator Norris has a most unusual car and I wish him well in it.  However, with a 3.1 litre engine, I suggest he may be driving a jet engine rather than a car.  I commend him on keeping it on the road.  The Senator, and others like him who can keep Jaguars firing on all cylinders, deserve a zero rate of motor tax.  The fact remains that we need the money.  Everyone knows that if we do not take in the requisite income, we cannot sustain our local government services.  One of the key policies underlining the changes being introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan is that local government councillors will be responsible for the management of the local budget.  The new property tax will also feed into local budgets and there will be an agenda, locally, to ensure greater efficiencies and reductions in costs.  I hope those changes will be very constructive.<\/p><p>Sinn F\u00e9in representatives raised the issue of a three-pronged approach to taxation.  We already tax on the basis of the emissions of vehicles but if we add size and value as parameters, that will not necessarily improve the environmental performance of the motor tax system.  We have moved away from the size of vehicle basis used prior to 2008 because it did not produce any environmental gain.  I do not know how price could be used as an environmental parameter.  The current system is simple, very clear and effective and is reducing emissions.  In that context, it is working.<\/p><p>I think I have addressed most of the points raised.  If Senators wish to raise further issues, we can deal with them on Committee Stage.  I know Senator Barrett is concerned about a specific issue, which we will deal with later.  I thank all of the Senators for their contributions and the thought-provoking issues they raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800013#M00400","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364473200,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2013: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1364473200,"counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800014#N00500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364473200,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 6, inclusive agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364473200,"counter":160,"content":"<p>SECTION 7<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364473200,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1364473200,"counter":162,"content":"<p>On the section, my understanding was, although I am open to correction, that an attempt was made some years ago to ring-fence the money derived from motor tax for the local government fund.

Will the Minister of State, in the context of what Senator Mooney has said, give the House some assurance that we are not going to see a continual extraction of funds from local government?  If that continues, local government will cease to function.  In dealing with this legislation today we are looking at taking some money out of the motor taxation fund.

When one talks about funding local government, the critical issue is the powers given to elected members of local government.  I spent 27 years in local government as an elected representative.<\/p> <p>Like the Senators I am well versed in the powers and efficiencies of local government.  An important plus in the property tax legislation is that locally elected councillors will be in a position to increase or decrease the budget by up to 15% from 2016 onwards.  The provision will be a big issue next year during the local elections and councillors will have to prove how well they will manage the accounts for councils.  The provision will give more powers, responsibility and authority to elected members.  It will not simply be a matter of asking the county manger to do this, that and the other.  He or she will inform a councillor that he or she has the power to grant approval.  The provision will grant more authority to local representatives and give an opportunity for more efficiency.  Local representatives will be in charge of what is happening.  I have no doubt the next local election will dwell on efficient, responsible and accountable local government.

On the one hand, the Minister of State said there is \u20ac960 million.  I ask him please to correct me if I am wrong about the following.  Legislation was introduced some years ago to ring-fence that amount of money which meant the Government could not touch it.  I am inclined to believe that happened.  Otherwise he would not be tabling a section to permit the transfer of funds from the local government fund.<\/p><p>Some weeks ago the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport announced that he would provide an allocation, somewhat small admittedly, towards the maintenance of local roads.  Earlier in the year I attended a committee meeting where the National Roads Authority stated its concern about a reduction in funding for ongoing road maintenance.  Earlier today the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, pointed out his distinguished record in local government but Senator Landy and I have also served in local government.  I would hate to see a repeat of the situation that developed in the 1980s during the last economic recession.  There was a severe reduction in funding for the roads network and it took almost 20 years of successive governments and successive Administrations to right that wrong.  There was no money in the kitty then and we are in the same situation now.<\/p><p>The Government must have a vision of the future and it simply cannot make a decision to cut funding just because we have no money.  All of the indications are that European Governments are moving away from austerity policies.  The Italian Government is worse off than we are, relatively speaking, but it is talking about using money to invest in state projects, to develop infrastructure and whatever.  I have seen the damage done by a severe reduction in funding for local authorities and that is why I have a severe difficulty with the same being done now.  The Government needs money from wherever it can get it but it is a pity to seek assistance from local authorities again.  On the other hand, the Minister of State spoke in glowing terms, and rightly so, that local government will be more efficient, have more powers and whatever after the next local election.  Those powers will be of no help if local authorities have no money or their funding is reduced.<\/p><p>The Minister of State made the point that local authorities will be empowered but let me give an example of a contradiction.  The local improvement schemes were vital, especially in rural Ireland.  Some months ago it was announced that the scheme would be re-introduced, which was welcomed by all sides.  It transpired, however, that local authorities could only introduce the scheme if they shifted money from another heading.  There was no increase in funding.<\/p><p>Local government funding is vital for the fabric of society and I mean in that in the physical sense.  As the money will be used primarily on the road network, can the Minister of State assure the House that the Government will not take its eyes off the ball despite all the fiscal pressures?  I want him to give an assurance that the Government will find the money and resources elsewhere.  Otherwise, the next generation for the next decade will face the same problem of having to take remedial action to repair the roads at perhaps double the cost, as happened in the mid to late 1990s and well into the 2000s.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800015#O00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364473800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364473800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>SECTION 8<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1364473800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<ul><br \/>In page 13, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:<ul>&#8220;8. The Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government shall within six months publish an evaluation of the taxation of goods vehicles in paragraph 5 of the Schedule to the Act of 1952, as inserted by <i>section 4<\/i>, based on laden weight per axle to yield the equivalent revenues of taxation based on unladen weight per vehicle.&#8221;.<\/ul><\/ul>I welcome the Minister of State.  My amendment seeks him to evaluate the matter.  An evaluation is a very good idea and would do the country a lot of good and help the roads budget.<\/p><p>  With regard to the six months stipulation, a lot of the research has been done so it would not be onerous.  I would not impose such a burden on the Minister if it were so.  An Foras Forbatha, an organisation well known to the Minister of State's officials, researched the matter a long while ago.  An Foras Forbartha based its research on that done by the American Association of State Highway Officials, AASHO, in the United States and the road track costs studies in the United Kingdom.  The research found that heavy goods vehicles account for about 15% of the capital cost of a road.  One would not need as much sub-structure and one could have steeper hills and hollows if trucks did not use a road.  The AASHO's study was based on old airport runways that were used for the mass transit of all sorts of vehicles.  The findings proved that the surface would hardly ever wear out if a road was built properly and one just had cars on the road, which addresses the point made by Senator Landy.<\/p><p>  The unladen weight system for heavy goods vehicles is out of date.  Obviously the weight of a load has some impact.  The number of axles is important because the weight compresses downwards.  A small number of axles on a small piece of road will cause the potholes to which Senator Landy referred.  Many axles will spread the weight over a wider area and will not cause potholes.  The research showed that the problem is not juggernauts but the number of axles under a juggernaut.  One of the UK studies showed that a 32 tonne vehicle with four axles only met 82% of its road user cost.  If one adds a fifth axle with the same weight then it would not only meet its road allocated cost but also be 31% above it.  Therefore, the savings are substantial.<\/p><p>  My colleagues in the school of engineering also sent me some examples.  They estimated that the permanent wear damage factor is reduced by 21% when one moves from five axles to six axles, there is 15% more carrying capacity and the road damage per tonne is reduced by 36%.  I can also quote a Norwegian study and I shall supply all of the research to the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>I understand that vehicles with more axles do not cause potholes and the engineers tell me that tandem axles are even better.  We could reward those who have vehicles that do not cause potholes and should consider changing the system to achieve a revenue neutral outcome.  I accept the wish of the Minister of State that any change should be revenue neutral, as this did not happen on a previous occasion.<\/p><p>We do not have a truck manufacturing business, however we could transmit a signal to importers to import a different kind of heavy goods vehicle that will not do so much damage to our roads.  We could apply the principle that those who cause potholes pay for them, as an adjunct to the polluter pays principle.<\/p><p>In this amendment I ask the Minister to look at this and incorporate it in the system.  As I said earlier the research is available and it is a task for the engineers in the Department to compile it and discussing it with the engineers I mentioned.  It is not designed to reduce revenue, but it might reduce expenditure and get us better value from our roads budget.<\/p><p>The research is robust and has been around for a while.  We might ask the Irish Academy of Engineering to examine it but I genuinely put forward this suggestion on the basis that it makes sense.  It should assist the Minister in managing his budget and this would help us at a difficult time in the public finances.

It is generally accepted that unladen weight is not a satisfactory basis for motor tax and that it is out of line with the basis of taxation of commercial vehicles in other countries, which is generally based on gross design vehicle weight.  There is no correlation between gross design vehicle weight and unladen weight.  Care must be taken to ensure that if charges are applied in the future to the current fleet, motor tax rates are set in such a way that they do not lead to large increases for some owners and large reductions for others.  Initial analysis undertaken last year by the Department on a sample of the commercial fleet would suggest there are large variations both up and down between unladen and gross weight design.  This seems to be a particular issue for those vehicles in the 10,000 kg to 14,000 kg unladen weight categories.  If the basis of taxation were to be changed, it would apply equally to all commercial vehicles, not just those over a certain weight.  There has already been some consideration of the matter and once the Non-Use of Motor Vehicle Bill 2013, which is a priority for the Department, has been enacted, it is intended to review the basis of taxation for commercial vehicles.<\/p><p>The timescale for such review is subject to the resources of and competing demands on the Department and accordingly I cannot give an absolutely specific timescale for completion.  We can certainly look at the correlation between gross design vehicle weight, which is readily available from the manufacturer's certificate of conformity, and the laden weight per axle as the Senator is suggesting.  There are legal limits on axle weight and enforcement structures in place to ensure compliance.  The road network is built to modern standards in full knowledge of the standards applicable.  This helps to ensure that structural damage to the road network is prevented and ameliorated as much as possible.  The tax rate applicable to the larger HGVs is already quite high, almost \u20ac5,200 per annum for over 20 tonnes.  The industry has concerns about its competitiveness and this would obviously have to be understood.<\/p><p>I do not know if my reply has been helpful to Senator Barrett.  The points he has made will be examined but we cannot commit to a timescale or what the outcome will be.  We cannot accept the amendment as such.  Within these parallel lines, we will do all the work that needs to be done to analyse the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800016#P00300","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1364474400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I do not think it will take too long as much of the research has been done and the Department may be unduly pessimistic.  I was glad to hear the Minister of State agree in principle with my suggestion.  Do we progress by continuing with the existing system, which is unsuitable but people bought into the concept of the unladen weight?  When the Minister decides, and I think he probably has in principle, to communicate to the road haulage system that we are moving from the current system, which we are all agreed is an unwise system, that would be a signal to them and they could be heading down this road in advance of the Minister's decision.  We would prefer if they bought vehicles with a larger number of axles, because vehicles with a smaller number of axles are damaging the road network unnecessarily compared to vehicles with a larger number of axles.  Would one call that a declaration of intent to move to the system, which the Minister of State described in his very eloquent reply?  I think this is worth doing and probably has been worth doing for a number of decades, based on the research which he says was outdated and other countries have made the move.<\/p><p>I will not press the amendment because of the Minister of State's response, but the momentum that is indicated in his reply must be maintained.  It is just worth doing it.  The industry should know the Minister of State's thoughts.  In fact his reply should be circulated to the industry.  The record will be there.  I think it is the wise way to go.  The industry will probably agree that it a wise way to go but they will have an incentive to purchase vehicles which do not have a damaging impact on the roads.<\/p> <p>Such vehicles are available and we do not have an industry which manufactures them to defend.  The impetus provided by the Minister of State in respect of that change is very welcome.  I hope it will be circulated to people.<\/p><p>As already stated, the Department is taking an overly pessimistic view in respect of how long it would take to carry out the research work involved.  Much of that work has already been done and is available, I presume, from the NRA, which absorbed part of An Foras Forbatha when it was disbanded.  As Senator Clune stated, there are many engineers who are aware of the work to which I refer, who see it as worthwhile and who would undoubtedly assist the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in making the kind of move he is contemplating.  I am of the opinion that he is actually doing something more than contemplating and that he intends to go in the direction to which I refer when the workload within his Department has been reduced.  I commend him on that.  Perhaps it might be the case that next year we will be considering moving towards a system for the taxation of heavy goods vehicles which the Minister of State described.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800016#P00400","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364475000,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I assure Senator Barrett that all of the issues he raised, and those which are regularly raised with the Department by the industry, are very much under discussion.

We believe that this is a regressive move and we are opposed to it.  We also believe that it is very short-sighted, because people will, having lost their medical card, now avoid accessing health care where they might once have been more willing to do so.  This will likely mean poorer health outcomes and require more hospital visits, inpatient care and residential-nursing-home care, which will lead to increased costs to the State in the long run.

It means that the net loss, if I can put it that way, to somebody who is affected by this legislation would be \u20ac144 a month or approximately \u20ac36 euro a week because the system will pay for their drugs above that limit.<\/p><p>I would appeal to colleagues to stick to what is in the Bill rather than trying to create fears where none exist.  Even though there may be a basis elsewhere for concern, there is no basis for concern on the part of Members in this House or others that persons will lose access to their GPs as a result of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800020#T01900","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364476200,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364476200,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Sections 4 to 6 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364476200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>SECTION 7<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1364476200,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<ul><br \/>In page 9, lines 47 and 48, to delete all words from and including &quot;Insofar&quot; in line 47 down to and including &quot;Executive,&quot; in line 48.<\/ul>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire St\u00e1it ar ais go dt\u00ed an Teach.  I propose in the amendment to delete, &quot;Insofar as it is considered practicable by the Health Service Executive,&quot;.<\/p><p>  It should be noted from this amendment that I am not seeking, in this subsection, the deletion of the following: &quot;a choice of medical practitioner shall be offered under the general practitioner medical and surgical service made available under this section.&quot;  This is a commitment that the House made, as the Minister acknowledged in debate yesterday, as a response to the IMF programme to open up the general medical service to new medical entrants.  Yesterday I put on the record some numbers of persons earning &#8364;700,000 plus.  We wanted to get new graduates, many of whom had to emigrate, to be allowed to practice as GPs.  That was earlier recommended by the Competition Authority.  It is the express wish of this House, in legislation, that such is what we wanted.<\/p><p>  There is an absolute requirement that the Minister allows new graduates to take up their places.  The Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012 opens up access to GMS contracts to all fully qualified and vocationally trained GPs, and there will be no limits on the number of contractors.  Section 2 of that Act provides that the Health Service Executive will be entitled to enter into a GMS contract with any suitably qualified and vocationally trained general practitioner and will not be limited to granting contracts in cases where a GMS contract holder has died, retired or resigned or where the contract has otherwise been terminated.  Section 5 of that Act, most importantly, provides that the HSE, when filling or creating a GP position, will not take account of the short-term or long-term economic viability of that or of other GP practices.<\/p> <p>Why has this provision been included?  These obligations are to be met in so far \"as it is considered practicable by the Health Service Executive\".  While I have much less experience of the House than the Minister of State, Ministers have not stated in my time in the House that the Revenue Commissioners will collect tax, the Garda Commissioner will investigate crime or the Minister for Education and Skills will provide primary school places in so far as it is considered practicable to do so.  The Health Service Executive was given obligations by the House as part of the agreement with the International Monetary Fund.  A service must be provided from the wide range of new graduates, rather than by those on salaries of \u20ac700,000 per annum.  I am not interested in whether the HSE considers this practicable or not as it has a duty that was imposed on it by Parliament.<\/p><p>We referred to legacy issues yesterday.  Senator Crown's Bill on smoking disappeared into the Department and has not been heard of since.  Similarly, his Bill on the practice of uninsured medicine has also disappeared.  The Department lost a case on health insurance in the Supreme Court by a unanimous decision of the court and lost a case on the same issue in the European Court of Justice.  I do not trust it when it states a choice of doctor will be available &quot;insofar as it is considered practicable&quot;.  This is the law and the Department must adhere to it.  The Department has a record of showing disregard for the wishes of Parliament.  This is a legacy issue rather than one that has arisen in the Minister of State's time in office.<\/p><p>I do not know the reason this provision has been included in the Bill as I have never seen another Minister invoke a similar provision.  We decided, and it is internationally agreed, that there will be a general practitioner service with a choice of doctor.  This is not at the discretion of the Health Service Executive or any official.  I am worried generally about the extent to which officials dictate to the Government.  Elected Members made a commitment in the House and it would not cost much to meet it, particularly when compared to the \u20ac700,000 or more we pay to certain general practitioners.  I do not know why this subsection is in the Bill. <\/p><p>I supported the Government's position on the new income arrangements.  Why should we seek to renege on a commitment by using the weasel words &quot;insofar as it is considered practicable&quot;?  The HSE does not have a great record.  Parliament should determine these matters and I hope the Minister of State will agree to remove the section.  This is an obligation incurred as part of an international agreement and attempts to change it in this section come from a Department that does not have the happiest of relationships with the House.  It is time the House asserted itself.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800020#T02300","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1364476800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  There is no intention to roll back or renege on the position as set out in the 2012 Act, nor will it be the effect of section 7(9).  I understand and accept the argument Senator Barrett made yesterday on the opening up of the system.  He made some compelling points with which I agree and which were properly dealt with through the legislation to which I referred.  There is no question of that Act being rolled back or in any sense reversed by anything in this Bill.<\/p><p>The Senator is concerned that the section may, even inadvertently, repeal or roll back the 2012 measures.  I understand his remarks to suggest that it is almost the intention to do so.  I assure him that this does not constitute a backsliding from the measures taken in 2012 to open up general medical service contracts to any fully qualified general practitioners.  The provisions of the Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012 are not affected by the subsection.  As I stated, the 2012 Act opened up access to GMS contracts to all fully-qualified and vocationally-trained general practitioners, subject to general suitability criteria.  No limits have been set on the number of GP contractors.<\/p><p>The Senator will be aware that previously there were three routes for entry into the GPS scheme.  These were: where a vacancy arose due to the retirement, resignation or death of an existing GMS doctor; where a new GMS panel was created in response to an identified need for an additional doctor in an area; or where a GMS doctor obtained approval from the Health Service Executive for the creation of an assistant with a view to partnership within his or her practice.  Previously the HSE was required, before filling a vacant GMS panel or creating a new panel, to take account of the potential viability of the panel and the viability of existing GP practices in the area in question.  Under the 2012 legislation, new GMS contract holders are free to establish their practice in the location of their choice.  There is a caveat that, once established, any GP contract holder who wishes to move location will only be able to do so with the prior approval of the HSE.  This provision is designed simply to ensure continuity of GP care for patients.  To date, 114 general practitioners have obtained a GMS contract under the Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012.  There are in the region of 2,400 GPs with GMS contracts in total. <\/p><p>I understand the Competition Authority has expressed the view that the new arrangements are having a very positive effect.  The authority is reported to have seen evidence of doctors advertising their services and prices, as well as greater moves in terms of innovation in pricing among GPs, which is also a positive change.  The new open contractual arrangements between general practitioners in the GMS scheme are not affected by section 7(9).  The subsection deals with the relationship between the patient and general practitioner.  The language ensures that as far as practicable the HSE will arrange the general practitioner service with the GP of choice by the individual.  However, we cannot guarantee that the individual will always get the GP of his or her choice.  This is the reason for the provision.  It could happen that the general practitioner of choice is unwilling to take on a new patient because he or she already has too many patients.  In general, GPs are not supposed to have more than 2,000 GMS patients.<\/p><p>I am concerned that the Senator's amendment would inadvertently engender an inflexibility and impracticality in the delivery of general practitioner services by the Health Service Executive and general practitioners.  It is for this reason alone that I do not propose to accept the amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800021#U00150","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1364476800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Is the amendment being pressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800021#U00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1364476800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I will seek, on Report Stage, to incorporate some measure to deal with the misgivings I have, which were echoed to some degree by the Minister of State.

To take the Minister of State's example where a doctor X has 2,000 patients, surely another doctor would be available in such circumstances.  The Minister of State referred to a choice and I am keen to preserve the principle of choice.  The list showing that some general practitioners earn \u20ac500,000 or \u20ac700,000 per annum from the GMS scheme also indicates that some of the doctors in question employ two or three doctors.  Why can these doctors not engage with patients in their own right?  I am worried the Department is using the phrase \"insofar as practicable\" as a means of reneging on a commitment because that is, unfortunately, a tradition in the Department.  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court referred to a Department which sought to usurp the function of the Oireachtas.  Choice is not expensive to provide in this case and it should be available.

We discussed legacy issues yesterday and people might be concerned but there is no question of disrespect being shown to the Houses of the Oireachtas here and that we are attempting through the use of phraseology such as &quot;insofar as it is considered practicable&quot; to give wriggle room to the HSE not to carry out its duties.

I recognise a lot has happened in the reorganisation of local government and with SUSI, which was previously done by local authorities, but this should be a goal for the Government in order that citizens would be able to declare their income in a single office rather than all offices, something that leads to the many complaints from Deputies and Senators on behalf of people who are going through a multiplicity of means tests.

For reasons I will indicate in a moment, I am not in a position to accept the amendment proposed but I very much acknowledge the context and argument proposed by him and supported by his colleagues.  The amendment is in the general spirit of section 8, which refers to data exchange.  These days people say data is king and very often that is the case.  If data is available it is sometimes only available in one spot and it needs to be seen by another section or Department.  What we provide for in section 8 is data exchange on a statutory basis, which is entirely in compliance with data protection principles and embeds the Data Protection Commissioner in the process by requiring the commissioner to approve any agreements for the sharing of data.  The basic principle of data exchange and sharing is established but the protections Senators want to see in terms of privacy and other protections that are in place because of the data protection legislation which dates back to 1988 are also satisfied.<\/p><p>The point about centralising the process is also well made by Senator Barrett and others, where, for example, different activities are going on in different places that there is a strong argument that they should go on in one place or at least to reduce the number of places a particular activity is conducted.  I am not an expert on the matter but, curiously, for all the work done by the Revenue Commissioners \u2013 as we know they will do more \u2013 I do not think it conducts means testing.  I have not had an opportunity to definitively establish the fact but it strikes me that they are not involved in means testing so this would be a new activity for them.  That is something to bear in mind when we examine the appropriate place for means testing to be centralised, were we to consider doing that.<\/p><p>From the point of view of the health Acts, the HSE is charged with legal responsibility to make decisions regarding the eligibility or otherwise of a person ordinarily resident in the State.  This legal obligation would remain on the HSE even if the amendment were to be accepted.  The HSE would still have to assess the eligibility under the health Acts.  The Revenue Commissioners are not equipped at present \u2013 I accept that people are talking about what might happen in the future \u2013 to carry out an assessment of medical cards and GP visit cards as well as other services provided by the HSE.<\/p><p>There has not been universal support for the centralising of applications for medical cards.  I consider it has been a great success.  Nothing is perfect but there has been considerable success in dealing with the backlog, not without objection and sometimes from our own colleagues on all sides.  People were worried about certain changes.  The centralising of the processing of all new medical card applications and renewals at the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, was done with effect from 1 July 2011.  Significant progress was made on the national project to provide enhanced service delivery to clients and providing a consistent and equitable national assessment process on which everyone can depend.<\/p><p>The HSE processes in the region of 750,000 applications each year.  It aims to have all medical card applications and renewals processed within 15 working days.  The latest information, as at 18 March, shows that more than 95% of applications are processed within the target time.  Different types of application are made.  There is the basic application for a medical card, a GP visit card and it is also required to process applications for discretionary cards which often require a significant medical input.  It is important to bear that in mind in the context of the assessment of eligibility.  That requires a clinical panel to be put in place.  One has recently been established for the processing of the discretionary applications.  The medical or clinical dimension is another issue one would have to consider in the context of giving the task to another agency at some point in the future.  There is also the emergency process provided by the HSE for a person who is terminally ill or in urgent need of medical attention who cannot afford to pay for it.  In such cases a card is provided within 24 hours.<\/p><p>The suggestion that we centralise means testing in a particular agency is not without complication.  I am not sure whether the Revenue is the place to do it.  I very much accept the spirit in which the proposal has been made.  Senator Barrett will be interested to hear about administrative costs and efficiency, as it is very much in line with the arguments he makes in debates, as highlighted by Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh.  The administration costs of the primary care reimbursement service is approximately 0.5% of the cost of the medical card scheme, which is pretty good.

It would be of benefit if we could free up resources for health by cutting the administrative burden, which is a lot more than in other areas.  The fastest growing category of staff for many years in the health service was the administrative layers, as the Minister of State is aware.  It does not make sense to perform the same functions in the areas of health, education through SUSI, social welfare and in the Revenue Commissioners.  I agree with other speakers that it is a good goal for us, and a whole-of-Government goal, as we face the significant problem of the duplication of tasks.

Once again, I thank the Minister of State for his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800023#W00500","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364478000,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364478000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Section 8 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364478600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the Title be the Title to the Bill&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364478600,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1364478600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the Bill be received for final consideration&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"vote","time":1364478600,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the Bill do now pass.\"<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 21; N\u00edl, 7.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators Terry Leyden and Marc MacSharry.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800024#X00100","aye":["1121","1150","1114","1165","1151","1166","1117","1172","1131","1135","1162","1132","1174","1134","1118","1153","1170","1129","1125","1163","1171"],"nay":["1157","1140","1149","1128","1136","1122","1154"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Bill 2013: Motion for Earlier Signature","time":1364478900,"counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800025#Y00050"},{"type":"speech","time":1364478900,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I move:<ul><br \/>That, pursuant to subsection 2\u00b0 of section 2 of Article 25 of the Constitution, Seanad \u00c9ireann concurs with the Government in a request to the President to sign the Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Bill 2013 on a date which is earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill shall have been presented to him.&quot;.<\/ul><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800025#Y00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"vote","time":1364478900,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 22; N\u00edl, 7.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators Marc MacSharry and Trevor \u00d3 Clochartaigh.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800025#Y00300","aye":["1121","1150","1114","1165","1151","1166","1117","1144","1172","1131","1135","1162","1132","1174","1134","1118","1153","1170","1129","1125","1163","1171"],"nay":["1157","1140","1149","1128","1136","1122","1154"]},{"type":"speech","time":1364479200,"counter":255,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800026#Z00100","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1364479200,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I propose that the House stands adjourned <i>sine die<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800026#Z00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1364479200,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I am glad to have the opportunity to raise the issue of the regulation of practitioners in the health and social care area, particularly counsellors and psychotherapists.  The Minister referred to this area when we discussed the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill in this House and in the other House.  A point raised was that there is concern that two areas in particular are not regulated.  For various reasons, be it financial, health or social pressures, more people are turning to these types of services.  Most of the services provided are of an excellent standard but there is a need to regulate them and to ensure that would-be users can be confident that they can access quality professional services and that they will not be treated by so-called cowboys, particularly if they are in a vulnerable state.<\/p><p>I raise this issue because Behaviour &amp; Attitudes published a survey this week carried out by the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy which revealed that 60% of Irish people now want to talk about issues.  They believe that is an acceptable thing to do and they discuss it with their friends and relations.  That has become a more common conversation.  Some 80% of people believe the entire area should be regulated.  The Minister of State would agree with that and would expect it.<\/p><p>I raise the issue because it arises regularly.  People are concerned about it.  Individuals who use these services are vulnerable.  We do not want to aggravate their problems but rather ensure they get the best care possible.  People expect the State would regulate in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800026#Z00600","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1364479200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to update the House on the ongoing regulatory programme being undertaken by the Department of Health, including the regulation of health and social care professions.<\/p><p>The Health and Social Care Professionals Act was passed by the Oireachtas in 2005; it was amended last year.  The Act provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for 12 health and social care professions.  The 12 professions to be regulated under the Act are: clinical biochemists; dieticians; medical scientists; occupational therapists; orthoptists; physiotherapists; podiatrists; psychologists; radiographers; social care workers; social workers; and speech and language therapists.<\/p><p>The structure of the system of statutory registration will comprise a registration board for each of the individual professions to be regulated and a health and social care professionals' council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  The council was established in March 2007 as working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the 12 health and social care professionals designated under the Act.  <\/p><p>Five registration boards have been established to date, and the registration boards and their registers for the remaining designated professions should be established by 2015.  Under the Act, the Minister for Health may designate other health and social care professions if he considers that it is in the public interest to do so and if the specified criteria have been met.<\/p><p>While the immediate priority of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is to proceed with the establishment of the registration boards for the professions currently designated under the Act, he did commit to bring counsellors and psychotherapists within the ambit of the Act as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Both the Minister and I acknowledge the work done by a number of counsellor and psychotherapist national groups in coming together as a Psychological Therapies Forum to advise as a single voice in so far as is possible.  However, a number of issues remain to be clarified.  These include: decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated; the title or titles of the profession or professions; and the minimum qualifications to be required of counsellors and psychotherapists, which is an extremely important aspect.<\/p><p>A report from Quality &amp; Qualifications Ireland, QQI, is expected to be completed after the summer and will establish standards of knowledge, skills and competence to be acquired by students of counselling and psychotherapy.  This is an essential prerequisite to regulation of the profession and will allow for the regulation of education courses for the future.  In addition, the council will need to assess the adequacy of the wide range of qualifications held by existing practitioners against the QQI benchmark to establish their eligibility for registration.  <\/p><p>Officials of the Department will be engaging with the Psychological Therapies Forum and other relevant stakeholders as soon as the QQI report is available.  They will work through the outstanding issues that have yet to be addressed with a view to achieving regulation of the profession as soon as possible in the best interests, as the Senator rightly said, of the protection of the public.<\/p><p>I emphasise that while counsellors and psychotherapists are not currently subject to professional statutory regulation, they are subject to legislation similar to other practitioners including consumer legislation, competition, contract and criminal law, and so forth.<\/p><p>The issue of regulation is properly raised by the Senator.  I hope the outline I have given goes some way to setting out the current state of play in that regard.  It is a most important issue and it is being addressed in the context in which I have set it out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013032800026#Z00700","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1364479200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that and for outlining the roadmap that is ahead of us as he prepares to ensure that these professions are regulated.
