I welcome the Minister.<\/p> <p>I would like to start by expressing again our sympathy for the Enright and Walsh families on what was a real tragedy, with the loss of a wife, a daughter and a granddaughter, and a very traumatic event for the family.  We covered this debate to some extent during the passage through this House of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2014.  I thank the Minister for the empathy and sympathy that he showed for those affected by the case in considering the amendments and, indeed, I know the family were grateful.  While we did not get the amendments passed, we had a good debate, which raised the question: What is birth?<\/p> <p>Interestingly, we have a commonly understood meaning for stillbirth which would not seem to cover circumstances in which a mother dies, the baby dies as a consequence and then the baby is removed from the woman's body by way of autopsy.  I believe that was part of the dilemma that faced the coroner in this particular case, and his ruling is interesting.  He relied upon the statutory interpretation but also took into account the provisions of the eighth amendment to the Constitution, to which he referred in his ruling.  He also had correspondence with the Attorney General, who said that a death certificate could be issued under the stillbirth provisions.  The coroner was not convinced of that, so he reconsidered the matter and considered the definition of stillborn child and the violation of the fundamental rights of the unborn child.  He said that the majority of the definitions confirmed that birth means the separation of the unborn child from the body of the mother, and went on to say that the 2004 Act does not contain any restriction as to how a birth should occur.  He ended up making the finding, as a matter of law, that the removal or separation of a non-living foetus from the mother in the course of an autopsy is a birth and that its death is therefore registerable.  It was noteworthy that the Enright family thanked the coroner in court through their legal representatives for recognising the separate legal personality of the unborn child.  The family, I believe, have asked him to reserve issuing the coroner's certificate pending consideration of the constitutional action that they have before the courts.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jim Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1982\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1982&amp;amp;pid=JimWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Of course, none of us wanted them to go down that route, as the Minister acknowledged during the discussions we have had here.  If the Minister of State is back in this Department, he may look again at the Civil Registration Act to see whether they might have what we could call a Mollie Enright amendment to the Act, which would recognise deaths of infants in such a case.  Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution is interesting, particularly the Irish version, which states: \"Admha&iacute;onn an St&aacute;t ceart na mbeo gan breith chun a mbeatha\" - in other words, the life that has not been born.  To some extent, it is hard to rationalise that.  I know that, under the law, this has happened previously, so there is probably a question mark in regard to it.<\/p><p>I look forward to the Minister of State's response.  I think that he, like me, would feel that no family in such traumatic circumstances should have to fight so hard and also expose themselves to the exploitative legal costs we have in this country in order to pursue what they see as justice for their daughter and granddaughter.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020300002#B00200","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454495400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>In many ways, given the excitement that is going on around this place, this is an issue that brings us all back down to earth.  The loss of a daughter or a grandchild is terrible for any family, particularly so when a grandfather loses his granddaughter and daughter in one tragic accident.  While my expression of sympathy and empathy does not really help, I would still like to make it.  I met the family in the House with Deputy Conway and Senator Walsh.  I know this type of deep injury and the sense of loss probably never go away, and people just manage to live with them.  I hope the Walsh and Enright families can, in many ways, move on with their lives, while always keeping Mary and Mollie very much in their thoughts.  Those two families are very much in my thoughts today.<\/p><p>The loss of a child in any circumstances is an extremely sad experience for a family, and this case is especially tragic.  It is important to say, in the first instance, that the Coroner Service and decisions made by coroners are matters for the Department of Justice and Equality.  In a case where a coroner is involved, the obligation to initiate the process of registration rests with the coroner and the obligation is discharged by the issuing of the coroner's certificate containing the required particulars of the death concerned.  The question of which section of the Act under which the certificate is issued is entirely one for the coroner.<\/p><p>While there have been media reports about the inquest into these tragic events, I do not have specific information to date as to the coroner's precise findings.  In this case, as far as I am aware, a certificate has not yet been received from the coroner by the relevant registrar.  I also understand that the issues in this case are the subject of High Court proceedings and would, therefore, be <i>sub judice<\/i>.  Bearing this in mind, I am not in a position to comment.  For the information of the House, I have circulated the relevant sections, which I will not read out as we have gone through them on many occasions in the Seanad.<\/p><p>I would like to conclude by again expressing my sympathies to the families.  It is very hard to have to go on despite the loss of their daughter and grandchild, friend and sister.

It was a car crash and the mother was obviously driving the car.  She was totally in the right and was driving on the correct side of the road when the other car veered across and crashed into her vehicle.  Unfortunately, both she and her unborn baby were killed.  The family was very anxious that the unborn baby - their daughter and granddaughter - would be recognised as an individual.  I believe that has happened through the coroner's finding.  I think he is just holding back on issuing his certificate pending the family's consideration of whether to proceed with a constitutional case.<\/p> <p>This case has highlighted a matter that should be examined.  Such an examination should contemplate the fact that baby Mollie Enright was seven and a half months.  The Minister of State may have seen the photograph - taken at the autopsy - of her in her white gown.  In circumstances where a baby like that has not been taken from the mother during an autopsy, families might still wish to have that unborn baby recognised in its own right as an individual.  I believe this has now happened through the ruling of the coroner's court in this instance.  I am of the view, therefore, that this matter must be examined because similar cases are sure to arise.  There have been such cases in the past and there will be in the future.<\/p> <p>Interestingly, when we talk about the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, an issue I have been strong on and would like to mention on my last day in the House, one of the 34 victims of that largest loss of life during the Troubles was Baby Doherty, the unborn baby of a pregnant woman who was killed.  We all recognise that there were 34 victims.  There is a need to examine the position of those who find themselves in such tragic circumstances, without allowing extraneous matters to cloud what should be done in the interests of justice.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for the interest he took in this case and wish him well in the forthcoming election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020300002#D00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1454495400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Leaving aside this particular case, I have always felt we should be very careful regarding what we have in our Constitution and that many of these matters should be dealt with through legislation, particularly as medical science is evolving all the time.

Rather, I am of the view that both Houses need to deal with this sensitive matter through legislation.  That legislation should give us the flexibility to respond to certain tragic events.  I am facing into an election and perhaps Senator Walsh is also facing into one.  I am not too sure whether he is running again.  However, other Members of this House will be running in the forthcoming elections.  If re-elected, in our role as legislators, we should be brave enough to legislate on issues like this.  I am concerned by the fact that we rush to embed things in our Constitution that should not be in it.

Perhaps on reflection, that was the wrong thing to do.  He also forgot to mention the date of the election, which I thought was quite amazing.

Having lauded our Oscar nominees and international reputation, Ireland is still at the bottom of the European league for Government investment in culture and the arts.  Council of Europe data show that in 2012 in Ireland just 0.11% of GDP was spent on culture and the arts compared with the European average of 0.6%.  I hope the next Seanad, Oireachtas and Government will increase investment in the arts as a matter of priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020300002#P00500","speaker":"1167","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454495400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach.

I say to you and the Leader that the support this House has received from both of you, as well as from Ms Deirdre Lane and all of her team, has been greatly appreciated because a great deal has been achieved.  I was first elected to the Seanad way back in 1993.  I remember coming through the gates and assuming I would have to introduce myself, but I was delighted to be made welcome by the ushers at the door and everybody else.  It seems that the team of people working in Leinster House make a huge effort, for which I thank them.  On my first day the late Senator Mr. Tom Fitzgerald from County Kerry, whom I had not met previously, met me and offered to show me around.  I got a great inkling of where everything was, what to do and what the traditions were.  Approximately one week later the then Taoiseach appointed the late Mr. Gordon Wilson as one of his nominees to the Seanad.  I had met Gordon a few weeks earlier and had the great pleasure of showing him around Leinster House.  Even though I had never been around it myself, except with Mr. Fitzgerald, it was a great way to give the impression that I knew my way around.  It is an example of how each of us was made welcome by so many others, including by Senators on the other side of the Chamber.  I do not think the willingness and enthusiasm of Senators I have come across in the past 23 years are recognised enough.<\/p> <p>I have been involved in a number of careers but in this one every single day from the first time I came into this House I have been fortunate enough to get a sense of achievement and satisfaction.  There is a seanfhocal I remember well: &eacute;ist le fuaim na habhann, agus gheobhaidh t&uacute; brad&aacute;n - listen to the sound of the river and you will catch a salmon.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Feargal Quinn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is listening that has given us a great opportunity to be able to participate in so many different things.  That is one of the reasons I sometimes feel guilty when people criticise the television view of the Seanad or the D&aacute;il and see empty seats.  They do not realise how much work is going on and how much work can go on not necessarily in the Chamber.<\/p><p>Years ago, I remember being asked to explain the word &ldquo;management&rdquo; in five words or fewer.  We spoke about it a lot and came up with, &ldquo;Management is getting results through other people&rdquo;.  That is what I have learned here in this House.  It is about the ability of the Government, this and the other House to get results through other people.  I found listening and getting results on that basis has been a huge success.  It could not have taken place, however, without the enthusiasm, commitment and the dedication of so many people, both who work here and who have been elected to this House.<\/p><p>Last night, I checked the number of Bills I have had the pleasure of introducing in the House.  I have introduced 17 Bills, some of which have become law and others which have become law in different cases.  I would love to think it would be possible that somebody in the new Seanad will grab hold of those remaining Bills which have been prepared and will be able to continue with them.<\/p><p>The real challenge is to ensure this House is respected and regarded well.  It could not happen without the enthusiasm we get from right around this House.  I mention Senator David Norris, the father of the House, as our leader.  There are also the other Senators on this side, Senators John Crown, Sean D. Barrett and R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, who cannot be here today.  If we are going to succeed, we have to continue with the commitment, the dedication and the enthusiasm which I have seen here over the years.<\/p><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing us this time to be able to say a few words.  I offer everyone going for election every success, even the retiring but not very retiring Senator Craughwell.  He is certainly not very retiring, in spite of that today.  I wish him well.  It would be a shame not to have his voice, along with all the other voices, we hear.  Congratulations and I wish everyone going for election, whether for the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, well and I hope we see them back here.  I certainly intend to maintain my interest in what is going on here in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020300002#Q00500","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454495400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Today is a day on which we reflect on the past five years and it is important we thank people.

I wish all incoming Senators all the best and hope their presence justifies why the Seanad was retained.

I thank everybody for the courtesy and friendship they have shown to me.<\/p> <p>I know we cannot get a Minister to come into the House now but there is one issue which the new Seanad, or even the new D&aacute;il, should look at.  Yesterday, driving from Kilkenny, I filled my car with diesel which cost 99 cent per litre.  When I got to Dublin, I noticed the price per litre was &euro;1.06, &euro;1.07 or &euro;1.08.  Somebody has to do something about this.  The same company from which I bought my fuel in Kilkenny are selling it in Dublin for &euro;1.06.  Somebody is ripping somebody off.

The Garda is in a position quite separate to public servants.

The decision in this case is wrong and I hope it will be reversed because the Garda deserves the full support of the people.  I was quite surprised that the general secretary of Impact, Shay Cody, warned that he would ballot for industrial action if the Garda was exempt from the rules of sick pay.  That was very unfair.  I wish the Garda Representative Association, GRA, success in any appeal it takes in that regard because garda&iacute; put their lives at risk every day of the week.

That is borne out by the extensive body of legislation which has gone through this House and which has gone through relatively smoothly, considering the fact we did not have an overall Government majority.

I will not recite the same rigmarole but my initials are on those compliments.  Senator Maurice Cummins, as Leader of the House, has been one of the finest Leaders I can remember in this House.  A small example of that was yesterday when my colleague, Senator Barrett, who was a member of the banking inquiry committee, asked that the time given to the debate on it be extended.  Senator Cummins came up with a very good solution - he increased the amount of time for the first speakers on each side, which gave Senator Barrett an opportunity to put his views on the record.  The Cathaoirleach has been a very dignified Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and has done credit to this House.<\/p> <p>It has been an extraordinary Seanad, one that actually voted for its own extermination, which was quite an unusual political gambit.  Several Members on the other side of the House campaigned to retain the Seanad and yet voted for its extinction, which was one of the most Swiftian absurdities that I can remember in a political career of about 40 years.  <\/p> <p>Finally, I turn to my colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn.  It has been a real pleasure to work with him.  The word \"gentlemanly\" has been used and I think it is really appropriate to use it in terms of Senator Quinn.  He has been a most courteous, decent and gentlemanly Member of the House.  It has been a pleasure to work with him.

I will start by noting that I came across a quotation a few years ago that really struck me as commendable as a political philosophy.  It was by Fr. Pedro Arrupe, a Superior General of the Jesuits of whom Pope Francis is a particular devotee and it states \"Let there be men and women who will bend their energies not to strengthen positions of privilege, but, to the extent possible, reduce privilege in favour of the underprivileged.\"  I was so struck by this quotation that I have kept it on the back of my business card ever since.  It is a very simple philosophy in that if one helps the underprivileged and the vulnerable, one cannot go wrong politically.  It certainly has guided me to protect, in the first instance, the unborn.  I hope the situation will never arise in Ireland where, as happens on the other side of the Irish Sea or on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, 25% of unborn babies are aborted because that would be a travesty.  It has also guided me to ensuring Members protect the right of every individual and child to a good education.  It is striking that 50 years after Donogh O'Malley had the vision of free secondary education, people still look to him and what he achieved.  In the future, were Members to apply themselves to invest in education, it would be to the economic benefit of Ireland and its future and would enhance the lifestyle of the people.  One item at local level of which I am probably most proud is that I was involved in constructing a couple of advance factories in Wexford and New Ross and two highly successful companies now operate there.  This brings me to the third feature, which is that people have a right to employment and to a job.  One of the best works of life is to use one's endeavours to raise one's family and I am glad to note the rate of unemployment is falling.  It must be halved from its present level and hopefully, all those who were obliged to emigrate during the difficult times will return to Ireland.<\/p> <p>On the right to housing, like a number of other Members probably, I grew up in a local authority house.  I saw the importance of that and of improving the quality of local authority housing stock.  I have taken a lifelong interest in it and must state, as I leave this House, it troubles me that we probably face the biggest housing crisis for many decades in the history of the State.  I hope all Members of this House and the incoming Government will make this their top priority.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for his kind comments and good wishes and note he had not yet been born when I started out on this path in 1974.  I had never intended to be around for that long and I am sure many other Members also had not yet been born at that time.  Having served as a Fianna F&aacute;il public representative for 42 years, 19 of them in this House, I am particularly satisfied with my performance at local level.  At national level, one does not necessarily see the outputs and outcomes of the debates in which one participated and it is not easy to identify what are one's achievements.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jim Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1982\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1982&amp;amp;pid=JimWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, there is some unfinished work to which I would like to allude.  Along with others, I worked on the sub-committee which examined the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974.  Yesterday, I raised the matter at the sovereign committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in Belfast under the chairmanship of Senator Paul Coghlan.  I urged that body to see if it could resolve the issue so that the victims' families would have access to what caused that event and, in particular, the question of collusion.<br\/><br\/>All my life, since I was a child, one of my great aspirations and ambitions was to see a united Ireland and a British withdrawal from the island of Ireland.  That is ongoing work but I have to say, it has not received the focus it should have in recent times because of economic difficulties.  I hope we will return to that, reunite the people and move on.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude by wishing friends, colleagues and all Members of the House safe travel and every success in the election.  Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; go m&oacute;r libh sna m&iacute;onna at&aacute; romhainn, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r san olltoghch&aacute;n don D&aacute;il agus don Seanad.  I also express my good wishes to the Clerk of the Seanad and all the staff.  At the count in 1997, I was sitting there wondering how many votes I would get and I wondered why all the promises were not coming through in ballot papers.  The Clerk, Ms Deirdre Lane, came to me as she put down some bundles and said, &quot;I think we are going to see a little more of you around the House.&quot;  As it turned out, I was elected then for the first time.<br\/><br\/>To those retiring, I wish them health, happiness and a long life.  I will finish with a short quotation from John Buchan's <i>Pilgrim's Way<\/i>:<\/p><blockquote>Public life is regarded as the crown of a career, and to young men [and women] it is the worthiest ambition.

We have neglected that aspect of training.<\/p><p>I support the complimentary remarks as to how well and fairly the Cathaoirleach has chaired the sittings of the House.  The Leader has shown the same fairness and helped to make this a memorable Seanad.  He oversaw innovations such as the presentation made in the House by the leader of the Orange Order, the speeches given by MEPs in the Chamber and the addresses to Senators by former President, Ms Mary Robinson, and the Nobel prize winner, Professor Christopher Pissarides.  Notable reforms were carried out during this Seanad.<\/p><p>On developments in Northern Ireland, my namesake, the Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il, Assembly Speaker, William Hay, and his successor as Speaker, Mitchel McLaughlin, have played a notable role in bringing us together in this Chamber.  One of the strongest Unionists I have ever met told me after visiting the Seanad, \"This is the finest parliamentary Chamber I have ever been in but do not tell any of my constituents\".  It would not go down well in the heartlands of the DUP if it were known how much that individual admired the proceedings of this House and the building in which we are honoured to come to work every day.<\/p><p>Some people claim the Seanad does not do anything but we have shown otherwise, even in the past few months.  We achieved an amendment to the climate change legislation, for example, to secure a right for this House to have an input on climate matters.  We secured agreement on an amendment to the legal services legislation to ensure the omission of representatives from Northern Ireland on the new authority was rectified.  Senator Jillian van Turnhout and I succeeded in having the offence of chastisement abolished.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, full credit to him, was willing to take that amendment.  In attendance in the Visitors Gallery for some of the debate on that legislation was Dr. Toddy Daly, son of Dr. Cyril Daly.  The latter was a long-time advocate against corporal punishment.  It was a wonderful moment when that provision was accepted.<\/p><p>Parliament should be entitled to ask questions.  I agree with the former Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, and with Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns in his recent retirement speeches that we cannot be in a situation in these Houses where a decision is made one evening to give away &euro;64 billion and we are not allowed to ask questions as to what happened to that money and why it was needed.  That is a reform which should be pushed through in the next Oireachtas.<\/p><p>I join colleagues in thanking, as we have by our applause, the wonderful service over 23 years of Senator Feargal Quinn.  I wish him and Denise many happy years ahead.  I likewise convey my good wishes to Senator Jim Walsh and his wife, Marie.  I hope as many of us as possible return to this House because we have played a notable role in the development of parliamentary democracy in this country and received, particularly in Dublin working-class areas, a huge endorsement by the people to continue that good work.  Let us return in short order to go on with our important national work.  Parliament is not a branch of \"The Muppet Show\" and its Members are not inferior to those who achieve political power through the barrel of a gun.

I never imagined that five years on from 2011, when the country was in a very difficult situation, we would now be heading into an election in a much more optimistic and positive place.  The Government was given a job to do - namely, to fix the public finances and get people back to work - and, despite the fact that mistakes were made, we are, on balance, in a much better place today.

I was a second year politics student in UCD being lectured on Tuesday and Thursday mornings by the Seanad's former Leader, Maurice Manning, when Senator Quinn was elected.  Sadly, I did not have a vote then because I was an undergraduate.  We spent our political careers admiring people such as Senators Norris and Quinn and, indeed, Senator Barrett, who was a lecturer at the time and who has proven a very outspoken person in terms of the area of economics and the rights and wrongs relating to it.  It has been a great pleasure serving with people of such distinction.<\/p> <p>I wish all those Senators who are seeking election to the Lower House the very best, particularly the leader of the Opposition, a thorough gentleman, Senator Darragh O'Brien.  He was very disappointed when he lost his D&aacute;il seat on the previous occasion.  I think he is going to be back in the Lower House, which will be a loss to the next Seanad.  I tried it myself but, unfortunately, I did not get to the starting line on that occasion.  I will hopefully be in a position to seek re-election to this House and what happens, happens.  The past five years have been phenomenal in terms of the learning curve I have been on and it has been a huge honour to serve here.  It is amazing how, over time, one develops a very deep, personal bond - as well as a political one - with all of the other 59 Members of this House.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I suppose the politics is what creates the personal bond.

I have served in council chambers where there was rancour and so on and sometimes it lasted, but I can say that the professionalism with which people have done their business here has been inspirational.  It has been a pleasure to work with such a group of distinguished parliamentarians.

I pay tribute to other colleagues in the House who have decided not to go forward either in the Seanad or the general elections.  It has been a privilege to serve with each and every one of them.  Like Senator Michael Mullins, before I became a Member I was an avid follower of \"Oireachtas Report\".  I soon went off it when I became a Member and I have not looked at it since.<\/p> <p>It was a pleasure to meet Senator Quinn when I first became a Member.  Yesterday, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien commented on how she went to one of his shops when she was starting up her business and introduced herself and her product.  She was welcomed by the manager of the store, John Foy.  John Foy learned a lot from Senator Quinn - he told me as much himself - and he went on to open his own supermarket in Cootehill, County Cavan.  The supermarket is going from strength to strength and services not only Cootehill, but much of the surrounding area into County Monaghan and beyond.  That is only one of the stories that emerged as a result of Senator Quinn setting up Superquinn.  John Foy is one of thousands of people who went on to successful careers of their own as a result of working with Senator Quinn.<\/p> <p>I also pay tribute to Senator Jim Walsh.  It has been a privilege for me to be a party colleague of his.  I am glad to see that he is back in the parliamentary party, where he belongs.  As has been said here, Senator Walsh is a man of principle.  I agree with most of those principles, but not all of them, and we have had discussions and disagreements in the past.  Along with Senator Quinn, I wish them and their families many years of happiness together in future.<\/p> <p>Tributes have been paid to the Leader of the House as well and I agree with each of the positive comments made in regard to him.  I worked with the Leader when I was Government Chief Whip.  We were elected to the House on the same day.  We became very close friends when I became Government Chief Whip during the last Seanad.  I thank people for their comments in respect of me and the job I have carried out during the past five years.  The reason I carried out the job to the best of my ability is that I understood exactly where the Government Chief Whip of the day and his deputy, Senator Hayden, stood when it came to tight votes.  In case any of my party colleagues are listening in, I was not a soft touch or anything like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020300002#BB00400","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1454495400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Far from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020300002#BB00500","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1454495400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I know all about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020300002#BB00600","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1454495400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Only deserving cases were paired.

While one was eventually accepted by the Government, I am disappointed that the others were not taken on board.  Other Senators tabled Private Members' Bills.  During my time in the European Parliament, people worked together around a table to find the best way forward.  Every Senator wants to bring about the best changes for the people of the country.

As a country, we have the second highest spend on health care in the whole EU, yet we have quite an inefficient service.  We face major challenges in this area, which the next Government and Oireachtas will have to face up to.  We have a huge change in demographics over the next 15 to 20 years and we need to start planning for that.  I do not think we are focused on it, but if we do not focus on it, we will have major difficulties in five, ten and 15 years time.  Those are two issues that we need to focus on over the next five years.<\/p><p>I come back to something Senator Mullins raised regarding democracy.  I worked on the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the European Parliament and Subcommittee on Human Rights and travelled to a number of different countries where democracy does not exist.  I travelled to one country where up to 10,000 young people carry machine guns, where every place one went on the street, every second person had a gun.  At least in this country we have a democracy, which has been very good.  We may not always agree with the Government and the Opposition, but at least we have a democratic system that gives the choice to people, who elect the Government of the day.  That is something we should never forget.  We have been so good in managing our affairs over the last 90 or 100 years and long may it continue.  Now that we are coming to the anniversary of the 1916 Rising, there will be another 100 years where democracy thrives and the people have the right to change the law and to change the Government and not be dictated to by the people who carry guns and ammunition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020300002#CC00600","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454495400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom comhcheangal leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; eile agus m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Chathaoirleach.

I worked with him on the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, and I want to note in particular the interest he took in the North-South situation.  I am a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly now, but when we were members of LAMA, along with Michael Lawlor, and setting up the Confederation of European Councillors, as we have seen with the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, networking on the ground was so important.  We set up the North-South body of councillors, with Senator Quinn guiding it.  It is a thing we will have to look at again because it is the bottom-up approach.  The councillors are so important, as is networking and North-South co-operation.

I know of shops that have objected to competitors arriving, but Senator Quinn welcomed it.

The people of Dundalk have a fondness for the Senator but they were a wee bit annoyed with him that he went down to Drogheda and helped it.  Perhaps he will come back to Clanbrassil Street now with an overarching plan for the regeneration of the town of Dundalk, seeing as he made his first billion in that town.<\/p> <p>Two points stood out for me in the Seanad.  As education spokesperson, I noted that we were the ones who introduced the education and training boards Bill and the further education Bill.  It is important that we raise the status of vocational education and skills training.  The education and training boards are doing a good job in this regard.  All, or most, of the amendments came through this House, so we can take special pride in that.<\/p> <p>I support Senator Jim Walsh regarding Justice for the Forgotten.  We need to keep the debate going here.  We cannot allow the issues not to be explained fully to the people.  There is no hierarchy of Irishness.  When someone stands up and says he or she is an Irish republican, he or she should note that we are all Irish republicans.  We live in a republic.<\/p> <p>I was on Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta yesterday and someone rang in and asked me in a friendly way whether I still support doing away with the national anthem.  Senator Quinn raised the subject of the national anthem on one occasion and I added to his remarks by saying, just for debate, that we should do away with it altogether and have another one.  The caller made a remark to which I was not able to reply.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jim D'Arcy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2383\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2383&amp;amp;pid=JimDarcy&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He said on a radio programme that it has been sung in every school in Ireland, but I would have told him that it is not being sung in the Shankill Road or in east Belfast.

My time here has been the fastest five years of my life.  I am a confident person in the food business, and out and about, but it took me a long time to find my feet in here.  However, they have been the most decent, welcoming and polite group of people.<\/p> <p>I got out of the traps early yesterday with my comments about Senator Feargal Quinn, so I will not say anything about him today.  He was embarrassed yesterday because I piled adoration on him.  I said nothing about \"St. Diarmuid\" yesterday but we will leave that for another day.<\/p> <p>Sadly, I am not running again, although I am only 55 so the Senators may see me again in five years time.  However, the Senators who are re-elected will see a lot of me because I am dedicated to children with disabilities.  The Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children's Foundation, and all the families I am connected to on the medical cards issue, will be part of me forever.  I am not going away in terms of that.<\/p> <p>I am very upset about the way we treat the environment in Ireland.  The Senators know my views on fluoride, and we will not start that debate now, but we are the only country in Europe that puts that strange stuff in our water.  I will not go away on that issue either.<\/p> <p>I love business, food and chocolate.  I love entrepreneurs.  I believe in the island of Ireland and its greenness.  In what other country in the world can one take a satellite photograph and get the real thing.  We are green, so I will never stop in terms of my belief in that.  I told the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, the other night that he has been a brilliant Minister.  Ireland has taken off in terms of exports.  We are over the &euro;12 billion figure and are on our way to reaching &euro;19 billion by 2025.  I hope the Senators who return here will remain focused on that issue, which is indigenous.  It belongs to us so we should stay focused on it.<\/p> <p>I am not saying goodbye to any of the Senators because I will be in here morning, noon and night.  However, I have three people over 90 whom I hope to spend more time with.  I will spend a little more time on my business for a while, but I will be plugged into what the Senators are doing in this House also.<\/p> <p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson, Senator Se&aacute;n Barrett, Senator Imelda Henry and all the Senators who return will see a good deal of me.  The Leader is down the road from me in Waterford.  I will stay plugged into what this House is doing because it is the best club and the greatest honour to be a Member, but we will not stop in terms of our will to change things and do better.<\/p> <p>Senators can stop using the word \"retirement\" when speaking about Senator Feargal Quinn because he has so many plans.  He is launching a new book in May.  He has a new television series planned that will take him a year to make.  His beautiful wife Denise is thinking of divorcing him because she never sees him.  She never will see him.  For the record, he is not retiring.<\/p> <p>I thank Deirdre and the staff.  We would not be here only for them.  I agree with the comments about the parliamentary reporters.

I thank the staff here, Deirdre and Martin, the Captain of the Guard and the Superintendent.<\/p> <p>It is a special day for Senator Jim Walsh whom I wish every happiness in retirement.  It is a long time ago since I canvassed with him in New Ross, although not on the same panel.  <\/p> <p>I refer to the inimitable Senator Feargal Quinn, who says his piece quietly.  He reminds me of the village schoolmaster, \"that one small head could carry all he knew\", but when he spoke he spoke eloquently and to the point.  He will be a loss to this House but I am sure there are others outside it to replace him.<\/p> <p>The one thing I have learned about politics, and I am around a long time, is that there is no security of tenure for any of us.  My sister sent me a text this morning as soon as she heard that the D&aacute;il was dissolved stating that it is 29 years since I first decided to run for the D&aacute;il.  In that regard I feel a weight off my shoulders; I am relieved.  I say to those who are thinking of running on the Agricultural Panel that I will be on that panel and will be a thorn in their sides.  However, it is surreal for me not to be running in the D&aacute;il election for the first time in what is almost all of my adult life.  To see people today who are retiring from this House, and the other House, is surreal also.<\/p> <p>The most phenomenal achievement over the past five years of this Seanad occurred when the future of this elegant and noble Chamber, the Upper House, was put to the test.  It was a mistake by the Taoiseach to go down that road but a message was sent to this House by the people not alone in terms of saving the Seanad but about reform.  There has not been enough done in that regard.  That is an issue the next Seanad, and the Government, might re-examine because it is important that we would do that.<\/p> <p>It is also important to compliment the Leader of the House with whom I have had a great working relationship.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Denis O'Donovan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1988\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1988&amp;amp;pid=DenisODonovan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=03\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He has done a great job.  I also compliment the Government Whip, Senator Paul Coghlan, and Senator Aideen Hayden, as well as our own leader, Senator Darragh O'Brien, who is on the trail.  I wish everyone success, whether in running for the D&aacute;il or the Seanad or not running at all.  Politics is difficult.  There are Members here today who think we will be back in three months time, but we may not be.  It could be me who may not be back.  It is an uncertain lifestyle.  I often wonder if I made the right decision when I came to the fork in the road and had a choice of continuing in the legal profession or pursuing a career in politics.  However, I am now on the road and there is no turning back, but I have had a good innings.<\/p><p>I thank everyone from all sides of the House, including Independent Senators, for the camaraderie I have experienced here.  By and large, party politics are left aside when we are in the House.  That is very important.  The Seanad is different from the other House.  If there are issues to be dealt with, we try to deal with them and leave the veil of political parties outside the Chamber.  I understand the Cathaoirleach's indulgence.  This is like mass on Holy Saturday, probably one of the longest masses of the year.  This Order of Business has been extremely long, but it is probably the last in this Seanad.  <\/p><p>Members have referred to Senator Diarmuid Wilson.  We are supposed to have a Whip on this side of the House, but, unfortunately, he does not have a whip.  He has a fur or sheep-skinned whip because he does not lash too hard with it.  This should be recognised, but he deals effectively with business and that is what is important.  <\/p><p>I wish all of my colleagues luck, whether they are running for the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.  There are a few tough months ahead of us and there will be winners and losers.  There will be the vanquished and the victors.  Sometimes, in politics this is a hard pill to swallow and I have swallowed it many a time.  I hope on the road ahead it will be a little sweeter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020300002#GG00800","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454495400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>There I was thinking we would have a very brief Order of Business this morning, but it is only right and fitting that we reminisce and reflect on the five year period of this Seanad.  Looking back, there have been five referenda and a presidential election, while quite a volume of legislation has passed through the House.  The five important referenda included the children's rights referendum, as well as the marriage equality referendum.  We also had a referendum on whether the second House of the Oireachtas should continue.  In their wisdom, the people decided to retain it.  Naturally, I think they made a very good decision.  There were two other referenda on judges' pay and Oireachtas inquiries, an issue which may be revisited.<\/p> <p>I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  They are important people in keeping the House running in a seaman-like manner.  I mention running the House in a seaman-like manner as I see a gentleman in the Visitors Gallery, Mr. Enda O'Coineen, who travelled around the world on his own.  The Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach did a wonderful job in steering the ship through what at times were stormy waters, for which I pay tribute to them.  <\/p> <p>I also pay tribute to Deirdre and all of the staff in the Seanad office, as well as all other staff in the Oireachtas, including the ushers and stenographers.  I pay tribute to my own staff, Orla, Frankie and Jason, who also stepped in.  <\/p> <p>We have worked here as a team during the five years and our strong point has always been the scrutiny of legislation.  This is something the House does very well and I hope it will continue to do so.  This something that has been commented on by Ministers from all sides, past and present.  We have not guillotined debates on too much legislation in this House in the past five years, which is the way it should be.  It is only in circumstances where emergency legislation is being dealt with where debates should be guillotined.  I recollect on one occasion a certain Minister insisting on the debate on legislation being guillotined and suggesting that the Taoiseach would be rung to make me guillotine the debate.  I told the said person that if he rang the Pope, it would not be guillotined and it was not.  Its role in the scrutiny of legislation has been the most important aspect of this House.  <\/p> <p>I pay tribute to colleagues who are retiring.  I did so yesterday in the case of Senator Feargal Quinn.  That he has introduced almost 17 Bills in the period he has been in the House bears testimony to the amount of work he has done and the esteem in which he is held by all colleagues on all sides.  Likewise, Senator Jim Walsh has also been in the Seanad for quite some time and I wish him well in his retirement.  We have had many differences, but we have agreed on several occasions, too, on which I compliment.  As Senator Paschal Mooney said, he came here as a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator and it is only fitting that he leave as a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator.<\/p> <p>Other colleagues who have announced they are retiring include Senator Fiach Mac Conghail who has been a wonderful advocate for the arts.  I agree with him that the issue of arts funding will have to be examined by the new Government.  <\/p> <p>Senator John Crown has also been a wonderful Member of the House.  He was insightful and on many occasions his knowledge was very important when considering Bills dealing with health matters.  We will certainly miss his expertise.  <\/p> <p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien has indicated today that she will not be standing again.  She contributed to debates on many Bills.  She certainly displayed her expertise last week when dealing with the horse racing Bill.  Her in-depth knowledge of the industry surprised many.<\/p> <p>I wish all Members who are retiring and all those who will contesting elections, be it the general election or the Seanad election, every success.  It has been an honour to be Leader of the House for the past five years, but I could not have done it without the help and co-operation of each and every Member.

I also thank Jason, Keishia, Ronan, Niamh and Aisling, the secretary to the Cathaoirleach, who regulates the Chair.  They have done a wonderful job over what was a difficult five-year period in that the Government did not always have the majority, amendments were brought in late and so forth.  I compliment the staff.  It was a great honour to work with them and to see how it works from the other side.<\/p><p>As Senator Wilson pointed out, there are three other Members who started out with us, Martin McAleese, Deirdre Clune and Jimmy Harte, two of whom retired and one who went to Europe.  I wish the three of them well, Jimmy Harte in particular.<\/p><p>By and large, this was an excellent Seanad.  When I look around, I see quite a number of Members who will not be back.  It will be a changed Seanad, just as this Seanad was much changed from the previous one.  I want to wish anyone who is standing for the D&aacute;il the very best of luck and the same goes for all Members who are standing for the next Seanad election.  While this may not be our last meeting, we may not get the opportunity to say this again.

In March 2015, I advised the Seanad that I intended bringing amendments to both the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012 and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.  We needed to amend both of these because of a UK Court of Appeal decision in R (T) <i>v.<\/i>Greater Manchester Chief Constable (CA).  The UK appeal found that the indiscriminate disclosure of all old minor criminal records is incompatible with Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.  It must be based on the principle of relevance and proportionality and there must be a degree of coherence between the legislation providing for spent convictions and any legislation providing for disclosure of criminal convictions for employment purposes.  Put simply, any offences excluded from vetting disclosures because they are not relevant should also be spent convictions.  That is the key change being made.<\/p><p>There is also a change in regard to the District Court.  Section 54 provides that the following District Court convictions will not be disclosed by the Garda vetting unit: motoring offences more than seven years old, with the proviso that dangerous driving convictions are limited to a single conviction, and minor public order offences more than seven years old.  Where a person has only one District Court conviction, other than motoring or public order convictions, that conviction will also not be disclosed after seven years.  There are some exemptions in terms of convictions for sexual offences and the bona fide concern if a person would pose a threat to a child.<\/p><p>These are the substantive changes in the Bill and other than these, there are only minor drafting amendments to the other sections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020300002#KK00200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1454495400,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for reading that explanation in the House.

However, I accept that as the Minister said, there are significant exceptions to that rule.  These are welcome and will undoubtedly assist many people.  These are the exceptions pointed out by the Minister - that public order offences and most driving offences are exempted from the provision that only one conviction may be spent.

Under the existing legislation, the CER may modify a licence.
