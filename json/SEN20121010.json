However, in light of events yesterday it is of vital importance that in the first instance, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, be here himself and at the very least, he uses this opportunity to provide clarity in respect of the situation that unfolded at yesterday's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  In my opinion and that of my colleagues, the manner in which two people, whose cumulative salaries are close to \u20ac400,000 per annum, tried to manipulate a process in advance of a Committee of Public Accounts hearing to give information they chose to give but not information that was sought was an affront to the Oireachtas, the political system and ultimately the people of Ireland.  During their opening statement, their demeanour and attitude was such as to give the impression that they run the health service and would let the committee members know what the witnesses wanted them to know, when they wanted the members to know it.  This behaviour is unacceptable and in the interests of the integrity of this House and the Oireachtas, it is imperative that the Leader uses his good offices to prevail upon the Minister to make a statement on this matter to prevail upon the two individuals concerned, who between them earn nearly \u20ac500,000 per year, to apologise to the people of Ireland for the flippant and disrespectful manner in which they addressed the most important and historic committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas yesterday.<\/p><p>Members have learned that as of the end of August, the overrun in respect of the Health Service Executive, HSE, was \u20ac329 million.  One month later, it was \u20ac45 million more.  Last April, it was advised in these Houses, in media interests and by the former chief executive officer of the HSE, Cathal Magee, that unchecked, this would head for \u20ac500 million.  How right he was, as we are on course for an overrun of \u20ac500 million.  Nothing has been seen in respect of the so-called collection of moneys from the insurance companies.  Similarly, no cumulative savings in spending on drugs will have been achieved by the end of the year.  No thanks to the Committee of Public Accounts or the two people in receipt of \u20ac500,000 per year, one learned yesterday from RTE, the national broadcaster, and not those who supposedly run the health service, that Tallaght Hospital is to get an overdraft of \u20ac12 million.  One did not hear this information from the aforementioned individuals at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting yesterday and neither did they reveal that this overdraft facility was secured with a letter of comfort from the HSE.  What about Sligo Regional Hospital, which has an overrun?  What about Beaumont or the many other hospitals that have substantial overruns?  Who will finance them?  The deficit is growing at \u20ac45 million per month.  The Minister is in absolute denial and continues with his headless chicken approach to the management of the finances of the HSE.<\/p> <p>We were told some months ago that the new dream team in health would have it all under control but their opening shot to the arms of democracy was that they would tell us what was going on and how things would be done when it suited them.  These same people were not able to tell us where the savings would be made and that there would be no cuts to front-line services.<\/p><p>On another issue, we are still waiting to find out how the primary care centres were chosen.  One thing Mr. O'Brien told us yesterday was that to the best of his knowledge, as chief executive officer designate, nobody in the HSE had anything to do with selecting those centres.  Will the Leader agree that, as the T\u00e1naiste rightly said, we need absolute clarity and statements on this situation?  I hope he will prevail on the Minister to ensure that he will use the opportunity today to make the situation on these very important issues very clear.<\/p><p>We will not table an amendment to the Order of Business on the basis that there will be opportunities throughout the day to clarify these issues.  However, if there is not, we will highlight them every day because the farce that has become the management of our health service must come to an end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000002#A00500","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349861400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Listening to Senator Mac Sharry, I was struck that he might have kept his powder dry for a little later in the day given that the Minister for Health will be in the House from about lunchtime onwards.

We said previously that after the children's referendum on 10 November, we might ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to come to the House for a general debate on children's rights.  It might be worth looking at the report of the Ombudsman for Children then but before that, the Minister for Education and Skills will come to the House.  Many of us have called for various issues to be addressed during the debate with him and I note that 47% of the complaints to the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, in 2011 concerned education.  Some of the issues she raised in her report will be of relevance in the debate with the Minister for Education and Skills and we might be able to cover them then.  <\/p><p>I ask the Leader again if we might have a debate on community policing and street crime, something about which we have spoken previously.  I condemn the shooting yesterday of the 16 year old boy in Crumlin.  It was shocking and again highlights the problem of street crime.  I spoke yesterday about the purple flag initiative and the huge improvements in safety on the streets brought about as a result of co-operation between community police and local businesses in cities and towns in Britain and Northern Ireland.  It is an initiative we might look at introducing here to avoid these sorts of horrific incidents.  <\/p><p>There is some danger to Bewleys and its signage on Westmoreland Street.

It is important the House devotes some time to discussing mental health and mental health funding, to highlighting the fact there is help for people and that they should not feel isolated and alone or that there is nobody to whom to talk or to turn.  We need to publicise the fact there is help out there and make people aware that the HSE in every town and community is there to assist people.

It concerns the former Avon Arlington factory which is disused, closed and derelict since 1998 but apparently is now under the responsibility and ownership of the National Asset Management Agency.  However, it has given the local community the run-around, saying it is not its responsibility to secure it and make it safe and has abandoned the property.  It is an eyesore on the edge of the town and within hundreds of metres of the mainline train station which serves the south and west.  It is a tinderbox of 12,000 sq. m with hundreds of barrels of chemicals on site, unsecured and open to the elements.  The ground is contaminated and possibly the watercourses in the area.  I have raised the issue with the senior officials in Laois County Council who say they cannot get a straight answer from NAMA in respect of responsibility for the site.  I am genuinely concerned about it.  I do not want to have to return to the issue and say \"I told you so\".  The Portarlington community and the development association are getting the run-around from NAMA.  It is vital that whichever Minister is responsible instructs NAMA to take responsibility for it if the site is in its ownership.  The Environmental Protection Agency must intervene as a matter of urgency because the site is being vandalised and used for anti-social behaviour.  If one incident occurs at the site the entire town would have to be evacuated.  It is a disaster waiting to happen.  It is not fair to the people of the town that this derelict site on the edge of a town, with a population of 8,000, is allowed go unsecured.  Responsibility for it is way beyond the scope of the local authority.

That is fair enough.  I draw to his attention some of the figures prepared by the Government and some of the savings that were supposed to be made.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, planned to save &#8364;75 million expenditure on allowances and has come back with a measly saving of &#8364;3.5 million.  We were told there would be a microfinance fund facility to avail of funding from the European Investment Fund but we have not seen much progress on that issue.  The Department produced a medium-term fiscal statement in December in which it predicted a year on year growth of 1.6% for 2012.  However, growth in the second quarter is at 0%  and year on year the growth figures for the quarter are down by 1.1%.  We were promised 100,000 extra jobs.  We have not seen those but in the past 12 months 33,400 jobs have been lost to the economy.  The unemployment rate is at 440,000, almost 15%.  It is a bit rich of the Leader to cast aspersions on our figures when the Government gets its forecast totally wrong.  <\/p><p>  I call for a debate on a wealth tax because Sinn F\u00e9in has done much homework on such a tax.  Based on the information made available to us, we estimate that up to &#8364;800 million could be made available from a wealth tax but the Department of Finance will not cost it and will not give us the figures.  I challenge the Leader to invite in the Minister for Finance and put a costing on what the wealth tax proposed by Sinn F\u00e9in would bring in.  If it is &#8364;400 million, &#8364;500 million, &#8364;800 million, let us see it.  At least it would be more than is coming in at present and the right people would be taxed as opposed to those who cannot afford to pay.

It would be a useful exercise to reflect the views of various sides of the House on what constitutes good governance.  Yesterday, we saw an example of appalling governance at the Committee of Public Accounts to which Senator MacSharry referred.  How such people reach certain positions must raise questions about the selection and recruitment process in the public service.  The delegation's dismissive attitude and failure to display any command of their responsibilities and brief was alarming and spoke for itself.  <\/p><p>  A good governance debate could also include the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 which has not been enacted.  The Bill has knocked around for the past four years.  It was inspired by the good work of our colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn, and addressed the issue of hard-pressed subcontractors, many of whom have gone to the wall in the interim with the loss of a high number of jobs.  Our legislation and <i>modus operandi<\/i>  favour banks as the preferred creditors but there is a need to examine that provision.  <\/p><p>  It is farcical that people from this State must go to our neighbouring island to be declared bankrupt in order that they can have some time and be able to earn a living and, hopefully, create jobs.  Unfortunately, many of those entrepreneurs may not return here and their skills and potential to create jobs will be lost.  It is appalling that the legislation has been delayed.<\/p><p>  In many ways - and I have spoken about the subject before - its a reflection of the dysfunctional nature of the public service system.  We have far too many people in the public service who simply mark time and do very little yet earn good salaries.  Their primary objective is to get as much as they can for as little input as possible.  I have criticised the system for the past seven years.  There are excellent people in the public service without whom it would collapse but we need to root out the bad.  The Minister for Public Service and Reform needs to change the public service, as a matter of urgency.  The Minister identified in his budget speech savings of &#8364;150 million yet admitted almost a year later that the most savings he can achieve is &#8364;3.5 million.  It shows that he is not up to the job or acting in the best interest of the country.  I ask the Leader to examine the issues and to arrange a debate.  The Government has the largest majority in the history of the State but that privileged position is being squandered.  We are back to the 1980s when all the Government did was squabble among itself, mark time and double the national debt.  We are in a disastrous situation and can ill-afford behaviour that will lead to a complete catastrophe for the people.                 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000005#D00100","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1349862600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I join in welcoming the good news announced yesterday by the Kerry Group.

They were simply ways of hiding payments under the counter instead of calling them salaries which is what they deserved to be called.

There is a suggestion that older people, people with disabilities and other sections of society cannot afford to take cuts but that young people can take numerous cuts.  We need to discuss the issue in an open and frank fashion rather than pinpointing one section of society.  It is as if a young person's interest in housing, social protection and the economy is not as important as that of other people.  Aside from asking the Leader to invite the Minister for Social Protection to come to the House, I would also like him to arrange a special debate on youth affairs issues such as mental health, access to social protection, access to housing and employment activation measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000005#D00500","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1349862600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Well done, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000005#D00600","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1349862600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Like other colleagues, I welcome yesterday's announcement by the Kerry Group that it will locate an international centre of excellence in Naas.

He was found dead in a slurry pit.  I have some experience of this, in that last winter I had an accident on my farm when 13 stock went down into the slatted tanks.

It is only following the tragedy in Northern Ireland that people realise it.  Three gases are emitted and one lungful of the wrong gas will kill a person.  Unfortunately, this message is not out there in the agricultural community.  I now know I was lucky.  I spent six hours trying to take stock out of a tank underneath the ground, and one lungful of the wrong gas would have meant I would not be here today.  It is as serious as this.  There is an incredible lack of knowledge in the sector about this particular danger.  I raise the issue because the slurry period will close at the end of the month and an enormous quantity of slurry will be agitated, taken out and applied to the land in the coming three weeks.

People will have ample opportunity to raise the myriad of social welfare items that have been mentioned on the Order of Business.  Perhaps in that debate we can deal with facts rather than the speculation of which we have heard plenty in recent weeks.<\/p><p>Senators Wilson and Daly spoke about local government reform.  I understand the Minister will be making an announcement and all will be revealed on the issue next week.<\/p><p>On the issue of education, the Minister will come to the House again for pre-budget statements on 23 October during which I am sure Senators will have many questions on the education sphere.<\/p><p>I note Senator Paul Coghlan's comments on the demise of the Glencullen group which is certainly a blow to the motor trade.  Senator Michael D'Arcy spoke about accidents on farms and getting safety information to farmers.  It is a very important issue that I will raise with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine.  The Minister was here last week and even if he is not scheduled to be her in the next week or two, we will certainly arrange for that type of information to get to farmers - it is a very serious issue.<\/p><p>I already said that Senator Daly spoke about local government reform.  He need have no worries about the status of Waterford city.  If he read the terms of reference of the group that was charged with the issue of amalgamation, he would know that it specifically dealt the protection of city status for Waterford.<\/p><p>In addition to dealing with mental health, Senator Moran asked when the Walsh report would be published.  I will try to ascertain that for her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000007#F01700","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1349863800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1349864400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.30 a.m. and resumed at 11.45 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill 2012: Order for Second Stage","time":1349864700,"counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000009#H00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1349864700,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Bill entitled an Act to amend the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003 to confer additional functions on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission; and to provide for related matters.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1349864700,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I move: That Second Stage be taken now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000009#H00400","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1349864700,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":" Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill 2012: Second Stage","time":1349864700,"counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000009#H00600"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1349865000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1349865000,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Ar dt\u00fas, ba mhaith liom a r\u00e1 go bhfuil \u00e1thas m\u00f3r orm, mar Aire St\u00e1it sa Roinn Eala\u00edon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta, an d\u00edosp\u00f3ireacht ar an mBille um Choimisi\u00fan Thithe an Oireachtais (Leas\u00fa) 2012 a thionscnamh i Seanad \u00c9ireann inniu.

He is a regular visitor to the Seanad.  We always like to see him here.  As he has said, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill 2012 is a relatively straightforward Bill.  The obvious goals of the legislation are to introduce greater efficiency, to save money, which we really need to do, and to consolidate the records and standards used when Irish-language translations are done, thereby ensuring such translations are more consistent.<\/p><p>The previous Government decided in November 2008 to approve the translation into Irish of all statutory instruments.  That decision also established the central translations unit and led to a review of the official standard for Irish.  Subsequently, in June 2011, the current Government said there was a need to begin to consolidate translation services within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Obviously, we have arrived at that point now that we are considering this legislation.  The aim is to ensure there is consistency among the consolidated translation services.  The new unit within the Houses of the Oireachtas will have statutory responsibility for translating primary and secondary legislation and ensuring the official standard for Irish is reviewed not less than once every seven years.  Staff from the central translation unit have transferred to the Oireachtas pending the enactment of this sensible legislation.<\/p><p>Therefore, the two primary purposes of this Bill are to expand the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission by allowing it to assume functions previously held by the central translation unit, in terms of translating primary or secondary legislation, and to guarantee that the official standard for Irish - an caighde\u00e1n oifigi\u00fail - is reviewed periodically.  In any debate on this legislation, it needs to be emphasised that significant savings will be achieved on foot of it.  We often talk here and in the D\u00e1il about the need for public reform and the importance of getting more for less and achieving greater efficiencies.  In its own small way, this Bill will do precisely that.  It is envisaged that a financial saving will arise in the short to medium term from the consolidation of functions.  It should also be mentioned that the introduction of consistency, in terms of having an official single standard of Irish, is needed and should be uncontroversial.<\/p><p>This Bill contains a number of provisions relating to the translation of legislation.  It provides for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to translate statutory instruments made by Ministers, or by people other than Ministers when requested by Ministers to do so.  Similarly, it provides that Ministers may make arrangements, if they so wish, for the translation of statutory instruments other than by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The commission can arrange for people other than staff members to assist in the translation of statutory instruments as it considers appropriate.  The Bill will allow the commission to charge fees for the translation of statutory instruments.  This could mean that we will be able to cater for the amount of legislation that is before the Houses at a given time.  A serious amount of legislation is coming through at the moment.  The model proposed in the Bill will involve the translation of statutory instruments on demand, subject to the availability of resources, with Departments or other public bodies paying for the cost of the service.<\/p><p>The second part of the Bill relates to caighde\u00e1n oifigi\u00fail na Gaeilge.  It provides for the publication of an caighde\u00e1n oifigi\u00fail by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission at least once every seven years.  This will ensure there is a consistent and evolving standard that takes account of any changes in the intervening period.  Similarly, the Bill also provides that when the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is conducting a review of an caighde\u00e1n oifigi\u00fail, it should consult the Ministers for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Education and Skills, and Justice and Equality, as well as interest groups and the public, to ensure there is a wide consultative process in relation to the language.  I believe this is a healthy step.  It is important that we include as many groups as possible in the procedure.  Given the two major points covered in this legislation, I suggest it should be seen for what it is - a straightforward Bill that will ensure greater efficiency in how we handle translation and greater consistency in how our legislation is translated.  Ultimately, it will ensure that the translation processes receive the resources needed to do the job effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000013#M00400","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1349866800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Ba bhre\u00e1 liom c\u00fapla rud a r\u00e1 agus ceist n\u00f3 dh\u00f3 a chur.

While the Bill is short and technical, it addresses the issue that there must be one standard of Irish on which we can all agree.  The standards for Irish have changed consistently since those who spoke the language first came to our shores.  It is common for any spoken or modern language to go through a certain degree of change.  I found the Minister of State's reference to the change in the typeface in the 1930s very interesting.  The typeface at the time was very attractive and distinctive and I am sure its demise was lamented by many.  I was not aware that change had happened in the 1930s.  An uncle of mine has experience of that typeface, but I doubt he attended teacher training in the 1930s.  If he did, he is a lot older than I thought.<\/p><p>With regard to the Bill, because of the infinite wisdom of the previous Government and the previous Minister, Deputy \u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv, the central translations unit was established.  The Minister of State has explained why this was done and that it resulted in two units of the State being involved in the translation of legislation.  Often, when two groups are moving in the same direction, they follow different signposts and arrive in different ways.  What the Minister of State is attempting to do is right.  He is trying to ensure everybody is on the one road and that people are not moving in different directions.  I am sure the learned scholars, to whom Senator Brian \u00d3 Domhnaill referred, who work in the central translations unit and on the steering committee do and have done good work, as the Minister of State has acknowledged.<\/p><p>I believe the report to which Senator Brian \u00d3 Domhnaill referred is online, although I stand to be corrected on this.  I gather from the Minister of State that he has given a commitment that the recommendations made by that group and the steering committee will not be swept under the carpet.  He has given guarantees that the recommendations made by the expert group will be taken into consideration when An Caighde\u00e1n Oifigi\u00fail is reviewed in three years time.  That is welcome.  However, as we have seen in the past, there is significant duplication in various Departments.  Therefore, I am glad the Minister of State has taken the initiative, as we cannot have different groups doing the same job.

I am following Senator Noone and others in giving my delivery as B\u00e9arla because my tutor has gone down the west and I must source a new tutor.  I wish her well.<\/p><p>It makes absolute sense to bring this together; it makes no sense to have two offices doing a similar job.  It would be much more efficient to have one office doing it, it would eliminate confusion and tension and is the correct approach.  I will not repeat the remarks of my colleagues but I will make a couple of points about translating documents into Irish.<\/p><p>It is wholly appropriate that all legislation should be available in both English and Irish.  Irish is regarded as our first language so it is a priority and should be done as quickly as possible, within reason.  We must always bear in mind that reason is very important but the fact it must be done is critical.  It is also correct that where necessary and appropriate, translation should be farmed out.  There are plenty of people who are well capable of supplementing the services available here.<\/p> <p> It might be provocative to say it but I must ask if we are doing the Irish language any favours when a county development plan must be translated in full into Irish when not one person will purchase a copy of it.  Would that money not be far better spent promoting the learning of spoken Irish as opposed to wasting it on translation for the sake of translation?  Where it is necessary and appropriate, it should be translated.  Where there are people looking for a translation, it should be made available, but a county development plan will consist of seven volumes and it will probably cost between \u20ac60,000 and \u20ac100,000 to translate into Irish.  It is very frustrating when not a single person requested or bought it.  That is a complete waste of taxpayers' money and does the language no favours; it actually turns people against the language.<\/p><p>The Irish language is something we should all be proud of.  It is regrettable, and I include myself in this, that the percentage of the population who speak Irish has reduced year on year.  It is our job as people who genuinely like the language and see it as an essential part of our heritage that makes us who we are that we should ensure people speak the language and that money is spent appropriately on its promotion.  I would much prefer to see that \u20ac60,000 spent to provide classes for those who want to learn Irish again and to promote oral Irish, refostering the love of Irish that we have in our DNA but that needs to be activated.<\/p><p>I support this Bill.  Unfortunately I am unable to be here to hear the Minister's reply on the documents in local authorities and State agencies that are translated into Irish and left on the shelves and never picked up.  I will get it from the record and will talk to the Minister of State about it privately in the future.  In a situation where there are so many demands on resources there must be a common sense approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000015#O00200","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349868600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Minister of State back to the House and sincerely apologise for delivering my speech in English as my Irish is not up to scratch.

I know the caighde\u00e1n oifigi\u00fail has been pertinent and I have heard a lot about it in the last weeks and months.<\/p><p>I completely agree with Senator Conway that we need a common standard and that the money is being wasted on translation while the language should be there as something we love.  I would love to see money for such activities being channelled into courses or grants for those studying through the medium of Irish.  There are some such grants but they have been cut back.  Irish should be promoted.  As a former teacher, I know there are students who love Irish who might not go to a gaelscoil.  We must foster that love to encourage them to continue.  Speaking to my daughter's friends, I know there are people who would have loved to have continued had there not been a lack of finances.  If grants were available, they would pursue their career and develop their love of Irish.<\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh mentioned the importance of dialects and I agree with him, they are part of our culture and heritage.  Not only do we have dialects in Irish, we have them in English as well.  As a newly-appointed Senator, I found it very strange to listen to the dialects from all over the country, and sometimes having difficulty even understanding English.<\/p><p>I welcome the proposal that an caighde\u00e1n oifigi\u00fail will be reviewed not less than every seven years, with the next review taking place in 2015.  I was not aware the last one was published in 1958 and I feel 54 years is far too long an interval between reviews to keep the Irish language as up to date and relevant as possible.  I also welcome the consultation between the Minister of State and the Minister for Education and Skills, as well as other interested members of the public.  I ask the Minister of State to consider a closer and lengthier consultation period between the Department of Education and Skills and interested parties and the appointed committee as provisions will need to be made in course curricula and resources to allow for any changes or reviews to the previous caighde\u00e1n oifigi\u00fail.<\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to external experts who can be consulted or appointed to the committee.  Where will they come from?  Will they be from An Coiste T\u00e9arma\u00edochta or lecturers from the main universities?  Native Irish speakers of the main dialects should also be consulted during the review.<\/p><p>In view of the increased workload for Rann\u00f3g an Aistri\u00fach\u00e1in, will there be more employment in the sector in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000016#P00200","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1349868600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu\u00edochas leis na Seanad\u00f3ir\u00ed go l\u00e9ir a labhair ar an Bhille seo agus cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh go raibh siad an-deimhneach agus go raibh tuiscint ar cad \u00e9 at\u00e1 i gceist againn leis an Bhille seo.

The great Fintan O'Toole chaired one debate we had in TCD.  It is a great pleasure to welcome him and wish him well in the task because, as I said the last day, it is probably the most demanding job in Irish public life.<\/p><p>  The Minister said the last day that he envisages the demise of the Health Service Executive, radical reform and the introduction of universal health insurance.  I share the Minister's goals but would it not be better to put a sunset date on the Health Service Executive, which we are agreed should go?  As approximately half the population has commercial health insurance and more than one third has a medical card, could we speed up the introduction of full coverage for people for health insurance?  I hope that health insurance involves competition because the Milliman report showed that protecting one monopolist as health insurer was not a sensible policy.  There are many issues like extended average length of stay, the lack of scrutiny of claims and so on.  I know the Minister has sent Milliman back into VHI to see how efficiencies can be gained.  I think they will also be gained by having a choice of insurance providers.  <\/p><p>  The Minister and I would probably be in agreement that it is an expensive health service, as the Department of Health's own data shows.  We spend 11.4% of gross national income on health while Finland spends 8.9%, Sweden 9.8%, Switzerland in 11%, Denmark 11.3% and Norway 9.6%.  Colleagues, like Senator Crown, might disagree with the UK system but it is getting a universal health service for 9.6%.  Even Germany, which was mentioned the last day, is a couple of percentage points ahead of us.  We have a very expensive health service which must deliver and that is why I support the Minister in his reforms.  I realise that attempts to reform the health service have been seriously damaging to the political careers of very many Ministers for Health.  I certainly feel a duty that if the Minister is trying to reform the system, he deserves my support.<\/p><p>  One of its faults is that it is excessively bureaucratic.  The number of clerical and administrative staff in 2011 was more than 16,000 while in 1980, it was 5,400.  The total staff in the health service between 1980 and 2011 went up by 87%.  That is against a 195% increase in clerical and administrative posts, that is, 2.24 times.  <\/p><p>  I support the Minister in his reforms.  My amendment is purely a suggestion and I will not push it.  It should be accepted that we implement the reforms the Minister wishes faster.  That is the purpose of the amendment.  I think it is called a &quot;sunset date&quot; in US legislation.  Alfred Kahn, in the context of the Civil Aeronautics Board, said that if one leaves bureaucracies around, one gets function creep and they will invent other things to do.  Is it not better to tell them it is all over on a certain date?  It might not necessarily be the date I have put in the amendment.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000019#S00700","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1349870100,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, I do not agree with the amendment.  The discretion has to be left with the Minister in this matter because we are talking about a major change in abolishing the HSE and setting up the new structure.  The discretion has to be left with the Minister in regard to putting it in place.<\/p><p>I refer to the negativity about the health care sector.  It is interesting to look at the key indicators in regard to health care over the past ten years and I give credit where it is due, including to the previous administration.  The media focuses very much on the negatives in the health care sector but the argument I keep putting to people is in regard to maternity care.  The number of babies born has gone up from 55,000 to 74,000 per annum.  We have one of the lowest perinatal mortality rates in Europe, and long may that continue.  Likewise, outpatient attendance has increased from over 2 million per year.  The Minister disagreed with me the last day and he had a lower figure but I checked my figures.  In 2011, more than 3.5 million people attended outpatient departments.  That works out at approximately 37,000 attending Irish hospitals each working day, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.  That is a huge number.  <\/p><p>There are many positives and the EU survey on health care attitudes in Ireland showed that Ireland has the highest percentage of its population in the EU reporting to have good or very good health.<\/p> <p>That is an indication of the service that is being provided.  There are difficulties in certain areas and there is a need to be far more efficient in respect of the services provided, particularly in trying to eliminate waiting lists.  However, that will take time and we must continue working on it.  We must bring about the changes needed where deficiencies have been identified in the service.  The Minister has done much in the past 18 months.  In fairness to the previous Minister and previous Administrations, much good work was done.  The major issue was the escalation of costs during that period.  Perhaps more should have been done to ensure checks in the system, in particular, where the cost of drugs within the health care sector increased from \u20ac576 million to \u20ac1.9 billion.  That should not have happened and needs to be addressed.  While I agree in principle with Senator Barrett about a timeline, the discretion must be left with the Minister and it is accommodated in section 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000019#S00800","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349870700,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I appreciate Senator Barrett's support and share his sentiment.

My colleague, Senator Marc MacSharry, spokesperson on health, will give the Fianna F\u00e1il position on the Bill as a whole and propose a range of amendments to improve it.  I want to speak to my amendments which seek to ensure greater accountability within the health service for mental health, in particular, and I have proposed a number of amendments from that perspective.<\/p><p>  The amendments as a whole are designed to ensure the Bill puts in place the leadership and accountability structures needed to ensure implementation of A Vision for Change and delivers real improvements in mental health services.  I do not need to tell the Minister that mental health problems have huge social and economic costs.  The social costs are immeasurable on families when people go through mental health problems unsupported.  Even at a time of limited resources and priorities within the health service, we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that there is a huge cost for individuals, employers and the State as a whole.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, we do not have a good history of prioritising mental health services.  They have long been the poor relation of the health service as a whole.  In 2010, just 5.3% of health spending went on mental health compared with 12% in England, 18% in Scotland and 20% or more in other EU member states.  It is clear we are starting from a low base and much progress has been made in recent years, as acknowledged by the previous speaker, but we have a long way to go.  The particular weaknesses have been highlighted by groups such as Mental Health Reform, that our approach to mental health focuses purely on a medical model, that there is limited access to supports other than medication, an over-reliance on inpatient services, inconsistent support across the country and there are large gaps in geographic areas for particular groups, such as children and adolescents.  A Vision for Change set out the roadmap to improve the position and has widespread support from a broad coalition of groups who want it implemented.<\/p><p>  The reason I have tabled the amendments is that A Vision for Change has not moved on and is not where we had hoped it would be at this point.  There have been consistent and widespread concerns about the HSE's lack of accountability for delivering on A Vision for Change.  That has been attributed by Mental Health Reform, in its constituent groups, in large part to the absence of empowered leadership within the HSE and gaps in structures of accountability that lead to a lack of planning and a lack of separate reporting on mental health services.  The Bill presents an opportunity to put in place the structures in A Vision for Change which called for the establishment of a national mental health services directorate and that it would be one of the main drivers of implementation of the policy.  It is not clear from the Bill that will be achieved on the current wording.  It is not specific about who the directors will be.  There are other flaws that I will point out later.  <\/p><p>  I welcome the fact that the section strengthens the Minister's control over the HSE's activities and provides that written directions can be given by the Minister to the HSE &quot;concerning the implementation of any policy or objective of the Minister or the Government which relates to a function of the Executive, where the Minister is of the opinion that the Executive is not having sufficient regard to such policy or objective in the performance of its functions.&quot;  That appears to be an improvement on the current position.  However, I am concerned, as is Mental Health Reform, about the limitation that the Minister can only give a direction on policy implementation where he or she is of the opinion that the Executive is not having sufficient regard to that objective in its performance.  It indicates that the Minister must wait until there is a failure before he or she can give a directive.  We propose an amendment that provides that the Minister shall be empowered to give a direction on policy implementation at any time, without limitation, not waiting for a problem but ensuring that clear directives are given in the first place.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 3 is designed to increase public accountability of the mental health services and the role of the HSE in that respect.  The section, as drafted, increases the HSE's accountability to the Minister for implementation compared with the present position, by saying that the HSE should report to the Minister on its compliance with any ministerial direction.  Clearly that is positive.  We are proposing that to ensure greater public accountability, any such report by the HSE, concerning its compliance with ministerial directives, should be published.  <\/p><p>  In recent days we have witnessed instances of concerns about lack of accountability and an unwillingness on the part of HSE officials to answer questions at parliamentary committees in order that there could be greater public scrutiny, more of which is needed in the current context.  The amendment seeks to ensure there is nothing to hide and that the HSE should be happy to publish reports on compliance and making clear what it have been asked to do by the Minister and whether it is performing its function.  <\/p><p>  They are two simple amendments, the purpose of which is to improve accountability and transparency,<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000020#T00900","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1349870700,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I understand the concern underlying amendment No. 2, that the Minister will not be able to act fast enough or that he or she may have to wait until the HSE has failed to take account of policy before he or she can issue a direction under section 10(1)(<i>c<\/i>).  The provision, as drafted, would not result in this scenario.  Section 10(1)(<i>c<\/i>) balances the Minister's responsibility for policy with the HSE's responsibility for operational matters.  The HSE has responsibility under the Health Act 2004 for the provision of health and personal social services.  However, the HSE also has a statutory obligation to have regard to ministerial and Government policies and objectives when performing its functions.  The HSE, similar to any statutory agency, is expected to fulfil its statutory functions.  Section 10(1)(<i>c<\/i>) should not, therefore, need to be used often but is intended as an additional power for the Minister to use when it is needed.<\/p> <p>The new ministerial power should also be seen in the context of the proposed new accountability arrangement for the HSE whereby the HSE is accountable to the Minister for the performance of its functions.  That means it will have to explain its decisions and actions to the Minister.  This will help in ensuring that the Minister can act in an effective and timely way in regard to issuing a direction under section 10(1)(<i>c<\/i>).  It should help to avert a situation where section 10(1)(<i>c<\/i>) needs to be used.<\/p><p> If the Senator withdraws the amendment, and rather than put it to a vote, I will seek further Parliamentary Counsel advice on the matter.  I do not believe that it will be necessary but I will come back to the matter on Report Stage.  <\/p><p> With regard to amendment No. 2, I am concerned that there could be too many reports on compliance regarding a single direction and their publication could lead to confusion.  An overall picture of service matters would be available from performance reports against the service plan and from the HSE's annual report.

It provides for the HSE to &quot;have regard&quot; to priorities set by the Minister in its annual service plan and could enable the Minister to set a priority to provide the kind of community-based mental health care services that we need.  Undoubtedly, it is a step in the right direction to provide that the Minister can indicate his priorities and expect the HSE to &quot;have regard&quot; to them.  I am concerned that the phraseology of &quot;have regard&quot; is too weak.  Hence, we tabled an amendment to strengthen the provision by saying that the annual service plan must be prepared &quot;in accordance with&quot; the priorities set by the Minister.  Thus, we have inserted an automatic requirement that the priorities set by the Minister are adhered to.  <\/p><p>  Again, the amendment stems from the point of view that mental health services have traditionally been the poor relation in the health service.  When the HSE operates throughout the year there is panic as to whether there is enough money for services such as accident and emergency and other services.  Often mental health services are the first in line to have funding cut.  It is important that the Minister takes responsibility for saying that mental health services should be given priority.  The measure should evolve into an automatic requirement being placed on the HSE to act &quot;in accordance with&quot; that priority.  It would ensure that money is safely ring-fenced for mental health services.  It is not simply that the HSE must &quot;have regard&quot; to it which appears to be quite weak language.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000021#U00900","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1349871300,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I will respond to each of the amendments separately.  I appreciate that the Senators are motivated by a concern to ensure that provisions are sufficiently robust to ensure that the HSE abides by priorities set by the Minister.<\/p><p>  In regard to amendment No. 4, the Bill provides that the Minister may specify priorities to which the HSE must have regard in its service plan.  The HSE must take heed of these priorities when preparing its service plan.  Moreover, the Minister may direct the HSE to amend its service plan if the plan does not have sufficient regard to priorities and performance targets.  I think that provision is sufficient to cover concerns.  <\/p><p>  In regard to amendment No. 21, I understand that the issue is whether particular terms in section 12 are strong enough to ensure that the HSE follows the Minister's directions.  Section 12 amended section 31 of the Health Act 2004 which deals with how the HSE prepares and submits its service plan for the Minister's approval.  Directions under section 31(3) relate to the form and manner in which the service plan is prepared.<\/p><p>  Under section 31(4) a service plan must be prepared in a formal manner that is consistent with any direction under section 31(3).  This seems appropriate wording and, therefore, I do not intend to accept amendments Nos. 4 and 21.  <\/p><p>  The purpose of amendment No. 24 is to delete the reference to policies in section 31(9)(<i>d<\/i>).  The subsection provides that the Minister may, after consulting with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, direct the HSE to amend a draft service plan if, among other gaps, it &quot;does not accord with the policies and objectives&quot; of the two Ministers or the Government.  A deletion of the term &quot;policies&quot; would mean that the subsection would then refer to &quot;objectives&quot; rather than &quot;policies or objectives.&quot;  Both terms are useful and I am also conscious of the term &quot;policy or objective of the Minister or the Government&quot;, a term used consistently elsewhere in the Health Act 2004 and in this Bill.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  <\/p><p>  I shall deal with amendments Nos. 22 and 23.

From the Minister's perspective such terms grant him a safeguard and an ability to blame the officials if something does not go to plan.  My view - and our view - is that the Government of the day should set policies that are in line with the demands and needs of the people in terms of services.  The relevant organisation must carry those out to the letter, not to the extent that the person of the day may feel that it is consistent with, resemble, or be to the fullest extent possible but they must &quot;comply with&quot; them.

The first is to ensure that one of the directors appointed will be a director for mental health.  The second is to address, in the context of the mental health post, the issue Senator Barrett has just raised.  It is bizarre that the Bill specifies that only individuals who are currently national directors in the HSE can be appointed as directors.  There is a significant risk that the best person for the job might not be appointed for that reason.  I do not know anything about the individuals serving as national directors or anything about their performance.  However, it is bizarre to tie the Minister's hands in that way.  The trend in public sector management in recent years has been to ensure there is external competition, particularly for top posts so that we can get the best person for the job.<\/p><p>  Senator Barrett referred to somebody who might have delivered health service change elsewhere.  In particular it would be crazy to exclude someone, who has experience of mental health services, from interviewing for the job.  I do not understand the intention behind such restrictions in the Bill and I ask the Minister to reconsider.  If the best person for the job is somebody who is currently serving as a national director, so be it.  However, the Minister's hands should not be tied in that fashion.  We need to ensure there is a proper competition so that people can have faith that the person appointed holds the expertise and experience required.  This is one of the most important amendments we have tabled and I ask Members on the other side of the House to reflect on the wisdom of tying the Minister's hands and not having a proper open competition for key leadership posts in turning around the health service in general and in particular in the area of mental health, which needs leadership more than most areas in the health sector.

I do not think this gives rise to public confidence.  I am not suggesting the people concerned would not sail through the recruitment process.  However, it is in the public interest that the process is robust and transparent in terms of the appointment of people with the required experience and qualifications.

His delegated functions shall include but are not limited to producing a multi-annual plan to implement the Government&#8217;s mental health policy; consulting with patients, their families and significant others and other stakeholders in relation to a mental health services reform implementation plan; producing annual service plans, approving mental health service area budgets, reporting regularly against performance indicators agreed with the Minister for Health and ensuring equity of resources between Mental Health Catchment Areas.&#8221;.<\/blockquote>This is the most important of our series of amendments in that it seeks to ensure the appointment of a director of mental health and sets out the functions of such person.  It is important these are set out in the Bill.  The Bill as drafted refers to the appointment of between four and seven directors but does not state what will be their functions or responsibilities.  We strongly believe there is a need for a director of mental health.  A key recommendation of A Vision for Change is that a mental health directorate be established.  This must happen.  I do not understand the reason the Minister would not be willing to accept an amendment to the effect that there will be a director for mental health unless he is confident one will not be established.  In legislating for such an appointment, it is important to set out the functions of that person.  As such, the amendment specifies that the director for mental health would be responsible for producing a multi-annual plan to implement the Government's mental health policy, consulting with users of mental health services, their families, significant others and other stakeholders in relation to a mental health reform implementation plan.<\/p><p>  Senator Gilroy has been going around the country consulting with people.  We held a joint meeting two weeks ago to hear the views of the public in terms of their experience and that of their families in the area of mental health services.  I was struck by the gap between what some of the service providers believe is happening and the experiences of people who have been through those services.  It is important that the director would be specifically tasked with ensuring there is ongoing consultation with the users of mental health services and that this feeds into policy being subjected to external scrutiny.  It should not be the case that families in difficulty are treated as customers subjected to an overall plan.  There is a need to really listen to people and to allow change on the basis of proper feedback.<\/p><p>  The other functions set out in the amendment include the need for annual service plans for the mental health sector and a specific budget for mental health services, which is key given the raiding this year of the mental health budget to support other areas of the health service.  It is important there are performance indicators agreed with the Minister in this regard and that information in terms of the plan, where it is at, the budget in place and how it is being spent, outcomes for patients and so on are publicly available.  It is also crucially important to ensure equity of resources between mental health catchment areas, which is a real problem now.<\/p><p>  We strongly believe it is crucial this Bill follows through on A Vision for Change and ensures there will be a person specifically tasked within the directorate with provision of leadership for the mental health sector and that the statutory functions and responsibilities of this person are clearly set out in the Bill so as to ensure real implementation.  That is what we need.  We have a plan for the health services.  There is broad agreement on the fact that A Vision for Change is a good plan.  However, what we do not have is implementation.  I am not convinced there will ever be real implementation unless a person with leadership responsibility is appointed and there is a clear reporting structure on each of the issues outlined.

What has driven it mad is our financial sovereignty being handed over to a troika due to the actions of the previous Government.  Let us call a spade a spade.<\/p><p>  A number of issues arise.  This Bill is an interim measure on the way to the abolition of the HSE.  I refer to an interim structure at the top of the HSE to replace the board.  It is to give a clear line of sight.<\/p><p>  I wonder how many takers one would get for an interim position that certainly will not last any longer than three years and particularly for the salary in question, given that the previous incumbent was on &#8364;320,000 per annum plus a car allowance of &#8364;25,000.  The director-general designate is on &#8364;195,000.  This represents a considerable saving for the taxpayer.<\/p><p>  We are very fortunate to have someone of the calibre of the gentleman concerned agreeing to take the post.  I have absolute confidence in him, the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the new leadership of the VHI.  These represent the three legs of the stool that comprise our health service.  It is terribly important that all three interact in a meaningful, coherent way to address the cost base of the service, which is clearly too high.  This was not addressed heretofore but it is now being addressed.  As the House knows, new arrangements were agreed at the LRC talks by consultants and these will have a major benefit.<\/p><p>  Section 16E provides for the appointment of the director general.  Under subsection (4), the first director general is appointed by the Minister.  This is not something that has not happened before.  Subsequent directors general will be appointed by the Minister following a recruitment process under the <font color=\"#222222\">Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004<\/font>.  There are legislative precedents providing that the first person appointed to a new office be appointed as envisaged under subsection (4).  The use of this provision is the most practical way to advance the new directorate's arrangements.  I do not, therefore, intend to accept the amendments.<\/p><p>  It is important at a time of change that there be some sense of direction and that people have some certainty about who is in charge.  Having the director designate in position to walk into the job achieves this comprehensively.  The people in the HSE now know where the new leadership lies and they are rowing in behind it.

He just appointed somebody whom he knows.  I am sure the person in question is well respected \u2013 I have no doubt about that \u2013 but that is not the point.

I would hope the procedure of going to the High Court would not be invoked.  It has not been up to now under the old Act and this is very similar to that provision.  There is merit to Senator Barrett's point on the <i>sub judice<\/i> rule, which has not been noticed up to now.  Credit is due to the Senator for spotting it and his amendment should be supported.<\/p><p>  I would go further and oppose the entire section which is not good and should be changed.  It should not be left the way it is for the sake of it.  As we saw yesterday, there certainly was disagreement between Members and officials as to what could and could not be discussed.  The Member was not looking for the officials to go into policy.  Although they responded that they were precluded from talking about policy, I do not believe they were being questioned about policy but about the operation of the health budget.<\/p><p>  I disagree with the Senator on Government policy.  It is not the function of public servants to advocate policy one way or another when it has not already been decided.  It is a matter for Ministers and for Oireachtas Members and I would be happy for that to continue.  That would place an intolerable burden on public servants who are supposed to be and are neutral.  They would not want that burden.  The Minister and the Government should be accountable for policy and not public servants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000028#BB00600","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1349874900,"counter":235,"content":"<p>The provision relating to amendment No. 18 is: \"The Director General is not required to give an account before any Oireachtas Committee of any matter relating to the general administration of the Executive that is, or is likely to be, the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal in the State.\"  This is found in much other legislation, as it would be important not to interfere with the integrity of any future court proceedings as well as to protect the integrity of any current court proceedings.  The phrase \"is likely to\" is designed to narrow matters down in the context of possible future proceedings.  The new section 16I(6), as inserted by the Bill, provides for an application to the High Court by the director general or the committee to determine whether the director general is required to give an account to the Oireachtas committee.  This is widespread throughout Departments and State agencies.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 19, the subsection concerned is located in a general section dealing with the attendance of the director general before Oireachtas committees.  It is in that context that the subsection is enacted.  Senators will notice that subsection (9) begins with the words: &quot;In carrying out his or her duties under this section&quot;.  It is not an attempt to prohibit or censor the director general in any way but to delineate the position of the director general when he or she appears before an Oireachtas committee.<\/p><p>If one were to accept the amendment and delete the provision, as proposed by Senator Barrett, an Oireachtas committee would be free to ask the director general about matters of policy and his or her agreement or disagreement with it, and he or she would be obliged to answer.  Matters of policy are properly the domain of Ministers and the Government, as other Senators have pointed out.  It would not be appropriate for a representative of the HSE to comment on policy matters.  To ask a director general such a question would compromise his or her ability to properly serve the elected Government of the day and would also compromise the ability of the Government to have a working relationship with the director general, who has a pivotal role under this legislation in the planning and execution of policy in regard to health matters.  This type of provision is standard in legislation setting up State bodies.<\/p><p>Therefore, I cannot accept these amendments.

It is a pity that the occurrence of \"or is likely to be\" is widespread in legislation.  We are facing a problem when so much public administration has failed.  It gives a defence against answering questions and a considerable amount is wrong.  While I do not have a background in the health service, in the area of economics, during the period we got into trouble, where on earth were highly paid people in the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, and the accountancy and other regulatory bodies who were supposed to be regulating banks?  The Government is introducing whistleblower legislation, but we must assist them so that bodies that have failed cannot use opt-out clauses to stop discussing policy.  We have spent four years trying to find out what on earth the aforementioned bodies were doing in the damage they did for the economy, which also has implications for the health service.  I would hope we would move towards more answering of questions and less closed public administration.  The current system is not serving the country.<\/p><p>It could be said that the public face of Government was easily solved because we had an election, following which one of the Government parties, which had been in power for the best part of 80 years, was reduced from 78 to 20 seats.<\/p> <p>There is concern that the permanent Government remains, is largely exempt from the consequences of failed advice and bad policies, continues to opt-out on the basis of freedom of information defences, does not write anything down lest a journalist might discover it and so on.

I cite the situation in Galway following the appointment last January of Mr. Bill Maher to run Galway University Hospital, Merlin Park Hospital and Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals.  Mr. Maher has ensured a substantial increase in footfall at Roscommon Hospital, with the addition of new facilities and services, including plastic surgery and ruhematology services.  There is also a commitment to build a new colonoscopy unit there.  Furthermore, when Mr. Maher took over there were 9,901 people who, had they not been treated by September, would have been waiting a year or longer for treatment.

Deputy Miche\u00e1l Martin raised the issue of external consultancies providing legitimate tax avoidance for special advisers to the Minister for Health.  Two UK companies are involved but I will not name them as they are doing something which is utterly lawful and allowed.  They provide consultancy services to the Minister for what is effectively the role of a special adviser.  An individual person has been chosen by the Minister to give him advice.  We have always had issues with special advisers, as did the Government when we were in government and we appointed them.<\/p><p>  In this case the special advisers have been based abroad and have established consultancy companies or provide advice through such companies abroad.  This gives them a legitimate tax benefit.  Deputy Martin raised this with the Taoiseach who stated he would speak to the Minister about the issue.  Deputy Martin stated it will add to cynicism and scepticism among the public if this means of procurement and utilisation of consultancies by the Minister and his advisers is allowed to continue.  The practice is unlawful in Ireland and special advisers based here would not be allowed to do it under tax law.  It is a retrograde step.<\/p><p>  I may well withdraw the amendment and return to it on Report Stage.  I accept the amendment may not have the exact effect I intend because some of these advisers are not employees of the HSE but employees of the Minister or the Government.  However, it is an issue worth highlighting because of the tax saving in the order of &#8364;250,000, an amount which would have a significant effect on the budget of many hospitals.  It would pay for a number of home helps or nurses.  The issue should be addressed.  In the D\u00e1il, the Taoiseach replied to Deputy Martin that he would raise the matter with members of the Government, that he did not believe it was acceptable to have consultants involved in work if it had the effect described, that he would certainly raise the issue with the Minister and that he would revert to the Deputy.

Even if they work in Ireland for only a month and are not normally resident here, they must pay the full amount of tax which is deducted at source.

Yesterday 45 people were on trolleys in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  In the past the number has reached above 50 so to say it is the highest is not accurate.<\/p><p>In January last year we had 569 people on trolleys throughout the country and today the number is approximately 230.  Last year it was 330 so it is now 100 fewer.  Let us examine what the special delivery unit has achieved along with the clinical programmes and the front-line staff.  It is fair to say the unit had a very good conversation with those working in the hospital alluded to by Senator Byrne.  It asked what they felt needed to be done and introduced a range of initiatives involving home help, home care and teams to give intravenous antibiotics at home.  More long-term and acute beds were opened and they undertook to conduct a capacity study, which showed a capacity issue had arisen so more beds were opened as a consequence.<\/p> <p>None the less, there is no question that this hospital remains a problem, and there is a need for support for the management there because not alone has it the worst record with regard to patients on trolleys, it also has one of the highest rates of absenteeism.  Let us look at what it has achieved because we do not say it often enough.  There has been an 85% reduction in the number of people waiting a year or longer for an inpatient procedure.  There has been a 63% reduction in the number of people waiting nine months or longer for an inpatient procedure.  There has been an 18% reduction in those waiting three months or longer.  They are real measurable improvements and signs of progress that have come about because of a focus by the special delivery unit, SDU, in conjunction with the clinical programmes and the front line which is doing sterling work.  There has also been a 22% reduction in total in the number of people on trolleys.  That equates to more than 13,400 people who do not have to endure being on trolleys.<\/p><p>We should bear in mind that it was only a year ago in January that 569 people were on trolleys despite billions being spent on the health service.  We are not looking at inputs all the time anymore.  We are looking at outcomes for patients as measured by those who have to wait three months, nine months or a year, or those who have to wait on trolleys or have to be re-admitted.  We are looking at outcomes for patients in terms of the stroke programme, which is now saving one life per week and avoiding three other people having to go into long-term care.  They are Irish citizens, our people, our friends and people in our communities.  They are real.  That is what the SDU has been able to achieve in conjunction with the clinical programmes.<\/p><p>I will mention some of the things that have been done.  For the first time in this country, there is now an accurate figure for outpatient waiting times.  There is an attempt to say they doubled from April to last month when in fact only half the hospitals had been counted in April.  Nearly all of them have been counted and there are only about two more to go.  We reckon the full figure will be 360,000.  That seems like an insurmountable figure but it is not if one thinks that more than 200,000 people are treated every month in outpatient departments.  We are not afraid to have clarity around these matters, identify the problems and address them in conjunction with those in the service.  We will do that.  We had a very good debate in the House a couple of weeks back in respect of this.<\/p><p>In respect of this issue, the SDU has had a remarkable effect on our health service, has brought the focus back to where it should be - on the patient - and, for the first time, has enabled the front line to do the work it wants to do and grow the self-belief again that it can handle this challenge and do what we all want to see done.  This is to have a health service that is equitable and accessible for everyone, not just those who can afford to go privately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000030#DD01400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349876700,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I will withdraw the amendment.

Notwithstanding all the issues I would like to raise with him, including the issue this evening, he has always made himself available to this House.  His record is better than that of any other Minister in that regard.  I thank him for that.<\/p><p>  With regard to the selection of primary care centres, the issue of prioritising the tackling of urban deprivation was unilaterally ignored by the Cabinet, including the Minister.  It is vital that all documentation relevant to the process be made available as a matter of urgency.  There has been a ministerial resignation.  It is not unprecedented but it is certainly a very serious matter considering the reasons former Minister of State, Deputy R\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall, gave for her departure.<\/p><p>  It has been said on our side of the House by many colleagues that the wrong Minister resigned.  While I would have many issues with the Minister and the Minister of State who resigned, I believe it may be easier to shout from the terraces than it is to play on the pitch.  Notwithstanding that, the former Minister of State chose to state her reason for resigning was stroke politics.  At a time when the entire body politic is in very low standing among the public, whatever remedy is available must be employed.  In this context, it is in the interest of the Minister to ensure that any and all documentation, be it so-called commercially sensitive documentation or otherwise on lease agreements that may have been entered into after the granting of planning permission, be made available to the public.<\/p><p>  The never-ending and ever-changing story of the primary care centre of Balbriggan, in particular, is extremely worrying.  To many objective observers, it appears that the Minister looked after his own constituency when the opportunity presented itself.  I refer to the original site being deemed inappropriate, the HSE moving on and the further expressions of interest, after which a site was chosen.  All of this occurred on the Minister's watch.  He wrote to Balbriggan Town Council to state there was an agreement for a site and a purchase price in principle.  That was in July, I am told.  Clearly, the Minister was aware that the site was agreed in principle and that the price was effectively agreed.  The site happened to be associated with a long-term activist and supporter of the Fine Gael Party.<\/p><p>  With that in mind, it is essential that we get to the bottom of this issue.  As I said, it appears as if the Minister were looking after his own constituency.  He looked after Roscommon because Deputy Frank Feighan took the hit that Deputy Denis Naughten was not prepared to take.  The Minister for Health's ministerial colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, has not been able to deny that he lobbied explicitly for a primary care centre to be put in his area.  The reality is that the preannouncement weighting of all of the locations was not consistent with their having been placed in the top 35.  That is a concern of the people.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, called it stroke politics and based her reason for withdrawal very specifically on that issue.<\/p><p>  I cannot help but notice the absence of a number of Labour Party Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000032#FF00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1349877000,"counter":290,"content":"<p>There are three of us present in the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000032#FF00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1349877000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>There are actually more present that there are Fianna F\u00e1il Senators.

I am sure he is wondering when the announcement will be made by the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  The Labour Party Whip, party leader and spokesperson on health are present but they have to be here.  One wonders, however, about their colleagues who have, quite rightly, raised some of these issues in the past.<\/p><p>The aforementioned sideshow is occurring against the backdrop of a floundering health service.  There are many isolated issues to celebrate.  Some have been pointed out.  Earlier, Senator Burke pointed to some developments that are going well.  Of course, there are many people working extremely hard and giving very good care to people throughout the country.<\/p> <p> There are many isolated issues to celebrate.  The Minister has mentioned them.  Senator Burke referred to a number of aspects that were going well.  Many people are working hard to provide good care throughout the country.  However, there is a major issue with cost overruns, the health service's general management and front line cuts.  It has been proposed to cut home help hours again.  Combined with previous cuts, this amounts to 1 million hours.  The HSE will not be in a position to assess each individual case for cutbacks between now and Christmas.<\/p><p>Promises were made.  As the Minister is aware, I am on record accusing him of running a deeply cynical campaign from the Opposition benches.  He made a series of promises to buy the general election based on a bottom line that he knew could not support the level of expenditure demanded.  Promises were made in Ennis and Roscommon, there was going to be a centre of excellence in Sligo and cancer services were to be returned within 100 hundred days, a promise on which the current Minister of State, Deputy Perry, pontificated.  All of them have been welched upon and the Minister has claimed that he did not realise that the cupboard was bare.  He met the troika before the election was called and knew that the cupboard would not allow him to fulfil promises of that nature.  As I have stated on previous Private Members' motions on health, that was irresponsible.<\/p><p>Yesterday, the director general designate of the HSE and the Secretary General of the Department attended the Committee of Public Accounts and were able to clarify that what was a deficit of \u20ac329 million had increased to \u20ac374 million.  With the deficit increasing by \u20ac45 million per month, people can legitimately ask whether the Government can continue.  Never mind the sideshow of a Minister of State resigning because she has no confidence in her senior Minister, whom she accused of stroke politics and who is clearly looking after his buddies in the Cabinet and his party.  Examples include the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, in the case of Kilkenny, and Deputy Feighan in Roscommon, who took a bullet on Roscommon hospital that Deputy Naughten was not prepared to take.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, is also looking after his own constituency.  Conveniently enough and as luck would have it, the person who owns the site happens to be a member and supporter of the party.  I am not saying that there is anything wrong with that.  Ireland is a small country and it is possible to trace a political lineage to everyone.  Someone somewhere has had a first cousin who has canvassed for someone else in some party at some time.  However and as the former Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, pointed out, this explanation does not account for the agreed and clear criterion of deprivation being unilaterally ignored.<\/p><p>We were told that the Minister consulted his Cabinet colleagues and took advice from HSE officials, but the HSE's director general designate clearly stated yesterday that he was not in a position to confirm that the HSE had anything to do with the site's selection.  The children's hospital is due to be built in the constituency of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  I wonder whether that had anything to do with his support for the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  On &quot;The Week in Politics&quot;, he stated that what had happened looked like stroke politics.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and others expressed doubts.<\/p><p>Many of the Labour and Fine Gael Senators who have expressed concerns about, for example, the home help cutbacks and the cost overruns are absent.  The overruns were advised by Mr. Cathal Magee as far back as March or April, given the budget set out by the Minister.  That budget was dishonest because it was not achievable as far as Mr. Magee was concerned, but he was shipped out of his HSE offices and someone new who was prepared to take over was slipped in.  The hospital overruns were predicted by me and many others almost one year ago.  Some \u20ac124 million was to be saved on drugs and \u20ac74 million on the charging for the use of private beds.  None of these savings was achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000032#FF01100","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349877600,"counter":299,"content":"<p>The Senator has less than one minute remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000033#GG00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1349877600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>The Minister is trying to defend himself against a growing pool of opposition, possibly within Fine Gael but certainly among some Labour members of the coalition, as evidenced by Deputy Shortall.

We have a right in opposition to ask the questions to which the people are seeking answers.<\/p><p>Politics is about the art of the possible.  Primary care was a fundamental pillar of the programme for Government's health sphere.  I agree that the development of primary care is essential if we are to remove the logjam in hospitals.  However, this is an issue of how we achieve that and how we select centres, particularly where public private partnerships are involved.  Regardless of what happened previously, politics must be renewed.<\/p><p>Another fundamental plank of the programme for Government was a renewed transparency in public office, in the Government and in the Oireachtas, but none of that has come about.  This is just one glaring example.  In February 2012, the criteria for the selection of primary care centres were agreed between the Minister, the then Minister of State and departmental officials.  Subsequently, 15 centres were added to the list.  Senator MacSharry has covered most of this aspect of the motion, but how were additional sites added?<\/p> <p>This shades the political process and demonstrates political interference in a system where criteria had been agreed by officials overseen by Ministers.  If the process and criteria were objective and acceptable internationally, as I understand they were, why was there need for political interference to decide that centres like Balbriggan, which was way down the list of 200 primary care centres, would be selected ahead of Dundalk, which was 21st on the list?  The public is asking these questions and although there may be answers during this debate, there has been a glaring omission in providing an answer to those questions.<\/p><p>We all know what happened in Roscommon before the election, when a commitment was given that the hospital would be kept open, but we know what has happened since.  There is also the issue of the delivery of two primary care centres in Roscommon.  Why close a hospital and then invest money in primary care centres?  If all the services available at Roscommon hospital had been kept intact, there would be no need to provide primary centres.  There are hundreds of thousands of empty buildings throughout the country and we do not need new buildings in the current climate.

If the Labour Party wants new buildings when thousands of empty buildings are available, I cannot see the logic in it.  We should look at refurbishment rather than new buildings.<\/p><p>The second part of the motion relates to the cuts in home care packages and home help.  The programme for Government indicated that additional funding would be provided each year for the care of older people, with the funding going to more residential places, home care packages and the delivery of more home help and other professional community care services.  With cuts of \u20ac8 million in home help between now and the end of the year, there will be 1 million fewer home help hours, which will force elderly people out of their homes and into public or private nursing units.<\/p><p>Has the Minister or the HSE the capacity between now and Christmas to assess individually all 11 million hours of home help?  How can the Minister state that the assessment process is based on a review of individual needs, which is what is being said locally, when the outcome has been determined?  The cuts have been put in place.  How can the HSE be sure that cuts to home help hours will not just mean more people will have to avail of full-time care in a hospital setting, which is inevitable?<\/p><p>We are in a time when individuals are being refused a carer's allowance to look after disabled, elderly and vulnerable people.

He has had a long evening here and we appreciate the time given to this matter.  The amendment clearly sets out support for the Minister in the work he is doing.  It is important for us to consider the overall goal of what we are trying to achieve in reforming the health service.  The last part of the amendment states that the Seanad: &quot;welcomes the Minister and Government&#8217;s determination to move towards a health system that provides access based on need rather than income, underpinned by a strengthened primary care sector, a restructured hospital sector and a more transparent &quot;money follows the patient&quot; system of funding that will be supported ultimately by universal health insurance&quot;.<\/p><p>  We made it quite clear when we came into Government that the introduction of universal health care would take a number of years, and there is a process that must be gone through in implementing it.  There is a step-by-step approach, with one such step being primary care units.  On 17 July, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, announced an infrastructure package of &#8364;2.25 billion, with &#8364;115 million allocated to two bundles of primary care.  Initially, the idea was for 20 primary care units identified that could be developed, and another 15 were added.  I wonder how the other side of the House would have reacted if the Minister announced today that there would not be an additional 15 units?  How would the people who will benefit from the additional 15 units feel towards the Opposition if they were suddenly withdrawn?  That seems to what the Opposition wants but the Minister is not prepared to do it.  He wants to use the money and the opportunity available to him to develop primary care units in the maximum number of areas in the fastest possible time.<\/p><p>  The criteria are quite clearly set out, with a number of issues taken into account.  For example, elements include the deprivation index, the service priority identified by each integrated service area, the accommodation assessment and staff surveys.  Additional criteria include competition, GP co-operation and the population being served by general practitioners.  Pressure on services, particularly acute services, have been taken into account, as well as funding options such as Exchequer funding, builder lease and implementing public private partnerships.  All these elements have been taken into account when the Minister has considered primary care.<\/p><p>  My colleague across the House asked why we do not examine the potential use of unoccupied buildings.  In constructing a health care centre, certain standards must be reached, and not every building can be adapted to cater for health care.  In many cases it is probably cheaper to construct a brand new building than adapt an existing building.  We must consider such issues.  We have identified 35 areas where primary care units can go ahead, but we must go through a process, and they will not suddenly appear overnight.  The locations have been identified but the type of building required, for example, must be determined.  We must make progress.<\/p><p>  On Monday there was a letter in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i> arguing that there has not been a health care sector in Ireland for decades.  We now appear to have gone down the road of hysteria, with people convinced there is no health care sector in place.  I can give out figures repeatedly.  In fairness to previous Ministers, much development has taken place in the health care sector over the past ten, 15 or 20 years, although we could have done more.  We must get on with the process at this stage.  The fear being put into people's minds is a concern because people are very worried.<\/p> <p>I had a group of people in the House today who raised a number of issues on health care and they did so as a result of the amount of media attention these issues have been given and because the problems have been over-exaggerated.  <\/p><p>I will cite some examples I gave earlier.  In regard to maternity care, the number of deliveries a year has increased from 55,000 to 74,000.  We have the lowest perinatal mortality rate.  Outpatient attendances have increased from 2 million to 3.5 million.  Some 31,700 people per working day attend for outpatient consultation, even at a time when money is scarce the number of people with medical cards has increased from 1.146 million to 1.8 million.  Some 130,000 people have a GP-only card.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000034#HH00800","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349878800,"counter":319,"content":"<p>That has to do with unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000035#JJ00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1349878800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>The Government is being criticised for not doing enough in health care.

I am not a party member.  I was a fairly vocal critic of aspects of policy of the outgoing Government.  Since coming into this House I have worked very closely with members of the dominant party in the previous Government and have forged good working, personal and professional relationships with them and I am glad we were able to advance a number of issues related to health care and other aspects.  I look forward to working with Senator White on important legislation relating to retirement age.  I have been privileged to work with Senator Daly on our anti-smoking legislation and with Senator MacSharry on legislation seeking increased clarity, transparency and consistency in the approval of cancer and other high-tech drugs.<\/p><p>However, on this occasion I will not be supporting this motion and I hope there will be an understanding of my position on this.  While there is a need for clarity on the decision-making process that went into the primary care centres, the wording of this motion is unduly critical, censorious and makes certain assumptions about the process which are not as yet borne out by facts in the public domain.  As such, I cannot support the contention that the Government unilaterally ignored well-established criteria.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's exposition in the House today as to exactly what those criteria were.<\/p><p>There is something else I want to say and it is a very instructive illustration of how the process of politics works.  I must admit that on a personal level I am far less cynical about the politicians who occupy these two Houses than I was before I became a Member of this House.  I am, if anything, more cynical about the process of politics.  The systems which have been put in place have enforced certain behaviours, namely, that of flip-flopping.  When people are in opposition they will oppose cutbacks, when they are in government they will enforce cutbacks and when they are back in opposition they will oppose them again.  Patronage will be dispensed by parties in power and it will be opposed by those in opposition until they are back in power when they will again dispense it.  In our political system where in truth - do not take this personal, guys and girls - there is very little between the parties ideologically or in terms of convictions, matters such as patronage become issues.  There is inevitably built into the reality of the system a certain amount of playing of politics and parochialism.  One can understand how Roscommon hospital which lost its 24-hour access might feel there was a gap in terms of pre-existing medical care which needed to be plugged and that a primary care centre would legitimately provide some of the coverage for that.  I look forward to hearing what has to be said about this.  <\/p><p>I like giving the Minister a little back stiffener every time he comes into the House and I want to give him another one now because his reform programme is one that I support.  To give Members a quick picture of the vision, some people see things and ask why and some see the others and ask why not.  Let us look at the &quot;why not&quot; argument.  Let us imagine a system where everybody has a single negotiable insurance instrument which may be provided by a private insurance company or by the State, one which is based on a fixed percentage of one's income where richer people subsidise the poorer people but at the end of the process everybody has a solitary instrument, a card, a computer chip or whatever, which gives them the same rights of access to the same health systems without any fear or favour, that they can go to any institution they wish and take part in the same waiting process and, hopefully, they will not be waiting in such a system.  Some of the hospitals and doctors they elect to go to might be employees of the State, employees of the universities or other not-for-profit private entities.  Some may be completely private practitioners.  There will be sufficient policing in place to make sure that there was no cherry-picking or price gouging, that there was not supplier-induced demand, as we call it in health economics, where doctors prescribe unnecessary procedures in order to increase their throughput and line their own pockets.  It is a system which has complete empowerment of the patient at its core.  The patient chooses where he or she goes.  It is not chosen by some nameless bureaucrat.  It is a system which involves tackling the greatest vested interest in our health system now, which is one that never gets mentioned, which is the permanent government, the bureaucracy, the Civil Service and the HSE, a group which needs to be challenged.  It is a system which would put in place patient-derived forces which would have the effect of enforcing responsible behaviours on doctors, which would open the market by employing more doctors and which would end waiting lists because people do not get paid until they do what they say they will do.  They do not get paid for being merely in a job; they get paid for producing.  <\/p><p>This is the vision that we need put in front the Minister.  I will support him on his journey to it.  I am very keen that he will try to accelerate that move, that implementation.  I am sure there would be goodwill all around the House for that.  I see a number of other issues which arise on the way to that nirvana as being perhaps more in the nature of distractions than true progress.  We are hoping that the Minister will accelerate this process and move quickly because this is not some vague goal we should think about in a second term of office.  This is something we need to acknowledge, as is what we need to do to fix the system.  Palliative administrative and bureaucratic band-aids over the system we have now will not fix the fundamental problems which are inequity, poor quality and inefficiency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000035#JJ00400","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1349878800,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.

However, the blatant and undisguised party politicisation of the debate is to be regretted, and I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach will agree with that.  <\/p><p>I am certain our colleagues on the other side of the House will agree with me when I say that the provision of primary care and primacy care infrastructure is one of the more important elements of reform that we can achieve in this term of Government.<\/p> <p>We will resist the temptation to point out that the current dysfunctional condition of the health service is a legacy of mismanagement of the system by the previous Administration that we inherited.  We saw in yesterday's histrionic behaviour at the Committee of Public Accounts that evidence of this dysfunction remains.  It appears that the need to score party political points outweighs the requirement for calm and measured debate.  Undoubtedly there is a level of frustration with the manner in which certain elements of health care is provided in this country but it can hardly be addressed by stagecraft or amateur dramatics, either in this House or elsewhere.<\/p><p>Health care has been prioritised in the programme for Government and funding has been allocated for the provision of this vital infrastructure.  This will not only go a long way towards addressing the existing inadequacies in the provision of primary health care but will also act as a stimulus to the wider economy through the provision of much-needed employment in the construction phase of such developments.  The motion before the House appears to be an amalgamation of everything.  It was obviously put together by a committee in an attempt to score as many political points as possible.  In its thoroughness it forgets that the problems highlighted in the motion can be attributed to and traced directly back to the failures of the previous Government.  It will be supported and voted for by Members of this House who, probably out of a sense of embarrassment or decency, have decided not to turn up for this debate.<\/p><p>In light of this, the Government amendment is reasonable and can be supported by all Members of the House, including those on the Opposition side.  The delivery of primary care in an integrated fashion is a major step forward and in the current constrained economy represents an ambitious but deliverable project.  It is regrettable that this work was not undertaken when there were ample funds available.  The funding available for it now is something of which the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform can be proud and they can take some measure of satisfaction in its delivery.<\/p><p>The delivery of health care in a timely fashion based on need and delivered as close to home as possible at the level of least complexity can be achieved.  This underpins the strategy of health care delivery in this country.  Public private partnerships have worked well in the past, particularly in the delivery of vital infrastructure, such as roads.  We have seen this in some of the projects delivered under the previous Administration, to be fair.  For too long, however, we have spoken about health service reform.  We all agree that the previous Government's effort in this direction through the establishment of the HSE represented an honest but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to grapple with the problem.  The legislation before the House seeks to deliver the most fundamental reform of the service since 2004 and will probably go a long way towards addressing many of the legacy issues in that regard.  This Government has moved very quickly and the Minister is to be commended on that.<\/p><p>In supporting the Government's amendment we can all look forward to the day in the not too distant future, when the people of Ireland will have the health service they need and demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000035#JJ01300","speaker":"1117","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349879400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>F\u00e1ilt\u00edm roimh an Aire.

I note that part of the Government amendment &quot;commends the Minister for Health for managing within this difficult environment, and at the same time achieving cost reductions within the health sector which are impressive by international standards, particularly within the hospital sector&quot;.  I take it from that wording that Fine Gael and the Labour Party are voting confidence in the Minister.  Obviously, we will not be supporting the amendment.  However, it is quite interesting, particularly coming from the Labour Party Senators.  It appears to be very much at odds with statements from other party members.  I might refer to them later.<\/p><p>I welcome the Fianna F\u00e1il motion, which we will support.  There are two primary issues in this debate.  The first is the manner in which the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, has conducted himself.  We believe he has not explained in a credible way his decision to promote two towns in his constituency to higher places on the list.  The effect of this was to allow these two areas to have a status that means they will now have primary care centres.  The logic formally given for the Minister's promotion of these two sites appears to be of Einstein-like complexity, notwithstanding the fact that we would not begrudge a primary care centre for any area that needs one.  We believe the Minister persistently misled the House about his business connections with Seamus Murphy and the consultations he had with senior Labour Party Ministers about expanding the number of health care centres.  He is dodging questions and failing to answer them clearly.  I hope he takes this opportunity to answer them.<\/p><p>There is a certain sense of arrogance and bluster, which has only increased public suspicion that the reasoning was purely cynical and self serving.  The Minister's insistence that there exists a logistical logarithmic progression is meaningless and needs explanation.  Quite honestly, the dogs on the street and particularly the people who use the health services really do not believe the answer being put forward by the Government on this issue.  The Minister and the rest of the Government must come clean about the basis for adding these 15 centres.  That should be a very straightforward operation.  The support of the Labour Party for the Minister over its own Minister of State with responsibility for primary health care is another let down for voters.  Deputy Eamon Gilmore and the Labour Party have backed the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, throughout all of this and the Labour Party must take responsibility for its part in the Government too.<\/p><p>The second issue is the real reason the Minister should resign, namely, we believe he is doing a very bad job.  The Fine Gael and Labour Party coalition has been running the public health services into the ground.  The people look to their leaders to do the right thing, but Fine Gael has failed the people on this and has failed to legislate to reform the health service.  We all know these are tough times and that tough decisions must be made, but this is a question of choices.  Where is the legislation required to cut consultants' pay and to recoup moneys from private health insurers?<\/p><p>The recent controversy was sparked by cuts of \u20ac130 million announced by the HSE.  This was in addition to \u20ac750 million taken out of the health budget in 2012, which itself followed a \u20ac1 billion cut in 2011.  Recent Social Justice Ireland reports point out that during this time the income of our wealthiest citizens increased and billions of euro were handed over to bad banks.  We do not see the Government tackling those groups of people.  It appears that this Government will always take the easy option of cutting the services for the vulnerable.<\/p><p>Another issue has been glossed over in this debate.  We are talking about building primary care centres, but what about the staffing of those centres?  I can offer an example from Spiddal in County Galway.  Spiddal has had a primary care centre for a number of years but it has never been fully staffed.  It has never had the full complement of occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and other services.  There is the issue of building primary care centres but there is also the issue of staffing them.  This debate is taking away from the fact that while primary care centres might be built in cahoots with private enterprises, those centres must be staffed to ensure the people who need the services will get them.<\/p><p>Recent Government policies could put lives at risk in the interests of the profits of private insurance companies who provide care for money.  We oppose the Government's amendment as we believe it ignores the reality of the health system.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael said they would lift the ban on ongoing recruitment.  They have not done so and are therefore forced to pay for more overtime and additional agency staff.  Those extra costs mean that cuts in front-line services are inevitable.  I saw that last week with the closure of a day centre in Carraroe.  We were told that because agency staff could not be brought in and extra staff had been taken out of the public system to be put into Owenriff Nursing Home in Oughterard, which fell foul of a Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report, there were not enough staff to keep the public service open last week.  One cannot pull \u20ac1.7 billion out of the health service and expect front-line services not to be affected.  That is fairytale politics and economics.  Citizens deserve better and more honest policies.<\/p><p>We have tabled an amendment to make the motion more sensible.  It is our position that Fianna F\u00e1il's motion makes no sense or is at least incomplete.  Its statement that cuts should be made elsewhere is vague.  Where does that party think the cuts should be made?  Is it in education or rural transport?<\/p> <p>The point is the failing health system is a symptom of a failing economic policy, which means that policy needs changing.  That was backed up yesterday by the IMF annual report, which stated that austerity is not working.  However, the present Government and its predecessor had their heads in the sand in that regard.  They do not want to read this and do not even want to admit it.  The confidence of the people in the health care system has been limited in any case and for good reason.  The actions of the Government and the air of stroke politics arising from the Minister's recent decision have made this worse.  As Phil Prendergast, MEP, has stated, this is the sort of politics that has brought us to ruin.  The people are losing faith in their Government to do the right thing.  Are Nessa Childers, MEP, Phil Prendergast, MEP, and others in a different Labour Party?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000036#KK00200","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349880000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>The Senator's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000037#LL00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1349880000,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I have not heard any Labour Party Members tonight expressing full confidence in the Minister.

The central objective of the Government's reform programme is to deliver a fair, efficient, single-tier health service supported by a strong primary care system and underpinned by universal health insurance.  The latter will mean people are treated on their need; not what they can afford.  The programme for Government sets out a clear pathway for the future development and strengthening of the services, notwithstanding the enormous financial challenges the Government inherited.  Despite the challenges posed by reducing resources, it has already made significant advances in improving services and delivering on the commitments it made in the programme for Government.  I will provide examples to give Members a flavour of how much things are changing.  Earlier today, I stated there had been an improvement of 22% in the number of people who are obliged to wait on trolleys.  I have just received the latest figures, which indicate a reduction of 23.8%.  This is real and measurable and the people concerned are real.<\/p><p>I acknowledge there are still too many people lying on trolleys and we must and will do more.  I mentioned earlier the reduction, from an all-time high of 569 patients on trolleys only last year in January 2011 to a figure of 139 on 7 September 2012, which is a 75% reduction.  Overall surgical waiting list numbers have decreased in the last year by 7%, while each time band has seen a substantial reduction with those waiting more than 12 months down by 85%, those waiting over nine months down by 63% and those waiting more than three months down by 18%.  In addition, I note there are 800 fewer children on waiting lists.  There has been the establishment for the first time of a national office of clinical audit, NOCA, for surgery, critical care and orthopaedics.  For the first time, the country now has 24 hour a day, seven days a week thrombolysis coverage, which means that all hospitals that receive stroke patients and treat them have a stroke unit.  The statistics currently available indicate this is saving one life a week, as well as saving three other citizens from entering long-term care.<\/p><p>The average length of stay has reduced from 8.7 days to 7.9 days.  The rate of readmission from heart failure has been reduced from 27% to 6.3%.  A national education programme for asthma is now operational in primary and secondary care.  Four 24 hour a day, seven days a week percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, centres are in place to enable the percutaneous insertion of stents for acute heart attacks.  This development is real and now means that someone who experiences a coronary occlusion - who previously would have had a heart attack and died - can be saved.  Not alone can such a person be saved but instead of being a cardiac cripple lying in a bed for eight weeks, he or she will leave hospital after 48 hours.  These are real achievements that affect the lives of citizens.<\/p><p>In the area of mental health, three significant programmes are being designed in areas such as self-harm and eating disorders.  Moreover, an integrated care model for diabetes and other chronic diseases is being put in place.  In emergency medicine, all 28 continuous improvement implementation teams are in place.  Moreover, 30% more patients are being seen in dermatology and rheumatology clinics and national audiology screening of 99% of children within four weeks of birth is in place.  There is much more, including the productive theatre initiative, the money-follows-the-patient initiatives, the change such clinical programmes have brought and the money this has saved in respect of bed-days saved.  The savings amount to 70,000 bed-days, or \u20ac63 million, and there will be more this year.  As part of the reform programme the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2012 has been published and was debated in this Chamber earlier today.  This provides for the abolition of the  Health Service Executive, HSE, board and its replacement with a new directorate and governance structures.  A director general-designate has been appointed and already is taking action to change and reform the system.<\/p><p>The Government's primary care strategy is one of the key pillars of the reform programme in health.  The key objective of this strategy is to develop services in the community that will give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and other health care disciplines.  A modern, well-equipped primary care infrastructure is central to the effective functioning of primary care teams.  The infrastructure development, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multidisciplinary primary health care and represents a tangible re-focusing of the health service to deliver care in the most appropriate and lowest cost setting.  It is the intention of Government to develop as many centres as possible by one of three separate methods, namely, direct investment, that is, Exchequer-funded HSE construction, by way of leasing arrangements and through public private partnerships.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, announced the Government's \u20ac2.25 billion infrastructure stimulus package on 17 July.  This will provide investment in a range of important new projects.  The infrastructure stimulus package announced by the Government involved projects that would meet key infrastructural needs in line with the priorities identified in the Government's investment framework.  They would form the first phase of a new programme of public private partnerships, PPPs, designed to stimulate economic growth and create employment.  A total of 35 potential locations for primary care centres have been published.  Of these, approximately 20 will be commissioned subject to agreement between the local GPs and the HSE on active local GP involvement in the centres - because otherwise one merely would be building empty palaces - and site suitability and availability.  It is envisaged the locations will be offered to the market in two separate bundles.  The current position is that the HSE is engaging with the National Development Finance Agency as required to progress the primary care centre public private partnership programme.  The HSE is currently analysing the available sites in each location and engaging with the GPs in each location to determine their interest in participating in the primary care centre development.<\/p><p>I believe it is important to report on the progress achieved to date in the area of primary care.  In order to achieve savings in health spending while also reforming and improving the health service, it is imperative that we develop new models of care.  Primary care should be able to meet 90% to 95% of people's health needs and through modern and strengthened primary care, we can achieve much better health outcomes and much better value for money.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, in ensuring we achieve this.  In January, the universal primary care project, UPC, team was established to drive the implementation of the primary care reform.  The projects overseen by the UPC team include policy, planning, costing and legislative preparation for the extension of free GP care and the preparation of legislation for this key reform is at an advanced stage.  It also oversees the development of implementation plans for chronic disease management in primary care and preparation for a new GP contract to reflect the programme for Government commitments to universal free GP care and intensive chronic disease management.  All this change, however, must take place in the context of a very difficult budgetary environment.<\/p><p>The HSE budget has been reduced by \u20ac2.5 billion over the last three years.  The number of health service staff has fallen from a peak of 111,000 in 2007 to fewer than 103,000 now.  As all Members are aware, the country still faces serious challenges in respect of the public finances.  Further measures to address the deficit were submitted to the troika in July including accelerated cash collection from private insurance income, use of capital funding for revenue on a once-off basis, savings in 2012 from agreement with the pharmaceutical industry, additional once-off funding arising from an agreement with the Medical Defence Union and once-off transfers of funding from the Department's Vote.<\/p> <p> Proposals for the achievement of additional savings of &#8364;130 million were announced by the HSE in August.  Almost 50% of the savings are to be achieved from more focused cash and stock management initiatives, savings in medical equipment - non-capital, furniture, education, training, office expenses, travel and subsistence and advertising.  The remaining 50% will be achieved through efficiencies in disability services, home help hours, home care packages, agency and overtime payments.<\/p><p> As Senators are aware, Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  The demand for home supports will increase in the light of changing demographics, needs and wider system pressures.  This has obviously been a challenging year for the health services overall, including maintaining services in line with evolving resource pressures.  Decisions in regard to the provision of home help hours will continue to be based on a review of individual needs, and no current recipient of the service who has an assessed need for this will be left without a service.<\/p><p> Ongoing reductions are being applied to HSE-funded disability services generally as part of the general Estimates reductions, with savings generated focusing mostly on consolidation and rationalisation of back office costs to protect front-line service delivery as much as possible.  The HSE is continuing to examine options for savings from other sources to limit further the impact on front-line services.<\/p><p> In addition to undertaking measures to address the immediate position, the Department has been undertaking strategic measures to address the ongoing financial issues in the HSE.  A review of the financial management systems in the Health Service Executive was commissioned in May.  The review team came up with a number of recommendations to improve the financial management process within the HSE, and PA Consulting was engaged to draw up urgent measures to be put in place in regard to the HSE's financial management and processes having regard to the findings and recommendations of this review.  It was also requested to stress test the HSE's July cost containment plans, analyse the effects of the plans on scheduled and unscheduled care and identify potential structural cost savings in the acute hospital sector.  The consultants' report is due to be submitted to my Department shortly.<\/p><p> I would like to address some of the issues raised and comments made.  Senator MacSharry spoke about me being downright irresponsible.  I have to put it to him that there could be no greater example of downright irresponsibility than the throwing away of our financial sovereignty.  The only stroke here is from the masters of strokes themselves who want to spin a good yarn to distract from the real issue which is the mess left by the previous Government which we must clean up, and in health, that mess is as big as anywhere.<\/p><p> There is also a contention that we have the same captain and we are just moving deckchairs on the <i>Titanic<\/i>.  We have already had a long discussion in the House about a new director designate for the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000037#LL00400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349880600,"counter":338,"content":"<p>He is the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000038#MM00200","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1349880600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>There is a new Secretary General in the Department of Health and a new chief executive officer and a new chairman in the VHI.  Things have changed greatly, and will continue to change.  I said previously that as we reach that point where the <i>status quo<\/i> is really changing, the noise and din from those who are comfortable with that <i>status quo<\/i>, which does not put patients first, will grow to a deafening din, but so be it.  We are committed and we are going to do it.  There is no turning back for me or for my Government.<\/p><p>  Roscommon hospital was mentioned and it was said that if it had not been closed, there would be no need for primary care centres.  I would say to Senator \u00d3 Domhnaill that that is to totally misunderstand what health reform is about.  It is about moving patient care to the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as close to home as possible.  Clearly, there is a deficit in primary care in the Roscommon area which has to be addressed, and all the more acutely because of the fact the accident and emergency department in Roscommon hospital no longer functions as it did.  We have had that debate before and we know that the service there was not safe, as determined by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  I am pleased to report an ever-increasing footfall in Roscommon hospital in terms of new facilities and new services, including plastic surgery and rheumatology to mention but two.  Bill Maher continues to focus on moving more stuff from the bigger hospitals to the smaller ones, which is as it should be, and, indeed, from the hospitals back to the community in primary care.<\/p><p>  As I said, the home help reduction should not result in anyone losing out.  No one who is assessed as needing a service will be left without one.  As I said, I very much look forward to working with the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, in regard to primary care and to continuing my work with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in regard to mental health, disability and older people.<\/p><p>  Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh has abused his privilege in this House by suggesting that I have any business relationship with Mr. Seamus Murphy.  I do not and I have said that outside the House and inside it.  I challenge Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh to repeat that outside the House and to deal with the consequences.  When he talks about credibility, I find it difficult to stomach it given that his party leader still tries to tell us he was never a member of the IRA.  However, what I found even more disturbing was the shroud-waving engaged in by his party in February.  Pregnant women expecting the joy of a new child were told by his party spokesman that they would not have a safe service and cancer patients were told they would not be able to get their drugs.  The case proved to be utterly false and not only did we maintain a safe service but, as I outlined, we have improved it in so many ways.<\/p><p>  There is much more to be done; I do not deny it.  I remain as committed as ever to doing that.  I remain more determined than ever to make it happen but, mostly, I am more convinced than ever that we will achieve it because of the excellence of the people working in the health service and the new leadership that is emerging, both clinically and managerially.  I commend the amendment to the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000038#MM00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1349880600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister but I regret that no officials from the HSE or his Department are here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000038#MM00400","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1349880600,"counter":341,"content":"<p>He does not need them.

The 35 primary care centres identified by the Minister, and more, will be built in the lifetime of the Government.  In recent weeks the Minister is more determined than ever to deliver on primary care and he has a good Minister of State to ensure that will happen.  I can assure the House the delegation orders are signed and that the Minister of State will deliver on primary care.  Primary care is extremely important.  It is a pity it is politicised to the degree it has been in recent weeks.  It is a political issue but it is not a party political football.  We have had enough of that from all sides of the House in the past 15 to 20 years.  The health service was gradually dismantled in the past ten to 15 years and has to be rebuilt.

We have had to legislate to bring that back to ensure that accountability lies with the Minister.  That has been achieved in the legislation.  In fairness to the other side of the House, some interesting amendments were proposed to the Bill which the Minister will take into consideration.  It must be acknowledged that he was fair and reasonable in the parliamentary discourse that took place today.<\/p><p>In general, there is much positivity in health.  Primary health care will be the big ball issue in the coming years that will be delivered but a number of other deliveries are also taking place.  The bones of \u20ac2 billion has been taken out of the health service and there has been improved delivery.  Waiting lists are being reduced.

We should not disregard the newspaper headlines that people in receipt of disability or home care packages will lose them.  The media has dragged politics into disrepute and the situation is getting worse by the week.  The media tries to entertain the public who are already cynical about the Seanad and the D\u00e1il but politicians are being labelled as lazy.<\/p><p>  I feel honoured and privileged to be a public servant.  As John F. Kennedy said: &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.&quot;  I had the privilege of being very close to President Kennedy when he came to Dublin and visited Dublin Castle in 1963 - and I will tell Members about that on another occasion.  On this day 50 years ago he responded to the Thalidomide birth defects crisis by signing an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that required pharmaceutical companies to prove that their products were safe and effective prior to marketing.  He understood how important it was for his nation to know that this poisonous drug was not approved for sale in the USA.  We were not so fortunate here with just 32 survivors alive after 50 years.<\/p><p>  The Fine Gael Party gave a commitment in its programme for Government that it would deal with the issue and properly look after the needs of the 32 Thalidomide survivors.  No one ever believed that the survivors would reach 60 years of age because it was believed that they would die when they were about 20 or 25 years old.  It is a scar on the reputation of the Irish State that the group has been so badly treated.  They have not even received an apology from the State.  President Kennedy had the guts and knew that it was not correct to allow the drug to be sold.  Not only was the drug allowed into this country, it was still on shelves in pharmacies around the country a year later when people knew it was poisonous.  I would like to see the issue resolved.  The Thalidomide group has decided to take the matter to the courts.  The Minister for Health said that he would do his best to resolve the issue when he came to power.  The former Minister for Health, Mary Harney, and the Fianna F\u00e1il Party failed to deal with the issue and adopted a flippant attitude towards it.  I was the group's champion in the previous Government and I arranged for many of the survivors to meet the Fianna F\u00e1il Parliamentary Party but I was shocked at its heartlessness because it could not even make an apology on behalf of the State.  I wish the new Minister of State the best of luck in his new role.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000040#OO00400","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1349881800,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I call on Senator Bacik who has six minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000040#OO00500","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1349881800,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, to the House.

It is hard to accept criticisms from a party that governed during prosperous times yet increased the inequality in the health care system and presided over disastrous policies like co-location, the initiation of a consultant contract of which it is now critical, and the growing inequality and long waiting lists that we had even in the boom.

The programme continues, \"This Government\" is committed to introducing \"Universal Health Insurance with equal access to care for all.\"  The programme acknowledges, as do Ministers, that reform will not be easy and will be a difficult process that will take a little time.  It is a process that is well worth carrying out and has already started.  It is due to the radical reform that we have seen reform in primary care.  That is the first step.  Following the commitment to universal health insurance given in the programme for Government, there is a commitment to introduce universal primary care.  That is a radical new proposal that will be brought in through an ambitious four-phase programme that will ultimately result in free access to GP care.<\/p><p>An integral part of primary care reform is the idea that a stimulus package would be provided and the Minister referred to it in his speech.  Such a package would include - and it was announced as part of the infrastructure stimulus package announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin on 17 July - projects to meet key infrastructure needs in line with priorities identified in the investment framework, including primary care centres.  Some Opposition Senators have been critical of the idea of building new primary care centres but I disagree with them.  It is our strong policy to have new primary care centres.  I have had direct experience of them in other countries such as Spain which has an excellent primary care network.  They have a one-stop-shop in local communities with access to GPs, dental treatments and a range of treatments that most Irish people must go to hospitals to access.  A move towards primary care centres is progressive.  The building of centres is also part of a job creation stimulus package.  <\/p><p>I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy White, will drive forward the reforms.  Clearly, there have been frustrations caused by delays in rolling out the four-phase programme for primary care.  Steps have been taken.  It is important that we push the programme forward and see it as part of the overall package of health reforms.  <\/p><p>I pay tribute to the former Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, and thank her for her pioneering work in primary care.  She also pushed forward a very important health measure for dealing with alcohol abuse.  I know that her replacement, Deputy While, will progress her work.  <\/p><p>The Seanad Public Consultation Committee recently held good hearings with NGOs and groups working on preventive health strategies, particularly cancer prevention.  I look forward to sharing the findings of the public consultation committee with the Minister of State and the Department of Health.  Health strategies are an important part of a health care system.  It is also about cost saving and ensuring that people have access to health care at the earliest possible opportunity.  <\/p><p>All of these radical reforms would be difficult in the best of times but they are particularly difficult in the current economic climate.  The Government's amendment makes reference to that.  It points out that the Minister for Health has managed an impressive cost reduction in difficult times, that waiting lists have reduced, and we have all heard the figures, and that the Croke Park agreement has delivered real results in the health care sector.  Health service staff reductions amount to over 6,000 people yet we see efficiencies are being delivered.  It shows the achievements that can be gained with greater efficiency through the Croke Park agreement.  <\/p><p>It is also clear that the Minister inherited problems such as budgetary strategy and financial management in the Department of Health.  We are changing that through new changes to HSE governance. <\/p> <p>We have inherited the HSE, a creation of the previous Government.  It is important to ring fence budgets in the way we ring-fenced the mental health budget under the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  In primary health care the programme for Government provides for ring-fencing for additional psychologists, counsellors and community mental health teams.<\/p><p>I was delighted to hear Senator Crown voice his support for the amendment and for the Government's reforms.  We need to keep in our sight the very radical nature of the reform being introduced and the vast amount of work it will take as well as the critical goal we all share of access to health care on the basis of need rather than on means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000040#OO01000","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349882400,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy White, my former colleague from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, to his new post.  He was a brilliant Chairman of that committee and the expertise in finance he will be bringing to the Department of Health is most important.  I wish him well in his role.<\/p><p>I wish to outline some thoughts about primary care centres.  In the past we had dispensaries and we had a choice of doctor schemes.  I have some concerns and hope this has been properly costed.  In the past medical graduates used to convert the garage or the front room of a house into a GP office.  If we get the State and public private partnerships involved - I know the Minister of State has an interest in that from his previous role - will we just end up with the money going to builders, auctioneers, bureaucrats and so on?  It was a simple product and many people would say that the GP service was the one that did not fail.  People did not have to wait for years to see a GP.  I wonder if, following some of the recent controversy, it might merit re-examination.  What was wrong with what we had previously with physiotherapists and others setting up practice at home?  While it was not a one-stop shop, let us ensure we are not creating a new cost base and involving the State in new capital expenditure.<\/p><p>The Department's document indicates that we have invested approximately \u20ac5 billion in health capital projects in the past ten years.  Some of it was used earlier than that to convert hospitals such as Dr. Steevens' Hospital into offices.  It is a heavily bureaucratic service and I hope the Minister of State will be able to run that down.  Based on numbers discussed in the earlier debate with the Minister, Deputy Reilly, the fastest increasing area of the health service since 1980 has been in the number of administrators and clerical people.  This is about people treating patients.<\/p><p>We need to speed up the introduction of universal health insurance.  Some 36% of the population have medical cards and there are other grades of medical cards.  As approximately half the people already have private health insurance, let us go for it.  I hope the Minister of State will get an opportunity to review a version of the Milliman report on hospitals and the VHI that is less redacted than the one supplied to us.  We have a very long average length of stay.  I note from the Minister's speech that this has been reduced from 8.7 days to 7.9 days.  However, the Milliman report gave an example of a treatment that would take 3.7 days where best practice applied internationally and took 11.6 days here.  That adds approximately \u20ac1,000 a night to every in-hospital treatment covered by VHI.<\/p><p>The report also stated that very little analysis, appraisal and value-for-money research has been done within VHI to ascertain whether health insurance prescriptions and the overall costs were unduly high.  I had hoped that competitive health insurance would drive down costs and excessive lengths of stay.  There is material on that matter that the Minister of State might like to look at.  My amendment was to move faster to universal health care provided it is done in a competitive way so that instead of saying that a particular company charges less for health insurance because it cheated by recruiting only young people and not old people, one would rather say it was because the VHI had had a monopoly with too many monopolistic habits.  If old people can be allocated equally among all the competing insurance companies, we would get better value.<\/p><p>I have heard GPs make a further point - one the Minister of State and I would have had in common in a previous time as members of a board of a university.  Milton Friedman and Simon Kuzsnets, both Nobel Prize winners, said in the 1940s that if the American Medical Association were allowed to determine who could go to medical school and what foreign doctors could practice in the United States, it would result in a very expensive health service.  I believe they were right given that it accounts for approximately 17% of gross national income in that country.<\/p><p>What kind of health service would we have had if universities had not been so adept at turning away students with 550 points seeking to enter medical school in the past 25 years?  Would that have given a much more patient and consumer-orientated service?  Was it good value from the national point of view that these highly qualified and talented people who wanted to study medicine and had all the points were kept out?  There was a particularly daft attempt to weight that through the HPAT because too many women qualified - this was opposed by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and also the former Senator, Dr. Mary Henry.  Keeping out of medical school some of the most talented people the country has produced over the past 20 years must have had knock-on consequences for the service the Minister of State is seeking to organise in the consumer's interest.  Perhaps he might also review that matter.<\/p><p>The Minister also spoke about public private partnerships which really need to be examined.  In other fields, as the Minister of State will know from his time as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, the results were doubtful.  I believe in a public sector and a private sector.  When they come together, I am not so sure that the public sector has typically got a good bargain for the citizens as a whole.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is very welcome to the House and I hope he comes here many more times.  I wish him every success in his new role.  As we said to his senior colleague, the Department of Health has been the toughest job in Irish political life for a very long time - it has damaged the political careers of many who have held ministerial office there.  It is most important that the Government succeeds and I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000041#PP00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1349882400,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors' Gallery of the former Minister of State, Ms Mary Wallace, and other visitors, who are very welcome.

While I accept he was critical, at the same time he was developing a roadmap on how to introduce universal health care, which is now part of the programme for Government and will be implemented within two terms of office.  He did not spend the entire time in opposition throwing stones - he spent time researching how we would develop and implement the universal health care model, a major plank of which is primary care.

There is a need for greater emphasis on programmes which encourage people to avoid incurring medical conditions which are not good for them or the Exchequer.<\/p><p>Members on this side are condemning the cuts in this area, in respect of which the Minister of State is opposing us.  When previously a Member of the Seanad on this side of the House, the Minister of State did as we are doing and we opposed him.  This is part of the cynicism surrounding politics, as mentioned by Senator Mary White.<\/p><p>When it comes to the budget and overruns in the health service, it is inexplicable that the serious overruns identified in the early part of the year are to be addressed between now and the end of this year.  When the district hospital in New Ross closed, a number of people came together, took it over and operated it as a community hospital.  Each month the board of directors were given information on hospital costs for the previous month, how this compared with the previous year and projections and forecasts to the end of the year.  Everyone knew exactly what was going on and if corrections needed to be made, they were made immediately.  We did not wait until the end of the year to do so.  It is obvious there is not in place in our health service the required management personnel to carry out these functions, which is serious.  This issue needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>The appalling attitude of the witnesses who appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday typifies the reason our health services and finances in that area are as bad as they are.  There are too many administrators in the health services.  I was critical of the proposal to establish the Health Service Executive as I believed it was a flawed model and doomed to failure because there were no intermediate checks at regional or county level.  Oireachtas Members and councillors could play some role in relation to the delivery of services in their areas and monitoring of funding in this regard.<\/p><p>Another issue which needs to be addressed and for which I have been calling for a long time is that of costs across the public service, in respect of which I accept we on this side of the House must accept some blame.  The level of salary being paid to hospital consultants in this country is scandalous.  Some 500 consultants are on salaries in excess of \u20ac200,000 and the salaries of many others are just below that threshold.  I recently spoke to a hospital consultant, who is surgeon in Italy.  His salary is \u20ac5,000 per month which amounts to \u20ac60,000 per annum.  Consultants here are being paid three times that amount.  This issue needs to be tackled, otherwise patients will suffer.  This is not fair or justifiable.  This issue needs to be tackled if we are to have fairness and equality in our system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000042#QQ00600","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1349883000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Walsh for sharing time with me.

The same applies to Kells in County Meath, which was one of the 15 locations added to the list of 35.  There is nothing happening in relation to the provision of that primary care centre.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment last week.  Negotiations collapsed in 2010.  The Minister said in this Chamber last week that the HSE is seeking to resurrect those negotiations.  I do not believe they can be resurrected if they broke down in 2010.  Shame on the Minister for Health to announce a centre in Kells when there appears to be no foundation for it.

People have spoken about empty buildings throughout the country and wondered why primary care centres are being built.  It is because they will be purpose-built and building them will create employment.  When they are built and operational the rent from GPs will go to the State and not to private developers.

I hope the Minister of State, Deputy White, will take over the alcohol legislation and see it come to fruition.

At a HSE meeting we were told home helps are paid by the hour and we must get value for money.  Of course we do, but we must remember we are speaking about vulnerable people.  I hope the Minister of State will do what he can to ensure those who receive home help will have their hours maintained.<\/p><p>HSE areas which keep within their budgets should not be punished through cuts being made.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this.  I know it is early days for him and he is finding his feet.  The Department of Health is a poisoned chalice, as Fianna F\u00e1il knows.  In fairness to Fianna F\u00e1il, it kept pumping money into health but it did not work so we had to pull it asunder and reform it. We could not have begun the process of reform without the Croke Park agreement and keeping people on our side and working.  We all recall that prior to the election nurses were out with placards seeking a reduction in hours.  Under the Croke Park agreement this has gone away.

He is the only Minister with that kind of record.  We have had all the Ministers in the House at different times.  He always comes to the House and we genuinely appreciate that.<\/p><p>The Minister stated that I said he was irresponsible.  Indeed, he was irresponsible and reckless in the promises made before the election.  That is a fact.  Those promises were made on the back of a budget of which the current Government and former Opposition was aware.  It met the troika just as we did.  The cupboard was as bare then as it is now.  No one said to Senator O'Keeffe, a candidate for the D\u00e1il at the time, to promise a centre of excellence in Sligo.  No one told the Minister to write that letter we heard Senator Leyden read out in respect of the promises to the people of Roscommon.  The Government knew the promises were not deliverable . They should not have been promised.  That was irresponsible and politically downright reckless.  I described it before as political delinquency, and that is what it was.<\/p><p>As much as I welcome my friend and congratulate him on his elevation to Minister of State, and while I have no axe to grind and hold no bars in respect of the former Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, the reality is she resigned for a reason.

That for me demands, as we say in the motion, that the Minister publish all the documentation to do with these locations.  We are all in favour of primary care centres, universal health care and new GP care, but where are they?  It does not concern the 20 locations that were chosen, rather it concerns the 15 sites.  How did we pick them?  If one is in Dundalk, which is 21st in the ranking, one would wonder why its primary care centre location did not get up the curve.  We want all 400 of them as quickly as resources will permit.  I have no doubt the Minister of State will ensure this is done as quickly as possible, to the extent to which resources are available.  However, the reality is that 15 locations were chosen.  How were they chosen?  I venture it was done on political grounds.

Last week in Letterkenny, an injured jogger had to wait 48 minutes for an ambulance to come from the hospital, which is about 1.5 km from where his injury occurred.  It turned out that the ambulance came from Carndonagh, 35 miles away.  Luckily, the jogger was not seriously injured but he could have been.

This matter was aired extensively on local radio, thus giving a negative impression of the health service.  If the incident was isolated, we could live with it.  However, we are very concerned that if such an incident happens again, the injured party may not receive proper attention on time.  If it had been a cardiac incident, 48 minutes would have been too long to wait.  I still have not discovered why there was a delay.  Perhaps the Minister of State will outline the circumstances and give comfort, if not a guarantee, to the people such that there will be no recurrence.  Such an incident should not occur in this day and age, particularly when there is a hospital but a ten-minute walk away.  <\/p><p>Luckily, passers-by assisted the jogger in question.

I expect that everyone agrees the Minister has spent considerable time today responding to questions.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter and for the opportunity to clarify the position.  It is important that it be clarified.<\/p><p>The HSE's national ambulance service, NAS, provides pre-hospital emergency care and emergency and some non-emergency patient transport.  Before the NAS was established, each health board had its own ambulance service, with little co-ordination across board boundaries or national leadership on pre-hospital care.  Supported by the Department of Health, the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and HIQA, the NAS is providing national management of ambulance services.  In particular, the following developments are continuing: ongoing reduction to two ambulance control centres; increased deployment of advanced paramedics, who provide more complex on-site care; modernisation of communications and control infrastructure; and the development of new performance indicators.<\/p><p>Where necessary, emergency cover is supported by advanced paramedics in rapid-response vehicles and by resources dynamically deployed from adjacent stations.  A new intermediate care service is addressing routine inter-hospital transfers and releasing ambulances for emergency work, and the national aeromedical co-ordination centre organises aeromedical support, including inter-hospital transfers, transplant transport to the United Kingdom and the emergency aeromedical service, EMS, based in Athlone.  The effects of these changes are improved efficiency and increased resource availability across the service.<\/p> <p>In deploying emergency resources, the national ambulance service, NAS, operates under the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, EMS priority dispatch standard.  The PHECC standard identifies the appropriate resource for emergency calls and promotes practice in line with Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, national standards for safer, better health care.  These set out the principles for timely and clinically appropriate responses.<\/p><p>Ambulance crews are available to respond to emergencies, emergency transfers and lower acuity calls.  Ambulance control centres are responsible for strategically deploying emergency ambulances to maintain emergency cover, and for dispatching the nearest appropriate emergency resource to a call.  Emergency ambulances from all stations across Donegal are used in a dynamic manner to maintain emergency cover and to respond to calls as required.  Ambulance stations across the county and adjacent counties support one another, and the nearest available ambulance responds to an emergency call regardless of where it is based.<\/p><p>Key to the Senator's issue, the NAS has informed the Department that, at 7.31 p.m. on the day in question, Ballyshannon control centre received a call relating to an incident in Letterkenny.  The on-duty ambulance crews in Letterkenny were responding to other calls.  In line with established procedures, an emergency ambulance was tasked from Carndonagh.  This ambulance arrived at 7.55 p.m., 24 minutes after the call was received.  Meanwhile, an off-duty HSE paramedic was at the scene from 7.50 p.m., some 19 minutes after the call, and had informed Ballyshannon centre of her presence.  The ambulance left the scene with the patient at 8.10 p.m. and arrived at the hospital at 8.13 p.m.  I am satisfied the nearest available and appropriate emergency resource was deployed and that established procedures were followed.<\/p><p>The NAS has undergone significant change to ensure quality, safety and value for money.  As with other clinical areas, this process is ongoing as clinical needs and standards develop.  These developments are in the best interests of patients and are a key part of the Government's work to ensure high quality emergency care.  We all aim to have emergency calls responded to as quickly as possible.  I do not mean to take away from this particular incident, but it is clear the most appropriate response was provided in the quickest possible time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000046#UU01000","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349885400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

However, the ambulance arrived at 7.55 p.m.  Assuming the ambulance left at 7.35 p.m., it took approximately 20 minutes to get there.  Perhaps I am incorrect, but the distance between Carndonagh and Letterkenny is 40 miles or so.  I do not know how the ambulance could have travelled 40 miles in 20 minutes.  What speed can an ambulance achieve?  Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify.

In or around 1 July, I was contacted by a distraught mother who had paid approximately \u20ac85,000 to have her son trained as an airline pilot.  She borrowed some of that money and remortgaged a property, a story that is typical of many of the students caught in this situation.  How much money has been lost by the students in total?  The figure I have been given is between \u20ac5 million and \u20ac10 million.  Why did the Pilot Training College, PTC, in Waterford accept money from unsuspecting students when there apparently were concerns about the company's viability as long ago as the end of 2011?  That an organisation accredited by the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, took substantial sums of money in such a situation is a serious issue.<\/p><p>What investigation has the Department carried out to date, if any?  What investigation has the IAA conducted?  Is the Minister in a position to ensure the trainee pilots, some of whom have only received part of their training, will have their training completed by another accredited college?  Is the Director of Corporate Enforcement inquiring into this debacle?  If not, why not?  Did an auditor for the IAA or the PTC raise questions about the company's viability more than 12 months ago?<\/p><p>A further issue has come to my attention.  I will not be disparaging towards the directors or others involved, but some students e-mailed me.  Has another company set up shop in recent days in the premises owned and operated by the PTC since that company's liquidation?  If so, are any of the old company's directors involved with the new one?  They may not be.<\/p><p>During my probing of the issue, I learned that the training institute in Florida was owed approximately \u20ac1.4 million by the PTC.  What became of that money?  The PTC extracted substantial sums from many young people, primarily boys but also some girls, so that they might be trained as pilots.  Something is rotten.  I felt for the mother who approached me at a wedding.  I knew her to see her.  She explained her extreme plight.  That was early in the situation when the trainees were still in Florida.  The Minister assisted in getting them home, but a cost of $500 or $600 per student to bring them back from America is small change compared with the substantial sums they have lost.<\/p><p>I am deeply concerned by a number of the issues that have arisen.  I do not know whether the situation is as serious as I have been led to believe by some of the students and their families, who are scattered throughout Ireland.  Would it be appropriate to notify the Garda of what the company was doing?  The issue has come to light again.  In the past week to ten days, the High Court appointed a liquidator to PTC.  During the summer, there was some hope for a plan to save the company and complete the trainees' training.<\/p> <p>These people have been wronged and the State owes them a duty.  I hope the Minister will be able to answer some of these questions or give some good news about the Department guaranteeing the completion of the training for these pilots.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000047#VV00800","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349886000,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  The position which has arisen is most regrettable and came about from the failure of the Pilot Training College, PTC, a privately-owned and operated flight training school, to meet its contractual obligations to its students in the completion of their training in Florida.  I fully understand the frustration felt by the students involved and their families and I expressed my sympathy when I met some of their representatives on 20 July last.  Unfortunately in the current economic climate, many businesses have failed, leaving their suppliers, etc., out of pocket, including businesses where a State body has a regulatory role.<\/p><p>It is important that the role of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, with regard to flight training organisations is properly understood.  The IAA has responsibility for approving and overseeing flight training organisations in Ireland and the primary functions in this regard are the oversight of the safety, quality and standard of the training being delivered, the conduct of examinations and flight tests.  It considers whether the company has sufficient resources to safely provide the training required to the internationally-determined standards but has no involvement in, or responsibility for, the contractual arrangements between PTC and its students.  The IAA's role in the approval and oversight of flight training organisations is based on European rules and, unfortunately, PTC is not an isolated example, as there have been other similar failures in other countries in the recent past, with students suffering losses also.<\/p><p>As part of its regulatory role, the IAA completed audits on PTC in May 2011 and April 2012 and on PTC Florida in April 2011 and in October 2011.  The IAA also made site visits in the first quarter of 2012 and in June 2012.  During these various inspections it was clear that PTC complied with all EU and international requirements as a flight training organisation and there was no indication of any deficiencies.  PTC's accounts were signed off by professional auditors and were not qualified in any way.<\/p><p>EU and international requirements state clearly that the financial evaluation carried out as part of the approval and oversight process is not intended to be a consumer protection provision.  However, the IAA has tried to offer assistance to affected students where possible.  On 26 June, when the IAA was notified that PTC were ceasing all training activities, it immediately despatched a representative to Florida to secure the records of all students, and all training carried out to date was credited towards the students' final qualifications where possible.  The IAA has also worked with other flight schools to explore how students might complete their training elsewhere at as reasonable a cost as possible.<\/p><p>I am advised by the IAA that some 79 students have opted to continue their training with other approved Irish flight training organisations, 20 of whom are self-funded students.  There are a further 19 self-funded students who have remained in Florida to pursue their training under the US system, with another 24 who have not decided on their future career.  As a gesture of goodwill and without prejudice, the IAA funded the costs of students who wished to return to Ireland and 65 students availed of this offer.<\/p><p>On 26 July the High Court appointed an examiner to PTC Ireland.  The IAA worked with the examiner to assess the options available but unfortunately two weeks ago the examiner advised the court that a potential investor had withdrawn and it ordered the liquidation of PTC.  Whereas I and my Government colleagues sympathise with the plight of the students and their families who have suffered considerable financial losses through the collapse of this company, neither the Government nor the IAA accepts any liability in this regard.  The Irish taxpayer cannot be liable for a company's debts just because it had an approval of some form from a State agency.<\/p><p>The Senator asks about reports that a new company has been established at the same address as PTC.  I understand that a company, Clearsky Pilot Training College Limited, has been registered at that address.  The IAA has not received any application for approval from the company involved.  However, following these reports, last Thursday, 4 October, the IAA inspected the premises of the company in question and found that the company is providing refresher training for an international non-EU client.  That training does not meet the standard required for an Irish or EU pilot's licence.  Should this new entity wish to provide training meeting stringent EU standards, like any other company it will have to apply to the IAA for approval.<\/p><p>While the Companies Acts do not come within my remit, I am advised that a registered company is a legal entity separate from its owners, shareholders and directors. The owners of a limited liability company are liable only for the amount of money that they have invested in the company and are not liable for the entire debts of the company.  PTC was such a limited liability company.  Distressing as it may be for all creditors of PTC, whether students or firms, under the Companies Act, if a person is the owner or director of a company that is put into liquidation, the directors and owners are legally entitled to establish or continue to be involved with another company and the debts of the first company do not transfer with the owners or directors to the new company.  Creditors of the failed private entity should pursue the recovery of their debts with the liquidator if possible.  As I have said already, neither the Government nor the IAA accept any liability for a private company's debts.  Nevertheless, I acknowledge the Senator's comments that the students and their families have been wronged.  They have been wronged by the company involved and not the Irish taxpayer.<\/p><p>I cannot provide a figure on how much has been lost but it will amount to several million euro.  It is important to bear in mind that this does not just affect the young guy down the road or his mother but other parties are also involved, such as foreign airlines, a business in Florida and many other creditors.  It would not be possible for the Government to compensate some creditors because we have sympathy, but not compensate all creditors.  That would run into many millions of euro, including payments to foreign colleges, students and airlines.<\/p><p>I cannot answer the question of why the company accepted money up to the point that it ceased trading but unfortunately it is not uncommon for a business to continue to operate until the day it ceases trading.  I do not know if the Director of Corporate Enforcement or the Garda are involved in this case and I cannot speak for them.  I hope they will take an interest in the case and if there is a case to be answered in terms of company law or any other matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000048#WW00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1349886000,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being so frank.  I am disappointed as I feel much concern for the students who have been wronged and there has been much light touch regulation from the IAA.  Perhaps we could examine that in future.  The IAA experienced a company getting into difficulty in the not too distant past, although it may have been before the current Minister took office.  I am a solicitor by profession and it is my opinion that if a person or company takes in substantial sums of money up-front knowing that commitments cannot be fulfilled, it is bordering on criminal.  The company sent these students to Florida knowing that fact, which is reckless trading.  There should be some mechanism to punish such companies as we are talking about unsuspecting young people and their families.  Some of these people put their life savings into the training scheme but the company was accepting this money up to the difficulties arising on 1 July.  Somebody in the company knew damn well that within weeks it would be in a trading position where it would not be possible to survive.<\/p><p>The Minister should have another look at the matter because it will not go away.  The liquidator will probably not even consider the people who have been wronged as priority debtors.  These students should receive greater attention from the State as we sent them to be trained.  The light touch regulation of the IAA must be tightened, and it is a bit like the banking regulation in the past, which had terrible consequences for the country.

If there was reckless trading in the case, it is a matter for other authorities and the Senator makes a valid point in that regard.<\/p><p>There was a failure of another training college but that was more than 20 years ago.  At a policy level we are considering the introduction of a bonding system where if this happens again, at least the customers and trainees would be protected.  I do not accept that the IAA has been involved in light touch regulation and it is important to ponder the point.  If the IAA had discovered that the company was in trouble financially, what could it have done?<\/p> <p>All it could have done was close the company and told it that it could no longer trade and the people affected would be in exactly the same position they are in now except perhaps for the one or two who may have paid full fees in the past week or two.  When it comes to bodies that are licensed, regulated or approved by a Government body, we should bear in mind that all the airlines are licensed or approved by government.  Radio stations, all our public and private bus companies, hauliers, driving schools, private colleges and other institutions are all in some way regulated, licensed or approved by government.

Fianna F\u00e1il has published a Bill dealing with the issue of upward-only rent reviews, which is within the bounds of the Constitution.  As the Minister of State will know, upward-only rent reviews are crippling many businesses.  Those tenants are fighting their landlords to try to stay in business and reduce their costs.  Rents are falling all around Dublin and throughout the country, yet landlords are enforcing the lease clauses requiring upward-only rent reviews.<\/p><p>We have examined this issue on the basis that we must stay within the bounds of the requirement within the Constitution to protect people's private property and their interests in it.  There was a commitment to address this issue in the programme for Government and in the manifestos of the two parties in government.  The Fine Gael Party manifesto states that it would commit to end upward-only rent reviews.  It also states, &quot;We will pass legislation to give to all tenants the right to have their commercial rents reviewed in 2011 irrespective of any upward only or other review clauses.&quot;  The programme for Government states, &quot;We will legislate to end upward-only rent reviews for existing leases.&quot;  <\/p><p>When Deputy Alan Shatter became the Minister for Justice and Equality he said this would take a few months.  On 5 May he informed the D\u00e1il that legislation on the issue was being developed and that he was in ongoing consultation with the Attorney General.  In July he said that the matter was still with the Attorney General and in the 2012 budget the entire commitment was dropped.  Retail Excellence Ireland, an independent group not beholden to any political party, said the Government lied to every retail outlet in the country.  If the legislation we put forward is within the bounds of the Constitution, why is the Attorney General stating that this cannot be done? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000049#XX00300","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1349886600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who is unable to be here for a myriad of reasons.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to deal with the issue of upward-only rent review clauses in commercial leases.  I would like to note the broader context which should inform this debate.  That context relates to the ongoing work of Government to bring about the necessary transformational and structural changes to our economy which will assist struggling businesses and help them to grow.<\/p><p>The Government is acutely aware of the pressures felt by the retail sector in particular.  However, in December last, the difficult decision was made not to proceed with the commitment in the programme for Government to legislate to end upward-only rent review clauses for leases entered into prior to 28 February 2010.  It was a very difficult decision.  This is not an area in which I was very involved either before or after.<\/p><p>The approach envisaged by the Government at that time aimed at providing relief for tenants whose businesses might be viable were it not for the adverse impact of paying rent significantly above prevailing market levels.  However, the Government's legal advice was to the effect that the approach proposed gave rise to constitutional difficulties.  There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a constitutional challenge.  Furthermore, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed, so that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government was strongly of the view that compensating landlords in such circumstances could not be justified in the current economic climate.<\/p><p>Although legislative intervention may not be feasible, NAMA is playing a role in dealing with problems caused by upward-only rent reviews applying to NAMA properties.  This role applies where tenants of NAMA debtors can show that the rents they are paying are in excess of current market levels and, consequently, the viability of their businesses is threatened.  In such circumstances, tenants can seek NAMA's approval for rent reductions.  By the end of August, NAMA had received 271 rent abatement applications, of which 206 were approved, four were refused, nine were not eligible because they did not refer to NAMA properties, and the remaining 52 were under review.  Since the start of the year, NAMA has approved cumulative rent reductions of over \u20ac6 million.<\/p><p>By way of general comment, the common practice of including upward-only rent review clauses in commercial leases did not arise because of any legislative requirement.  The nature and application of a commercial lease is a matter for the parties to that lease, and parties have always been free to agree that review clauses, other than those based upon the upward only model, be included in their leases.  Furthermore, even where upward-only clauses are present, the parties have always been able to agree that a flexible approach should be taken both as to the amount of rent payable, and the way in which that rent is to be paid.  In this context, the Government has repeatedly urged that a pragmatic approach be taken by those involved in lease renegotiation.<\/p><p>One of the difficulties in regard to rent reviews is the absence of readily accessible, accurate information in order to determine the market rent payable in respect of comparable commercial properties.  The Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 addresses this issue by providing for the establishment and maintenance of a commercial leases database by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  Work is under way to ensure that the database will be operational at an early date.<\/p><p>The attention of the House is drawn to the existence of a rent review arbitration code, to be found on the Department of Justice and Equality website, which was developed by an expert group whose membership was drawn from all relevant stakeholders and which provides a mechanism to deal with the resolution of rent review disputes in the commercial property sector.  The code contains detailed provisions concerning the production of comparative evidence relating to property transactions.  It also places a firm duty on all parties to disclose all relevant information in their possession.  As matters stand, parties are free to specify that this code should apply to rent review arbitrations and all parties are encouraged to make use of its provisions.  I hope that addresses some of the Senator's concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101000049#XX00400","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1349886600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.
