The Chairman raised the issue of the Fennelly commission and words were used to the effect that there should not be a blank cheque involved in that commission of investigation.  I raised the issue of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and the uncertainty with regard to how long it will take to finalise that commission of investigation, the comments of the High Court judge who is conducting it and the warning he has given that this could be a waste of taxpayers' money.  I raised this matter in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  If legislation is needed with regard to that commission of investigation, a financial analysis must be conducted and made public before any decision is taken to move on in that regard.  There was agreement on the sense in that in the committee last week, given what you and others articulated, especially when the judge in question has effectively put the Government on notice that, in his opinion, it is uncertain at present as to how long this will take and he wonders whether it is a good use of public money and value for money for the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  The committee should consider formally asking that before any new commission of investigation, or even an extension of an existing commission of investigation, is decided upon, an analysis would be conducted as to how much it would cost, including the projection over a number of years, and that it would be made public.  That is a reasonable request considering that the Mahon, Moriarty and beef tribunals collectively cost the taxpayer approximately &euro;250 million.  The point of establishing these commissions of investigation was that they would not be tribunals.  They would be shorter and would not amount to a blank cheque for lawyers, frankly, which is what I have seen with some of the tribunals in this country.  The point was that there would be a time limit, so it would not be open-ended.  The Committee of Public Accounts has a role to play in asking the Government to consider that - at the very least and before it takes any decisions on these commissions of investigation - the length of time involved must be certain and that a spending cap might be necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#B00400","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I support what Deputy Deasy said.  When the commission of inquiry legislation was going through the Houses in 2004 and 2005, that was very much the intent behind it.  The legislation was seen as creating a viable alternative to the tribunals, which were perceived as being open-ended and costing the taxpayer an arm and a leg.  The purpose of the commissions of investigation was to be specific.  It was to focus the structure and the operation of the inquiry so it would be done with the maximum result but with minimum cost to the State.  The legislation put in place a dual structure in respect of the legal system on the one hand and non-engagement with the legal system on the other hand.  That combination of approaches would have to be achieved correctly to ensure that a vast quantity of money was not being spent, particularly by the engagement of major legal teams.  This particular case highlights that.  With regard to the Fennelly report and the IBRC, it would be worthwhile if we could find a mechanism to review the situation in terms of cost to the taxpayer in the context of the Committee of Public Accounts seeing how we could deal with it here to get some guidance and direction on the expenditure of taxpayers' money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#B00500","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I agree with the thrust of those comments.  Obviously, the cost of any inquiry is a matter of concern and anything that amounts to a blank cheque book for legal firms or lawyers must be avoided.  However, it is important that the committee makes it clear that the issues under consideration must be fully investigated because potentially serious questions in respect taxpayers' money arise from the serious matters the judge was asked to investigate.  There should not be an impression that issues surrounding potential costs of the commission were being used in any way or for any purpose to block a full and thorough investigation.  However, it is a good idea to make inquiries and ensure that legal costs, caps, <i>per diem<\/i>rates and so forth are in full view and under the surveillance of this committee.  It is a fair to ask that.  Nevertheless, it is an absolute imperative that each of the deals under consideration, most notably that involving Siteserv, is fully investigated.  We should not be, nor should we be perceived to be, throwing up a further road block in achieving a full investigation of those matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#B00600","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>It must be said that it is most regrettable that the inquiries referendum was voted down.

To allay any fears, Deputy McDonald, it has nothing to do with the issue being investigated, getting to the bottom of it and dealing with it in an effective way.  However, the history of tribunals and other investigations is that once they are established by the House, they appear to get out the gap and costs are never a question.  When that happens, as history has shown, we cannot intervene.  We are told that we cannot interfere with the direction of the tribunal.  The purpose of the conversation last week, and again today, is that some restraint be put on the costs, legal fees and structure of the proposed investigation or tribunal before it sets off, so that we at least have an idea of the cost implications versus the outcomes we are trying to achieve.  We have not learned from the history of this, and there appears to be a reluctance and inability to address it.<\/p> <p>  Last week, we asked Mr. Watt for the figures in respect of the Fennelly commission and the IBRC.  The figures were not available that day but we were told that they could be made available to us immediately.<\/p><p>I understand that we still have not got those figures and that is unhelpful.  The committee is right to follow the proposition outlined by Deputy Deasy in the context of protecting the taxpayers' money because it is a more sensible, prudent and constructive approach to the work of any ongoing tribunal or investigation.  We should take this issue up next week with the Department of Finance but in the meantime we should write to the Departments concerned about this issue, make our views known and seek a response.  Hopefully we will get an input into overseeing or examining the cost of the proposals that are being put before the Oireachtas.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#B00800","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We should ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to structure that and to come back to the committee.  In the context of the IBRC case, the High Court judge was effectively telling the Government that this needs to be structured better, with definite timeframes and that it needs to be clear because as of now, it is not.  A High Court judge is dealing with this but it could end up being a complete waste of taxpayers' money if it is not structured differently.  We are not getting into the substantive issue of whether there should be an investigation.  I agree with the Chairman on that point.  I am conscious that there may be information that I am not aware of and that when the Government made that decision, it may have had information to which I am not privy.  I am not going to second guess that decision but we should ask for that structure to be imparted to this committee, based on what the High Court judge has said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#C00200","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I entirely agree with that and the points are very well made.

I am not jumping to conclusions in terms of the possible outcome but it is important that we say that, along with saying that we need to see the structure.  Of course, there has to be some sanity in respect of the cost of this to the public purse.

Its expenditure includes amounts paid out in respect of totaliser betting wins, racing prize money and Bord na gCon&rsquo;s administration and running costs.<\/p> <p>  The downturn in the economy has had a significant impact on Bord na gCon&rsquo;s operations, and on its bottom line.

Since we last met this committee, much of the focus of the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, has been on the implementation of the Indecon report.  The progress on that project has been detailed in the briefing document submitted last week.  Indecon critiqued serious structural issues within the industry and raised questions about the validity of strategic decisions taken at the beginning of the recession.  These conclusions were further elaborated in the review by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the Limerick project in particular.  It is important to state that Indecon also felt strongly that if the appropriate actions were taken, as laid out in its review, the industry then would have a viable future.<br\/><br\/>Realising that future will be challenging.  The enormous impact of the recession on discretionary consumer spending is obvious.  Members of the committee, more than most, are aware of the effects of reductions in income on behaviour and on the spending choices people have been obliged to make.  The notion that the greyhound industry could sail unaffected through those waters simply is not tenable.  The recession has both caused attendances to plummet and led to many trainers and owners exiting the industry.  The period also saw very significant reductions in the Horse and Greyhound Fund, which ran at more than 30% at one point.  The capacity of the IGB even to sustain levels of incentive and prize money simply did not exist, partly because of the business hit but also because of the drain on our resources to pay down significant legacy debt.  That is the reality and there is no sugar-coating it.<br\/><br\/>We should not discount how the cumulative consequences of deep cost-cutting within the organisation has affected investment in our facilities and the marketing of our product.  The board in 2014 took significant actions to step up commercial performance through a new strategy and more appropriate levels of funding.  These will not make an immediate impact as there will be a time lag, but the benefits of the new strategy are beginning to show clearly for 2015.  Stadium branding and all marketing materials have been developed and updated.  The Tote brand has been updated to fit with the design of the stadium branding.  There is a strong digital marketing dimension to all our commercial work.  All stadia now have their own web presence, which is linked to <i>www.gogreyhoundracing.ie<\/i>.  The IGB has taken over all the food and beverage operations within its stadia.  These operations are now fully integrated in terms of planning and consistency of business objectives.  Food and beverage is now a key driver of future attendance and income growth.  The profits generated through the new food and beverage arrangements will be retained within the industry.  Significant progress has been made on another major issue, namely, the pension deficit, the details of which are to go for member consultation early in the new year.  There also has been much work done on the development of new income streams, based largely on significant investment in technological infrastructure, which was hopelessly outdated in terms of market requirements.  There are some positives in terms of outturns for the year and the general economic canvass on which this industry operates.  A lot has been happening at board level, the benefits of which may not be immediately apparent but which will have significant impact in the medium and long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Meaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Meaney and invite Ms Larkin to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#F00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448532000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.  At our presentation 12 months ago, I stated that if this industry was to survive and prosper, it would require tough decisions, ongoing assessment of the business model, the development of new income streams and an openness to new approaches right across the sector.  During the past year, the Irish Greyhound Board has not shied away from any hard decision, including the decision to sell the Harold's Cross site, the calibration of racing and the development and introduction of key performance indicators, KPIs, for all tracks.  Commercially, the Irish Greyhound Board has introduced a new digital and marketing strategy.  As already mentioned, we have taken over our food and beverage operations and entered into commercially important drinks pouring rights arrangements.  We have established appropriate technology platforms to generate new income streams and have signed contracts with some of the most iconic global wagering names.  Increased marketing spend has enabled investment in marketing to the tour operator and incentive markets.  We have increased our presence at a number of United Kingdom and European trade fairs and all this activity should yield dividends, based on the booking cycles of these companies, from next year onwards.<\/p> <p>  Despite these measures, the results for 2014 reinforce the fact that improvement following years of underinvestment in the commercial infrastructure of the Irish Greyhound Board will take time to deliver.  All the initiatives are important and overdue and will position the Irish Greyhound Board to maximise opportunities arising from improvements in the macroeconomy.  Critical actions must be taken to regenerate the industry, key among these being the need to increase of the number of owners, breeders and trainers involved in the sport.  This group must be increased and renewed as otherwise, the industry will continue to contract.  We are working with all stakeholders to develop ways to incentivise ownership and in that respect, the additional allocation in the budget is most welcome.  We have concluded a full consultation with industry stakeholders and the challenge is to ensure the maximum return on investment.  The additional &euro;1.2 million announced in the budget for the Horse and Greyhound Fund is going to prize money and additional industry supports at grassroots level.<\/p> <p>  At last year&rsquo;s meeting, the issue of regulation and integrity was brought up.  Regulation always has been a fraught area for all sports governing bodies and for greyhound industries worldwide.  It must be stated that only a very small number of those involved in the greyhound industry are non-compliant.  This being the case, the board has championed and introduced the use of new statutory instruments to strengthen our regulatory control.  Those who breach the regulations now know they will be faced with publication of adverse findings from test results of their greyhounds, which, in turn, will be banned from racing.  This is a major step forward and is but one to be followed.  The Irish Greyhound Board supports mandatory penalties for a range of offences but this will require amending primary legislation.  I realise I am not saying anything new in stating the past few years have been very difficult for all those involved in the greyhound industry.  There is a serious attempt to put the industry on a sound footing within the resources available to us and to create an industry model that is fit for purpose and is sustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Larkin"},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Larkin.

The legal agreement is one issue, while the fiduciary duty as a director is another.  The board members will not be able to get away from including major settlement figures in the accounts.

The Chairman will be issuing a recommendation that a formal service level agreement be in place.  I am shocked to hear one does not exist.<\/p> <p>  I cannot understand how an Accounting Officer in the Department has not learned lessons.  I will not go back to what happened in Punchestown years ago, with money handed out without proper agreements.  There were reports done at length.  Here we are with the same Department handing out &euro;14 million a year for the next number of years and no service level agreement.  The Committee of Public Accounts will not stand over that and will be saying it is not acceptable.  It is not acceptable in any Department to hand out that amount of taxpayers' money.<\/p> <p>  I will ask two or three questions on this.  In relation to the discussion on the subvention - it is called the horse and greyhound fund but I will call it taxpayers' money in case people think it is coming from somewhere else - of &euro;14.8 million the Department is handing out next year and the &euro;13.6 million it handed over this year, would the Department be aware approximately of the settlement that has been referred to in the High Court?  That had to come into its reckoning in some way as needing to be met from the funding.<\/p> <p>  I had a quick look at the amount of taxpayers' money going into the sector ten years ago.  It is in one of the charts we got.  In 2006, the State was putting in &euro;14 million.  I know the funding dropped down to &euro;11 million, &euro;10 million and whatever.  Total income on those occasions was approximately &euro;50 million, including the taxpayers' amount.  Therefore, the taxpayer was subventing the industry to the tune of approximately 28% of its income.  The chairman, Mr. Meaney, states the income has gone down and there has been an cumulative drop but the amount of the board's income coming from the taxpayer is increasing as a percentage of its income each year.  In 2014, the accounts show total turnover from racing activities as &euro;25 million and the taxpayer put in &euro;11 million.  That was a significant proportional increase in the Department's costs.  Next year, the Department proposes to give &euro;14.8 million.  Mr. Gleeson should be able to tell us whether the Department has a ballpark figure of what is a right amount for the taxpayer to be putting into the industry as a percentage of its total income?  As I said, it seems to be increasing.<\/p> <p>  In view of that, I would look at the governance of this.  The organisation, as Mr. Nealon recommended, could not exist without taxpayers' money.  We accept that is the case.  There is not a representative of the Department on the board.  Given that such a large proportion of the expenditure and income involved in Bord na gCon is taxpayers' money, the structure needs to change so that there is somebody there monitoring this and representing the Accounting Officer in the Department.  Essentially, the Department is handing it over to an independent company.  Not finding any fault with it, I am merely saying to protect the taxpayers' interest, the Minister should have a representative there to watch that.<\/p> <p>  Has Mr. Gleeson any observations on what was taken into account in how the Department arrived at the &euro;14.8 million figure?  Approximately, how many are employed in the greyhound sector because there has to be some connection between how much the taxpayer is putting into a sector and how many people are benefiting?  The following is a simplistic and probably unfair figure but the only one I can get from looking at the figures today is that there are 110 full-time staff in the organisation, although the organisation hires extra staff for catering for race meetings.  I do not even like to say it but that amounts to approximately &euro;124,000 per annum for those employed in the organisation but the staff in the organisation is only a fraction of the number in the industry.  Can Mr. Gleeson tell me the basis on which the Department arrived at this &euro;14 million, how many people in the industry is the Department supporting with this grant and how much per person in the sector is the taxpayer subventing it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#J00700","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Before Mr. Gleeson answers those questions, I will ask Deputy Sean Fleming to chair the meeting for a few minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#J00800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1448532000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>Deputy Sean Fleming took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>They are the same questions but I have a different view of matters from up here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#J01000","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448532000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>There are a few questions there but I will try to answer them as best I can.

Obviously, we have had a report on it and there is a ballpark figure there now which we assume will have to be accrued in the 2015 accounts in the normal way.<\/p> <p>  Second, in terms of the overall financial position of the industry, clearly we have a concern.  We know the chairman, the board and the chief executive have a concern about the financial status of the industry.  When one looks at the subvention that has been given in the past, the grant to the board went from &euro;15.2 million in 2008 to &euro;10.8 million in 2014 and that came at a time when attendances were falling, when tote income collapsed and when all the impacts of the economic downturn came as well.

I am sure that is the widest possible definition but it is 10,000 people.  Our figures show &euro;0.5 billion of turnover in the rural economy.  That is the figure we have.

That is a given.<\/p><p>Against the background of concerns about income dropping and other concerns, the Minister commissioned Indecon to produce a report on the sector.  It was published in 2013.  There was a range of recommendations in it, including on governance, regulation and the financing of the industry.  There was recognition that something had to change in terms of financing the industry.  It was a long report.  There were three main pillars to the recommendations on improving finances.  One was that the board would have to dispose of assets because it was burdened with a significant debt that was eating up resources that might otherwise have been put into the sector.  To an extent, this is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy because, in order to develop the sector, one needs to be putting money into prize money, stadiums and developing new products.  However, if one's sources of funding, from the State or commercial revenue, dry up, it has a negative impact on that.<\/p><p> The first part of the Indecon report suggested something really had to be done about bringing down the debt.  The only realistic way of making a really significant impact on that was the sale of assets.  There were a few proposals in the report.  They were not necessarily prescriptive but there were suggestions as to what assets might be sold.  The second recommendation concerned the development of new streams of income and new products.  The chairman and chief executive will know more about that than I do.  They have already described progress in that regard.  The third point was that there was a significant number of non-performing stadiums.  It was recommended that something be done to calibrate the cost of those stadiums to the income deriving from them.  That probably meant reducing the number of races and making sure the expenditure in non-performing racecourses did not exceed the income derived from them.  Those are the three strands of that income piece.<\/p><p> The chief executive has described the kind of governance arrangement within the Department.  Obviously, the board and chairman have their own responsibilities, and we have responsibilities also.<\/p><p> Reference was made to the presence of a departmental person on the board.  That is an arguable point.  It is not in the legislation.  We will be drafting a Bill.  We have begun to draft the heads of a Bill to respond to some elements of the Indecon report.  The Bill will deal with some aspects of governance and deal with regulation.  It might introduce mandatory penalties for offences such as doping.  The board composition is a policy decision and I cannot elaborate on it.  However, if the committee has a view on the composition of the board, we would all have to take it into account in the context of redrafting the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>That is fine.

That is the answer to the first part of the Deputy's question.<\/p> <p>  The second part of the Deputy's question related to key performance indicators.  The key performance indicators have been built to analyse the profitability of the tracks, the subvention we are paying per meeting and per spectator, the level of sponsorship generated at track level, and the amount of Tote and commercial profits being made.  Those key performance indicators have been running for 12 months now.<\/p><p>The analysis arising from them has been very useful in identifying different aspects of performance and what is good and bad on the various tracks.  Different issues arise in respect of the ten IGB tracks and seven privately-run tracks and it gives us an opportunity to investigate them.<\/p><p> My priority for the next 12 months will be to see how much we can lift the KPIs.  By targeting specific areas of weakness we hope to bolster the entire industry.  Obviously, this is taxpayers' money and there is no guarantee that funding to tracks will continue in the long term.  My priority is to address the weaknesses.  On pulling the tracks up, every time one takes a track out there are repercussions for local industry and, while it might solve commercial issues, it might also severely undermine the dog population in an area.  It is better to see if we can solve the non-performance of tracks and other issues.  A key challenge, given that we are dependent on tracks, is the fact that the tracks are only open for some 16 hours per week.  <\/p><p> We will go back to the Indecon recommendations and look at what else we can do in terms of alternative sources of income to support what happens on the tracks.

We are exploring other such options to help bring a completely different audience into greyhound stadia because it is a State resource which is available in key urban locations and which we should be utilising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#K01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Larkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I have two racetracks in my constituency, one privately owned and one not.  My family raised greyhounds when I was growing up so I have a gr&aacute; for it.  I felt a little bit annoyed listening to the opening statements of Ms Larkin and Mr. Meaney.  Those who run the racetracks, who train and own dogs, work very hard to keep the industry going, to keep it competitive and preserve it as a form of entertainment for others but the opening statements we heard today were a little vague and there was nothing in them.  As the Vice Chairman said, some &euro;14.8 million of taxpayers' money has been allocated but Ms Larkin said a key thing to regenerate the industry was to increase the number of dog owners, breeders and trainers.  She said the extra money that had been allocated would go into prize money and additional industry support at grassroots levels and that there would be a serious attempt to put the industry on a sound footing within the resources available.  She also said she would strive to create an industry model which was fit for purpose and sustainable.  She said she was looking at exploring other options but that is all very hazy and fluffy and there is nothing concrete in it.  Can Ms Larkin give me some examples of what she means by \"additional industry supports at grassroots levels\"?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Meaney said a lot was happening at board level, the benefits of which may not be immediately apparent but which will have a significant impact in the medium and long term.

During 2015 the Irish Greyhound Board conducted an extensive consultation at grassroots level.  We started with our own front-facing staff, the people referenced by the Deputy in her opening remarks, and we asked them how we could bolster the industry.  We extended the discussion to the directors of all tracks and this culminated in the circulation of a document for public consultation.  The document posed a number of options as to how we might grow ownership and invest in the industry.  It discussed bolstering syndication, the leasing of greyhounds to new and upcoming syndicates and targeting prize money.  It put out a number of options to industry stakeholders but the the money available to the Irish Greyhound Board was quite limited at the time, it being mid-2015.  Nevertheless, we received a number of comments from stakeholders.  The comments differed widely, as one might expect.  Some felt we should support syndication while others felt that doing so should not be at the expense of the owner, who supports the industry on an ongoing basis, and that one group should not get preferential treatment over another.  Others felt the current funding arrangements could be broadened and made more equitable.  That is just a flavour of the comments we received.<\/p> <p>  The announcement in the budget of an additional &euro;1.2 million is a significant game changer for us in terms of what we can do.  In the past 12 months the Irish Greyhound Board ran over 16,000 races, which will give members an idea of the population involved in dog racing.  Of that 16,000, half of the dogs were in the mid-grades - between A2 and A6 - and one of the considerations for us is whether to target one such group with additional funding or whether to provide an increase in funding across the board.  Another alternative would be to replace earlier cuts to prize money.  We are working through these three very different concepts and there are other possibilities, such as paying run money to placed dogs to directly subvent the costs associated with bringing a dog to racing.  There are possibilities around racing clubs and around various breeding incentive schemes.  There are myriad options and we have prepared initial costings on all of them.  Our intention is for the entire board to consult, in the middle of December, with the various industry representatives who have engaged in the process in the past months, either by written submission personal representation.  The objective will be to increase pools and attendance because if we can increase ownership those owners will also attend stadia, which will have a knock-on effect on the Tote and our food and beverage offerings.  We have &euro;1.2 million and we need to spend it wisely to ensure that, with the industry input, we get the best return for our money.<\/p><p>I was conscious of keeping my opening statement brief but this is the thinking behind my remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine Larkin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1448532000,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Like Ms Larkin, I was conscious of keeping my statement as short as possible.  We live in the industry every day, and I can see how what we said could seem to be vague, but we did not mean to be vague in any shape or form.  A number of major issues have been dealt with in 2015.  The two main High Court cases predated the executive and the present board members.  A huge amount of time over recent years has gone on dealing with them and getting them behind us.  I accept what Deputy Fleming said.  While there is a cost, I am delighted they have been dealt with.<\/p> <p>  The deficit in the defined benefit pension scheme has used up a lot of time.  We are at the consultative stage and having it dealt with is very important to me.  The executive, with the support of the board, has put in place a deal with our bankers which is very important for any organisation.  Disposal of core or non-core assets is a big issue and we accept Indecon's recommendation.  During 2015, we have disposed of the old head offices of the IGB on Henry Street in Limerick.  This, along with other income we generated, will allow us pay down debt to the bank in 2015 for the first year since I got involved.<\/p> <p>  As I alluded to earlier, most of the executive, including the CEO, only came on board in 2014.  All board members, with the exception of one, are new and none of the executive was in place when I came on board in 2011.  The point I am making is that we now have a good executive with new blood on the board.  We have a bit of cash we did not have before.  This is a platform to kick on, which we did not have over the past four years in which I have been involved in the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Meaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Mr. Meaney mentioned the assets and the loan.

It has declined at varying rates each year since then.  We have changed completely the commercial strategy and the commercial operations with regard to how we approach this.  When I first started in mid-2013, commercial operations as they were and the commercial strategy were not fit for purpose.  We had a homogenous approach to the market in that we sold the product and racing on the back of the Irish Greyhound Board brand.  What we have done since, following research, is have a local market-based strategy to promote the stadia in each of their local markets, within a drive time of 45 to 50 minutes, assuming this is the maximum distance anybody will drive for a night out with regard to cost and time.  We have also launched <i>www.gogreyhoundracing.ie<\/i>and put in place a consumer facing racing brand rather than the IGB brand.  We separated IGB as a corporate entity and put in place a consumer infrastructure.<br\/><br\/>We have completely changed our digital infrastructure and we have upskilled our digital expertise.  All of our activities are dovetailed between advertising, digital activity, social media and social platforms.  We are trying to expose the industry and sport to the widest possible audience because the biggest opportunities with regard to getting leisure and racing consumers back to the tracks are with people aged between 18 and 35 years.  In the year to date, the average attendance per meeting in the IGB tracks increased by between 6% and 8%.<\/p><p>The position with Christmas bookings, in terms of the sales cycle this year compared to the sales cycle for the same period last year, is that we are up 18%.  Our digital strategy is part of the overall strategy.  It is about acquisition of customers and retention.  The next phase, having put in place that infrastructure, is to put in place loyalty technology and loyalty marketing.<\/p><p> Let us consider the journey we have come from.  We had a situation where we had a database of 100,000 customers.  It was non-compliant, in multiple formats and was effectively unusable.  The marketing department and our outside digital people have now worked through that.  We now have a functioning database of over 60,000 people.  To that database we have sent over 400,000 promotional e-mails so far this year.  That part of the journey involved putting in place the jigsaw to get to the point where we can actually put in place loyalty marketing, which is a speciality in its own right.  A tender document has gone out.  There is a two-piece approach.  The first is to ensure we have the correct strategic direction for it.  The last thing we want to do is pick a model or infrastructure that does not work, does not deliver or does not give us a return on investment.  We are taking a two-phase approach.

Earlier the CEO alluded to the fact that she has had a consultative document in terms of how the organisation is going to increase the number of owners.

Bookmakers are not getting any younger.  If one looks at the bookmakers at the track, they would probably be there for ten, 20 or 30 years.  Trying to get new guys in is very difficult and it is also part of the split - I call it upstairs-downstairs.  The downstairs is the traditional greyhound man - the owners and trainers.  They really are with the bookmakers.  Upstairs are those with corporate groups or on a night out etc.  They bet with the Tote.  They are there for a good night out and they are going to bet with the Tote.<\/p> <p>  In essence there are two tracks that are working very well in terms of 50:50 with the Tote.  Shelbourne Park would be stronger from the bookmaker point of view.  Kilkenny would be very strong with bookmakers as opposed to the Tote.<\/p> <p>  Attracting new bookmakers in is very difficult, but one of the things we have seen is the new television trial we are doing at the moment with Turf TV.  We are using bookmakers in the UK, and betting shops in the UK and Ireland.  The bookmakers at those tracks which are offering very competitive odds, which is in line with the UK and Ireland, are seeing an upturn in turnover from the on-course traditional bookmaker.  It would be very difficult to get traditional bookmakers and I do not see any growth in that area.  As I said, the age profile of a traditional bookmaker must be late 50s or early 60s, similar to the UK.  The UK has the same problem.  One has 2.7 bookmakers per BAGS, Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service, and they are struggling to get bookmakers.  One needs three bookmakers at the track to form an SP for the UK.  I do not know how one resolves that bit of it.  One of the ways of resolving it, I suppose, is getting more people into tracks.  Take Galway, Johnny Morris would have been a good bookmaker at Galway track.  More people come downstairs.  One gets that type of bookmaker back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Lewins"},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Since the new board and new chair came in, there has been a lot of firefighting over previous issues.

As with many other industries, now is the first time the board has had an opportunity to be strategic and to look where we are going.  Things are not going to improve overnight.  If the Chairman decides to bring us back in here next year, it is not going to be all bells and whistles from where I am sitting.  There is going to be a gradual improvement over the next five years by getting people back into the industry.  I am old enough to have seen this before where the greyhound industry takes a dip and then it comes back up again.  There is no doubt we have taken a dip, a hammering, but slowly it is going to build back up.<\/p> <p>  Do I see the industry being able to survive without State support in five years?  Honestly, no.  I would not at this stage be able to state the number of people involved for the kind of industry it is.  For example, it has not been mentioned today that a huge number of clubs and organisations up and down the country through the medium of greyhound racing raise a huge amount of money annually.  It is very hard to put a figure on that, but I would say it could be anything between &euro;4 million and &euro;5 million.<\/p> <p>  For example, Kerry county board's main fundraising in the year is a big night at the dogs in Tralee.  In Kilkenny, where I live, there is an organisation, BEAM, for people who need support.  It is their biggest fundraiser.  Even though it is a very small track, annually they raise &euro;35,000 and they have done that for the past 20 years.  To look at the greyhound industry purely in the context of the taxpayer putting in &euro;14.5 million or &euro;14.9 million is unfair.  One needs to look at it in the context of the employment it gives, of the social side of it for community and for older people, and also for the amount of money it allows people to raise for very worthy causes.  It may be not always very worthy; I think sometimes political parties might even use it.  However, in general it is for very worthy needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Meaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1448532000,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Why is that not so worthy?

It is the second stadium in Dublin and is more a local than a national stadium.  It is a stadium where a night out at the dogs takes place on a regular basis.  On my side of the city it is treated as virtually a northside stadium.  I cannot understand, considering that the stadium is profitable, why Bord na gCon should sell it to defray debts incurred in Limerick.  This is Dublin and that is Limerick.  Surely a reasonable analysis of the situation would not require the elimination of a second stadium in Dublin which is profitable, local and availed of by the ordinary punter.

I would very much be one of the people who would suggest that when we rationalise by bringing the whole business together in Shelbourne Park, the people that go to Harold's Cross are looked after.  It is very hard to justify the two tracks.  Traditionally, and let me make this point, Harold's Cross was the Dublin man's track and maybe Shelbourne Park was the Croke Park of greyhound racing.

Taking key positions in State bodies such as his is regarded by many, in particular by me, as being a reward for showing loyalty to a party in power.

It is probably true that, had Fianna F&aacute;il in its old construction been in power, Mr. Meaney would not have been appointed, but that is a reflection more on Fianna F&aacute;il than on anyone else.  What it did in appointments left much to be desired.  Let me be clear on that point.  During its long period in government it set in train the practice of awarding or rewarding its own, which is not the way to construct a board or appoint someone to a position such the one Mr. Meaney occupies.<\/p> <p>  I also say with some regret that, despite the announcement made by the Government that it would depart from this practice, it has not done so to any great extent.  The day people are appointed because of their willingness to serve and commit to a board on the basis of their abilities must be reached soon.  That is the ideal.  Civil servants in Departments observing the dynamic or tension there should be between Ministers and the Civil Service should have this as their value.  We should be reaching beyond the political system and the norm in appointing people.  Unfortunately, we have not distanced ourselves from the culture of appointing insiders.  We need only consider some of the committees in the Houses and who is advising them to know that, generally, it is the usual suspects.<\/p> <p>  I will say something about Mr. Meaney's case, not because he is from Carlow-Kilkenny but because I knew him as a businessman previously.  He has a track record, not only in terms of his membership of Fine Gael but of running a successful business.  He is an individual with integrity.  I have no doubt that he is attempting to make a contribution to the organisation in question that is in the best interests of transparency, accountability and so on, which is welcome.  The only thing that would have held me back from appointing him was the fact that he was from Carlow-Kilkenny and I might have been accused of supporting one of my own.  I might have been willing to appoint him because of his credentials.  Deputy Shane Ross's point is about an individual's credentials.  Unfortunately, that process for selecting various State appointees was not in place when Mr. Meaney was appointed, although it is now.  That is regrettable, as Mr. Meaney displayed in his correspondence to the committee in question that he would have liked to have appeared before it for no other reason than to explain his qualifications.  This committee spent four and a half hours one day discussing the issues of office accommodation and toilet rolls.  I was happy to appear before it at that meeting and account for myself.  It might be no harm if other Chairmen or Ministers did likewise.  Deputy Shane Ross gave his opinion and I am giving mine.  I respect the job being done.

The last line is interesting that in order to complete its work by the end of 2016, a request has been made for funding of &euro;3 million.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach mentioned that this investigation could possibly take eight years.  Lets do the maths.  If that is the case, or even close to it, given that by 2016 an additional &euro;3 million will be involved, then one is talking about serious money if it runs into another seven years beyond that.  It is clear to me that a proper analysis, based on the estimates with regard to how long this could take, has not been conducted.

Serious issues have arisen in relation to the sale of loans to Cerberus and how it is treating the customer at the other end, causing serious difficulties to local economies and businesses and, in particular, a business in Kilkenny.  I intend to raise the issue with the officials next week as to what controls are in place once a bank sells its loan into Cerberus.  What is the attitude of the Department of Finance and the State to protecting businesses that are working with the banks but are unable to work with Cerberus because it is demanding full payment of a loan upfront, when in fact it is a distressed business?  It will close businesses.  In one case, there are 40 jobs involved.  I am expressing my deep concern about its attitude and will raise the issue next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015112600002#Y05300","speaker":"965"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1448532000,"counter":730,"content":"<p>The witnesses withdrew.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1448532000,"counter":731,"content":"<p>The committee adjourned at 2 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Thursday, 3 December 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
