In this regard, the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, working with the relevant local authorities across the Greater Dublin Area, will co-ordinate a strategic metropolitan plan for the Dublin area. Engagement with each of the four Dublin local authorities will be undertaken as part of preparing the MASP, through the RSES process.<\/p><p>The MASPs will inform each local authority development plan, focusing on high-level issues that affect each city as a whole across local authority boundaries, as well as setting investment priorities, ranging from planning for transport, housing and economic development to major regeneration areas and projects. Plans for the future development of individual areas will be a matter for the relevant local authority to pursue through the relevant development plan, in line with the overarching planning policy objectives of the NPF.<\/p><p>Implementation of the NPF will be supported by an investment of &euro;2 billion for urban regeneration and development purposes, focusing on cities and towns in excess of 10,000 in population, and complemented by a similar &euro;1 billion fund for regeneration of smaller towns and villages which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development.<\/p><p>The Urban Regeneration and Development Fund will be a competitive bid-based fund, operated in line with criteria that my Department is in the process of drawing up in consultation with the Department of  Public Expenditure and Reform.  The funding for urban regeneration and development, which will become available from 2019, is additional to the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) and at this preliminary stage, it would be expected that urban regeneration initiatives leveraged by the funding being made available would include the provision of the homes required in the cores of our cities and towns.<\/p><p>The overall purpose of the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund is therefore to achieve sustainable growth in Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other larger urban centres, complementing the similar focus of the rural regeneration and development fund being developed by the Department of Rural and Community Development.<\/p><p>Given that Project Ireland 2040's significant policy shift towards securing more compact and sustainable urban and rural development will require significantly more effective land management in key development areas, it is proposed to establish a National Regeneration and Development Agency to assist in ensuring a more effective approach to strategic land management, particularly in terms of publicly owned land.  The Agency will act as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests, to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects.<\/p><p>The detailed arrangements in relation to the establishment, location, staffing and powers of the Agency will be finalised as quickly as possible.  At this point, however, I envisage that the Agency would be tightly focused and would seek to work primarily through the statutory powers of the stakeholders it is being established to assist, such as the local authorities who already have extensive powers to acquire, compulsorily if necessary, lands for development and to deliver infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700058#WRA03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":49,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700058#WRA03750"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[9673\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700058#WRA03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans for further social housing projects in County Meath.","asker":"1225","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":51,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[9674\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700058#WRA03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of a new scheme of social housing in Kells, County Meath.","asker":"1225","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":52,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 56 together.<\/p><p>Social housing need, is in the first instance, a local issue and local authorities must respond to the nature and extent of that local need by devising and implementing appropriate targeted proposals that best fit the specific needs in their areas. <\/p><p>For that purpose, my Department has put in place the structures and funding required for the early advancement of social housing supply proposals put forward by local authorities, including Meath County Council. &euro;6 billion in exchequer investment has been secured to support the social housing targets under Rebuilding Ireland and to deliver 50,000 social housing units through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, over the period to 2021. <\/p><p>In relation to social housing developments, the latest status report for social housing construction projects,\u00a0as at end Q3 2017, contains key information on current social housing construction activity\u00a0in all local authority areas.

It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.<\/p>  <p>  In August 2017,\u00a0my Department published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings, where concerns arise.

It is to deliver 1,500 social housing units in total, via three bundles. The first bundle, as referred to by the Deputy, comprises a total of six PPP sites, and will provide over 500 units in the Greater Dublin Area. The tender documents were issued to the three candidates in December 2017 and the dialogue period is presently on-going. Tenders for this bundle are due to be submitted in June 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the value for money (VFM) for this project, the Central PPP Unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provides guidance in relation to PPP projects. It sets out four specific VFM tests that are applied in the case of PPPs over the course of the planning and procurement process. These tests focus on assessing whether or not the PPP approach compares favourably with the alternative cost of using traditional procurement to achieve the same result. The purpose, sequence and format of the four VFM tests in the PPP approval process are set out clearly in the central PPP guidance.<\/p>  <p>  Bundle 1 of the Social Housing PPP Programme is at a stage whereby it has successfully met the criteria under the first two of these VFM tests.

Since the national roll out, my Department has been working intensively with local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to develop and implement the scheme. There have been a number of national and local press advertising initiatives, as well as\u00a0targeted\u00a0online promotion, in an effort to ensure that property owners who can benefit from the scheme are aware of the benefits.<\/p><p>I can confirm that at the end of 2017, applications in respect of a total of 820 houses had been received by local authorities nationwide. A total of 41 applications have been received\u00a0across the four Dublin local authorities, with\u00a026 of these properties\u00a0being deemed suitable for social housing, and 7 unsuitable, following an initial evaluation.

All local authorities are active in sourcing and identifying potential properties and it is expected that significant numbers of contracts will be entered into once that process is complete. Once contracts are signed, delivery is estimated at between 2 and 6 months, a fraction of the time involved for\u00a0a capital acquisition or build project.<\/p><p>Feedback from local authorities indicates that, in many cases, properties requiring extensive repair work, and therefore not suitable\u00a0for the\u00a0RLS, have been secured under the Buy and Renew Scheme which facilitates local authorities or\u00a0AHBs to purchase vacant properties for social housing use. In addition, anecdotal evidence suggests that the levels of vacancy recorded as part of Census 2016 have significantly reduced in the interim, particularly in urban areas like Dublin where many\u00a0previously vacant\u00a0homes have since been occupied. <\/p><p>It is clear from end 2017 output, that RLS has not yet delivered the level of new social housing homes envisaged. I have reviewed the operation of the scheme, as part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, and\u00a0I have concluded that the scheme has significant potential but there are areas where it can be improved to make it more attractive and effective. At the Housing Summit held on 22 January 2018, local authority Chief Executives were advised\u00a0that, from 1 February 2018, a number of key changes\u00a0were being made\u00a0to the scheme.

Accordingly, under the vacant site levy provisions, there will be a cumulative effect associated with not activating a site for development purposes for each year that a site remains vacant or idle.<\/p>  <p>  As announced in Budget 2018, it is proposed to increase the rate of levy from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020 in respect of sites included on the local vacant site registers in 2019. Legislative provision for this increase along with amendments to other relevant provisions will be tabled by way of Seanad amendments to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016, which is presently at Seanad Committee Stage. These amendments are currently being drafted by my Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to addressing the issue of the hoarding of residentially zoned land, a number of amendments to the provisions relating to the extension of duration of planning permissions have also been tabled in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016. The amendments proposed are collectively aimed at tightening up the provisions in relation to the extension of duration of planning permissions and ensuring that extensions of duration, without commencing substantial development, will no longer be facilitated.<\/p>  <p>  Following a commitment given in Budget 2015, a public consultation was conducted by the Department of Finance on the issue of unused zoned and serviced land with a view to examining what taxation measures might be taken to penalise land owners who do not develop such land.\u00a0 On considering the outcome of the public consultation and further to the enactment of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 which introduced the vacant site levy, the Department of Finance determined that no new tax intended to encourage the development of residentially zoned and serviced land - separate to the vacant site levy - would be introduced at that time. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to a land tax, in the 2012 Report of the Inter-departmental Group on the Design of a Local Property Tax (the \"Thornhill Group\"), the basis of assessment for the Local Property Tax (LPT) was comprehensively examined, including both the \"taxable value of the property\" option and a site value tax (SVT). The report favoured the use of market value of residential properties as the basis of assessment and this recommendation was accepted by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Thornhill Group concluded that the arguments for SVT were outweighed by the likely difficulties in ensuring acceptance by taxpayers, i.e. arriving at values that were evidence based, understandable and acceptable to the public in addition to complexities and uncertainties in the valuation effort necessary to put an SVT in place. In contrast, the Group considered that, under a market value approach applied to housing, the market value of a residential property would be related to the characteristics of the building itself, the site on which it was located and the characteristics and amenities of the neighbourhood. There would be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owners in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the properties. <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, at the request of the Minister for Finance, the operation of the LPT was reviewed in 2015 by Dr. Thornhill. A number of submissions to the review favoured changing the basis of determination of LPT liabilities to site value, floor area or variations thereof. Dr. Thornhill considered these but remained of the view that market value is the most appropriate and equitable basis on which to determine LPT liabilities.<\/p>  <p>  Tax issues are a matter for the\u00a0Minister for Finance and neither I nor my\u00a0Department have been lobbied in relation to the possible introduction of a land tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700059#WRB03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Accommodation","counter":116,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700059#WRB03350"},{"type":"question","counter":117,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[9712\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700059#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of student accommodation units built or planned in the Dublin 1, 3 and 7 areas since 2014 up until Q4 2017, in tabular form.","asker":"1291","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":118,"content":"<p>To support and drive increased student accommodation delivery, my Department has implemented several measures under the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, including fast-tracking planning applications directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for student accommodation projects of 200 or more bed spaces, and facilitating low-cost funding availability from the Housing Finance Agency to the higher education institutes specifically for student accommodation projects.

understanding of what it is doing on their behalf, what their entitlements are, and the workings of Government in general.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">In support of this objective, the Government has approved a list of policy areas for which citizen-focussed information campaigns will be run.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">These campaigns are funded from the &euro;5 million budget allocated to strategic communications.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">As an overarching policy initiative, with significant reach, Project Ireland 2040 is the most important information campaign which will be run in 2018.  Given the &euro;116 billion taxpayer spend envisaged, the Government believes that it is essential that citizens understand how and where this investment will be made and how it will impact on their lives.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">To this end, a comprehensive citizen awareness programme has been developed for the plan, with the goal of informing as many citizens as possible, creating awareness of the plan and enhancing citizen engagement with the detail in it relating to their lives.  While the full spend will not be finalised until the end of the campaign, an indicative budget of &euro;1.5m has been allocated from within the overall &euro;5 million allocation.  The cost for the launch event for the plan was approximately &euro;45,000 ex vat.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  This is a multi-faceted, year-long communications programme, co-ordinated by the Strategic Communications Unit (SCU) in my Department, which <\/font>uses existing contracts (agency, media buying etc) and<font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> includes the following aspects:<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">- Comprehensive briefings from cross-Government Senior Officials<\/font><\/p><p>- Regional Launch Events<\/p><p>- Sectoral Forums<\/p><p>- County Forums<\/p><p>- Online communications programme<\/p><p>- Production of informational videos<\/p><p>- National and Regional Outdoor campaign<\/p><p>- National and Local Print Media - Content Partnerships<\/p><p>- Cinema Campaign<\/p><p>- Content Partnership with Regional and National Radio Stations.<\/p><p>No TV Advertising is included in this information programme.<\/p><p>In keeping with previous National Development Plans, Project Ireland 2040 is being communicated to citizens through media partnerships. \u00a0Content partnerships have been established with the following media outlets:<\/p><p>- Irish Times<\/p><p>- INM Group<\/p><p>- Examiner Group<\/p><p>- Journal Media<\/p><p>- 30 Regional Newspapers<\/p><p>- 28 Local and National Radio Stations<\/p><p>The media buying process to enable this was handled by a third party media buying organization, appointed via an open procurement competition.<\/p><p>As with previous National Development Plans, all stories run under media partnerships are clearly identifiable as\u00a0such.<\/p><p>Each media organisation was provided with a content pack relating to Project Ireland 2040.  Any decisions relating to editorial style were entirely a matter for each organisation.  The SCU had no input in selecting or contacting any external or third party interviewees.  The SCU had no direct contact with regional media organizations.<\/p><p>In general, funding for campaigns will come from the Strategic Communications budget.  In some cases, there will be a 50\/50 split with the relevant Government Department, depending on the nature and scope of the campaign.  As regards printing costs for Project Ireland 2040, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was responsible for the printing costs associated for the National Development Plan and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government was responsible for the costs associated with printing of the National Planning Framework.<\/p><p>Project Ireland 2040 was launched in Sligo IT on Friday February 16th 2018.  Events of the day included a Government meeting to approve the plan, the actual launch of the plan and a number of media engagements carried out by myself and the Cabinet.  My Department was responsible for all planning and arrangements for the day.  This involved attendance by the following:<\/p><p>- 7 Cabinet Secretariat\/Protocol staff to support the Cabinet meeting<\/p><p>- 9 SCU staff to support the launch<\/p><p>- 5 Officials\/advisers with policy responsibility<\/p><p>- 5 Press Officers to support media engagements<\/p><p>As the launch is very recent, payments such as travel and subsistence and hotel accommodation have not yet been processed through our financial system.<\/p><p>In addition to the campaign for Project Ireland 2040 outlined above, the Strategic Communications Unit utilises all media in the course of the delivery of Government priority campaigns.  The choice of media is informed by the nature, subject and reach of the campaign.  As part of the Healthy Ireland Campaign, the SCU with their colleagues in the Department of Health, formed a media content partnership with a national daily newspaper to produce health supplements as part of the campaign.  Similarly, the Unit worked with the Department of Education and Skills on a supplement in a national daily newspaper as part of the Action Plan for Education.<\/p><p>Costs for these media content partnerships are as follows:<table><tr><th>Newspaper<\/th><th>Campaign<\/th><th>Cost<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Independent<\/td><td>Healthy Ireland<\/td><td>&euro;96,300 ex vat<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Irish Independent<\/td><td>Action Plan for Education<\/td><td>&euro;8,600  ex vat<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The Project Ireland 2040 campaign is ongoing and is subject to regular review.

The barbarity of the attacks by the Syrian regime on its own people, the deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, including homes, hospitals and schools, and the refusal of the Assad regime to allow humanitarian aid in, or injured civilians to leave, has been shocking, even by the standards of the Syria conflict to date. <\/p>  <p>  I can only imagine how terrifying this is for the people there, who have no way to protect themselves or their children, and no way to leave.<\/p>  <p>  On numerous occasions in this House, I have condemned the violence in Syria and I reiterate that condemnation in the strongest terms today.<\/p>  <p>  I attended a UN Security Council briefing on this issue in New York last week, where UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres appealed for an immediate suspension of violence in Eastern Ghouta to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid, and for evacuations. Ireland strongly endorsed this call, and welcomed the adoption of a UN Security Council resolution on Saturday that called for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access. However, the bombardment of Eastern Ghouta has continued in defiance of this resolution. The international community must redouble its efforts to press for a full and immediate ceasefire, and unhindered humanitarian access to besieged populations in Syria. <\/p>  <p>  The brutal repression of dissent by the Assad regime since March 2011 has cost the lives of almost half a million people so far. Over 13 million people require humanitarian assistance, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas. In addition, 5.5 million Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries and the region. <\/p>  <p>  The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, including through use of &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; techniques, forced displacement under the guise of truces, denial of humanitarian assistance and deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure such as schools, markets and hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  Clearly an end to the conflict, and to Assad&rsquo;s barbarous rule, is urgently needed. Ireland fully supports the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which call for an end to violence; full humanitarian access, a democratic political transition and accountability and transitional justice.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures. <\/p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Syria at their informal meeting on 15 February and again at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 26 February. Ireland added its voice to calls for the immediate and full implementation of the ceasefire demanded by the UN Security Council.  <\/p>  <p>  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-brokered talks in Geneva and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. The EU and its Member States have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.4 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort. The EU hosted a donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in April 2017 at which pledges totalling &euro;5.6 billion were made, and will host another donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in April 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the humanitarian effort in response to the conflict in Syria, including &euro;25 million in 2017 alone. Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the Syria crisis. Ireland also supports a broad range of efforts to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700064#WRG00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Data","counter":253,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700064#WRG00900"},{"type":"question","counter":254,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[9292\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700064#WRG01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of freedom of information requests the Department has received in the past eight years; the number of which were accepted without further escalation and not accepted respectively; the number requested which were not accepted that were escalated to the information commissioner; the number on which the information commissioner ruled in favour of the person requesting the freedom of information; the number on which the information commissioner ruled against the Department; the number the Department appealed to the High Court; the number on which the High Court ruled against the Department in favour of the applicant; the number which were then brought to the Court of Appeal by the Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":255,"content":"<p>The Office of the Information Commissioner keeps the operation of the Freedom of Information Act under review and publishes relevant statistics in its Annual Reports.

In particular, there are serious concerns about the Israeli military court system which is used in relation to Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including children. The same system does not apply to Israeli settlers in the same geographical area. These courts have a near-one hundred percent conviction rate, a statistic which raises serious questions about the system&rsquo;s compliance with international standards of due process.Ireland has raised our concerns at EU level and in international fora. In the most recent Universal Periodic Review of Israel, which took place last month, Ireland raised the issue of administrative detention, and made recommendations on the rights of detainees. During my visit to the Middle East last month, I raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the detention of minors directly with the Israeli authorities, including the issues of night-time arrests and blindfolding. Ireland also provides financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs who are active in bringing these issues to light.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specific case raised by the Deputy, the minor was not arrested directly after the incident, but an arrest later took place following political attention being paid to the case in Israel. The arrest was carried out in the middle of the night, and later broadcast on Israeli television. This raises serious concerns. <\/p>  <p>  Irish and other EU diplomats have attended the person in question&rsquo;s hearings in the military court, as this case has developed. The handling of this case so far is worrying. The minor is being held in Israel, which makes family visits very difficult. She is being held without bail pending trial, which may result in a very long period of detention, on the basis that she is a danger to public safety. This allegation lacks serious credibility.<\/p>  <p>  The individual&rsquo;s mother and other family members have themselves been arrested and held.

I am further advised that in certain circumstances, hearings or determination can take place in respect of part of an appeal; however the appeal will remain open until all issues are concluded.

In the last year, the TAC has arranged over 200 of these informal hearings which would have directly dealt with 826 individual appeals, notwithstanding that the outcomes of these may have impacted upon other appeals also. Although some remain to take place, the TAC has been able to proceed with 135 informal hearings in relation to 618 individual appeals.

At its simplest, an individual who might otherwise be engaged as an employee by the end-user of his or her services provides the services to the end-user through an intermediary.  Typically the intermediary used in such circumstances is a company.  The company can take the form of a personal services company (PSC), with only one worker who is also a director.  The company earns all, or almost all, of its income from supplying the services of the worker\/director to the end user.  A variation on the PSC arrangement is a managed service company (MSC), which supplies the services of more than one individual.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the UK tax authority, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has recently been successful in the appeal case referred to by the Deputy. This appeal was taken by an intermediary company which had a contract with a television company in relation to the provision of the services of a journalist.<\/p>  <p>  The appeal case related to a charge to tax and national insurance contributions arising under specific UK tax and social security legislation relating to the supply of a person&rsquo;s services through an intermediary.  In summary, Chapter 8 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act, 2003 and the Social Security Contributions (Intermediaries) Regulations 2000 provide that where the services of an individual are supplied through an intermediary to an end-user in certain circumstances, the intermediary company is required to treat all payments and benefits, including for example dividends, made to that individual as employment earnings and to deduct and remit PAYE income tax and national insurance contributions accordingly. Those circumstances are where the individual would be regarded for income tax and national insurance purposes as an employee of the end-user if the services were provided under a contract directly between the end-user and the individual. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that we have no comparable legislation in Ireland governing the taxation of individuals engaged through intermediary companies.  As a consequence, there is no basis for Revenue to seek to ignore contractual arrangements entered into by such a company and to apply the tax treatment that gave rise to the appeal.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the question of an investigation or audit, I am further advised by Revenue that it cannot comment on matters relating to any specific identified taxpayer or narrowly defined group of taxpayers.  However, in the absence of legislation similar to that referred to above, there is no statutory basis for Revenue to take the approach that gave rise to the recent UK appeal.<\/p>  <p>  In January I, along with my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, published a report informed by the public consultation on the use of intermediary-type structures and self-employment arrangements. The consultation invited submissions on possible measures to address the loss to the Exchequer that may arise under various scenarios including where an individual, who would otherwise be an employee of an end user, provide his or her services to that end user through an intermediary vehicle.<\/p>  <p>  The report concludes that the major part of the Exchequer loss is attributable to the much lower social insurance contribution payable by self-employed individuals as compared with aggregate total social insurance contribution paid by and in respect of employees.  It therefore recommends that the most effective step to take is to consider reducing the differential in social insurance rates.  <\/p>  <p>  The report also examined options to address this challenge by providing that, in certain circumstances where an individual is engaged through an intermediary and that engagement bears the characteristics of dependent employment by the end user of the person&rsquo;s services, that end-user would be required to deduct income tax and PRSI under the PAYE system. The report recommended that such proposals should be further explored and would have potential to reduce the scope for aggressive tax planning.  <\/p>  <p>  I am examining these recommendations along with my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700066#WRJ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Costs","counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700066#WRJ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":340,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[9579\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700066#WRJ02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the steps being taken to address the exceptionally high motor insurance premiums being charged to returning emigrants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1339","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":341,"content":"<p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to review individual cases as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that should apply in such cases.  <\/p>  <p>  However, I wish to inform the Deputy that issues faced by returned emigrants, both from EU and non-EU countries, featured prominently in the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s examination of the motor insurance sector.  Accordingly, Recommendation 6 of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance aims to address the problems faced by this category of drivers.  Pursuant to this recommendation, a protocol has been agreed between the Department and Insurance Ireland under which insurance companies have committed to accepting the driving experience returning emigrants gained while abroad, when the driver has had previous driving experience in Ireland.  The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated any differently to any other driver subject to their ability to demonstrate, and the insurance company to verify, continuous driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  What this means is that the returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein or, indeed, whether the country is a member of the EU or not.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, insurance companies have agreed to provide relevant and helpful information on their websites to make it easier for consumers to understand the implications of their move abroad from a motor insurance perspective.  As part of this exercise, they will outline what people need to do under a number of different circumstances depending on the length of time they intend being away from Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland submitted a report on the implementation of this recommendation to the Department of Finance on 22 December 2017.  This report confirmed that Insurance Ireland members have agreed to publish the wording of the agreed protocol on their company websites and any other forms of social media, in addition to providing training for staff who can work through issues with emigrants before they leave, whilst they are out of the country and when they return to Ireland.  The stated intention is &ldquo;to resolve any issues well before they arise and for the consumer to be aware of the considerations when moving abroad&rdquo;.  The wording of the agreed protocol is also available on the Insurance Ireland website. <\/p>  <p>  The report also outlines some sample cases which demonstrate how the rolling-out of the protocol has already led to disputed cases being resolved to the benefit of returning emigrants, and provides figures indicating that the number of such cases being processed under the Declined Cases Agreement is decreasing.<\/p>  <p>  If, however, a returning emigrant is unable to secure a motor insurance quotation on the open market, they may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement process, and the relevant contact details are: declined@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.

The event, which was hosted by my colleague Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, is now in its third year and is a key deliverable as part of the Government&rsquo;s International Financial Services 2020 (IFS2020) Strategy. The organisation and execution of the Forum is the responsibility of IDA Ireland, with input where required from Departments and agencies as part of IFS2020.<\/p>  <p>  The international financial services (IFS) industry is an important pillar of the Irish economy, directly employing over 42,000 people across the country. The employment is a mix of those working for international firms that have chosen to locate activities in Ireland and indigenous Irish firms that export internationally traded financial services.<\/p>  <p>  The current Government Strategy for the IFS sector, IFS2020, was developed in 2015 to address the challenges of growing the sector at a time of unprecedented change. The IFS2020 Strategy is led by Minister D&rsquo;Arcy with the purpose of protecting and growing employment in IFS companies in the IDA and Enterprise Ireland portfolio. The vision of IFS2020 is for Ireland to be the location of choice for specialist international financial services, building on our strengths in talent, technology, innovation and excellent client services, while focusing on capturing new opportunities in a changing market and embracing the highest forms of governance.<\/p>  <p>  The EFF 2018 was a tremendous success with over 700 domestic and international delegates in attendance. The core function of the event is to promote Ireland as a location for IFS. This is achieved by bringing together the leading organisations in the public and private sector to discuss the future of the European financial system. In doing so, the Forum highlights the commitment of the Government of Ireland to the European project and the range of IFS activities that are carried out from here. The Forum also highlights the commitment of the Government of Ireland to the sector and the partnership approach it adopts with industry to grow the sector in Dublin and throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  The 2018 Forum was opened by An Taoiseach and featured keynote addresses from Philip Lane; Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, Colm Kelleher; President of Morgan Stanley, and Beno&igrave;t C&oelig;ur&eacute;; Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank to name a few.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Forum, I had the pleasure of delivering a keynote closing address and having an on-stage conversation alongside Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, also in charge of Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union at the European Commission. This provided the opportunity for both the Vice President and I to share our perspectives on the policy and regulatory developments impacting financial services in Europe today and in the year ahead. It was particularly notable as the Vice President delivered his first public remarks on the final report of the High Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, an area of key importance for the future of finance. Ireland offers a unique blend of expertise and a proven track record in the area of green and sustainable finance, with a globally-recognised cluster of talent in renewable energy finance and experience in green asset management, and I welcomed the Vice President&rsquo;s statement.<\/p>  <p>  The European Financial Forum, as a Government-led initiative, is a unique event that is emerging as a fixture in the international media. Having the Forum as an annual event serves as a focal point for the work of the IFS2020 strategy and provides a platform to respond to significant events such as Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Preliminary planning for the 2019 Forum is currently underway, led once again by IDA Ireland. We hope that the 2019 EFF will build on the continued success of the EFF as a showcase for Ireland&rsquo;s financial services environment and Ireland as a location for high-quality investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700067#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Claims","counter":360,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700067#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":361,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[9784\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700067#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of claimants in respect of a company (details supplied); when they can expect to receive 100% of claims as announced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":362,"content":"<p>Setanta\u00a0was placed into liquidation by the Malta Financial Services Authority on 30 April 2014.

This is an EU competency and the Government has committed to work with our EU counterparts in seeking to reform this area. <\/p>  <p>  Defibrillators, other than implantable defibrillators, are liable to VAT at the standard rate, which in Ireland is 23%. Parts or accessories are also liable to VAT at the standard rate. There is no provision under existing VAT law that would make it possible to apply a reduced rate or zero rate to the supply of such products. Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rate on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.

month accounting period.\u00a0 This means that collection of the tax is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime for sales of certain solid fuels operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and enforced by local authorities.\u00a0 I understand that there is ongoing contact between Revenue and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in relation to this area.<\/p><p>Data is not available on the amount of solid fuel sold between Northern Ireland and this State.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The serious threat that fiscal fraud poses to legitimate business, to consumers and the Exchequer is recognised and I am advised by Revenue that tackling this criminal activity has been one of its priorities over recent years.\u00a0 There is extensive formal and informal cooperation in place between Revenue and the UK tax authority, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), which is the responsible tax authority in Northern Ireland.\u00a0 Where appropriate, this also includes An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.\u00a0 The aim of this cooperation is to target the organised crime groups responsible for a large proportion of criminal activity, including activities aimed at combatting fiscal fraud as it relates to a range of excisable products such as mineral oils, tobacco products and alcohol.\u00a0 The setting up in 2016, within the framework of &ldquo;A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan&rdquo;, of a Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts was a further step in supporting and facilitating such cross border cooperation.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Mutual Assistance procedures are also in place in both Revenue and HMRC which can support specific compliance interventions (including audits) relating to the tax affairs of any specific person.<\/p><p>I am advised that there has not, to date, been specific consultation between Revenue and HMRC in relation to the carbon tax and VAT aspects of the solid fuel sector.\u00a0 In this regard it should be noted that there is not, at present, a comparable carbon tax regime in place in Northern Ireland for the sale of solid fuels.<\/p><p>Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office, and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat both the illicit fuel and tobacco trades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700068#WRL00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Meetings","counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700068#WRL01000"},{"type":"question","counter":399,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[10032\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700068#WRL01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of times he or representatives from his Department have met with an organisation (details supplied) in 2016 and 2017.","asker":"1259","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":400,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy's question, the number of times that I, Ministers of State of the Department, or representatives from my Department have met with IBEC are 8 in 2016 and 9 in 2017.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700068#WRL01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stamp Duty","counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700068#WRL01300"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[10125\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700068#WRL01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the rate of stamp duty payable in a case (details supplied);

Having visited the area the following day I saw at first hand the extensive damage and disruption caused by this flood event, particularly to the community in the Inishowen Peninsula area. <\/p><p>A national study to assess and propose measures to manage Ireland&rsquo;s flood risk is being undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW) through its Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. The CFRAM Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, designated in 2012 as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The flood risk for each of these areas has been assessed, through detailed engineering techniques to assess their risk and impact from flooding. This risk and the proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified to manage that risk are outlined in the Flood Risk Management Plans. <\/p><p>Carndonagh, Clonmany and Buncrana-Luddan are three communities that have been studied as part of the North Western &ndash; Neagh Bann CFRAM Programme.<\/p><p>In relation to Carndonagh, the Plans propose measures consisting of using storage areas along with a series of embankments and walls along the Donagh River. Improved channel conveyance would protect properties impacted by flooding from the Carndonagh watercourse and hard defences would protect properties impacted by flooding from the Glennagannon River. Proposed plans for Buncrana &ndash; Luddan consists of a series of sea walls, flood embankments and floodwalls to protect against coastal and fluvial flood events. <\/p><p>While the houses in question in Elm Park are in the Buncrana &amp;amp; Luddan AFA, the current proposed measures does not protect these houses. However, when a scheme for Buncrana &amp;amp; Luddan is progressed to detailed design, the August 2017 flood events will inform the extent of the measures to be implemented to mitigate flood risk in the area.<\/p><p>Flood Relief Schemes will be subject to project-level development and assessment. Future development and the detailed design for the schemes will take account of recent flood events.<\/p><p>As the flood risk in Clonmany was assessed as relatively low no structural flood relief schemes are proposed, at this time. The Plans set out those non-structural measures in place or proposed that can benefit all at risk communities and properties, including emergency response, national flood forecasting, individual property protection and community resilience. <\/p><p>Local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address. Donegal County Council may carry out flood mitigation works using its own resources. The Council may also apply to the Office of Public Works for funding of flood mitigation works under this Office's Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme. The purpose of this scheme, introduced in 2009, is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. The OPW has approved 32 Minor Works schemes in Donegal at a cost of &euro;1.2m. Details of these schemes are on the OPW website<i>, <\/i><i><i>www.opw.ie<\/i><\/i><\/p><p>In summer 2017, the OPW finalised all Plans and each Plan was submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D\/PER) for an independent review of the environmental assessments.

These areas were all stable in terms of population growth, so no new school places were required. However sufficient demand for more choice emerged in 28 areas, including in New Ross. <\/p>  <p>  In the majority of the 28 areas surveyed where sufficient demand emerged, including New Ross, the level of parental demand for a wider choice indicated a size of a four classroom school being required to accommodate such a level of demand.<\/p>  <p>  Under the patronage divesting process, a school could be opened where a school building became, or was due to become, available as a result of an amalgamation\/closure of an existing school.  In some areas, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable make school properties available, my Department also included an examination of properties held in public ownership.<\/p>  <p>  In order to facilitate the opening of these schools, their initial establishment, as with most new schools, has been in temporary start-up accommodation, pending a permanent school building being made available.  All schools, irrespective of their location, have to operate within their available accommodation and manage annual pupil intake accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  The initial establishment of these schools as four-classroom schools and the need to be cognisant of managing the available accommodation has been reflected in my Department&rsquo;s engagement with the patron body of the schools, Educate Together.  Indeed, a case has been submitted by Educate Together to my Department to further expand New Ross ETNS and four other schools opened under the patronage divesting process and this is currently under consideration.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently carrying out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to identify areas of demographic growth and determine where additional school accommodation is needed in order to plan for school provision nationwide and this work is almost complete.  In this context, the outcome of the nationwide demographic exercises will input into consideration of the case submitted by Educate Together. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has announced a new Patronage Reconfiguration process, which will accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools, to reach 400 multi-denominational and non-denominational schools by 2030.

It is intended that this could be done through some premium in capitation grants for schools.<\/p><p>I do recognise the need to improve capitation funding for schools having regard to the reductions that were necessary over recent years. Budget 2018 marks the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish Education and Training service the best in Europe within a decade.  In 2018, the budget for my Department will increase by &euro;554 million to over &euro;10 billion. One of the actions of the 2016-2019 Action Plan is to restore capitation as resources permit.

I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers. The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the changes I negotiated together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511, at a cost of over &euro;200 million across the public service.<\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010. It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  A commitment is included in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 to consider the issue of newly qualified pay within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.

In this regard, my Department is currently carrying out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to identify areas of demographic growth and determine where additional school accommodation is needed in order to plan for school provision nationwide and this work is almost complete. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700074#WRR03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Admissions","counter":643,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700074#WRR03100"},{"type":"question","counter":644,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[10044\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700074#WRR03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when an application for change of status from a girls only school to a coeducational school by a school (details supplied) made on 7 February 2018 will be decided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":645,"content":"<p>I wish to confirm that an application from the school referred to by the Deputy, in respect of a change of status from a junior mixed\/senior girls school to fully vertical co-educational school, was received earlier this month, by my Department.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>In regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.  In addition, as you will appreciate, in order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management have the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs and address critical issues as they arise.  For this reason, the number of Garda available in any one Garda Station on a particular day is subject to the operational requirements of the overall Division.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware Carrigaline Garda Station forms part of the Togher District.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Togher District on 31 January 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 120 of whom 6 are designated Community Garda.  There are also 3 Garda Reserves and 11 Garda civilian staff attached to the Togher District.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 10 have been assigned to the Togher District.  I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda District, including the Togher District.<\/p><p>In relation to the number of &quot;Community Garda&iacute;&quot; it is important to recognise that community policing is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  The official categorisation as a &quot;Community Garda&quot; simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities including through the giving of talks to schools, community groups and others.  It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.<\/p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Overall the Model advocates a partnership based, pro-active, community-orientated style of policing.  It is focused on crime prevention, problem-solving and law enforcement, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life of the entire community.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies. <\/p><p>As part of the Community Policing Model An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work in partnership with local communities, to prevent and deter crime through initiatives such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, Text Alert and the Garda Schools Programme as well as through more formal structures such as Joint Policing Committees.<\/p><p>The Community Policing Model also places a strong emphasis on Crime Prevention and within each Garda Division, where there are specialist Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs), who are trained to encourage, promote and advise on crime prevention within communities.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Engagement Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network. <\/p><p>I have previously stated that I welcome the strong emphasis that the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District.  In terms of progress on this important initiative, I am informed that a draft Community Policing Framework which outlines the manner in which Community Policing Teams will be established has been completed and is subject to internal review before being approved by the Garda Executive for implementation.<\/p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out in tabular form the total Garda strength and the Community Garda strength of Carrigaline Garda station for the years 2009 - 2017, and as of 31 January 2018.

During the section 115A court review, the court considers the reasonableness of the refusal using a balanced range of criteria and has power, if satisfied, to impose the proposed personal insolvency arrangement on the dissenting creditor(s).  This court based review effectively removes the so called &ldquo;Bank Veto&rdquo;.<\/p><p>Since the introduction of the section 115A court review, 78 cases have been approved by the courts in favour of the debtor.<\/p><p>Currently, there are over 500 cases before the courts.\u00a0 A significant High Court judgment in early February addressed two key issues that had become a logjam in the process.  Namely, technical issues around the application for a court review and a fear from personal insolvency practitioners that creditors might pursue them for costs in a personal capacity.\u00a0 These issues have now been adequately addressed.  The judgment has been positively received by both the Insolvency Service of Ireland and Personal Insolvency Practitioners.

In assessing if this unfairly prejudiced,\u00a0the financial institution (a fund rather than a bank), the court held that\u00a0it was appropriate to compare with market investment returns rather than with\u00a0the interest rates and terms that are available to a bank which also has to\u00a0raise capital.

The Personal Insolvency Arrangement, in particular, is an innovative solution that seeks to restructure or settle secured debt. Other important elements of this framework include the statutory protections regarding the debtor's reasonable living expenses and their home.<\/p>  <p>  Since its establishment in 2013, the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI)\u00a0has returned over 6,000 debtors to solvency with over 2,000 of those cases being Personal Insolvency Arrangements (PIAs) which deal with mortgage debt. In over 90% of these PIA cases, debtors have been able to stay in their homes.  This is a significant achievement given that many cases involved arrears exceeding 720 days.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the solutions introduced in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 have served as a catalyst for over 120,000 informal agreements between debtors and creditors, as reported by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Debtors now have realistic alternative options available to them through the ISI if negotiations break down.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a number of amendments and supports, since 2012, to ensure the success of the solutions provided by the personal insolvency legislation.  These include the section 115A court review process and the Abhaile Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service.<\/p>  <p>  The section 115A court review process permits a debtor to ask the Court to review and assess the reasonableness of a rejected PIA and, where satisfied as to its reasonableness, make an order confirming the PIA proposal.\u00a0 This removes the so-called &ldquo;Bank Veto&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Another important enhancement is Abhaile, the Government&rsquo;s national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service.  This was introduced in 2016 to ensure that people who are in danger of losing their home have access to free professional advice, including advice from a personal insolvency practitioner.  In addition to detailed financial advice, Abhaile offers legal advice to homeowners in mortgage arrears with the aim of allowing them to find a solution to their arrears and to stay in their homes where possible.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2016, the Abhaile Scheme has engaged with over 10,000 people in mortgage arrears, most of them in the chronic arrears category over 360 or 720 days in arrears.  Up to 19 February 2018, Abhaile has provided:\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - financial advice and negotiation help &ndash; through Dedicated Mortgage Advisers working with MABS &ndash; to over 4,900 borrower households in home mortgage arrears;<\/p>  <p>  - vouchers for professional financial advice and help on home mortgage arrears from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, to 8,292 borrowers;<\/p>  <p>  - vouchers for legal advice on home mortgage arrears from a Legal Aid Board solicitor, to 2,285 borrowers;<\/p>  <p>  - help from a duty solicitor for unrepresented borrowers before a County Registrar&rsquo;s court on home repossession, to over 3,340 borrowers.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also finalising a review of the operation of the Personal Insolvency Acts.  The review is taking place under section 141 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which requires the Minister for Justice and Equality (in consultation with the Minister for Finance) to review the operation of Part 3 of the 2012 Act, and responds to a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government.<\/p>  <p>  Submissions made by stakeholders via a public consultation on the operation of Part Three of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 contain a range of recommendations to enhance the process and to support increased engagement with the personal insolvency system.  These submissions are being analysed and considered by my Department as part of the review along with recent developments in personal insolvency, including recent High Court judgments related to the process.  I look forward to bringing proposals to Government in the coming months to address the conclusions of the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700076#WRT02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":717,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700076#WRT02900"},{"type":"question","counter":718,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[9357\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700076#WRT03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of an asylum application by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":719,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned\u00a0is the subject of a\u00a0deportation order made on 16 December 2010. <\/p>  <p>  Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned requesting that the deportation order be revoked, pursuant to the provisions of section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). \u00a0All relevant aspects of the case will be considered before a decision is made.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy might wish to note that the decision to ensue from the consideration of this request will be to have the existing deportation\u00a0order\u00a0&lsquo;affirmed&rsquo; or\u00a0&lsquo;revoked&rsquo;.

I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the DMR West Division on 31 January 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available, was 667 of whom 64 are designated as Community Garda&iacute;. There are also 26 Garda Reserves and 53 Garda civilian staff attached to the DMR West Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of whom 137 have been assigned to the DMR West Division.

Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that Douglas, Passage West, Bishopstown, Togher, Carrigaline, Blackrock, Anglesea Street and Crosshaven Garda Stations are located in the Cork City Division.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Cork City Division on 31 January 2018, the latest date for which information is currently available, was 666.  There are also 42 Garda Reserves and 68 Garda civilian staff attached to the Cork City Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,600 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 38 have been assigned to the Cork City Division. I am pleased to say that Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am also pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. Also 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cork City Division.<\/p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out below in tabular form the strength of the Garda stations concerned for the years 2010 to 2017 and as of 31 January

The Act sets out the statutory conditions which must be met for naturalisation.  These include that, regardless how long an applicant may have resided in the State, the applicant\u00a0must have\u00a0a period of 1 year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the 8 years immediately preceding that period, have had a further total residence amounting to 4 years (in the case of an application based on being the spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen the Act reduces this further period to 2 years during the preceding 4 years).\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The guidance notes attached to the application form inform applicants that arrangements for assessment of residence are on the basis that the person is physically resident in the State for the required period of time and that where there are significant absences from the State the application may be refused.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Where an applicant is found to be non-resident for substantial periods of time\u00a0such periods will not be reckonable for the purposes of satisfying the statutory residency conditions for naturalisation.

In this regard it is considered that\u00a0a\u00a0reasonable and generous period of up to 6 weeks\u00a0be\u00a0allowed for absences from the State for normal holidays and other short term and temporary nature absences, such as for business meetings or a family wedding or bereavement or medical emergency while abroad, and\u00a0that such short term\u00a0nature absence from the State\u00a0would not\u00a0impact on\u00a0the statutory residence requirement.

Register is held by the Examiner&rsquo;s Office, an office of the High Court. <\/p>  <p>  The question of removal from the Register is complicated by the fact that under the Bankruptcy Acts, where a person is adjudicated bankrupt his or her property will, as a general rule, automatically vest on the date of adjudication in the Official Assignee, to be realised for the benefit of creditors. <\/p>  <p>  While the bankrupt person is now, in normal course, discharged from bankruptcy after one year, any such property which has not yet been sold will, as a general rule, remain vested in the Official

For example, the Office has responded to a number of applications for relief from Restriction Orders previously made by the Courts.<\/p><p>The lower numbers in more recent years are attributable to two principal factors.<\/p><p>Firstly, as has been detailed in previous responses, the ODCE&rsquo;s enforcement strategy in recent years has been to concentrate its resources on investigating more serious indications of wrongdoing the result of which is, typically, the submission of a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for consideration. By definition, these investigations, when compared with District Court prosecutions (which make up the bulk of the earlier years&rsquo; numbers): <\/p><p>- are substantially larger in scale; <\/p><p>- are far more complex;<\/p><p>- are substantially more labour intensive, particularly as regards Garda and professional resources;<\/p><p>- typically involve the issuing of multiple Production Orders to multiple parties;<\/p><p>- typically involve multiple possible offences over multiple years;<\/p><p>- are prone to give rise to novel issues of law, for example, the interaction between criminal investigation and individuals&rsquo; privacy rights;<\/p><p>- typically involve substantial volumes of documents (often into thousands of documents from multiple sources in both hard copy and electronic form) and significant numbers of witnesses. <\/p><p>As such, investigations of this nature, for obvious reasons, take considerably longer to bring to a conclusion than is the case with District Court prosecutions. In that context, it is also important to bear in mind that, as has also been detailed in previous responses, in the case of files referred to the DPP, it is the DPP and not the ODCE that takes the decision as to whether to direct charges. Therefore, the matter of direction of charges on indictment is entirely outside the control of the ODCE.<\/p><p>Secondly, on legal advice received from Senior Counsel following two High Court judgements in disqualification applications brought by the ODCE in 2014, the ODCE suspended that programme of activity pending an appeal by the ODCE to the Court of Appeal.  In 2016, the Court of Appeal overturned the decision made by the High Court in one of these cases.  Based on the decision in the Court of Appeal, the Office has recently recommenced its programme of seeking the disqualification of directors in appropriate cases.  However, many of these are now being dealt with by way of undertakings rather than Court applications and, as such, the effect of the undertakings regime introduced by the Oireachtas in the Companies Act 2014 will be to reduce the number of people having to appear before the Courts, thereby freeing up Court time for other matters and reducing the associated costs to the individuals concerned. <\/p><p>In addition to the Court actions initiated by the ODCE, nearly 1,000 company directors have been restricted or disqualified on foot of Court applications made by liquidators over the same period.  In every one of these cases, the ODCE has first reviewed the circumstances of the case and, having examined the liquidator&rsquo;s report, has determined that the liquidator should not be relieved of the obligation to make such applications.<\/p><p>Finally, I would note that not all enforcement actions taken by the ODCE result in Court applications.  Rather, the ODCE operates a graduated approach towards enforcement, i.e., where deemed an appropriate response, indications of non-compliance are dealt with, inter alia, by way of warning, statutory direction (i.e., directing compliance) etc. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700081#WRY00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Ireland Investments","counter":865,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700081#WRY00900"},{"type":"question","counter":866,"qnumday":368,"qnumall":"[10045\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700081#WRY01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps being taken by Enterprise Ireland to foster the development of the augmented reality and virtual reality industries here; the companies that are supported; her plans to address the expansion in the sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":867,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[10049\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700081#WRY01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the conferences and events focused on augmented reality and virtual reality Enterprise Ireland has been involved in; the plans for participation by Enterprise Ireland in these events; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":868,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 368 and 372 together.<\/p><p>From an Enterprise Ireland perspective, the technology that underpins the augmented reality and virtual reality industries is currently niche and developmental.

Going forward, Enterprise Ireland would expect a greater number of companies to be involved in augmented reality and virtual reality industries, particularly in the above areas. To support these companies, Enterprise Ireland offers an array of supports and I am satisfied that these supports will assist entrepreneurs and companies in the augmented and virtual reality sectors to realise their ambitions. <\/p><p><b>- Start-Ups:<\/b>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s provides support to start-up companies to assist with business planning, mentoring and development advice, feasibility funding and finance, often in the form of equity investment, as appropriate to the founder&rsquo;s ambitions and the company&rsquo;s potential and stage of growth.<\/p><p><b>- Competitiveness:<\/b>Enterprise Ireland  recognises that Irish companies must be competitive in order to succeed in international markets.

The Act brought about major reform in the area of mental health law and practice in Ireland.  The Act which, commenced in 2006, provides safeguards for those involuntarily admitted and detained in approved centres and puts in place mechanisms for the regulation and inspection of our mental health services.\u00a0 The Act also established the Mental Health Commission.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has introduced a number of Acts amending the 2001 Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Mental Health Act 2008 was enacted on an emergency basis to deal with issues that had arisen in a court case at that time, specifically in relation to unexpired and expired renewal orders.  The immediate passing of the legislation was deemed to be necessary to reduce the possibility of impacting negatively on patient health.<\/p>  <p>  The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 introduced the definition of &lsquo;authorised person&rsquo; to the Mental Health Act 2001.\u00a0 An \"authorised person\" is a person empowered under the Act to lawfully remove persons to an approved centre.  The need to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 arose from High Court proceedings where a patient sought and was granted a declaration that her removal to a psychiatric hospital was not in accordance with the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced a significant change with regard to the administration of Electroconvulsive Therapy.  Following the commencement of this Act, where a patient who has been admitted on an involuntarily basis, has capacity and refuses ECT, that patient&rsquo;s wishes must now be respected.  Up to that point, the Mental Health Act allowed for administration of ECT to people who were &lsquo;unwilling&rsquo; to consent.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a comprehensive review of the 2001 Act by an Expert Group was published in 2015.  The previous Government accepted the thrust of the Report of that Expert Group and approved the preparation of the General Scheme of a Bill to reflect the Report&rsquo;s recommendations in revised mental health legislation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Review contains 165 recommendations and is progressive in nature. First and foremost, it sets out to promote and protect the rights of persons with mental illness.  This is in addition to promoting access to the most appropriate and highest achievable standard of care and support.<\/p>  <p>  The previous Government agreed with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Expert Group Review and approved the preparation of the General Scheme of a bill to reflect changes in revised legislation.  This work is underway at official level and is expected to be significantly progressed by mid-year.  I acknowledge that progress on finalising this work has been slower than anticipated, but it is a complex undertaking and when changes are proposed on such a large scale, we must ensure they are made in a careful and considered manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700084#WRBB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Abroad Scheme","counter":972,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700084#WRBB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":973,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[9425\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700084#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children who, while in the care of the HSE, obtained treatment in the United Kingdom in each of the years 2015, 2016 and 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":974,"content":"<p>The HSE operates the Treatment Abroad Scheme, for persons entitled to treatment in another EU\/EEA Member State or Switzerland under EU Regulation 883\/04, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulation 987\/09, and in accordance with Department of Health Guidelines. <\/p><p>The HSE hold and record statistics on the Treatment Abroad Scheme and I have asked them to reply to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700084#WRBB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland","counter":975,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700084#WRBB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":976,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[9426\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700084#WRBB01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 413 of 13 January 2018, the number of the 1,096 nurses and midwives that requested CCPS verification from the NMBI in 2017 who are mental health staff; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":977,"content":"<p>Given that this is an operational matter, it is appropriate that it should be dealt with by the NMBI.

An estimated 55,000 people in Ireland have a form of dementia, and this figure is expected to nearly treble to 150,000 by 2046.  While the majority of people with dementia are aged over 65, it is important to remember that one in ten people diagnosed with dementia are under 65.<\/p>  <p>  As a response to the increasing number of people with dementia, the Irish National Dementia Strategy was launched in December 2014.  The Strategy aims to improve dementia care to allow people with dementia to live well for as long as possible and have services and supports delivered as well as possible.  My Department and the HSE are working on a review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will be published in the\u00a0second quarter of\u00a0this year\u00a0and will identify what has been achieved so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy.  The work on the review will feed into the estimates process for 2019 and subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel with the Strategy,\u00a0a National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme (NDSIP) was\u00a0agreed by the Department of Health, the HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies.  &euro;27.5million was committed to the Programme\u00a0over a three year period across a number of initiatives, including dementia specific intensive homecare packages, an education and training programme for GPs and Primary Care Teams, and an information and awareness campaign which seeks to challenge public misconceptions about dementia and the challenges facing people living with dementia.<\/p>  <p>  In the medium term, the HSE plans to create compassionate, inclusive communities for people with dementia and their carers, by building a network of local and national partnerships under the Dementia Understand Together campaign.  Plans are progressing to further implement the\u00a0Dementia Strategy through the National Dementia Office, including in the area of diagnosis, post-diagnostic supports and care pathways.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, my Department secured &euro;1.23 million in Dormant Accounts funding to develop a number of projects which are designed to expand public awareness of dementia and to improve care for people with dementia.  These projects include a national post-diagnostic support pathway, a national dementia registry, the staffing of assistive technology libraries in all CHOs and the establishment of dementia friendly community groups.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that people with dementia continue to live their lives as fully as possible, in their own homes and communities for as long as they can.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard laboratory approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and has been agreed by experts from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and other Irish and international experts.  This testing is available in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre website (www.hpsc.ie) gives extensive information on Lyme Disease diagnosis, treatment and how to avoid tick bites.  A Lyme Disease Subcommittee of the Scientific Advisory Committee of HPSC with professional clinical, entomological, scientific and environmental health expert representation (including a representative of the Lyme Support Group, Tick-Talk Ireland) has been established to explore all possible ways of raising awareness about Lyme disease.  This Subcommittee is expected to meet shortly with a view to finalising it report.  This report will cover a number of areas, including initiatives undertaken to date, summary advice relating to awareness, preventive advice for the general public, preventive advice and material for those responsible for sites or locations known to have or suspected as having higher densities of ticks, and summary advice relating to GP management of the condition.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and  sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decison-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.<\/p><p>When the plasters were first introduced, the budget impact was low, because of the specific indication for which they are licensed.  It was therefore a cause of clinical concern that, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, as a nation, we were using more plasters than the entire UK National Health Service, with ten times our population.<\/p><p>When a treatment is intended for a small group of patients, and evidence suggests that it is being  used for many times that number, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review its use.  In 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing had been for the licensed indication.<\/p><p>Following the clinical review, and in the interest of ensuring appropriate patient care, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from 1 September 2017.  This process supports their appropriate use, ensuring that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.<\/p><p>Under the new arrangements, all patients receiving lidocaine plasters for the licensed indication, shingles, were automatically approved on the HSE system.  All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community schemes.<\/p><p>Non-shingles patients were given a three month grace period, in which their GP could move them to other treatments or apply for continued reimbursement.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients were no longer automatically reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.<\/p><p>In order for non-shingles patients to receive the patch through the community schemes, their GP must apply online for continued reimbursement approval.  If an application is refused, the GP may appeal, making a clinical case for the patient.  The HSE advises that the turnaround time for applications is three working days and for appeals it is five days.<\/p><p>As of 16 February, approximately 1,500 post-shingles patients have been approved, and the plaster is being provided to those patients in the normal manner.<\/p><p>Another 4784 non-shingles patients were registered by their GP, and 14% of these patients, 670 people, have been approved.  In addition, 284 online appeals have been made, including patients who were never registered, and over 65% of these patients have been approved.<\/p><p>Over 2300 patients are now approved for the plaster in the drug schemes, with more than 850, over one third, approved for use other than post-shingles pain, based on the clinical case made by the GP.<\/p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters. <\/p><p>The introduction of the new approval system was flagged in August 2017, when details of the proposed changes were circulated by the HSE to prescribers and pharmacies. This advice has been re-issued in the last week, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website.

This decision left approximately 20 patients without access to medication.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, the company modified its decision and agreed to continue to supply the medication free of charge for the patients on the access scheme for a further six months, or until the next clinical trial commences in 2018, but from October 2017 it would not cover the cost of administering the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the critical and exceptional circumstances, the HSE decided to facilitate a transitional arrangement, under which it would fund the necessary nursing service to ensure that patients would continue to receive the medicine until a new clinical trial commences in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Company anticipates that approximately half of the current access group of patients will be recruited into the next clinical trial in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The terms of this transitional arrangement, under which the HSE has agreed to fund the administration of the drug, includes a requirement that the lead clinician ensures that appropriate alternative treatment regimes are put in place in good time for those patients not proceeding onto the next trial.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has written to the consultant for assurance that these conditions are being complied with.<\/p>  <p>  This transitional arrangement does not alter the reimbursement decision of the HSE in relation to Respreeza.<\/p>  <p>  The company is welcome to submit a new reimbursement application, which will be assessed in line with the 2013 Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700090#WRHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Administration","counter":1199,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700090#WRHH01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1200,"qnumday":486,"qnumall":"[9940\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700090#WRHH01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an appointment for a person (details supplied) will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1201,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the\u00a0 health service. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and \u00a0sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the\u00a0localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010. <\/p><p>When the plasters were first introduced, the budget impact was low, because of the specific indication for which they are licensed.  It was therefore a cause of clinical concern that, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, as a nation, we were using more plasters than the entire UK National Health Service, with ten times our population. <\/p><p>When a treatment is intended for a small group of patients, and evidence suggests that it is being used for many times that number, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review its use.  In 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing had been for the licensed indication. <\/p><p>Following the clinical review, and in the interest of ensuring appropriate patient care, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from 1 September 2017.  This process supports their appropriate use, ensuring that post-shingles patients continue to receive this treatment.<\/p><p>Under the new arrangements, all patients receiving lidocaine plasters for the licensed indication, shingles, were automatically approved on the HSE system.  All of these patients continue to receive the treatment under the community schemes. <\/p><p>Non-shingles patients were given a three month grace period, in which their GP could move them to other treatments or apply for continued reimbursement. \u00a0However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients were no longer automatically reimbursed under the community drugs schemes.<\/p><p>In order for non-shingles patients to receive the patch through the community schemes, their GP must apply online for continued reimbursement approval.\u00a0 If an application is refused, the GP may appeal, making a clinical case for the patient. \u00a0The HSE advises that the turnaround time for applications is three working days and for appeals it is five days.<\/p><p>As of 16 February, approximately 1,500 post-shingles patients have been approved, and the plaster is being provided to those patients in the normal manner.<\/p><p>Another 4784 non-shingles patients were registered by their GP, and 14% of these patients, 670 people, have been approved.\u00a0 In addition, 284 online appeals have been made, including patients who were never registered, and over 65% of these patients have been approved. <\/p><p>Over 2300 patients are now approved for the plaster in the drug schemes, with more than 850, over one third, approved for use other than post-shingles pain, based on the clinical case made by the GP.<\/p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters. <\/p><p>The introduction of the new approval system was flagged in August 2017, when details of the proposed changes were circulated by the HSE to prescribers and pharmacies.  This advice has been re-issued in the last week, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website. <\/p><p>(<i>).<\/i><\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

It is fully accepted that admission to an age appropriate facility is in the best interest of the child.<\/p>  <p>  Where a child requires admission to an in-patient bed, a bed in a\u00a0Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) unit is sought in the first instance. A decision to admit to an adult unit is made only if a CAMHS admission is not feasible. Where such admissions take place HSE Standard Operating Procedures apply. An admission to an adult unit must be advised to the Mental Health Commission and is generally to a separate area in the adult unit with appropriate supervision.<\/p>  <p>  Most child admissions to adult units are for children in the 16-17 age bracket.\u00a0The HSE advises  that admission to an adult unit may often be more appropriate for the individual and to avoid any impact on younger children in CAMHS in-patient units. Children admitted to adult units are provided with special support by the HSE. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Progress in this area has been significant since 2008 when there were 247 such admissions to adult units in that year.\u00a0This declined to 81 in 2017, despite a background of increasing demands overall on Child and Adolescent Mental Health services. CAMHS has seen a 26% increase in referrals between 2012 and 2017.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note, that the number of\u00a0 admissions\u00a0 does not necessarily equate to the actual number of children admitted, as an individual child may be admitted on more than one occasion in any given year.\u00a0In 2017, there was a total of 307 CAMHS admissions, of which 226 (74%) were to age appropriate units and 81 (26%) of admissions of Children were to Adult Units. The temporary closure of some CAMHS beds, such as the Linn Dara Unit in Dublin, influenced the admission rates to adults units in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of bed days used, in 2017, based on the most recent figures available, 96.9% of bed days used were in Child and Adolescent Inpatient Units. Performance generally continues to be above the HSE Service Plan target figure of 95%, and indications are that where a child has been admitted to an adult acute in-patient unit, the length of stay has been kept to a minimum. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE Service Plan allows for some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units, particularly where very short-term placements take place.\u00a0 Full account is taken of all relevant factors such as the preferences of all those involved, and geographical factors relating to access or visiting. In this context, the HSE continues to closely monitor on a weekly basis all child admissions to adult units with a view to minimising such admissions. <\/p>  <p>  I and departmental officials regularly meet with the HSE to review various mental health issues including the potential for further improvement on age appropriate CAMHS admissions. Relevant data is regularly published on the HSE website and is subject to regular monitoring by the Department of Health. Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I am satisfied that, where children have to be placed short-term in adult mental health units, the Executive makes any special arrangements necessary to protect and monitor these young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700093#WRLL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Data","counter":1303,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700093#WRLL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1304,"qnumday":523,"qnumall":"[10161\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700093#WRLL00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of extra home help hours that will be provided in 2018 relative to 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1305,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to promoting care in the community so  that people can continue to live with confidence, security and dignity  in their own homes for as long as possible.

Their recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  This season (2017\/18) the HSE procured the trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine for all those in the recommended at risk groups and health care workers and carers.  The trivalent vaccine used in Ireland is the most widely used influenza vaccine in Europe. <\/p>  <p>  NIAC is considering the need to expand the current recommendations for influenza vaccine, including the potential community wide benefit of extending recommendations to include all children.<\/p>  <p>  Initial evidence suggests that the vaccine provides higher protection against the Influenza A strains than recent years (H3N2 &amp;amp; H1N1).  While it is less effective against the B strains predominating this year, people who received the flu.  Vaccination remains the most effective means of preventing infection by seasonal influenza viruses and can reduce severe disease that can lead to hospitalisation and death.<\/p>  <p>  The influenza vaccine purchased by HSE is based on WHO advice on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2017\/8 northern hemisphere Flu season which issued on 2 March 2017.  It recommended that trivalent vaccines for use in the 2017-2018 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following:  <\/p>  <p>-   an A\/Michigan\/45\/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; <\/p>  <p>  - an A\/Hong Kong\/4801\/2014 (H3N2)-like virus; and <\/p>  <p>  - a B\/Brisbane\/60\/2008-like virus.<\/p>  <p>  Influenza vaccine is most effective when circulating viruses are well-matched with viruses contained in vaccines.  Due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System &ndash; a system of National Influenza Centres and WHO Collaborating Centres around the world &ndash; continuously monitors the influenza viruses circulating in humans and updates the composition of influenza vaccines twice a year.  For many years, WHO has updated its recommendation on the composition of the vaccine (trivalent) that targets the three most representative virus types in circulation (two subtypes of influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus) and since the 2013&ndash;2014 northern hemisphere influenza season, a fourth component is recommended to support quadrivalent vaccine development.  Quadrivalent vaccines include a 2nd influenza B virus in addition to the viruses in trivalent vaccines.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE Communications Plan which launched on the 2 October 2017 had an initial focus on Health Care Workers.  Radio adverts commenced on the 9 October and ran for three weeks.  There were further radio ads over the holiday period when ILI rates exceeded the baseline threshold for the first time.  People aged 65 and over as well as pregnant women were the primary audiences for the radio campaign, which also reached medically at risk groups and Health Care Workers as they make up a more generic radio audience.  Digital advertising and promotions targeting risk groups, the over 65s, pregnant women and healthcare workers and likewise there will be options for further campaigns when flu levels go above the threshold.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE &ldquo;Under the Weather&rdquo; website gives advice to people on what to do if they suspect they are developing influenza.  Health is one of the themes of the cross-sectoral &lsquo;Be Winter Ready&rsquo; campaign which launched on 8 November 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE reviews and updates its influenza plans, including the communications strategy, taking into account the lessons learned from previous years, with a view to targeting key groups to get the greatest impact in terms of people receiving the influenza vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700093#WRLL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Abroad Scheme","counter":1312,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700093#WRLL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1313,"qnumday":526,"qnumall":"[10164\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700093#WRLL01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons in County Kildare who applied for the treatment abroad scheme in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1314,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, this query has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700093#WRLL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Staff Recruitment","counter":1315,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700093#WRLL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1316,"qnumday":527,"qnumall":"[10165\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700093#WRLL02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to retain and recruit front-line staff in the health services including nurses; the number of nursing staff needed in public national hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1317,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding significant recruitment and retention challenges, including global shortages, considerable progress has been made in the past four years in growing the numbers of front line staff working in the public health services, including doctors and nurses, as additional resources have become available.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The number of consultants has increased by 109 in the 12 months ending December 2017 to 2,971 whole time equivalents, and by 415 in the 4 years since December 2013.

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.\u00a0 The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring\/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.\u00a0The proposals seek to ensure that:   <\/p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation; <\/p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme; <\/p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and <\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.\u00a0 Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,\u00a0 no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.\u00a0 Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.

It is also intended to raise awareness in the fishing industry of the negative impact such waste can have on the marine environment. <\/p>  <p>  Through the Fishing for Litter project, fishing ports and fishermen have been actively recovering marine litter as well as better managing waste, both on board and ashore.  This is done on a voluntary basis and while fishermen are not paid directly for their participation, they are supplied with large hardwearing bags in which they can collect marine litter that accumulates in their fishing gear as part of their normal fishing operations, as well as their own waste that they generate during fishing trips.  Filled bags are returned to the quayside in participating ports and moved to secure containers ready for safe and responsible disposal.  Specific waste facilities are provided at the participating fishing ports into which fishermen can deposit their waste free of charge.  In 2017, around 50 trawlers in\u00a09 ports - Clogherhead, Castletownbere, Ross A Mhil, Killybegs, Greencastle, Kinsale, Dunmore East and Dingle and Union Hall - participated in the project.  As part of this project novel waste management technologies are being tested on board vessels.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, since 2005, BIM has been working with industry on the recycling of old fishing gear.\u00a0 A total of 400 tonnes of nylon netting has been successfully recycled. During 2016 and 2017, BIM assisted by my Department, Donegal County Council, Wexford County Council, Clogherhead Development Group and several other private companies, cleared the stockpiles of old fishing gear that had built up over the years in various ports and prepared this for recycling.  A total of 187 tonnes of bulk material was removed from the ports in counties Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Cork, Waterford, Wexford and Louth, of which 100 tonnes consisted of valuable polyethylene netting that has been readied for recycling. <\/p>  <p>  BIM&rsquo;s Responsibly Sourced Seafood (RSS) standard compliments Origin Green. In developing Origin Green plans, seafood companies set targets around their raw material sourcing and reduction of their environmental impacts, including waste management. As part of each plan, companies are asked to source from suppliers with recognised certifications such as the Responsibly Sourced Seafood Fishing Vessel Standard or broader sustainability measures.  The RSS system provides an accredited, independently certified raw material supply source as part of these plans.\u00a0 Individual certification to the RSS requires applicants to demonstrate compliance, awareness and understanding of the waste management procedures in their harbour centre or port. This benefits their fishing operations by assuring that fishermen are fishing responsibly and are committed to reducing their impacts on the marine environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700094#WRMM02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry Data","counter":1365,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700094#WRMM03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1366,"qnumday":543,"qnumall":"[9416\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700094#WRMM03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount of seed mussels Northern Ireland and UK registered boats fished in the Irish Sea in territorial waters in each of the years 2003 to 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1367,"content":"<p>The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) is statutorily responsible for the collation of data on catch and landing records for sea-fisheries including the mussel seed fishery.

The latest EPA projections, published in April 2017, which reflect the implementation of policies and measures as of the end of 2015, indicate that Ireland is expected to exceed its annual non-ETS sector emissions limits under the EU Effort Sharing Decision from 2017 onwards, and that emissions could be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  The projected shortfall to our targets in 2020 reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  It is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.  In the light of this, Ireland&rsquo;s 2030 target will present a very significant challenge.  <\/p>  <p>  As a means\u00a0of addressing this challenge, I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan last July.  It provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  A key objective of the Plan is to close the gap to Ireland's 2020 EU target and to prepare for the EU targets that Ireland will take on for 2030.  The Plan sets out over 70 individual mitigation measures and 106 related actions\u00a0to reduce emissions in the four sectors with the most significant contribution to national emissions (Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use).  Although the Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve either Ireland&rsquo;s proposed 2030 target or the 2050 transition objective, it has established the framework for the development and implementation of medium-to-long-term policy options so as to achieve progressive emissions reductions in each of its four key sectors. <\/p>  <p>  The Plan is also a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  The most recent list of measures currently in place in the context of National Mitigation Plan is set out in the 2017 Annual Transition Statement, which I laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 8 December last.  This Statement details the key measures in place in the respective sectors, the objective for each measure, estimated mitigation potential and funding information, where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the approach set out in the National Mitigation Plan, the Government&rsquo;s recently\u00a0launched &lsquo;Project Ireland 2040&rsquo;, comprising the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan 2018-2027, which will support\u00a0significant\u00a0progress towards Ireland&rsquo;s National Transition Objective for 2050.  National Strategic Objective 8 of The National Development Plan commits funding of &euro;21.8 billion towards climate action investments, including some &euro;14 billion to be invested by Ireland&rsquo;s semi-state companies and by the private sector.  This means that almost &euro;1 in every &euro;5 to be spent in the framework of the National Development Plan over the next decade will be on climate action, with a strong focus on strategic investments in the areas of transport, renewable energy, grid development and interconnection, the built environment, and flood risk management, to address the significant climate change challenges that Ireland faces.  <\/p>  <p>  This funding commitment provides a clear opportunity for significant upscaling in our investments to deliver deep emissions reductions in the coming decade and to further develop and implement the National Mitigation Plan.  This will be essential both in order to meet Ireland&rsquo;s targets, under the draft EU Effort Sharing Regulation, for a 30% reduction in non-ETS\u00a0 sector by 2030, relative to 2005 levels, as well as to make significant progress towards Ireland&rsquo;s National Transition Objective for 2050 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland by at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) and, in parallel, to pursue an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700096#WROO03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Efficiency","counter":1442,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700096#WROO03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1443,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[9851\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700096#WROO03300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the cost of the dairy sector pilot project (details supplied) that was\u00a0conducted in 2017; the number and scale of recipients to the scheme; and his plans to sustain and expand the scheme; and the funding allocated for same in 2018.","asker":"1345","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1444,"content":"<p>Energy efficiency has been described as the 'first fuel' and a key contributor to\u00a0meeting our climate goals.  <\/p><p>SEAI developed the Dairy Sector pilot scheme in partnership with Teagasc and rolled it out during 2017 as part of a new suite of pilot measures for the SME sector. \u00a0Payments amounting to &euro;187,500 of grant support were made in 2017 to 47 successful grantees by the\u00a0SEAI from funding provided by my Department.

The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.<\/p>  <p>  A number of key public transport projects will be delivered across the Dublin region over the period of the new national development plan 2018-2027 which will address growing congestion in the city and capacity constraints on the existing public transport network.  These projects include BusConnects, Metro Link and priority elements of the DART expansion programme.  In addition to these, there will be continued investment in sustainable transport projects including traffic management and other smarter travel projects along with new urban and cycling routes in Dublin to allow transport infrastructure to function more effectively and relieve congestion.<\/p>  <p>  BusConnects is the main investment priority for public transport to address growing congestion in Dublin in the short to medium term.  \u00a0A radical improvement in the bus system can deliver a step change in performance across all areas of the Dublin region within a relatively short time.

The capacity increases at peak periods which will be provided by the project will assist in reducing crowding on the green line and enhance accessibility for mobility and sensory impaired users during these periods.\u00a0 A necessary complementary investment project, known as\u00a0the green line infrastructure upgrade -\u00a0an investment project to lengthen the platforms at the existing green line stations -\u00a0was\u00a0completed towards the end of last year and enables the use of the new, longer trams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700100#WRSS01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Infrastructure and Capital Investment Programme","counter":1565,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700100#WRSS01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1566,"qnumday":617,"qnumall":"[9527\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700100#WRSS01700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his department's capital allocation in each of the years 2018 to 2022; and the areas to which funds will be allocated in each of those years.","asker":"1288","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1567,"content":"<p>The capital allocation for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the years 2018 to 2022 can be found in the recently published National Development Plan 2018-2027 <\/p><p><b>Capital Allocation<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th>2018<\/th><th>2019<\/th><th>2020<\/th><th>2021<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;'000<\/td><td>&euro;'000<\/td><td>&euro;'000<\/td><td>&euro;'000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1,327<\/td><td>1,643<\/td><td>2,058<\/td><td>2,526<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>My budget speech\u00a02018 listed the priorities within the programmes within\u00a0my Department and how the capital\u00a0allocations will be spent. <\/p><p>Further details on my Department's capital allocation can also\u00a0be found in REV 2018 which\u00a0was \u00a0published in December 2017. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700100#WRSS01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Coast Guard Issues","counter":1568,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700100#WRSS01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1569,"qnumday":618,"qnumall":"[9547\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700100#WRSS02000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the efforts by Ballyheigue Coast Guard unit to take over the building occupied by Glenderry inshore rescue unit; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that the lack of a folio number for the boathouse of the latter is inhibiting this transition; the steps he will take to address this anomaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1570,"content":"<p>Ballyheigue Inshore Rescue Service, Ballyheigue CRBI, a declared resource available to the Coast Guard, is not presently a\u00a0unit of the Coast Guard.

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the current yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  Under this new arrangement, a person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may also be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits, over a 50 year period.<\/p>  <p>  For those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory) (SPC), there are other state pension payments available.  Notably, they may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC pension.  Consequently, if a person doesn&rsquo;t receive a State pension after pension age, they have both significant means and have made little or no contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  Introducing a new pension entitlement for such people would reduce the resources available for other pensioners, most of whom have less means than they do, and have contributed significantly more to the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p>  <p>  The model of TCA which will be in place for all new pensioners from 2020 will be decided upon following a consultation later this year, and I do not wish to pre-empt this process, nor the Government decision and legislation which will follow it.

A specific budgetary allocation is not made on a county by county basis under these schemes; rather, in order to ensure that the maximum output can be achieved, funding is available on the basis of performance and capacity to deliver new social homes using these schemes.<\/p><p>SHCEP supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the long term leasing of houses and apartments from private owners, developers and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).  Properties made available under the programme are used to accommodate households from local authority waiting lists.  Leased properties are allocated to tenants in accordance with the relevant local authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.  My Department recoups the cost of the agreements that are made with private property owners, including AHBs, to the local authorities.  Expenditure includes the ongoing cost of contractual arrangements and relevant cost of new contracts made within the year.<\/p><p>Total Exchequer funding for SHCEP in 2017 was &euro;83.947m; of this amount, a total of  &euro;1,714,383 was recouped to Westmeath County Council.  This supported the ongoing contractual commitments of 341 dwellings, operational at end 2017.<\/p><p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a flexible and immediate housing support that is now available to all eligible households throughout the State.  There are currently over 33,000 households in receipt of HAP and over 20,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme.  HAP commenced in Westmeath County Council on 1 December 2016 and the total numbers of active HAP tenancies at end 2017 was 366.  The 2017 average monthly rent paid to landlords under the HAP scheme in Westmeath was &euro;540.<\/p><p>In respect of the provision of HAP funding, Limerick City and County Council provides a highly effective HAP transactional shared service on behalf of all local authorities.  This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  Accordingly, my Department does not recoup individual local authorities in respect of HAP rental payments in their administrative areas but rather recoups all landlord costs via the HAP SSC. <\/p><p>My Department has, since 2015, provided local authorities with a HAP administrative payment of &euro;150 per HAP household on the basis of the cumulative number of new households supported through HAP in each year.  This administrative payment recognises the resources required to manage the HAP process by local authorities.  Westmeath County Council has received a HAP administrative payment of &euro;24,150 in respect of households supported by them at mid-year 2017.<\/p><p>RAS was established in 2004 and placed responsibility on local authorities to meet the accommodation needs of people in receipt of Rent Supplement for 18 months or longer, and who are assessed as having a long-term housing need.  RAS provides a more structured, accommodation-based approach to the use of the private rented sector to meet long-term housing need, thereby eliminating dependence on temporary income support payments, i.e. rent supplement.  On a phased basis, long-term Rent Supplement recipients will transfer to social housing and have their longterm housing need met by local authorities under the RAS.  <\/p><p>At 31 December 2017, 60,338 households with a long-term housing need have been transferred from Rent Supplement to RAS and other social housing solutions nationally.  Of these, 34,493 were housed directly under RAS and a further 25,895 were accommodated under other social housing options, excluding HAP.  Since the first transfers commenced in 2005 to end of December 2017, Westmeath County Council has transferred 1,105 Rent Supplement recipients directly to RAS and a further 341 to other social housing options, excluding HAP. <\/p><p>A total of &euro;134.338 million was allocated to RAS in 2017.  Of this, the total RAS expenditure in 2017 for Westmeath County Council was &euro;3,902,877.

Under section 16(h) of the Residential Tenancies Act, a tenant shall not engage, nor allow their visitors to engage, in anti-social behaviour.  Section 17 of the Act defines anti-social behaviour to include behaviour that: constitutes the commission of an offence reasonably likely to affect directly the well-being or welfare of others; could cause fear, danger, injury, damage or loss to certain persons; or persistently prevents or interferes with the peaceful occupation of others in the property or neighbourhood.  <\/p><p>Under section 15 of the Act, a landlord owes to each person who could be potentially affected a duty to enforce the tenant&rsquo;s obligations and section 77 provides that third parties who are directly and adversely affected by tenants engaging in anti-social behaviour may, subject to certain conditions, refer a complaint to the RTB for resolution, where a landlord has failed to enforce their tenant&rsquo;s obligations.  Further information can be obtained on the RTB&rsquo;s website at <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>In relation to tenants engaging in anti-social behaviour in a local authority dwelling, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 provides for a court order on application by the tenant, tenant purchaser or the housing authority or approved body concerned, which has the effect of excluding a household member engaged in anti-social behaviour from the dwelling and, if appropriate, from the estate in question for a maximum period of 3 years.  The Act also empowers a housing authority to refuse to allocate or sell a dwelling to a person engaged in anti-social behaviour or in the interest of good estate management.  <\/p><p>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 strengthened the powers of housing authorities in relation to securing excluding orders where there is anti-social behaviour in their housing stock.  Part 2 of the 2014 Act prescribes procedures to deal with serious breaches of the tenancy agreements for their dwellings, including anti-social behaviour and strengthens the power of housing authorities to recover possession of their dwellings from households in serious breach of their tenancy agreements, including engaging in anti-social behaviour.<\/p><p>Section 35 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 requires each housing authority, by reserved function, to adopt an &lsquo;&lsquo;anti-social behaviour strategy&rsquo;&rsquo; for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in its housing stock.  <\/p><p>Such strategies apply to dwellings let under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2009 and dwellings let under Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) Availability Agreements (Chapter 4), as defined in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  The tenancy agreement and legislation, which forms an integral part of the anti-social behaviour strategy, allows for a more targeted approach in dealing with persons engaged in anti-social behaviour and to avoid, if possible, the eviction of an entire household.<\/p><p>In respect of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, under section 45(6) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, local authorities may refuse to provide, or cease providing, housing assistance in respect of a qualified household where the local authority considers that any household member is or has been engaged in anti-social behaviour.  Under this section, the local authority may also refuse to permit a person who proposes to take up or resume residence or enter or be in a dwelling the subject of housing assistance where the local authority considers that the person is or has been engaged in anti-social behaviour.  As they are private rental tenancies, the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Acts also apply to tenancies in the RAS and HAP schemes.

Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.<\/p><p>In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, the homeowner, the builder, the developer and\/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.  It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.<\/p><p>In August 2017, I published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings, where concerns arise.  The Framework is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern.  The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.<\/p><p>In response to the many building failures that have emerged over the past decade, my Department introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.<\/p><p>A Certificate of Compliance on Completion is jointly signed by the builder and the assigned certifier.  This must be accompanied by plans and documentation to show how the constructed building complies with the building regulations and also the inspection plan, as implemented.<\/p><p>In parallel with the 2014 Regulations, a project is in place in the Local Government Management Agency to improve the effectiveness of the Building Control System.  A number of enhancements have been delivered to date and others are in progress, including: <\/p><p>1. To facilitate the consistent implementation of the changes introduced by the 2014 Regulations, the electronic administration of building control functions and to provide a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector, the Building Control Management System (BCMS) IT system was developed. <\/p><p>2. To standardise work practices, systems, procedures and decision-making in relation to oversight of building control activity across the sector, a &ldquo;Framework for Building Control Authorities&rdquo; was developed and first published in September 2014 and revised in June 2016.<\/p><p>3. To further support local building control authorities in their daily activities, a compliance support work stream has been developed.  A number of frequently asked questions have been answered through this system. <\/p><p>4. To support staff in building control authorities to carry out their work effectively, training programmes have been developed. <\/p><p>5. To increase the level of meaningful inspections of building activity, a BCMS module is currently being developed to collect data at commencement, which will further inform building control staff in planning risk based targeted inspections.<\/p><p>The Local Government Management Agency is working towards encapsulating all these work streams into a centralised structure for the governance and oversight of Building Control.  This structure will ultimately be a shared service embedded in a lead local authority. <\/p><p>At the end of May 2017, the Government approved the draft heads of a Bill to place the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) on a statutory footing and the Bill was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.  I received the Committee&rsquo;s report on 14 December 2017 and I am considering its recommendations, with a view to progressing the drafting as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Once it is enacted, the Bill will provide consumers who engage a registered builder with the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator and will complement the reforms which have been made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations and contribute to the development of a culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector.<\/p><p>With regard to timber framed construction, in accordance with the recommendations of the , a standard in relation to timber frame construction was developed. Irish Standard 440: 2009\/A1:2014 Timber Frame Construction, Dwellings and other Buildings (I.S. 440) specifies requirements for materials, design, manufacture, construction details, site work and quality control for platform timber frame construction.  It requires that the responsibilities for the tasks involved in the planning, structural design, site erection and inspection be agreed and recorded prior to the commencement of each project.  I.S. 440 also gives specific details relating to fire, including the construction of separating walls, horizontal and vertical fire stopping, cavity barriers and detailed fire stopping junctions for walls and floors and service penetrations.<\/p><p>I understand that I.S. 440 is currently under review, and it is intended that both external and party wall new constructions and methods will be included in the next revision of the document.  Manufacturers of timber frame buildings are assessed under an approval scheme operated by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) for compliance with I.S. 440 requirements including Factory Production Control (FPC) and a register of compliant manufacturers is available on the NSAI website at <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>It should also be noted that my Department has recently issued guidance on Timber Frame Walls, which have been tested to the European fire test standard and meet the performance set down in Technical Guidance Document B (TGD B) for external and separating walls in dwellings.

This was evident in the Social Housing Output indicative figures published last month, showing that nearly 26,000 households had their social housing need met in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  I expect 2018 to be another strong year for the delivery of social homes, while the introduction this year of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, the Affordable Purchase Scheme and the Affordable Rental Scheme will see important advances in these areas.

With the Affordable Rental Scheme, a pilot project is being undertaken with Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in conjunction with the Housing Agency and an Approved Housing Body (AHB), using publicly-owned land.  To further assist in this work, I announced following my review of Rebuilding Ireland, that Minister of State Damien English will lead a new delivery team in my Department working with local authorities and AHBs on social housing delivery.

Security of tenure provisions under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2016 apply once a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months, with no notice of termination having been served during that time.  Section 34 provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any notice served, in line with those set out in section 34 of the Act.<\/p><p>The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  Section 56 of the Act provides that, where there is an abuse of the termination procedure in section 34, a tenant may bring a complaint to the RTB on the basis that they have been unjustly deprived of possession of a dwelling by their landlord.  Further information from the RTB is available at and through the RTB helpline - Lo-call on 0818 30 30 37 (mobile operators may charge a premium rate to the Lo-call number) or 01 702 8100 - available from Monday to Friday, 8:30am to 6.30pm. <\/p><p>The so-called &lsquo;Tyrrelstown amendment', included in the 2016 Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act, already limits the ability of landlords to use the grounds of sale to terminate tenancies, provided for in section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Act.  Where a landlord proposes to sell 10 or more units within a single development at the same time, that sale will now be subject to the existing tenants remaining in situ, other than in exceptional circumstances.<\/p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, enacted on 4 December 2015, provided that notice periods for the termination of further Part 4 tenancies, i.e. tenancies that extended beyond 4 years, be extended <i>pro rata<\/i>in line with the length of the tenancy, subject to caps of 224 days for termination by landlords and 112 days for terminations by tenants (previously 112 days for landlords and 56 days for tenants). <\/p><p>Furthermore, the Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December 2016, recognises rapidly increasing rent prices as the most significant challenge to security of tenure in the rental sector at present.  Where tenants cannot afford their rents, their tenancies are not secure and evictions for non-payment of rent may ensue.  <\/p><p>To address this, the Government introduced, through the 2016 Act, the concept of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) to moderate the rate of rent increases in those areas of the country where rents are highest and rising quickly.  The 2016 Act also gave effect to other actions to address tenants&rsquo; security, including the abolition of a landlord&rsquo;s right, during the first 6 months of a further Part 4 tenancy, to end that tenancy for no stated ground, and the extension of the term of Part 4 tenancies from 4 to 6 years.<\/p><p>In September 2017, as part of the review of the Rent Predictability Measures, I announced a series of further measures in relation to the rental sector, including a two-year change plan to develop and strengthen the role of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), particularly with regard to enforcement.<\/p><p>With regard to social housing supply, the Government has made housing a top priority and, through the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan, has a framework in place to deliver an increase and acceleration in the supply of high quality housing, including social and affordable homes, particularly in the major urban areas where demand is greatest.<\/p><p>Rebuilding Ireland contains a suite of actions that will increase housing construction and refurbishment.  Under Pillar 2 of the Action Plan, 50,000 new social homes will be delivered by 2021, supported by &euro;6 billion in exchequer funding.  Of these, 33,500 homes will be provided through direct construction and refurbishment and as of Quarter 3 of 2017, there were over 12,000 new homes in the social housing construction pipeline, including those on site or recently completed, and this is being added to on a weekly basis.  I expect to provide a further update on social housing construction activity in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700109#WRBBB03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Pressure Zones","counter":1918,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700109#WRBBB03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1919,"qnumday":747,"qnumall":"[9779\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700109#WRBBB03400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he has satisfied himself that the rent pressure zones are working adequately to tackle the housing crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1920,"content":"<p>Section 24A of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2016 sets out the procedure for the Minister to prescribe, by order, an area as a Rent Pressure Zone.

These changes will strengthen the impact of the Rent Predictability Measure and will further slow the growth in rents.  These enhanced enforcement procedures to be introduced in 2018 will reform the Rent Pressure Zone mechanism to deliver a more effective and transparent approach to its operation. <\/p><p>The Government has given priority to the drafting and early publication of a Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill to address this and other urgent issues in the rental sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700109#WRBBB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Loan Scheme","counter":1921,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700109#WRBBB03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1922,"qnumday":748,"qnumall":"[9780\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700109#WRBBB03700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to extend the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme in view of demand; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1923,"content":"<p>Following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan, a new loan offering - the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan - was introduced on 1 February 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;200 million for the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan has been raised by the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) on a fixed rate basis for periods out to thirty years maturity.

Under Pillar 2 of the Action Plan, 50,000 new social homes will be delivered by 2021, supported by &euro;6 billion in exchequer funding.  Of these, 33,500 homes will be provided through direct construction and refurbishment.  Significant progress has been made in increasing the build programmes of local authorities and approved housing bodies and there are over 12,000 new homes in the social housing construction pipeline, including those on site or recently completed, and this is being added to on a weekly basis. <\/p><p>With the funding made available in Budget 2018, the aim is to meet the housing needs of almost 25,500 households during 2018.  Central to this delivery will be the construction of 3,800 new homes by local authorities and approved housing bodies, through direct build, turnkey developments and rapid delivery projects.  This construction programme, underpinned by a multi-faceted Action Plan, is the correct way to make a fast and sustainable response to the housing crisis. <\/p><p>All local authorities are undertaking social housing construction including on publicly owned lands.  This can be seen in the Social Housing Construction Status Reports which my Department publishes quarterly.  These reports provide information on the construction programme underway for each local authority area, including Kildare and other counties adjacent to Dublin.  The last published report sets out the position at the end of quarter 3 of 2017 when there were over 3,600 new social homes on site and under construction and a further 2,000 new homes with approval to appoint contractors and move onto the construction phase.  That report is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: <\/p><p>.  <\/p><p>It will be these schemes that will form the bulk of the housing starts and delivery of the 3,800 homes targeted through new builds in 2018.  The precise timing for the advancement of each of these projects, including completion dates and tenanting, is a matter in the first instance for the relevant local authorities.

Last year, I secured an additional &euro;500 million during Budget 2018 negotiations, to increase the social housing delivery ambition from 47,000 to 50,000 social housing homes by end 2021. Combined with the target to deliver just under 88,000 tenancies under the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Schemes, this means that we will meet the needs of just under 138,000 individuals and families over the lifetime of the Rebuilding Ireland plan.<\/p><p>It should be noted that we are making good progress, with just under 45,000 households having  their social housing need met since Rebuilding Ireland was initiated. Indeed, I recently published details of the social housing delivery ambition to 2021 against the delivery achieved at end 2017 and this information can be accessed at the following web link:<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to addressing the use of hotels for emergency accommodation and we are working closely with the local authorities to secure the necessary alternative accommodation.  The delivery of family hubs has been an important response and there are now almost 500 units of family accommodation in these hubs.  These facilities offer a greater level of stability than is possible in hotels, with the capacity to provide appropriate play space, cooking and laundry facilities.  My Department will fund and work with local authorities in relation to the delivery of further hubs. <\/p><p>During the course of 2017, a total of 1,263 families in the Dublin Region were moved on from hotel and B and B accommodation arrangements into either independent tenancies or more appropriate hub accommodation. Nationally last year, over 4,000 exits from homelessness were achieved into sustainable tenancies in local authority and Approved Housing Body housing  and HAP supported accommodation. Every effort will continue to be made to achieve the maximum number of exits from homelessness this year, assisted by the recent extension to all local authorities of the Homeless HAP placefinders service, which has been a key response in Dublin and in Cork since its introduction there last year. <\/p><p>In relation to the rental market and the particular pressures faced by tenants, the Government has also prioritised a range of actions to ensure that existing rent predictability measures, such as the Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) and increased security of tenure, are fully respected and enforced.<\/p><p>With well over half of all tenancies now covered by RPZs, we are making sure that all landlords comply with the 4% maximum annual rent increases and we are bringing forward legislation to give the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) increased enforcement powers to act where these new rules are not being applied.  This legislation will also make it an offence to break the RPZ rules. In addition, the RTB published a guidance note in late November on the &ldquo;substantial change&rdquo; exemption in RPZ areas which will make it clearer for landlords and tenants.<\/p><p>Another key policy that will help to deliver more new properties for rent, and more affordable rental properties, is the finalisation of new apartment planning and design guidelines (which issued for consultation in December 2017), which will facilitate more cost-effective and flexible design to meet different rental market segments. The new guidelines also facilitate the development of specific build-to-rent developments as well as shared accommodation rental models, which are suited to city centre development at scale and which will help to boost the supply of urban core rental accommodation at more affordable levels, in line with the National Planning Framework principle of delivering compact city centre living as opposed to continued outward sprawl.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700111#WRDDD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Loans","counter":1970,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700111#WRDDD00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1971,"qnumday":764,"qnumall":"[10113\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700111#WRDDD00700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will examine the need to install a robust local authority housing loan system similar to that available in the 1980s with the objective of ensuring that families that do not qualify for local authority housing on income grounds can apply for a loan to buy or construct their own houses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1972,"qnumday":771,"qnumall":"[10120\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700111#WRDDD00800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the income qualification guidelines, upper and lower limits, for qualification for a housing loan from the local authority; if applicants need to be on the local authority housing list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1973,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 764 and 771 together.<\/p><p>Following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan, I have introduced, from 1 February 2018, a new loan offering, known as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.

The phased nature of the HAP roll-out has allowed for significant learning in the operation of the scheme. In this way, new HAP authorities have benefited from the experience of those authorities where the scheme has been previously operational.  On average in 2017, 350 additional tenancies were being supported by HAP each week, with over 33,000 households currently having their housing needs met under the scheme, and some 20,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of monthly HAP payments.<\/p><p>As HAP is a social housing support and consequently households are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.

In order to further assist homeless households in exiting emergency accommodation the homeless HAP place finder service, with effect from 19 January 2018, can now be made available in each of the 31 local authority areas.

","asker":"1306","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2009,"content":"<p>My focus, and that of the Government, is to ensure that as many households as possible remain in their homes and in this regard, a range of measures are currently being implemented across Government Departments and agencies. These actions are focused on encouraging those in mortgage distress who have not been able to engage, to reach a long term debt resolution and avoid repossession if possible.<\/p><p>One of the measures that has been introduced is a national mortgage arrears resolution service, known as Abhaile, which is provided free of charge to the borrower and its aim is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.  The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together, for the first time, the full range of supports and services required by borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  The Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgetary Service, MABS, acts as the gateway for the service and can be contacted by telephoning 0761072000 or by accessing their website at the following link  <\/p><p>The mortgage to rent, MTR, scheme introduced in 2012 and administered by the Housing Agency on behalf of my Department is targeted at those households in arrears who are eligible for social housing support, whose mortgage is unsustainable.  Under the scheme an eligible household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to becoming a social housing tenant of an approved housing body, AHB.  The borrower voluntarily surrenders their property to their lender who in turn sells the property to an AHB.  The AHB becomes the landlord and the household gets to remain in the family home as social housing tenants.  The tenants pay a differential rent to the AHB, based on their income, which is designed to be affordable.  The MTR scheme is an established part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  <\/p><p>A review of the mortgage to rent, MTR, scheme, published on 8 February 2017, introduced a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the MTR scheme in order for it to work better for borrowers.  The review, available at the following link: , explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and recommended a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  My Department and the Housing Agency are working with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.  I am providing an additional &euro;5 million for the MTR scheme in 2018, which will support at least 250 additional MTR cases to be completed by AHBs working together with lenders using the MTR scheme.<\/p><p>The MTR Review also concluded that the current financial model of the scheme may not, in its current configuration, be capable of delivering the scale of successful cases that could benefit from the scheme over time.  In order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency has been working with a number of financial entities who have expressed an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of alternative long-term lease arrangements.  A call for expressions of interest from bodies interested in pursuing pilot operating models was initiated by the Housing Agency on 26 October 2017.  The Housing Agency is currently reviewing the submissions received and will make recommendations to my Department as to the make-up of the pilots, which can then be initiated.<\/p><p>For those borrowers in danger of losing their home who are ineligible for the MTR scheme but qualify for social housing support, it is recommended that they engage as early as possible with their local authority regarding their housing needs. A household may be determined by their housing authority to be in need of housing if it has a mortgage that is deemed to be unsustainable under the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, even though the household may, at that time, remain the legal owners of the dwelling concerned.  Any household assessed as eligible for social housing support is immediately eligible for support through the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme. Once a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700112#WREEE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":2011,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700112#WREEE01900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Monuments","counter":2010,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700112#WREEE01800"},{"type":"question","counter":2011,"qnumday":781,"qnumall":"[9586\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700112#WREEE01900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the details of all national monuments in County Wexford; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":2012,"content":"<p>Details of national monuments in County Wexford that are in my ownership or guardianship, as Minister, under the National Monuments Acts are set out in the following table.

Later this year, my Department will be inviting\u00a0applications from candidate sites for inclusion on the upcoming\u00a02020 Tentative List.\u00a0 Inclusion on\u00a0the list will ultimately be determined by whether\u00a0a site meets relevant criteria relating, <i>inter alia<\/i>,\u00a0to outstanding universal value, availability of adequate site management and protection resources, and the extent of stakeholder engagement and support for the bid.<\/p><p>My Department is in\u00a0ongoing contact with Kerry County Council and its Canadian counterpart\u00a0in relation to the\u00a0potential\u00a0World Heritage application\u00a0and has\u00a0informed both parties\u00a0that Ireland will\u00a0support the\u00a0Valentia bid\u00a0once it meets the\u00a0qualifying criteria. There is specific reference too to the Cable Station in the National Development Plan and my Department will engage with all the key stakeholders with a view to agreeing an appropriate investment programme for its refurbishment.<\/p><p>I understand that a considerable amount of preparatory work has already been done locally on the Valentia proposal, including\u00a0essential repairs to the buildings which were grant aided\u00a0by my Department. The Department\u00a0will\u00a0continue to assist with\u00a0the preparation of the Tentative List\u00a0bid,\u00a0including providing\u00a0as much\u00a0advice,\u00a0guidance and support\u00a0as possible to\u00a0Kerry County Council\u00a0as the lead\u00a0organisation\u00a0at local level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700113#WRFFF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Scoileanna Oile&aacute;in","counter":2038,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700113#WRFFF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":2039,"qnumday":790,"qnumall":"[10076\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018022700113#WRFFF00900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"an bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist aici l&iacute;on na scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; do na me&aacute;nscoileanna ar na hoile&aacute;in a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; i mbliana &oacute; tharla go bhfuil an-tairbhe ag baint leis an sc&eacute;im do na hoile&aacute;in agus an-&eacute;ileamh ar na scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute;; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1312","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":2040,"content":"<p>Mar  eolas don Teachta, le deich mbliana anuas t&aacute; deontas ar fi&uacute; &euro;27 in aghaidh an scol&aacute;ire in aghaidh an lae &aacute;  &iacute;oc ag mo Roinnse le teaghlaigh at&aacute; c&aacute;ilithe faoi Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge i leith scol&aacute;ir&iacute; &oacute;n m&oacute;rth&iacute;r a chaitheann scoilbhliain ioml&aacute;n ag freastal ar cheann amh&aacute;in den tr&iacute; iar-bhunscoil ar na hoile&aacute;in &Aacute;rann.
