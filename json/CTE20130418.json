Are these minutes agreed to?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  Item No. 2 is matters arising.  Our last meeting was with the director of the Local Government Audit Service who gave an outline of the work of his office.  A common thread appeared in our examination of bodies that receive Exchequer funding which is not subsequently audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That common threat relates to the need for greater accountability for this funding, whether it is given to the CIE for school transport, a voluntary hospital or to local authorities for the provision of specific services.  It may be appropriate that we draw up a short report on these issues and report to the D&aacute;il with recommendations.  I ask the clerk to examine the issue with a view to drawing up an outline of a report that the committee can work on.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. <\/p><p>  No. 3 is correspondence from Accounting Officers received since our meeting on 21 March 2013.  Correspondence dated 22 March 2013 from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing information requested at the meeting of 7 March 2013.  This is to be noted and published.  <\/p><p>  No. 3A.2 is correspondence dated 28 March 2013 from Ms Niamh O'Donoghue, Secretary General, Department of Social Protection, providing information requested at the meeting of 14 March 2013.  This is to be noted and published.  There is one issue where data have not been supplied that relates to the number of people in receipt of a welfare payment who do not attend for interview as part of the work activation process.  The committee will examine the issue of labour market activation measures when it examines Chapter 17 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report with the Department of Education and Skills.  We will also bring in F&Aacute;S to discuss the issue and it may be appropriate if the Department of Social Protection was already represented at the meeting.  <\/p><p>  No. 3A.3 is correspondence dated 8 April 2013 from Mr. John Moran, Secretary General, Department of Finance, regarding the provision of information requested at the meeting of 21 February 2013.  This is to be noted and published.  The correspondence relates to the level of cash retained in bank accounts by public bodies.  We will follow up on the issue with the Accounting Office at the  Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The matter was specifically raised by Deputy Harris.<\/p><p>  No. 3A.4 is correspondence dated 12 April 2013 from Mr. Brian Purcell, Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, regarding the provision of information requested at the meeting of 21 March 2013.

This is to be noted and published.  As we are drafting a report on the work of the Committee of Public Accounts on bank stabilisation that we hope to publish in May, the information contained in the correspondence will feed into the report.  I ask the clerk to go back to the Department in respect of the redacted information that was supplied to the previous Committee of Public Accounts on the guarantee as this is directly relevant to bank stabilisation.  It is important that we return to Mr. Moran on the basis that we have requested that the documents provided to the last committee meeting that was heavily redacted and request same to be provided to us with perhaps less redaction because we want the information which may not be as commercially, or otherwise sensitive, now as it was then.  The information would be relevant for the report that we are concluding and it is important that it is provided to us.<\/p><p>  We also asked Mr. Moran on the day if there was a note taken of those who attended meetings over the period in the Department.  He was asked to check that out.  I ask again that we remind Mr. Moran of the need to provide the information because it is helpful to the report that we are currently undertaking and will provide to the D&aacute;il in May or June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013041800003#B00500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1366275600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I ask the Chairman to clarify to which report he is referring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013041800003#B00600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1366275600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We agreed to carry out a report to complete the circle, as it were, on bank stabilisation.

The week before the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland comes in to meet us, at the end of April 2013, we receive the 2011 accounts.  The 2012 financial year has long since passed and the accounts have been prepared.  The accounts may not have been signed off by the auditor and the audit may not have been commenced or completed.  I find this most unhelpful to the committee.  It has happened previously that one hour after visitors left the meeting, they published their accounts for the 12 months prior to the year we were discussing.  I refer to the idea of an organisation lodging accounts with the Oireachtas immediately before appearing before the committee, when the accounts are 16 months old.  We need to see the accounts for 2012, even if they are not audited.  They should have been presented to us in draft form so we can have a meaningful discussion.  We are continually given the runaround by State agencies and this is the fourth time I have raised this exact point.  It is clear that the financial year has come and gone since the accounts were lodged in the Oireachtas but we do not have the accounts.  What is the point in discussing something such as this?  The accounts cover a period between 28 and 16 months ago.  We are discussing information that is 28 months old, from January 2011.<\/p><p>  We should deal with it as part of the work programme.  Organisations have a vested interest in not providing us with up-to-date information.  Perhaps it is carelessness or the way the public service works to give people information that is 28 months old.  As part of our work programme, when inviting any State agency to appear before the committee, we should know the last accounts available to us, whether the subsequent year-end has been completed and where the accounts are for that year, even in draft format.  Normally, accounts produced by large reputable organisations produced or prepared for audit should be very close to the final figures at the end of the audit.  We should log this in our programme from now on.  We are chasing history at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013041800004#C00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1366276200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland accounts of 2011 had a clean audit opinion.

Agreed.<\/p><p>  We will now move on to item No. 6 on our agenda, which is any other business.  While I do not want to delay these proceedings any further, I wish to respond to articles published recently in one of the daily newspapers and, in the interests of protecting the independence of the Committee of Public Accounts and of transparency and accountability, to deal with the issues raised therein in a non-political way.  There is a political content to the reports, which I will deal with outside of this forum.  I wish to deal now with the facts relating to the freedom of information request referred to in the articles.  I am sure members have all seen the six articles in question.  <\/p><p>  I wish to say that I was a Minister of State in the Department in question at the time.  When the first report was released to the newspapers, it concerned me greatly and was news to me in terms of the figures.  My only comment at the time and up to now was that it was, at that time, not a matter for me and that I was not aware of the figures.  The construction of the office went on and the office was provided.  <\/p><p>  I wrote on 4 April to the Comptroller and Auditor General asking him to investigate the matter.  He duly responded and I will ask Mr. McCarthy to deal with that response later.  In order to deal with the other aspects of the issue which were reported, I wrote to the Standards in Public Office Commission on 4 April and asked that it investigate the matter to determine whether any regulation was breached.  I have received a reply from the commission to the effect that it does not have a role in this matter.  I received a reply from the Comptroller and Auditor General and he can explain that reply himself.  I wrote to him as a Member of the House rather than as Chairman of this committee.  The general content of the reply was that the accounts, dating back to 2007, were signed off and he did not see how he could investigate this matter fully.  <\/p><p>  If any other body or agency had spent that kind of money on an office for a Minister - a Department or the Comptroller and Auditor General - I am sure I would be the first one to say we need to inquire into that.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Standards in Public Office Commission and the Comptroller and Auditor General do not see a role for themselves in investigating the matter, I believe this committee must request all the details and paperwork relating to the decisions, costs and any other relevant information concerning that undertaking from the two Departments.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as it was then, does not own the building in question.  It is owned, on behalf of the State, by the Office of Public Works, which at that time was under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  It was the Department of Finance, through the OPW, that actually agreed the costings and spent the money.  It is only right that we ask both Departments for all and every single piece of information they have on this matter.  When that information is properly compiled, it should be made available to the members of this committee, along with the response given to the newspaper on foot of the freedom of information request.  I have a copy of that response and can make it available to the committee if it is not readily available elsewhere.  Then the members of this committee can decide what they wish to do.  They can ask both Secretaries General to appear before the committee to discuss the details of that project.  I believe members would want to be armed with all information relevant to this matter, including the information on the decision makers from each Department.<\/p> <p>That is what I would ask for if it was any other matter I read about or that came before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013041800006#E02600","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366278000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Could we ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on the matter?

Those audits were completed in 2008 and subsequently disposed of by the committee.  The option of reopening and audit that has already been closed is not available to me.<\/p><p>  Compliance with procurement guidelines and good procurement practice, including if there was competitive tendering and the achievement of good value, are matters that are routinely tested on a sample basis in the course of audit.

It is essential we apply the same guidelines and level of scrutiny to this issue as we would to another issue.<\/p><p>  There is, however, a broader issue.  Is this an isolated incident?  What was the cost of a ministerial office back in that period?  Was it only the Chairman's office that cost &euro;250,000?  Was this an average cost?  There is work that must be done on the protocols in place for ministerial offices.  I will reserve my judgment until I review the correspondence, because I have only seen the media reports but those reports clearly suggest the Minister must sign off or approve the expenditure and we must establish the protocol there.  Does a Minister actually sign off line by line and should he do so?  What is the protocol now?<\/p><p>  This is also relative, it must be compared to other ministerial offices at the time.

When I see a systemic problem or if I believe there are grounds, if I see a repeated pattern, as the Deputy states, back in 2007 there was an expectation that a standard of a particular level would apply for Ministers or Minister of State.

I was the mayor of South Dublin County Council shortly before the Celtic tiger collapsed.  When certain buildings were being constructed at that time, I was absolutely horrified with the actual expenditure involved.  It would be useful if, as a result of this discussion, we could see a comparison between the amounts of money that were spent on projects such as the one under discussion and the equivalent amounts that would be spent nowadays.  That would allow us to see whether we are getting better value for money now than we were then.  My impression is that when public buildings were being constructed during that period, the costs went through the roof.  It would be interesting to see the situation now, to learn about the extent to which have we improved the situation and to compare what the equivalent costs would be if these projects were being done by the private sector.

I think there is a general awareness in society that this happened.  One would expect every project, considering them on a like-for-like basis, to be procured now at a much better price than would have been the case in 2007.  That would be one's expectation purely on the basis of the price indicators.  If one were to carry out a piece of audit work based on the hypothesis that this is what one expects to find, one would seek accountability if one found a current project that is not cheaper, on a like-for-like basis, than a 2007 project.

We have witnesses to invite into the room.  The building occupied by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is not owned by the Department.  It is actually owned by the State and the OPW looks after it.  My understanding is that it is a listed building.  I wish to inform Deputy Harris that it was not my expenditure.  The total expenditure came from the OPW.  The OPW designed it, laid it out, specified it and did whatever else it did regarding this project.  The OPW paid for it.  The cost, with the exception of the cost of the furniture, was not recouped from the Department.  There was a reimbursement from the Department to the OPW in relation to the furniture aspect of the project.  At no stage - this is a political point - did I have an involvement in designing or asking for particular furniture or whatever.<\/p> <p>I understand there is a protocol or arrangement in place whereby a particular office is designed in a particular way.  For example, an office for the use of a Secretary General, assistant secretary, junior Minister or senior Minister will be designed in a certain way.  In this case, the Office of Public Works assumed responsibility for the expenditure on and design of the project.  The request to both Departments should take into account the view expressed by members that the investigation should cover the period from 2007 to date and examine the protocols that are in place.  The other points of interest raised by members should also be included in the request.<\/p><p> I may have omitted to state that I submitted a freedom of information request to the Office of Public Works seeking a copy of all the material Deputies have sought.  I will submit a similar request to the Department, as I have nothing to hide in this matter, which I would like investigated.  If the planned meeting with representatives of the Office of Public Works on 25 April does not suit the office in terms of producing the information the committee has requested, we will arrange a separate meeting to deal with the matter.<\/p><p> On the timeframe, I raise this matter today because I am also concerned.  I would have stopped the works if I had known they would cost so much money.  There is not a political animal in this House who would not have stalled at the cost of an office of that size.  I was the first occupant of the office in question, which was subsequently occupied by two other Ministers of State, including the incumbent.  It may be no harm for the Deputy to visit the office and ask where the &euro;250,000 - the final cost was &euro;290,000 - was spent.<\/p><p> To respond to Deputy Harris, if we are asking about Ministers and junior Ministers, we should also seek information on Secretaries General and assistant secretaries to ascertain <\/p><p>how we are all treated in respect of this matter.  I will supply the plans that were provided under the freedom of information request I submitted.  They were certainly different from the plans I saw in today's newspaper.  Members need to have the facts.<\/p><p> From the point of view of a timeframe, I have asked for the investigation, and members support the thrust of this investigation and have added their voice to different aspects of it.  I presume the committee will write to both Departments concerned today.  Given that I wrote to the Office of Public Works on 9 April, I presume it is in the process of compiling the relevant information.  There should not be any delay or kicking to touch of an examination of this issue.<\/p><p> Are members satisfied that we have concluded with this matter?  As that appears to be the case, we will proceed to the agenda proper.  On any other business, is the agenda for the meeting scheduled for 10 a.m. on Thursday, 25 April agreed?  Agreed.  We will meet the Health Service Executive to deal with Vote 40 -  HSE annual financial statements 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013041800009#H04100","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366279800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I wish to raise one further matter under any other business.

More than half of the gross expenditure was on broadcasting related grants and functions, a total spend of &euro;246 million.  Almost a quarter of the spending was on energy related programmes.  Expenditure on communications programmes in 2011 was &euro;17 million.  This included spending of just under &euro;9 million on ICT programmes compared to an estimate provision of &euro;29.6 million.  The reduced spending was as a result of a later than anticipated roll-out of the schools broadband programme.  Broadcasting licence fee receipts of &euro;218 million account for the bulk of the Vote's appropriations-in-aid.<\/p><p>  The main application of the broadcasting licence fee receipts is in the form of grants-in-aid to RTE and TG4.  Some 7% of the licence fee income is allocated to the broadcasting fund which is administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  The statutory financial statements for the fund are audited by me and the 2011 statements are for consideration by the committee today.  I have also presented a report on a special audit of the administration and management of the broadcasting fund.  The fund was established in 2003 to support the production of new television and radio programmes on certain subjects.  These include programmes relating to Irish culture and heritage as well as programmes aimed at improving adult or media literacy or raising public awareness and understanding of global issues.  There have been two successive multiannual grant schemes since the fund was established.  These are known as the sound and vision schemes.  Given that the grants are paid to commercial operators, European Commission approval for the schemes was required under state aid rules and grants must comply with the conditions set.  The total income of the fund from its establishment up to the end of 2011 was just over &euro;100 million.  Of this, &euro;86 million had been allocated to support the production of more than 1,200 programmes.  Close to 90% of the funding was allocated to television programmes with approximately 10% allocated to radio productions.  At an operational level, funding applications are assessed against specific specified scheme criteria.  On completion of the assessment process, a schedule of recommendations is presented to the authority for formal ratification.  The examination noted that over 60% of the 2011 applications for funding were rejected at the assessment stage.  Given that processing of deficient applications is wasteful of resources, the report recommended that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland identify the reasons for the high rate of rejections and engage with stakeholders to improve the quality of applications. <\/p><p>  The report also recommends that a greater level of transparency be brought to the assessment process.  In particular, assessment reports should clearly demonstrate the manner in which applications for funding satisfy or fail to meet the scheme criteria.  The report makes a number of recommendations in relation to the management of grant funding agreements.  These include actively seeking to recover funds where delivery schedules are not met or contract terms are not adhered to and considering past contractual performance when reviewing further applications for funding.  We also recommended that the management of requests to draw down funding be done on a contractor basis rather than on an individual project basis.  As an example, this could mean the withholding of payments on one project if applicants were not in compliance with agreement on earlier projects.  The report also identified a need for the authority to ensure that all sources of State funding were taken into account when determining whether EU regulations on state aid were being complied with.<\/p><p>  The examination found that funded programmes are not monitored by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to ensure they are broadcast.  The report recommends that formal verification procedures be introduced, including the possible retention of final grant instalments until confirmation of broadcast has been received.  The contracts for some programmes provide for recoupment of funding where the production generates profits.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland was unable to definitively state the number of contracts which contained a recoupment clause and there has been no recoupment of funding to date from any profits generated by funded productions.  Some grant-funded programmes also availed of tax-based financing and are, therefore, more likely to have profit potential.  The report recommended that the authority should maintain a register of contracts with recoupment provisions and actively monitor the profitability of those projects.  <\/p><p>  Ultimately, the purpose of the grants scheme is to achieve the stated objectives.  It is difficult to determine the fund's effectiveness because the authority did not set targets in relation to those objectives.  The report recommends that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland consider setting output targets and capturing more objective impact data so that the benefits and contribution of the fund can be more fully assessed.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland undertook to consider this recommendation in the planned statutory review of the fund which was scheduled to commence in the latter part of 2012.  The CEO should be able to update the committee in that regard.<\/p> <p>The authority produces separate financial statements in regard to its other operations.  In the main, these relate to regulatory functions regarding the broadcasting sector.  The main source of income for this activity is a levy imposed on broadcasters, based on full cost recovery from the regulated bodies.  In practice, since the introduction of the levy in 2010, the authority has collected fees in excess of its actual expenditure.  As a result, the financial statements indicate an amount of &euro;2.9 million was due to broadcasters at end 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013041800011#K01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366281000,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I will confine this brief statement to the Vote, as Mr. O'Keeffe will deal with the Chapter on the broadcasting fund in his opening statement.<\/p><p>  As requested by the committee, I have also provided a briefing note updating the position as regards end-2012 expenditure on the Vote.  The total gross spend under the Vote in 2011 was &euro;446 million.  This was some &euro;49 million below the 2011 budget allocation of &euro;495 million.  The gross spend was divided between &euro;323 million, current, and &euro;123 million, capital.  <\/p><p>  Turning to the sectoral areas, there was expenditure in 2011 of some &euro;17 million on communications, multimedia developments and the information society.  This expenditure was primarily on broadband schemes operated by the Department.  Some &euro;117 million was spent in the energy sector in 2011.  The bulk of this was in respect of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and was mainly for the implementation of energy efficiency schemes, on which some &euro;98 million was expended in 2011.  The schemes funded supported energy efficiency in homes, including for low income families, businesses and the public sector.<\/p><p>  In the broadcasting area, expenditure in 2011 was some &euro;246 million.  Of this, &euro;182 million was paid in grant aid to RTE in respect of the revenue from the sale of television licences.  In addition, grants of &euro;36 million and &euro;14.4 million were provided for TG4 and for the broadcasting fund respectively.  Under the natural resources heading, almost &euro;28 million was paid to meet the administration and operational costs of Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Loughs Agency.  Also under this heading, some &euro;7.5 million was expended by way of grant in aid to Ordnance Survey Ireland.  In addition, &euro;1.4 million was spent on various geoscience initiatives, &euro;2.9 million on a national seabed survey and over &euro;1.9 million on mine rehabilitation.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Department's administrative budget, this has been almost halved since 2007.  The total spend in this area was &euro;40 million in 2007 and it is now &euro;22.2 million.  This is a reduction of 44% over a five-year period.  It partly reflects the transfer of some minimal functions, but mostly arises from a reduction in staffing resources in the Department, from 339 at the end of 2007 to 248 at the end of last year, representing a reduction of 91 or 27%.  Notwithstanding this, the Department has continued to oversee and implement a wide range of new and existing programmes, undertake certain regulatory functions and provide quality advice across its wide brief.<\/p><p>  As indicated previously, I have provided the committee with the Vote outturn figures for 2012 separately.  These indicate gross expenditure of &euro;405 million in 2012 or &euro;41 million below the 2011 outturn.  The outturn for 2012 also represents a saving of &euro;48 million on the 2012 budget estimate of &euro;453 million.  A breakdown by subhead has also been provided.<\/p><p>  A key outcome in 2011 was the successful switch-off of the analog TV system on which the Department expended some &euro;2.3 million on an information and advertising campaign.  The spectrum released by the analog switch-off was part of the multiband auction conducted by the telecommunications regulator in November 2012.  This realised some &euro;855 million for the Exchequer, of which &euro;450 million was paid in 2012, which was some &euro;270 million in excess of the budget provision.<\/p><p>  I confirm my Department has an internal audit unit which operates in accordance with a written charter.  Its annual plans are approved by me and an independent audit committee.  These audits may cover any area of activity involving public funds within the remit of the Department.  Internal audit reports are circulated to the Comptroller and Auditor General and representatives of that office meet the committee annually.-<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013041800012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Dunning"},{"type":"speech","time":1366281000,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Thank you.

We have submitted detailed briefing documents to the committee on the matters under examination and I will now summarise some of the key elements.<\/p><p>  The sound and vision scheme has been in operation since early 2006 and has supported the production or \"in production at present\" of over 500 television programmes and just under 1,300 radio programmes.  These have been broadcast on public, commercial and community broadcasting services in the State, a total of 58 radio and television services.  We have provided funding of over &euro;108 million from the licence fee allocated to the BAI to support the making of these programmes.  Over 90% of that funding has gone to the independent production sector.  Many of the programmes have received critical and audience acclaim, for example, the animation project \"The Secret of Kells\" which received an Oscar.  In the current week, a number of programmes we funded are showing on television, including \"The Estate\" on TV3, \"Sc&uacute;p\" on TG4 and \"John Lonergan's Circus\" on RTE.<\/p><p>  With regard to reviews of the scheme, we undertook a formal review in 2008 and we are currently in the process of a review.  There is strong endorsement from all stakeholders for its existence and continuance.  It is viewed as having a positive economic and cultural impact on the broadcasting and independent production sectors, particularly in the independent production sector, which has highlighted employment in the sector as being supported by the scheme.  We also have an arrangement with the Irish Film Institute on archiving of programmes made, which allows access to the public for all of the programmes through the scheme.<\/p><p>  As committee members are aware, the Comptroller and Auditor General conducted a review of the scheme during 2012.  This was a thorough process which produced a fair report and no significant issues for the BAI arose.  The report made a series of recommendations with regard to administration and management and outputs and performance of the scheme.  The BAI co-operated fully with the Comptroller and Auditor General and agreed to implement all of the recommendations, either in full or in part.  Significant progress has been made in regard to some of the recommendations and progress has been made on all of them since the report was completed in 2012.  We detailed progress in respect of the recommendations in appendix 1 of the briefing document.  I will be happy to answer any questions members may have on those matters today.<\/p><p>  With regard to the financial statements for 2011, the BAI has continued its policy of operating tight financial controls on expenditure.  As a result, the levy invoiced on broadcasters was reduced from &euro;5.6 million in 2011 to just under &euro;5 million in 2012.  Recently, we sent out invoices to broadcasters in respect of 2013 and these have been based on a further drop in the amount liable for levy.  The estimates we have submitted in respect of the following years, 2014 and 2014, show this pattern continuing.  The finance audit and risk committee of the BAI operates as a sub-committee of the authority.  It met on eight occasions in 2012 and it oversees all finance, investment and audit matters.  It also meets with the Comptroller and Auditor General, considers a series of internal audit reports and reviews and updates the risk register.<\/p><p>  The sound and vision scheme paid out grants and awards of just under &euro;14.4 million in 2012, up from &euro;11.8 million in 2011.  There was no recommendation within the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General with regard to the surpluses we held, but they were noted.  In keeping with the principle of the review, we have sought to reduce surpluses and in doing that the scheme made awards of over &euro;19 million in 2012.  Administrations costs, which include staffing, legal and audit fees and assessment and consultancy costs, have been kept at less than 8% of the total income to ensure that the majority of funds are allocated to the making of programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013041800012#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1366281000,"counter":259,"content":"<p>May we publish Mr. O'Keeffe's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013041800012#L00600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366281000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013041800012#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1366281000,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending today and apologise for the delay they experienced.

As well as it doing very well here in terms of winning an IFTA, the producers entered it in festivals abroad and it has done very well because of that Irish link with an very international story.  The scheme allows such a story to be told and a film on it to be made.

We had a lot of engagement with the sector on why applications were failing.  That was a constant issue.  We highlight that in our response in the document.  It is a competitive process.  One competes for the funding and, inevitably, what we have found in the past year is that a lot of qualifying applications for very good projects have been rejected because we simply do not have the funds.  It is a very competitive process at this point.  Independent producers and broadcasters are all putting in a lot of applications.  The number of applications in the past 12 months has increased dramatically and there is no sign of it reducing in the current run.  That is a factor.  There is only so much money that we can give.<\/p><p> A second factor relates to the high level of radio applications, probably from the community sector, and we need to work with the sector a little more.  We have been doing some work with it.  It is a fact of life currently that there is a finite amount of money and that has reduced this year from last year.  To give a concrete example, we received applications in the current round for projects worth up to &euro;18 million but we have funding of only &euro;4.5 million.

One of the issues that is also highlighted in the chapter 20 report is the fact that people were taking more than 12 months to sign contracts.  One of the reasons for that is applications were not at a sufficient stage of development.  We had identified that fact in 2010 so we took a much stronger line in terms of saying that we would only award funding to projects that were at a point where they were ready to go into production so they could meet the requirement to sign a contract within 12 months.  That meant a large number of projects were failing at that point.  We funded all the qualifying applications in 2011.  That was one of the factors that fed into our surplus.  Moving into 2012 we had identified that as being an issue we needed to examine so we changed the round structure and that meant last year we got a lot more qualifying applications.  As Mr. O&rsquo;Keeffe said, we will still have a significant number of applications that will fail but they will not fail because they do not meet the quality threshold.

If we consider the skills the workforce of the future requires, they are in the digital area.  If we do not have the infrastructure in the school to enable those skills to be imparted, we have a deficit.  As a Department we are centrally involved in promotion of the digital society and we are happy to put aside from our relatively small capital resources the amount of money we have put aside to date, and will continue to do so on the basis I have set out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013041800018#R01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Dunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366285200,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I would encourage Mr. Dunning to monitor it but I am aware anecdotally from some schools, and this is not the fault of his Department, that sufficient emphasis is not placed on developing modern media skills in their students.

We had an engagement with the Revenue Commissioners on that.  Initially, we did not agree with their interpretation on the matter and we took some tax advice on it.  Moreover, the tax advice we received indicated we were right and we did not think the legislation applied in this instance.  We had discussions with the Revenue Commissioners on the matter, but it stood its ground.  It was strongly of the view that the legislation did apply to communications contracts.  We then considered our options, of which there really were two.  We could come to an agreement with the Revenue Commissioners - on a voluntary basis, as the Deputy noted - whereby we would admit there was a technical breach, if one wishes to put it that way,  and would pay a fine, which amounted to &euro;15,000.  Alternatively, we could have gone into battle with the Revenue Commissioners and gone to litigation or to appeal commissioners.

During this morning's discussion, I have found it hugely instructive to examine the list of projects the broadcasting fund is involved in supporting, which appears in appendix 2.  It really brings home the diversity of broadcasting in which the authority is involved, as well as the scale of the moneys allocated to people, which is both big and small.  The largest grant was for &euro;1.5 million, three were for amounts greater than &euro;1 million and a large number were worth approximately &euro;100,000, followed by a long tail of awards of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;12,000, which were for radio projects.  However, there is a gigantic variety of different projects involved in all of this.  I wish to focus on the observations the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in chapter 20 regarding how that fund would operate, as well as some recommendations it made in that regard, and will turn to paragraph 20.19 of the report.  I will not go through everything here, because in quite a few cases the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has accepted the findings fully.  It stated it accepted the point and outlined what it was going to do about it.  However, on the issue regarding delays in finalising contracts, the report makes the point that four of the 25 cases examined did not finalise their contracts within the 12-month period and for some, the finalisation point for the contracts ranged from 13 months to almost three years.

The first point is that one must have a commitment from the broadcaster that it will broadcast the finished product.  We then make the offer and those concerned have 12 months in which to put everything in place and sign a contract with us.  That is now the situation and we will go beyond that only in exceptional cases.

If there is a request to go beyond 12 months, it comes to me first, as the chief executive officer, from the Sound and Vision team, and I then refer it to the authority to make a decision.  There may be genuine reasons for it.  Certainly in the case of large projects, there may be reasons, as the amount we give may be a small portion of a larger amount to put together a project and there may be different reasons it has taken longer.

Annexe C refers to the profile of projects funded from 2006 to 2011.  A couple of things jumped out at me, including funding by language.  In television, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is not doing as well as I would have anticipated on the Gaeilge front.  Some 50% of the television programmes supported is in English, while 22% is bilingual and 28% is in Irish.  When one goes across the radio spectrum it is really massively unbalanced, is it not?  Only 10% of the radio programmes supported are in Irish.  How does Mr. O'Keeffe account for that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013041800023#W02600","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366287600,"counter":667,"content":"<p>It is a challenge.  There is undoubtedly a massive imbalance.  Under the scheme, the requirement is to have 25% Irish and bilingual programming, and we achieve that annually from the entire scheme.  Clearly, in television we achieve more than that.  There is an issue related to the number of broadcasters.  In television there are a limited number of broadcasters that apply for support from the fund.  TG4 is obviously a strong applicant or a supporter of applications for the fund.<\/p><p>  On the radio side that is not the case.  We have a number of Irish language broadcasters.  We have Raidi&oacute; na Life in Dublin and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  They have not contributed to a great extent.  Some of the community services have put in projects which are either Irish or bilingual.  Generally speaking, across the rest of the sector, we would not receive many applications in Irish.

Aldi is a privately owned international discount food retailer operating in nine countries worldwide.  We entered the Irish grocery market in 1999 and currently have 100 stores nationwide.  We opened our 100th Irish store this morning in Callan, County Kilkenny.  We also announced this morning our plans to open a further 20 new stores over the next three years, with the intention of creating 300 permanent jobs.  Aldi's headquarters and distribution facility is located in Naas, County Kildare.  A second office and distribution facility that will service our southern operations will open in Mitchelstown, County Cork, in September this year.<\/p><p>  We are committed to working with as many Irish suppliers and to sourcing as much of our offering from within Ireland as possible.  When Aldi opened its first stores in Ireland in 1999, our product range was largely imported.  Over the past 13 years we have adopted a localised approach to our Irish operations, investing in and developing an Irish buying department comprising over 40 professionals dedicated to increasing the number of products sourced from Irish suppliers.  As we have grown, so too have our suppliers' businesses.  Aldi has tripled its annual spend on Irish products over the past five years, helping maintain over 20,000 jobs across the Irish food industry.  In the same five year period, we have recruited more than 60 new Irish suppliers, meaning Aldi now partners with over 125 Irish suppliers, producers and manufacturers.<\/p><p>  Currently, over 50% of Aldi's grocery range is sourced from Irish suppliers.  All of our Nature's Isle fresh poultry, beef, pork and lamb are sourced exclusively from Republic of Ireland farms which are certified under the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme.  All of the fresh breads and almost half of the cakes sold at our stores are sourced from Irish suppliers.  Aldi's milk is 100% Irish sourced, while more than half of the yogurts we sell are produced in Ireland.  Aldi's fresh fruit and vegetables range is also sourced, where possible, in Ireland.  Other Irish produced products available at Aldi stores include eggs, chocolate, cheese, crisps, tea, coffee, dog food, flour, soft drinks and spring water.<\/p><p>  We are always looking to work with new Irish suppliers and to innovate our product range.  Our buying department works closely with Bord Bia in this regard and we have held a series of well-attended seminars for existing and prospective suppliers to develop relationships further and plan future seminars with Bord Bia to explore exporting to our international business.  In recent years, our Irish sourcing practices have matured beyond trading with traditional grocery suppliers, as we have partnered with a number of new, innovative Irish producers such as EuroPharma Concepts Ltd., from Clara in County Offaly, which is the only Irish company making toothpaste and mouthwashes, and Gallagher's Bakery in Ardara, County Donegal, which produces high-quality gluten-free products.<\/p> <p> Aldi's commitment to Irish products is based on our interest in playing an active role in the economy.  Equally, we find that Irish customers have a certain expectation with regard to the taste and appearance of certain products that can only come from Irish producers.  Since July 2008, Aldi has maintained the position of the fastest growing supermarket chain in Ireland and is now the fifth largest grocery retailer in terms of sales.  We firmly believe our strategy of offering high quality Irish produced products has been a key driver behind our continued strong performance and growth.  Opportunities also exist for Irish products to be sold in Aldi's international businesses.  Currently, products from Irish suppliers are sold in Aldi's UK, US and Australian businesses.<\/p><p> Aldi's chief concern is providing our customers with an unrivalled value-for-money grocery offering, by selling high-quality goods at the lowest possible price.  Our customers tell us they have managed to save up to &euro;80 a week on a typical family shop by shopping at Aldi, without having to compromise on quality.<\/p><p> In delivering real value for money for our Irish customers, Aldi maintains excellent relationships with all of our suppliers, farmers and producers. We have adopted a long-term, co-operative, sustainable approach to working with our Irish suppliers, many of whom, including Callan Bacon, Iverk Produce, Irish Yogurts and Gem Pack have worked with Aldi for more than ten years.  We offer our suppliers fair market prices for the products they supply.  Agreements reached are honoured and invoices are paid promptly.  It would make no sense for Aldi's business to squeeze suppliers, seek additional discounts or renege on an agreement.  Our business model involves little or minimal duplication in our product range.  For example, we offer one type of flour that comes from one supplier.  If we make it difficult for our supplier to operate, we will not have any flour to sell in our stores and, as a business, therefore, we would lose out.  Aldi categorically does not demand any money from its suppliers.  We do not ask suppliers for \"hello money\" to stock their goods or for financial marketing support to run promotions on their products to give them prominence.  Given that 95% of the products sold at our stores are own-label, are unique in our range and are produced exclusively for Aldi, such a practice is irrelevant.  We do not seek payments from our suppliers for spillages, wastage, etc.  Such costs are borne by Aldi.  We negotiate a fair price with a supplier that works for both parties and then stick to that agreement.  We agree a cost price for products delivered to our distribution centre and we do not ask for anything more. Our straightforward approach to working with suppliers is recognised by the industry and Aldi has not attracted any of the negative commentary related to some practices in the sector.  This was noted at a previous meeting of the committee when the author Suzanne Campbell told members the feedback she had from the industry and, in particular, from the then IFA President, Padraig Walshe, who said trading with Aldi was exclusively positive.<\/p><p> Aldi achieves its low prices and value for money through our efficient, well-organised business model.  Efficiencies are sought and achieved in every aspect of our business.  I will briefly illustrate what we mean by this.  For example, the checkouts in our stores utilise the leading scanning equipment in the market and place multiple barcodes onto the product to make it scan as efficiently as possible at the point of sale for the customer.  This results in our checkouts being on average 50% quicker than other retailers.  Our stores are largely uniform in size and we know exactly how much they cost to heat, clean and maintain.  An Aldi store can be run by between 12 and 15 people, compared to 200 for a large multiple retailer, which leads to staff cost savings.  This is not achieved at a cost to our employees; Aldi pays on average 30% higher than the market.  We also minimise the use of product packaging and shrink wrap, further reducing the cost of products.  Having only 1,350 lines with minimal or no duplication of products, removes the additional costs related to buying, developing and stocking products.  Customers are not charged more to have to make decisions about largely comparable products.  They, in essence, buy into and trust the choices we have made for them and benefit from the savings.  That is a huge responsibility and it is one that we take seriously.  Strong customer support has meant Aldi's market growth has consistently been the strongest in Ireland every month since July 2008.<\/p><p> I refer to the proposed statutory code of practice for the grocery sector.  Aldi fully complies with all Government regulations and legal obligations with respect to operating in Ireland and will continue to do so.  However, Aldi is not an enthusiastic supporter of the introduction of such a code of practice . As previously described, we firmly believe we have a fair and efficient operating system in place with our suppliers.  We do not believe, therefore, it is appropriate that we should be punished for the indiscretions of others.  Legislation exists to deal with this issue, which is not being availed of by suppliers or producers and we do not see how a code of practice will address this problem.  Our primary concern is that the introduction of a statutory code will mean an extra layer of bureaucracy in dealings between the retailer and supplier, which, in turn, will mean an additional cost of doing business and, ultimately, higher prices for the consumer.  Our customers understand the strong relationships we have with our Irish suppliers and appreciate the low prices and value for money Aldi provides through our current fair business practices.<\/p><p> Providing correct and informative labelling to ensure customers can make informed decisions when shopping is of the utmost importance to Aldi.  Customers are particularly interested in buying Irish products where possible and the need for comprehensive and accurate food information labelling is essential for their trust.  All Aldi products are clearly labelled in terms of provenance and content.  If a product is 100% Irish, that is, grown or farmed in the Republic of Ireland and subsequently produced and packed in Ireland, it carries a tricolour logo with the words \"100% Irish\".  All of our Bord Bia quality assured fresh poultry, beef, pork and lamb carry such a logo, as does our Irish organic smoked salmon range.  We also differentiate between products that are produced in Ireland and those that are packed in Ireland.  Finally, if a product is sourced from Northern Ireland, we indicate this.  This approach ensures our customers are clear about the provenance of our products.<\/p><p> Aldi was extremely disappointed by recent events relating to the mislabelling of the content of a small number of beef products, which clearly let our customers down.  It was totally unacceptable to Aldi and we felt angry and let down by the suppliers in question.  If the label says \"beef\", our customers expect it to be beef.  Our suppliers are absolutely clear that they are required to meet our stringent specifications and Aldi does not tolerate any failure to do so.  Each mislabelled product was immediately recalled and removed from our shelves and the company responsible for supplying the product removed as a supplier to Aldi.  Our rigorous testing and quality control procedures are already among the most exacting in the retail industry.  However, recent events mean that Aldi must raise the standards of compliance for our suppliers to an even higher level to ensure that our stringent specifications are met.  Aldi is determined to learn from this experience and avoid any repeat.  We are now introducing a programme of regular DNA testing to ensure meat content conforms to specification and labelling.  Aldi customers need to have absolute confidence in Aldi products and we will continue to work tirelessly to enforce exceptional quality control throughout the supply chain.<\/p><p> Aldi has been the fastest growing retailer in Ireland since 2008 and we firmly believe that the high quality products supplied by our many Irish suppliers have contributed significantly to this growth and we thank them for their continued support in this regard.  Our own-brand Irish product range has proven to be very popular with both our customers and the food industry, winning a number of national and international awards for quality and taste.  Our Irish suppliers have won 45 Blas na h&Eacute;ireann national food awards since 2009, picking up more awards than the suppliers of any other retailer in Ireland over the last three years.  Our Irish suppliers also performed strongly at the prestigious 2012 Great Taste Awards in London, picking up a total of 29 titles.  I will leave my opening remarks at that and I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800003#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366274400,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation.  Mr. O'Connor made a straightforward presentation, which dealt specifically with a number of the issues of concern to us.  There was a concern that the balance of power between producer, the processor and the retailer was not equal and there was a constant pressure on the producers to produce more for less.<\/p> <p>There is a concern that the conditions being laid down in certain cases will eventually put producers, as opposed to processors, out of business.  I am referring to the sector in general rather than a specific company.  Let us take one simple product, liquid milk.  Producers are concerned about the power and dominance of the multiples and the imbalance in the allocation of the share of profits in respect of the gross price paid by consumers.  They have informed me that if this continues, milk production, particularly winter milk, will become unviable and we will eventually reach the point where there will not be sufficient winter milk available to supply supermarkets. <\/p><p> I have noted with interest a newspaper report this week indicating that it is intended to buy liquid milk from some of the large producers in the south east and export it to the United Kingdom, which is a much larger market than Ireland.  I understand it is likely that the United Kingdom will have to import milk from this island, North and South.  One hears that a significant amount of milk produced in the North is sold in the South - I have no problem with this, as I am not a partitionist - but producers of milk in the North look two ways, namely, south of the Border and across the sea to Britain.  We may become dependent on Northern milk if Southern farmers pull out of the business because it is no longer viable on the basis that they cannot compete with their Northern counterparts because they have a lower cost base in the North.  However, if a better price can be achieved subsequently in Britain on the basis that it is no longer self-sufficient in liquid milk, we will suddenly find ourselves without milk.  This is only one example of the issues we are discussing because, as the delegates will be aware, there are constant complaints from vegetable growers, including potato producers, about standards and so forth.  That is the background to this issue.<\/p><p> I compliment our guests on their straightforward presentation and welcome the clear statement that Aldi does not seek shelf money or hello money, special promotions and so forth.  This was a major concern.  Does Aldi operate in the United Kingdom?  This is an important question because I understand a food ombudsman has been introduced in the United Kingdom to act as a type of referee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800004#G00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366275000,"counter":748,"content":"<p>It is known as a food and drink adjudicator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800005#H00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1366275000,"counter":749,"content":"<p>Sometimes the precise terminology eludes me.  The adjudicator is able to undertake an analysis of, for example, the price of a two litre carton of milk - let us say it costs &pound;1.49 - and make a decision on the division of profits.  Is Aldi opposed to a policy of adjudication?<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Connor's statement that it would not be appropriate for Aldi to be \"punished for the indiscretions of others\" implies that there are indiscretions and bad practice in the trade.  Laws introduced in the Oireachtas frequently impose a major onus on citizens and businesses.  Legislation is invariably introduced in response to the indiscretions of the few, rather than the many, and to protect society against those who cannot live by high standards.  The recent DNA scandal is a case in point.  I presume the vast majority of suppliers to Aldi provide exactly what the company seeks.  However, in the recent case, a small number of people across Europe decided that they would ignore all codes.  As a result, a series of new regulations will come into force to ensure the unscrupulous few can no longer get away with such practices.  I ask the delegates to address this issue.  If there are indiscretions, do they not accept that it would be fair, in the interest of stopping the unscrupulous, to introduce a trade-off whereby everybody would have to comply with a mandatory code of practice?  This would ensure those involved in what the delegates described as indiscretions and what others describe as bullying tactics or unfair practices were brought to heel and forced to comply with the high standards Aldi claims to observe.<\/p><p>  While every group that has come before the joint committee has stated it does not want a mandatory code, none has argued that retailers do not abuse their dominant position over producers, nor has any of the them told us how we would ensure, other than by the introduction of mandatory codes and a food adjudicator, that everybody, not 80% or 90% of the market, would adhere to high standards.  That is the nub of the issue.  <\/p><p>  Why are cars subject to a national car test when most people keep their vehicles in good nick, regardless of whether there is a test?  The NCT was introduced because some people allowed their cars to fall apart.  It imposes an additional burden on people and is unfair in the sense that it requires those who keep their vehicles in good nick to pay money to have them tested.  That is simply how society operates and this is the nub of the issue.  How would the delegates address the issue of unfair practice if they were in our position, other than by using the power of the law?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800005#H00300","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366275000,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I will answer the question on the code of practice and Mr. O'Connor will answer the question on the supply of milk, specifically winter milk.

I have a couple of questions, the first of which relates to the code of practice and whether it should be mandatory or voluntary.  As our guests are probably aware, the Government proposes to introduce a consumer and competition Bill which will include provision for a code of practice for the retail sector.  As is the case with probably every other company which has made a presentation to the committee, the representatives from Aldi indicate that it is fully compliant with all the legislative and regulatory requirements which apply within the State.  If all companies are already compliant and they are already incurring costs for being compliant, maintaining records, etc., I fail to see how implementing a code of practice would give rise to a significant additional cost.  Perhaps our guests might indicate where the actual increases in costs might arise.  If the various companies are so compliant, they must be incurring significant costs already.  In such circumstances, imposing a code of practice would not give rise to an additional major burden.<\/p><p>  Our guests have referred to the DNA testing which Aldi has initiated.  Obviously, this will give rise to an additional cost.  Given that the company is so sensitive to cost pressures, surely this is not something it would want to be doing.  It is obvious, however, that there is no reluctance on the part of the company to carry out DNA testing.  I fail to see, therefore, why there might be a reluctance to implement a statutory code of practice, if one were introduced.  Perhaps our guests might tease out this matter a little further.<\/p><p>  In the context of pricing and suppliers, it has been stated Aldi operates an annual tender programme.  Does this mean suppliers can expect that prices they agree with Aldi will be maintained on an annual basis and that changes could not be made within the relevant 12 month period?  What processes does the company have in place to ensure suppliers are kept abreast of what the price agreements are and does it have a policy on introducing changes to take account of fluctuations in price?<\/p><p>  The final matter to which I wish to refer is not really germane to the subject matter of the meeting.  However, it was mentioned on a number of occasions during the presentation.  It is welcome that Aldi will be opening 20 new stores throughout Ireland.  That is a positive and welcome development.  Our guests have referred to how efficiencies are built into Aldi's business, how their stores can be run by 12 to 15 staff and how this is not achieved at a cost to employees.  I understand Aldi does not recognise trade unions and does not allow employees to enter into collective agreements.  The National Employment Rights Agency has indicated that 53% of companies inspected by it have failed in their obligations to employees.  This is an indicator of how matters might be dealt with otherwise when a business does not recognise the right of its employees to join trade unions or when it does not have proper and agreed grievance procedures in place.  If the latter is the position, it might indicate the way in which particular businesses might wish to deal with suppliers.  Will our guests outline their views on union membership among their employees?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800006#J00100","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1366275600,"counter":753,"content":"<p>I must vacate the Chair at this point and call on Deputy Pat Deering to take over.

Our employees earn in excess of 30% more than the industry average.  We treat them very well and have a very good record of retention in our business.  The Deputy has stated we discourage employees from being members of trade unions, but that is not the case.  We do not recognise trade unions, but we also do not discourage anyone from being a member of a trade union.  The choice in that regard is entirely his or her own.  The conditions we offer within our business are excellent and recognised as such.  We do not make the link between suppliers being mistreated and how we treat our employees.  In fact, we also have a very strong record in terms of how we treat our suppliers.  This is consistent with how we treat our employees.  There is a consistency but not the one the Deputy is suggesting.  It is actually the opposite of what he is suggesting.<\/p><p>  On DNA testing and whether our activities in this regard seem to contradict what we said about the introduction of a code of practice giving rise to an additional cost, the Deputy inquired as to why we would not happily shoulder that cost as well as the cost of DNA testing.  DNA testing will definitely work and certainly achieve the outcome intended.  In other words, the DNA material in products will be tested.  However, we remain unconvinced as to whether a code of practice, be it voluntary or statutory, will work and achieve what is envisaged in the context of people who believe they have been mistreated in coming forward and availing of the process.  There is already legislation in place of which people might avail, but this is not happening.  We are not convinced, therefore, that the introduction of a code will not simply give rise to an additional layer of cost and an extra burden of administration.  The Deputy has stated all companies are claiming to be compliant, but we can only speak for ourselves.  We certainly are compliant.  We will be obliged to introduce additional administration - and additional labour to deal with this issue - if any of the codes of practice proposed is introduced.  We are compliant and after the introduction of a code, we will be compliant, but we will have a higher cost base.  If the introduction of a code does not achieve what is envisaged for it, we will have a higher cost base with no return.  That is our concern and why it is different from the introduction of DNA testing which will work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800006#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donald Mackay"},{"type":"speech","time":1366275600,"counter":756,"content":"<p>Has Aldi had any engagement with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the development of a code of practice in which it could have faith?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800006#J00600","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366275600,"counter":757,"content":"<p>We have engaged with the facilitator throughout the process and expressed our concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800006#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donald Mackay"},{"type":"speech","time":1366275600,"counter":758,"content":"<p>What about developing a code of practice that could work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800006#J00800","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366275600,"counter":759,"content":"<p>We have given feedback on our concerns in respect of what is being proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800006#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donald Mackay"},{"type":"speech","time":1366275600,"counter":760,"content":"<p>That is not the same as proposing something which might work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800006#J01000","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366275600,"counter":761,"content":"<p>That would place all of the burden back on us in creating the entire code of practice.

Deputy Thomas Pringle has inquired as to what comprises the cost in this regard.  The main constituent is our reissuing every contract into which we have entered with our suppliers in a new form in order that we would be compliant with the new code of practice in the context of the details we would be required to include in contracts under that code.  There would also be significant legal costs.  As we understand it, the code, as drafted, would give rise to significant training costs.  There would also be ongoing training costs on an annual basis.  There would also be reporting costs.  In such circumstances, there would be significant administrative costs that would absolutely arise as a result of the introduction of a code of practice which we currently do not have to meet.  As stated, however, we would comply.<\/p> <p>There is no question in that regard but if extra costs have no benefit, why would we want to add them?  Mr. Mackay may comment on the same point.<\/p><p> In terms of the annual tender, the Deputy asked whether a contract that was set for a year with a supplier lasted for the entire year or if there were circumstances in which its terms could be changed, specifically cost price.  Yes, a contract can be changed in both directions, upwards and downwards.  We actively participate with our suppliers on a weekly basis.  If circumstances in the market change so dramatically that sourcing a product becomes unsustainable, we will revisit the issue with our suppliers.  We have 1,350 products.  We offer one tomato ketchup product whereas the multiples offer five different brands in four sizes.  If one is missing, the consumer will take something else.  If we do not have our tomato ketchup, we lose business.  We do not need many of our lines to be absent before customers start believing that they cannot get everything they need from us.  It is in our interest to have sustainable relationships with our suppliers so that we can have a sustainable delivery of our product.

They also stated that more than 50% of Aldi's grocery range was sourced from Irish suppliers.  What percentage of non-grocery products are sourced from Irish suppliers?  Mr. O'Connor referred to having 1,350 products.  It was mentioned that Irish suppliers were sold in Aldi's UK, US and Australian businesses.

Our guests stated that they had felt angry and let down by the suppliers in question.  We are facing a challenge.

I am not claiming that this is Aldi's situation, but the multiple in question stated that it felt let down by its supplier.  Morally, it could not stand over such a claim when it was only paying 8 cent for a product that was supposed to be a beef product and it knew that producing a burger for that price was impossible.<\/p><p>  How much cognisance does Aldi take of pressures on suppliers?  What is its response to the claim of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, that retailers do not pay sufficient attention to the increasing input costs facing primary and middle producers?  It has been stated that Aldi does not get involved in how producers work, but it deals with processors that have a relationship with primary producers.  If there is a squeeze in that regard, it has an impact.  This factor should be included in the mix.<\/p><p>  My question on the code of practice has been asked, so I will change it a bit.

Through a comprehensive tender process, we are aware of the constituent parts of every product that we produce.  On the basis of our buyers sitting down and discussing these parts with their counterparts among our suppliers, we agree a fair cost price.  We take costs into account, although we do not negotiate directly or have a direct relationship with the producer.<\/p><p>  I can cite a number of examples of overseas supply.  Our Irish operation does a significant amount of business with Callan Baking in County Kilkenny.  Its product is exported to our UK business.  We also have a significant relationship with Irish Dog Foods, the products of which are exported to our UK and German businesses.  Should members require it, we can provide information on further examples.<\/p><p>  We participate in in-store promotions.<\/p> <p>I would insert a caveat by saying that we are effectively an everyday low-price retailer.  How we differ from others is that the prices we set are the prices the consumer will pay next week and the week after.  Their shopping basket does not increase or decrease on a weekly basis and there is really no requirement for consumers to move from one retailer to the next to seek out the best value.  They should be aware that they can come to Aldi and avail of the best value in the market and a significant discount every week.<\/p><p> Having said that, we heavily promote what we call a Super Six offer on fruit and vegetables.  How that works is that we have meetings with our suppliers and indicate to them that we would like to increase volumes and we negotiate a cost price based only on increased volumes.  We then select a retail price that we feel is appropriate for the promotion and we sell the items to the customer at that retail price for a period of two weeks.  It is a rolling two-week promotion that we do throughout the course of the year with different products.  The cost of the promotion is borne absolutely by Aldi in the same way that it is our cost if we choose to put an advertisement in a newspaper.  We do not get into a situation in which we say to a supplier that we will sell a product at X amount and pay them Y.  We have a discussion with them in advance.  We need to do that because of the point I made earlier, which is to say that we need supply.  We will not offer a promotion to a customer and then not deliver.  We ensure we have supply.  We estimate and agree volumes with the supplier and then we set our retail price and we take the burden of the reduction.<\/p><p> On our spend in terms of groceries, currently the figure we quote is 53% of what we currently pay to our suppliers.  In our Irish business, spending on grocery items goes to Irish producers.  That is not a retail figure that is distorted by televisions or whatever else; it is what we pay for food items to our Irish suppliers.<\/p><p> In terms of tripling our spend, I am not sure how I can answer that question because we were asked about the base from which it had risen.  I am not comfortable giving a figure on where we were.  What we can say is that if we assume a figure for three years ago or five years ago, we have tripled it using the measure of cost price that we pay the supplier.  Five years ago we were paying X; now we are paying Y, and the volume has increased threefold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800007#K01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366276800,"counter":775,"content":"<p>What is Mr. O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s view of Aldi&rsquo;s share of the competition in the Irish grocery marketplace?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800008#L00200","speaker":"949"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366276800,"counter":776,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Heydon asking whether we consider it to be a competitive market?

We think that by offering everyday low prices, as Mr. O&rsquo;Connor described, rather than raising and lowering prices on an ongoing basis, it puts a lot of pressure on everyone else to reduce their prices in order not to allow market share to transfer from them to us as we grow, but of course we have grown.  Mr. O&rsquo;Connor has mentioned that.  We opened our 100th store today.  We are going to open a second distribution centre in Mitchelstown in Cork in September and we will continue to expand through the two distribution centres and to open the 20 stores we have said we will open over the next three years.  That will not be the end of it.  We will continue to grow from there.  The two distribution centres have a far larger capacity than the 120 stores we have already indicated.  The market is competitive and we play a part in making it competitive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013041800008#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donald Mackay"},{"type":"speech","time":1366276800,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O&rsquo;Connor and Mr. Mackay for attending.

We are going to get the answer some day from a multiple about gross margins in this country.  Aldi is operating in nine countries.  Is the gross margin taken out of this country in the top third, the middle third or the bottom third compared to the other countries in which Aldi operates?<\/p><p>  It has been said that annual tendering does not influence Aldi as to who is the producer for the primary supplier to the company.  However, it must have a big effect in the case of fresh produce, especially fruit and vegetables or meat.  If I negotiate with Aldi and put in a tender that is accepted, renegotiation can work both ways, as was mentioned.  For example, a supplier could say the price must increase because his or her costs have gone up or Aldi could say to a supplier after one month that its costs have risen and that it must reduce the price paid to the supplier.  That could have an effect on the primary producer, namely, the farmer.  In the tender process a price is agreed for a product to be supplied.  Does part of the annual tender relate to different credit agreements with suppliers?  Are there different credit agreements with each supplier on the length of time for which Aldi is given credit?  Could the credit agreement be renegotiated when the annual tender takes place or at any stage during the term of supply?<\/p><p>  I have asked all the multiples about the proposal on minimum pricing for the sale of alcohol in supermarkets and off-licences.

They are listed in our business for a short period, usually at Christmas time.  We set our retails on those prices in order to be profitable.

Obviously, that cannot apply going forward but historically, it does apply.  Of course, for a retailer like Aldi, once landlords have us in a commercial rent situation, they are not going to yield on the agreement that they have with us and we understand that.  However, the market, as far as commercial rents are concerned, is not growing.  That means that when the rent reviews come around, while our rents will not go down, they are unlikely to go up because of the prevailing market situation.

My name is Phyllis Cunningham, I am a qualified nurse and I started my career in Jervis St. Hospital.  My current role is senior transplant co-ordinator and I manage the National Organ Procurement Service, currently based in Beaumont Hospital.  I manage a team of five transplant co-ordinators and liaise with 40 intensive care units around Ireland.  I also work closely with transplant units in hospitals in Britain and Northern Ireland.  I set up the organ transplant service in Beaumont Hospital in 1986 and have continued to work in the area.<\/p><p>  Every day I witness at first hand the life saving and life changing outcome of organ transplantation.  I have experienced the development of all the transplant services in Ireland and see the increasing demand for more organs for transplant.  In 1999, for instance, there was an average of 100 patients on the waiting list for renal transplant and 145 transplants took place.  Today, there are 600 people on the waiting list and at best we expect to achieve 180 renal transplants by the end of the year.<\/p><p>  I am humbled by the wonderful families I meet who make the very unselfish and thoughtful decision to donate their loved ones organs at a very difficult and traumatic time.  I have experienced the comfort and consolation families have derived from organ donation and I passionately feel that every family should be offered the opportunity to consider donation in circumstances where it would be possible.<\/p><p>  I would like to share with the committee my most recent experience.  I was involved in a case with two parents whose six year old boy died suddenly in extraordinarily tragic circumstances.  For confidentiality, medical and legal reasons, I cannot discuss the circumstances.  I would like to highlight, however, that these parents, who have many questions that will require open and honest answers regarding the lead up to their son's tragic death, at a very difficult time spontaneously donated their son's organs for transplantation and the recipient was another child in a life saving situation.  This wholly unselfish gesture of the donor family ensured that the recipient family would not have to go through what they had just experienced: the loss of their child.<\/p><p>  I welcome legislation to support an increase in organ donation but I have concerns about the term &quot;presumed consent&quot;.  I feel this term has negative connotations as it loses sight of the fact that the donor family is central to the whole process and so the ultimate choice must rest with the family.  In practice, it should be presumed that all families would like to be asked about organ donation and in keeping with their loved ones wishes they will make the right decision for them.  The ultimate decision will be with the family of the deceased.  I believe the best approach would be to incorporate into the legislation an opt-out system which would involve the family.<\/p><p>  Most importantly, in conjunction with any legislation there needs to be ongoing public awareness and education about the need for and benefits of organ transplantation.  Knowing the wishes of your loved one regarding organ donation is easier for a family than having to make a decision on their behalf at a very difficult and traumatic time.<\/p><p>  Legislation and education alone are not enough.  More resources are required to deal with the potential increase in the service and a robust infrastructure must be put in place to ensure discussion with the families about organ donation is done in the right way at the right time by the right person.<\/p><p>  Organ donation truly is the most precious gift, given unconditionally and wholeheartedly with such goodwill to the organ recipient.  Organ donation not only benefits transplantation but it is a key element to support families in their grieving process.  It is very important that we can maintain a positive and sensitive approach at a most traumatic time for a grieving family.<\/p><p>  I will share an example of the gratitude felt by recipients by reading an excerpt from a letter written by a 16 year old to his donor family on the anniversary of his transplant.  He said:<blockquote>I know this time of year is very hard for you but I hope it helps to know that I think of you every day and how grateful I am for the wonderful gift you gave me.  Everything I do, everything I achieve, I do it for you.  Most especially, I bring your loved one with me and I will try never to let you down.  Once again, thank you for changing my life, from a kidney recipient.<\/blockquote>In reply, the family wrote back, &quot;Our lives will never be the same because of the loss of our loved one but your letter is beautiful remembrance.  Take care and best wishes for the future&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Phyllis Cunningham"},{"type":"speech","time":1366274100,"counter":841,"content":"<p>Our next witnesses, Mr. Joe Brolly and Mr. Shane Finnegan, are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800004#D00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366274100,"counter":842,"content":"<p>I thank the committee and the Chairman for inviting us here today.  I am a part-timer but the celebrity surrounding this failed transplant has captured people's imaginations.<\/p><p>  We have worked closely with the main stakeholders, North and South, and our question was &quot;How can we help?&quot;.  It quickly became clear to us that the way to help was to work towards the putting in place in the South of proper infrastructure for organ donation and to move towards the system operated by the leading European donor rate countries.<\/p><p>  It has been a huge adventure for me and I see beside me, and I cannot say how ecstatic I am to see her, Ms Noreen O'Halloran, whom I met at an event for the Mercy Hospital in Cork earlier this year.  At that stage, she was so ill I thought things might not work out for her.  I sent her a text about six weeks ago to say I was thinking of her and she texted back to say not to worry because she was on her way to the hospital for a transplant.  Five weeks ago she received a kidney from the family of a deceased donor in very difficult circumstances, as they always are.  The transformation is extraordinary.  This is the amazing Noreen O'Halloran today, and she is a full supporter of the Government's proposed legislation for soft opt-out.  She has her own website for patients, which she will talk about.  The fact she is here today is a symbol that there is nothing to fear from this because family consent is at the heart of the proposal.<\/p><p>  If members would be good enough to look at the document that has been circulated, from the <i>makelifeyourlegacy.com<\/i> website, &quot;Opt for Life!&quot;, we hope that a one-stop shop can be worked out with people like Professor Jim Egan and Dave Hickey, and with Phyllis Cunningham, who is the doyenne, the mother of organ donation in this society, who works tirelessly often with little help and few resources, along with her team in Beaumont Hospital.  The point of our involvement is to ensure the organ donation system is fit for purpose.  There is no reason we should be lagging behind the main European countries.<\/p> <p>This is very easily solved and it makes perfect economic sense.<\/p><p> Briefly, I want to tell the committee about the position in Northern Ireland.  One of the documents that I have circulated to the committee is from the Department of Health and Social Services with whom we have been working closely in the North.  Over five years, in the North, by putting in place the infrastructure that Professor Egan recommended in his paper which is one of the appendices in the document the committee has, we have achieved an 81% increase.  That is coming from a very low base in Northern Ireland five years ago of approximately 13 or 14 donors per million of the population - we are now at 22 per million.<\/p><p> One of the appendices in the document is drafted by Dr. Paul Glover, who is the national director in the North for organ donation and transplantation.  The five main parties, all of the patient associations in the North and all of the main stake holders are unanimously in favour of a move to soft opt-out for the following reason.  Even with a good infrastructure, we have reached a ceiling in the North and we realise now that the way to move to the next level is to move to soft opt-out.<\/p><p> Briefly, I will explain the proposal.  I appreciate that most of the members are in tune with what is going on.  The reason I started this is that after I came out of the transplant and I went on the radio talking about how people must become donors, I received a call from one of the McNicholl girls, a mountainy woman from Dungiven which is close to me.  She said I was wasting my time and that we should do what is done in Belgium, where everybody is a donor unless they do not want to be and one's family still has the final say.  She told me that everybody is a donor in Belgium and it is merely a normal part of the dying process.<\/p><p> This proposal, what the Minister is proposing, will make organ donation the norm in society.  If one thinks of it logically for a moment, the question at present is, \"Should I decide to become a donor?\"  Apathy is a big problem in that regard - we only have 27% or 28% of the people involved.  Under the new system, the question will be, \"Is there a reason that I should not be a donor?\"  That will more properly accord with the overwhelming view in society that organ donation is good.  Who does not want to save seven lives after he or she is dead?<\/p><p> I do not want to go through all the nitty-gritty, but the committee will see the basics of the proposals and all the statistics set out.  A phrase is often used about this - I have been using social media and I am aware that Ms O'Halloran used it too.  The question that keeps coming back from people is, \"Why have we not done this already?  It is a no-brainer.\"<\/p><p> I commend the proposal to the committee.  The committee will spend time reading the document.  We have a limited amount of time here and I will pass over to my good friend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Brolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366274700,"counter":844,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Shane Finnegan to the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800005#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366274700,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brolly.  I also thank and congratulate the Chairman for acting so promptly and with such an open mind on this issue when Mr. Brolly and I first met him a couple of months ago.  I also commend the Chairman and the committee for hosting these hearings, today and next weeks.<\/p><p>  I struggled when I first sat down to consider what I could add to this process.  I am an organ donation campaigner with all the facts, but the many other eminent representatives one will see here, today and on 25 April, can relay that information to the committee.  Then I thought there is something that I can bring to this table that some others cannot, that is, what this process is like through the eyes of the patient.  I will tell the committee what this debate and the issue of organ donation looks like through my eyes.<\/p><p>  First and foremost, I see a wildly fluctuating system where in any given year someone like me may have a slim chance of a transplant.  In another year, such as 2010 when organ donation dropped by 28%, I would have no chance.  I see the top ten European countries for organ donation have adopted the opt-out system and being representative of patients dependent on the Irish health service, I validly ask the question, \"Is that a coincidence?\"<\/p><p>  I also see in 2012 that Ireland, a giving country full of compassionate people, has an organ donation rate of 20 per million population compared to 35 per million in countries such as Spain and Croatia.  As a proud Irish person, I see this outlook on organ donation as not being reflective of the Irish people.  Contrary to all the good work of the talented professionals who work in this field, I see that this is the result of a confined and restricted system.<\/p><p>  I can say with some conviction that Irish people are compassionate as regards organ donation because Mr. Brolly and myself had independent research conducted by Am&aacute;rach on the soft opt-out system.  The question we asked the Irish public was, \"Would you support a system of organ donation where all of us were donors unless we have opted out during our lifetime, with the next of kin always having the final say?\"  In a survey of over 1,000 persons and without any education on this issue, 71% said \"Yes\", 11% were indifferent and 18% said \"No\".  The committee is the first to hear this research.  Mr. Brolly and I will be issuing this to the media later today.  With a good education process that would accompany legislative change, Mr. Brolly and I firmly believe these figures on public support would rise.  As a patient, I see us pushing an open door.<\/p><p>  Finally, I will give one last statistic which for me, as a long-term renal patient, is the most concerning of all.  In 2000, there were only 150 patients awaiting kidney transplants.  Today, that figure is closer to 650, a 413% rise.  People are living longer.  Type 2 diabetes sufferers are on the increase and the current waiting list will not dissipate any time soon unless we make this very subtle change.<\/p><p>  With dialysis patients each costing the health service &euro;70,000 a year, there are long-term savings to be made by changing.  One cannot put a cost on a human life.  That is for others.  Fr. Alex Reid once stated that if by his actions he could save one life, then it will have been worth it.  How often do the committee members, as legislators, have the opportunity to go back to their constituents and say they are actively saving multiple lives?  I do not think anyone before the committee today, or on 25 April, would question that.<\/p><p>  After 20 years knocking around renal units, transport wards, dialysis units and operating theatres, I have not seen or heard of a system that can impart change and make the difference the way this opt-out system could.  Call me naive.  I see no plan B.<\/p><p>  I would ask the committee not to have somebody like me sitting in front of it in ten years' time when the situation is undoubtedly worse.  They should give us hope, show leadership of which I see an abundance in this room and start helping us drive the change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1366274700,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I would point out to Mr. Brolly that the Minister and the Government have not yet published legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800005#E00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366274700,"counter":847,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Brolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1366274700,"counter":848,"content":"<p>Hopefully, as part of our deliberations, we will feed into that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800005#E00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366274700,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800005#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Brolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1366274700,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Christine Quinn from Castlebar, County Mayo, and thank her for attending.

Up until then, I was in perfect health.  Later that year I was diagnosed with a rare and incurable lung condition.  Over the next few years my condition deteriorated until, in August 2011, matters reached a critical stage.  I could no longer work and I was hospitalised.  I was dependent on oxygen to keep me breathing.  My life was very grim and there was no end in sight.<\/p><p>  Professor Jim Egan, with his wonderful team at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, was my life-saver.  They cared for me and never let me give up hope.  With their help and support, and tremendous kindness, I was given the chance to have a second shot at life.  Professor Egan agreed, at this stage, that a transplant was my only means of survival.  I was ecstatic, but at the same time I was very nervous wondering would I survive.  I was one of the very lucky ones.  I was put on that transplant list.<\/p><p>  At this stage, I had what everyone else would say was everything but, in reality, I had nothing.  I had a good job.  I had plenty of money.  I had my own house, plenty of friends and my own car, but that was nothing because I had not got my health.  None of it was any good to me.<\/p><p>  I could barely walk and I could not breathe.  I depended on my family and friends to do absolutely everything for me.<\/p> <p>Oxygen kept me alive and in September 2011, just two weeks after being put on the list, I got the call that saved my life.  I was given the ultimate gift of a lung transplant and thankfully I have never looked back.  I am now back at work and am able to do the things in life I love and best of all I can go for a walk and breathe fresh air, something I could not do.  I can now do the simple things in life that we all take so much for granted.<\/p><p> People should not be fooled - it was by no means an easy journey and there were days when I wondered if it was worth it all.  As members look at me today they see living proof that organ transplantation works.  I will be forever grateful to the wonderful family that allowed their loved one to be my donor.  There are huge waiting lists for recipients and a great shortage of donors.  Advances in medical science result in more successes in transplantation, which should encourage more people to be organ donors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800005#E00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Christine Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366275300,"counter":853,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Quinn for coming this morning and sharing her story.<\/p><p>  Our next group of speakers Ms Noreen O'Halloran, Mr. Michael Kiely and Ms Annette Betson are also sharing time.

Mr. Michael Kiely and Ms Annette Betson and I are very pleased to be here and have listened with great interest to the many invited guests.  We also hope our personal experience of organ failure will assist the members of the committee and give them a greater understanding of how organ failure affects the lives of patients and their families.<\/p><p>  I will give a brief introduction.  Mr. Kiely suffers from end-stage kidney failure and after being on hospital haemodialysis, his sister, Ms Betson, decided to become a living donor to him.  As a result in January 2012, Ms Betson successfully donated one of her kidneys to Mr. Kiely.  I was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease at the age of 18 and started peritoneal dialysis or home dialysis in September 2011.  I am happy to report that five weeks ago I received a kidney transplant from a deceased donor through Beaumont Hospital.  My form of kidney failure is hereditary and unfortunately has affected four generations of my family.  My father, Mr. Tom O'Halloran, has suffered with this illness for 30 years and is currently awaiting his third kidney transplant.  So far he has been waiting for six years.  It would be more common for a parent to be proud of his or her child, but I can say wholeheartedly that I am so proud of my father as a result of what he has been through.  While I would always have loved to have given my dad a kidney, since that is not possible being here is the only way I can help him.<\/p><p>  It is because of what we have been through or in my case what I still see my father going through that Mr. Kiely, Ms Betson and I would like see an improvement in the current organ donation system.  In that respect we have two proposals we feel could greatly improve the current system of organ donation.  Our first proposal is the employment of more co-ordinators in all acute hospitals.  We feel that the role of the co-ordinator is extremely important, particularly in identifying potential donors and also in comforting families who have decided to donate their loved ones' organs.  At present Beaumont Hospital has six co-ordinators with none in any of the other acute hospitals.  As a result we believe potential donors are being missed.  Having two co-ordinators in each acute hospital would go a long way towards ensuring that organs are not being overlooked and result in more transplants thereby saving more lives.<\/p><p>  Our second proposal is the establishment of a national organ donor register, which we believe would encourage more people to sign up indicating their willingness to be a donor.  In this age of technology, this seems the most effective way to obtain donors.  The UK operates a similar register and after running a campaign at the start of the year to highlight organ donation, an additional 147,000 people registered.  While I appreciate that it has a greater population, as this form seems to work there, why should Ireland not establish a similar register?<\/p><p>  The newly introduced driving licence format gives an opportunity to tick part 4 in question 20 agreeing to become an organ donor whereby code 115 will appear on the licence.  The Government is already in effect collecting this information therefore making it easier to establish a register.  For people without access to a computer we feel that organ donor cards could still be used but perhaps a prepaid envelope should be included with the card allowing them to send their details for entry into the organ donor register.  It would be imperative for all acute hospitals to be able to access this database should an issue with organ donation arise.<\/p><p>  Over the past nine years there has been a significant increase of 785 patients needing dialysis.  There are various reasons, including obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure.  The end result is that the number of patients needing dialysis is increasing annually.  As of 31 December 2012, some 1,828 people were on dialysis at a cost to the State of &euro;118.9 million.  This can be compared with the cost of transplant per patient at &euro;96,000.  I should say I got these figures from the HSE.  If we were to increase kidney transplants by 100 each year to reach a target of 250 per annum, the cost to the State would be &euro;24 million, thereby reducing the burden of dialysis on the State to &euro;94.9 million.  It should be noted that post-transplant the cost of maintaining a patient on drugs and hospital visits is approximately &euro;10,000.  An estimate is that each transplant results in a saving to the health service of in excess of &euro;830,000 per patient over the lifetime of the graft, which is approximately 15 years.  An increase in transplant activity of 100 transplants therefore results in savings of &euro;83 million over the lives of those 100 patients when compared with maintaining them on dialysis.<\/p><p>  Since I received my kidney transplant and after consulting various renal consultants and clinical nurses, I have been informed that the rate of rejection of a kidney transplant is now minimal.  This is due to the exceptional cross-matching in Beaumont Hospital and advances in immunosuppressants.  Therefore the medical staff rarely see rejection anymore.  While I say that the average life of a kidney transplant is between ten and 15 years, as a kidney recipient, I am certainly aiming for many more than 15 years.  Hence the saving of &euro;830,000 I mentioned earlier could possibly be greater.<\/p><p>  The kidney transplant programme in Ireland is at a critical juncture where, in order to further develop the programme for both living and deceased donors further investment in infrastructure is needed.  The investment would result in a doubling of the life expectancy in patients with renal failure and a saving to the health service of in excess of &euro;240 million over the next ten years.  Expansion of kidney transplantation to 250 transplants annually would result in the following benefits over the next ten years: a reduction of more than 1,000 in the number of patients maintained on dialysis; a reduction in dialysis treatments of 1.4 million; a reduction of 2.8 million patient journeys to dialysis treatment centres; and a doubling of the life expectancy patients would have if they continued on dialysis.  All those figures have been supplied by the HSE.<\/p><p>  Having been on two forms of dialysis over 17 months - I know Mr. Kiely will agree with me on this, I cannot overemphasise how my life has been transformed in just five weeks.  I have never felt better.  A weight has been lifted from my shoulders and my life is my own again.<\/p><p>  The following needs to be done in order for Ireland to reach its full potential of donors.  We need to train more co-ordinators in all acute hospitals.  We appreciate there would be initial costs to such a project, but as highlighted by the figures I quoted earlier, the cost would be greatly outweighed by the benefit of getting patients off dialysis and improving their quality of life.  We need to establish a national organ donor register that is accessible by all acute hospitals.<\/p> <p>The information could be collected on this register or on the new driving licence application form.  Promoting living donors could be achieved by trying to reduce the time it takes for cross-matching and work-ups.  People could be encouraged to donate through incentives.  In some parts of the United States tax incentives are offered to those who offer a kidney to a loved one.  In the past week, Australia announced it would pay three weeks wages to anyone who agreed to become a living donor to a loved one to a maximum of AU$3,600.  Perhaps Ireland could consider a similar or different incentive to encourage living donors.<\/p><p> Public awareness is extremely important.  We feel most people not affected by organ donation do not fully understand its implications or how they can help.  Recently, and unbelievably, I was asked by a man in his mid-30s what was dialysis.  This is why educating and informing is so important.  Real-life stories are the best at achieving this.  For my part, six months ago I decided to establish a website, <i>kidneyfailuremystory.com<\/i>, with a view to raising awareness of dialysis and documenting how it has affected my life.  In a way I wanted to give hope to other patients who had just started dialysis.  At times the isolation can be immense.  To date, in less than six months, more than 19,000 people have viewed the site.  If only a fraction of these 19,000 people decide to carry a donor card as a result I will have been successful in raising awareness.  At no stage has anyone ever disagreed with soft opt-out.  Everyone has been in favour of it.<\/p><p> Mr. Kiely, Ms Betson and I hope committee members have found our presentation informative, and that they appreciate our concerns regarding organ donation.  While we do not expect miracles we would like to see an improvement of the current system, a change for a better, and a more positive future for all patients awaiting any form of transplant, whether heart, lungs, liver, pancreas or kidney.  Who knows when any of us or our families may be affected by organ failure.  It should be noted one is three times more likely in life to need a transplant than to have one's organs donated.  Since the numbers awaiting transplants are growing yearly we cannot emphasise enough the real need for an immediate improvement.  For this reason we are in favour of soft opt-out and for change sooner rather than later.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Noreen O'Halloran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366275900,"counter":856,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Halloran, Mr. Kiely and Ms Betson.

I will commence by giving the committee a brief outline of the history and evolution of the Irish Kidney Association and treatment of kidney failure in Ireland.  Dialysis as a treatment is 70 years old.  It came to Ireland in 1958 and kidney transplantation started in January 1964.  In 1978 the Irish Kidney Association was founded by three groups of kidney patients coming together from Dublin, Cork and Galway, where haemodialysis was available.  The catalyst was the need to start a public awareness campaign highlighting the need for kidney donation after death.  The first kidney donor cards were produced by the IKA for the first awareness campaigns, which were ten years after the UK health system had produced its cards.<\/p><p>  As time moved on many more haemodialysis centres were opened, some funded and others built by the IKA.  The IKA grew along with the success of dialysis and transplantation.  A new drug, cyclosporine, was discovered, which is very effective in stopping the body from rejecting a strange new donated organ.  This permitted far superior kidney transplantation and liver, heart, lung and pancreas organ transplants also became possible.  Along with kidney transplantation they are now considered normal surgery and expected by society.  At present in Ireland, out of 3,900 patients with failed kidneys 53%, or 2,100, are transplanted and 47%, or 1,800, are on dialysis.  Including all other organ transplants, just under 3,000 people in Ireland enjoy extended life because of organ donation resulting in transplantation.<\/p><p>  Anyone who says the Irish organ donation and transplantation system is not working is wrong and misinformed.  What is true, and the reason we are before the committee today, is that Ireland is the only country in Europe which has never legislated for the organ donation and transplantation process.   What we have done is transpose last August the EU directive on the quality and safety of organ donation and transplantation into a Department of Health statutory instrument.  The Houses of the Oireachtas have never willingly debated organ donation and transplantation, except for Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Private Members' Bill, No. 43 of 2008.<\/p><p>  The discussion today surrounds the consent we seek from the public for deceased organ donation.  For the past 49 years this has been informed consent by the next-of-kin of the deceased.  Situations such as where no next-of-kin are available, next-of-kin not being able to make up their minds in time, or a dispute within a family are described as &ldquo;no consent&rdquo; and organ donation does not proceed.  Obviously organ donation does not proceed if consent is refused, but this decision is grouped together with the other situations I described and labelled &ldquo;no consent&rdquo; in all the records available to us.  This dilemma of \"no consent\" has frustrated people across the globe, particularly in Europe where organ transplantation is advanced but as many as ten people a day die because of the lack of donated organs.<\/p><p>  Some jurisdictions created a law of presumed consent.  The Spanish were the first to do so in 1979 and many countries chose to follow.  In the course of the following ten years, the Spanish realised creating this consent law made no significant difference to the donation rates and there was a wide variance in hospitals' organ donation rates.  Spain realised the shortage of organ donations was not because of the public&rsquo;s lack of willingness; it was much more to do with the clinical practice and process and the individual skills of health care staff in dealing with donating families.  In 1989 the Spanish created an organisation, Organizaci&oacute;n Nacional de Trasplantes, ONT, which trained and placed organ donor co-ordinators in hospitals and organised the organ donation process.  As a result, Spain has led the world's organ donation rates ever since.  It averages 35 donors per million of population.  Other countries which followed Spain&rsquo;s example are achieving more than 30 donors per million of population as a consequence.<\/p><p>  The architect, and head, of ONT, Dr. Rafael Matesanz, repeatedly states that changing laws on consent does not change organ donation rates.  One must change clinical practice inside hospitals to increase the rates.  The practice in Spain is informed consent, and is internationally recognised as being so regardless of what the law on the statute books suggests, which is presumed consent.  The rest of Europe found the exact same, and hard or soft presumed consent is not practised anywhere in Europe, where all countries use informed consent.<\/p><p>  In our strongly held view it is worth considering the point that renaming our consent system to suggest presumed consent, will simply confuse and divide the public.  The Irish people like to be asked, and not told, to do something.  Some people have no next-of-kin, some are entirely estranged from their families, some are separated, and not legally so, awaiting divorce, and some relatives will not be found in time.<\/p> <p>How is consent achievable for these people?  Should a decision posted on a register be acceptable for organ donation to proceed in these circumstances?  Could we go a little further and suggest that the recorded wishes of the deceased should be paramount?  We advocate, as do others, for a national organ donor registry to be used to show the next of kin the proof of decision by the deceased in his or her lifetime.  Should we take the decision in the registry as consent if next of kin are not available?  That is food for thought.  That might require written consent rather than an online registry.  If so, why not consider written consent by the person as consent after their death in the circumstances I have described where next of kin are unavailable?  NHS Blood and Transplant issued a press release last week announcing that the UK had increased organ donation by 50% in five years.  They did not alter their consent system.  They changed clinical practice, as we are suggesting we should do.<\/p><p> Creating a consent law that is different in name but in practice will be operated exactly as best practice dictates - which is informed consent - is foolhardy and will only lead to unnecessary confusion for the public.  We must introduce the Spanish organ donor co-ordinator model and the infrastructure surrounding organ donation to make real changes.  We can increase our rates just as the UK has done and save and extend the lives of 50% more people as a consequence.  The least important issue in the packages of changes the committee will learn about in these presentations today is the consent issue.  The infrastructure proposed will change everything for the better.  Ironically, the Spanish, Croatians and other European countries have proven that this infrastructural investment returns net savings in costs for other treatments that far outweigh the initial investment.  At worst, it will be cost-neutral on our health system and we will improve and extend many more lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366276500,"counter":859,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy for his presentation and for coming here this morning.

The first heart transplant took place in the Mater Hospital in September 1985.  Until the end of December 2012, there have been 296 heart transplants in Ireland.  The Irish Heart and Lung Transplant Association is a non-Government funded patient group.  We welcome the opportunity to put forward our view on the proposed changes in organ donation from opt-in to op-out and the problems this would create if it is changed without specific measures being put in place beforehand.<\/p><p>  Ireland is a very giving and altruistic society and our current donation rates, while not the highest in Europe, are still about 20 per million of population which ranks us just above mid-table in the list of European countries.  However, we can and should do better.  There is no evidence that presumed consent soft opt-out by itself will improve donor rates and to consider it without having the necessary infrastructure in place to support it would harm the gift of life ethic, which is so important to the idea of organ donation.  <\/p><p>  Therefore, before considering a change from opt-in to opt-out, let us look at the infrastructure that needs to be in place.  First, we need specialised donor co-ordinators in all our major hospitals.  As alluded to by Mr. Murphy, the NHS Blood and Transplant recently released details of a 50% increase in donation figures over the past number of years.  One of the major factors in achieving that was the employment of a network of 250 specialist nurse co-ordinators throughout the UK system.  Second, we need a national donor registry.  The Government needs to give sufficient resources to publicity campaigns across the country to inform people of the meaning of presumed consent and to promote donor awareness.  We also need proper funding for our national organ donation transplant office to allow it to function to its full potential.  The importance of the infrastructure cannot be underestimated and will require additional resources to ensure that presumed consent soft opt-out is introduced properly.  <\/p><p>  It would be wrong for committee members and their colleagues to legislate for a change to opt-out thinking that it will improve organ donation and transplantation without first addressing the weaknesses and gaps that exist in our current system.  We support the premise of presumed consent soft opt-out but only if the aforementioned infrastructure is set in place beforehand.  We owe it to the public and the many people awaiting a life-saving organ transplant to ensure that this is introduced with the necessary measures in place.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800008#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gilligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1366276500,"counter":861,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gilligan for his presentation.

Our role is to encourage and facilitate organ donation and shape policy in respect of transplantation and donation.  Much of our work has been done behind the scenes over the years.  We have contributed much in terms of a positive atmosphere towards organ donation in Ireland.  At the outset, it is important to say there is a division of opinion among us in respect of the question of soft opt-out.  Most of the groups in our network are in favour of moving to that process but we respectively and gently disagree with our colleagues from the Irish Kidney Association.  There is a significant amount on which we do agree but we disagree on this issue.  The other groups who are in favour of moving to a soft opt-out position include: the Alpha One Foundation, which is represented here in the public gallery by Ms Catherine O'Connor; Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, which I represent; the Irish Heart and Lung Transplant Association, which is represented by Mr. Gilligan; and the Irish Lung Fibrosis Association, which is also represented in the public gallery today.<\/p><p>  We are in favour of moving to a soft opt-out position and we understand this position will be presented by the Government.  All the Government has said on this issue to date is three lines in the programme for Government 2011-2016 so there is an onus on the Minister to set out in more detail what exactly it means by shifting to an opt-out position and to explain what a soft opt-out position is.  That needs to be done sooner rather than later.  Under no circumstances would the groups we represent in this submission support a hard opt-out approach whereby next of kin would not be consulted.  Next of kin should always be consulted in respect of organ donation.  This is the major change between now and 2009 when this issue was considered before and the Government was suggesting a hard opt-out position.  We agree with the Irish Kidney Association that those countries that profess to operate a hard opt-out system whereby next of kin are not consulted, for example, Austria, do not actually apply it in practice.  The IDN acknowledges the excellent individuals involved in transplantation and co-ordination, such as Ms Phyllis Cunningham with whom we have worked for many years and who is representative of the excellent standard of transplant co-ordinators, surgeons and teams and the procurement team.  We contend that without their dedication and skill, often working far beyond what they are called to do, transplantation and donation rates would fall considerably.<\/p><p>  We support a move to soft opt-out but we agree with Mr. Gilligan's argument that it must be accompanied by a package of essential measures.  The last thing we want to do is move towards a soft opt-out position and then see no difference in the organ donation and transplantation rates in a year's time.  <\/p> <p> The infrastructure for transplantation and organ donation must be improved.  The committee has heard a number of people, including patient representatives, state that a key issue is the appointment of a network of donor co-ordinators who would be assigned to major hospitals with ICU units.  Basically, they would be medical and nursing personnel who would ensure the smooth operation of the organ and transplant process, including protecting the interest and welfare of families who choose to donate organs in very difficult circumstances.  <\/p><p> We have, believe it or not, a national organ donation and transplant office.  It does fantastic work and is led by Professor Jim Egan but he has no resources.  He carries out the work in addition to his day job as co-ordinator of the lung transplant programme at the Mater Hospital with virtually no secretarial support.  If we are serious about co-ordinating organ donation and transplantation, adequate resources must be given to the office.  <\/p><p> I have heard staff at the Department of Health say that they will not develop a national organ donor registry.  How can people opt-out if there is no registry?  One simply needs to design a website that will allow people to indicate their preference.  We must also list a menu of organs to donate because some people may be happy to donate their kidneys but not lungs.  It is important to give them a choice.<\/p><p> From a lung transplant perspective, and I know that Ms Catherine O'Connor and Mr. Brendan Gilligan would agree, we need to take specific measures to improve the rate of heart and lung transplantation in Ireland.  Top priority should be a replacement for the very fine surgeon, Professor Freddie Wood, at the Mater Hospital.  There is also an inadequate number of rooms for surgery, preparation and recovery at the hospital and we need seven rooms for a transplant programme.  A soft opt-out system will make a difference based on other experience but not without these specific measures that I have outlined.  I agree with the soft opt-out but only as part of a package of measures.  A soft opt-out cannot be introduced on the cheap. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800008#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Watts","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366277100,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Watts for his presentation.

I found the presentations informative and inspiring.  To be truthful, when I have read about a living donor I wondered how I would respond if my brother looked me in the eye and said \"Bill, it's life or death for me\".  I admire the people who have donated.  Many of us would probably find it hard to make such a judgment call.<\/p><p>   With regard to the broader issue, I support the soft opt-out option.  Some people may know Dr. Patrick Hennessy from Cork who advocated donating and received a kidney.  I know him very well and have visited him a number of times.  Ireland has a low donation rate of only 20 organ donations per 1 million of population.  I do not have an intimate knowledge of the infrastructure that is required.  I have wondered whether the low rate is due to a cultural or religious factors.  Is there a reason we do not proactively donate organs?  Ireland is an altruistic nation in many ways.  Is there a reason Ireland does not rank high in the table of countries that donate organs?  Is it simply that we do not have the proper infrastructure?  Do we not have enough donor co-ordinators in the trauma units and accident and emergency units in hospitals?  Are there other reasons?  <\/p><p>  Very often legislation does not necessarily change the public's mind but it obliges Governments to do things about the legislation that they have enacted which means putting in place infrastructure in hospitals to encourage and allow organ donation.  We must remember that two patients are involved in the process, the one that donates and the one that receives.  I hope that organ donor co-ordinators in hospitals will have a strong understanding of donation and be trained in how to deal sensitively with people.  Co-ordinators will have to deal with people whose loved one has or is going to have his or her life support machine turned off and his or her family will have strong emotions.  <\/p><p>  A family sent me information that their young child had been involved in a car accident but had subsequently died.  Afterwards the parents regretted that they had not made the decision to donate his organs.  They were very emotional.  At the time their only focus was on their son and they never looked beyond that but sometime later they regretted not donating his organs.  Whatever decision is reached on legislation and the presumed consent or soft opt-out, we must ensure that in all cases the family is consulted.  It does not matter whether it is a hard or soft opt-out, in every case the family must be consulted and the infrastructure must be put in place.  <\/p><p>  I listened to wonderful comments on organ donation made by Mr. Joe Brolly, Mr. Shane Finnegan, Ms Noreen O'Halloran and others.  Very often the committee talks about policy and administration but on this occasion it should promote the concept of organ donation.  Aside from dealing with the appropriate legislation, we should advocate strongly and give people a platform to express ways to develop organ donation.  We are talking about life and death here but organ donation needs proper administration.  There have been advances in technology, medical technologies and immuno-suppressants.  We should also examine North-South relations and the possibility of a strong island-based transplant system just like what we are doing for rare communicable diseases.  We should work closely with the UK in that context.  I know that there is strong co-operation between various hospitals.

Family discussion on the issue is key to any successful scheme.  It is important that people who are in favour of donating their organs tell their next of kin so that if there is a tragic accident it reduces the burden on the family to make the decision to donate the organ.  I would also like to see specialist transplant co-ordinators trained in grief counselling based in every hospital trauma unit.  When this model was introduced in Spain it led to a large increase in the number of families consenting to donate the organs of a loved one.  It is important that we consider introducing a system to maximise the number of organs available.<\/p><p> I accept it is important to have a national organ-donor register.  Ongoing public awareness and education are very important to promote donor awareness.  What types of campaign do the witnesses plan to hold?  Do they plan to go into schools?

I am quite new to this issue of organ donation.  I lived in Belgium for approximately three years at the beginning of the 1990s, shortly after its system was introduced, and it was quite a hot topic there.  I agreed with it at the time and I still instinctively agree.  However, I wish to tease out some issues.  I understand that 24 of the 27 EU member states have some sort of presumed consent or opt-out system in place.  We need to consider those who are not in favour of the presumed consent model.  After Belgium introduced the system in 1986 there was a significant awareness-raising campaign and perhaps the rise in organ donations could be attributed to the awareness-raising campaign rather than the legislative changes.  People might argue that the US has one of the best rates of organ donation but it does not have presumed consent.  Ms O'Halloran mentioned the tax incentives in one of the states.  The US have what I believe is called a presumptive approach, whereby families are approached on the presumption that they will agree.  With the exception of the representatives of the Irish Kidney Association, all the witnesses have mentioned presumed consent.  There has been coherence on the package of measures that needs to be introduced.  If the measures were all introduced, why would we need presumed consent?  What difference would it make?<\/p><p>  I found the presentations very informative and I am absolutely convinced that we need legislation.  I had not realised we had an absence of primary legislation and that we only have the statutory instrument to introduce the European directive.  Why would we choose presumed consent rather than a presumptive approach?  Irish people do not like being told they have to do something and it is a very emotive time for families of potential donors.  I want to ensure we get this right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800010#K00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1366277700,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I will call the other members, after which we will go back to the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800010#K00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1366277700,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I wish to thank all the witnesses and commend them on their very comprehensive presentations.  I recently spoke to a medical consultant who was involved in a team looking after a patient.  They spent five hours in the operating theatre trying to get someone through a very difficult situation and they thought they had done a great job.  They found that in the theatre next door there was a team of doctors down from Dublin doing organ harvesting involving a girl who had unfortunately had a tragic accident and whose family decided to donate the organs.  They were extremely impressed by the co-ordination that was going on.  That family's decision to donate organs resulted in the transplant of a liver, a pancreas and kidneys.  After spending three or four hours on organ harvesting, they advised the consultant, to whom I spoke, that they were flying back to Dublin, with all the recipients already on the way to Dublin.  They were then scheduled to continue on after midnight to complete the transplants.  That indicates the commitment of the medical and nursing teams involved in the transplant area.  We should acknowledge the great work they do.  When we look at the health service we are very good at identifying the deficiencies.  However, it is also very important that we give recognition to the work being done there.<\/p><p>  Earlier this morning I raised an issue I have with the HSE.  Does a specific person in the HSE have responsibility for this area or does each hospital act independently?  When discussing co-ordinators in hospitals, the first question is whether one person should be answerable in the HSE and work from there.  I agree with the witnesses.  In the case I was discussing, the consultants in the hospital advised the parents that the person would not come through.  The family had no one else to fall back on for assistance.  Appointing co-ordinators is important, but is one person in the HSE responsible?  Is there a mechanism for co-ordination between the HSE and the voluntary hospitals?<\/p><p>  The European cross-border health care directive was passed in February 2011 and has to be implemented now.  Is there now far more co-ordination between health services in Europe and particularly between the UK and Ireland in this area?  Up to now each country has been working individually.  With more specialisation, could we develop a more comprehensive service through more co-ordination between member states?<\/p><p>  The key issue the witnesses have identified is that of co-ordinators within the hospitals.  With regard to the possibility of a change in the area of consent, coming from a legal background I know the difficulties that can arise in dealing with the administration of estates.  It is always a difficult time for families.  I am certainly in favour of a change in the law in this area, and presumed consent, which  is a better option at this stage, is something towards which we should be working.  It also requires a major public information process.  We achieved this in the area of road safety.  This is one area that should be given priority from the point of view of national co-ordination and a national campaign.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800010#K00400","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1366277700,"counter":876,"content":"<p>I wish to thank witnesses for their contributions.

There has been much talk in recent years about organ donation, particularly during the campaigns mounted in awareness weeks.  In recent months the conversation has changed with regard to the soft opt out model, which is something we need to think about and something which I support.  In my preparation for today I discussed this issue at home with family members and friends.  An issue of which I became aware, and perhaps somebody might be able to shine a bit of light on it, is that gay people are not allowed to be organ donors.  Given the amount of testing and tissue matching carried out in the Mater Hospital why can my friend, who happens to be gay, not carry a donor card?

This goes back to what Deputy Conway stated, that we must measure it in our own lives.  I have two boys and if they needed a donor I would want them to be able to receive a kidney transplant.  As a mother I would think twice about donating their organs but if we introduce this it will change the ethos and it will be up for discussion in the family home.  One is three times more likely to need an organ than to donate one.<\/p><p>  Perhaps I misunderstood, but Mr. Murphy, the chief executive officer of the Irish Kidney Association, stated the<i> status quo<\/i>  is okay.  If I were on dialysis I do not know whether I would be that happy.  He stated 1,800 people are on dialysis and 3,000 people are enjoying new organs.  I am aware of a UCD student from Waterford who has great difficulty.  He goes into hospital three days a week and if he wants to go home to his family at weekends, like any student, it must be organised with Waterford Regional Hospital.  It is a huge issue if he wants to go on holidays.  He is a young student and wants a life ahead of him.  I find it hard that the CEO of the Irish Kidney Association stated the status quo is fine.  I will give him plenty of time to answer.  He stated we need a co-ordinated network in the hospitals, but my understanding is those who want the soft opt out option also want this.  What is important is that the family has a say.  Mr. Murphy gave examples of people who live alone or are separated, but having this conversation now will give Irish people time before they are ill or on their deathbed for this decision to be made.

I have huge admiration for people such as Mr. Brolly - and the example he has set is second to none - who give of themselves to those in desperate need.  I am in favour of what is collectively sought, which is the soft opt-out option.  Prior to the meeting today I did a quick run around of my husband's brothers and sisters and my own to see how many of us had organ donor cards, how many of us did not and the reasons for this.  Just under 40% of our family members have organ donor cards, which is good, and I am one of them.  I cannot take the credit for going out and getting my organ donor card.  The only reason I have it is that my husband brought home the form years ago.  With regard to the members of our family who do not have an organ donor card, it is not because they do not want to carry one it is just that they have not got around to organising it.  Life is busy.  Taking this as a small yardstick, the vast majority of people in Ireland do not have exceptional reasons for not carrying an organ donor card, they just have not got around to it.  Presumed consent is very worthwhile and it is incumbent on all of us to get behind it and ensure it happens and that we will not be speaking about it again in a number of years.<\/p><p>  As this is not owned by anybody in the Department of Health or the HSE, I could not find a definitive answer on how much the ICT infrastructure would cost if we were to put it in place, how much the network co-ordinators in each hospital would cost and how we could fit it into the budgets.  If it is not being measured it is certainly not being considered for future budgets.

I thank the Chairman and the committee for the work they are doing on organ donation.  I come from a donor family, and this is the first time I have spoken about it on public record.  Almost 24 years ago I tragically lost a sister, my nearest sibling, to a brain haemorrhage.  At the time we as a family spoke about organ donation.  It is something which appears at a very tragic moment in a family's life and we did not have much time to think about it.  We decided she would donate and I must say, almost 24 years later, it is one of the most fulfilling things we did as a family and is something of which we are very proud.  She donated two kidneys to two different individuals, one a young man the same age as her and another man who was quite a bit older.  Both men are now close friends of the family and visit us and we speak openly about it.  We gave them a whole new life.  I am very much in favour of any proposal which would encourage donation in any way.  I have listened carefully to the arguments on presumed consent and we should consider it.

What needs to change is the infrastructure.  The reason I state the consent issue is the least important is because it is merely renaming what already exists.<\/p> <p>No one is suggesting that the practice in which the manner consent is conducted in a hospital should change.  Why change the name of it for the public?  The family is always contacted.  If consent is not achievable, should we consider other ways?  Renaming what is already the practice, that is, informed consent, might not be clever.  I do not know how it will affect the public other than to divide the public.  A poll was done, which we had nothing to do with, and of 5,000 people, 46% did not want presumed consent, 47% wanted presumed consent and 7% did not have an opinion.

It does not understand soft in, soft out.  \"Presumed consent\" is the phrase that creates emotion and division in the public and I do not want to have anything to do with it, if members do not mind me saying.

I had privileged access to the First and Deputy First Ministers as well as the health Minister.  We worked with all of the parties.  I say \"we\", but I am a part-timer.  There is unanimity in the North on the soft opt-out.  All of the stakeholders, patient groups and clinical leads are in favour of it.  I will revert to this issue.<\/p><p>  All of the parties agreed that it was important that no misinformation be peddled and that the message be given clearly to the public, namely, the proposed system is based on a family's written and informed consent.<\/p><p>  Regarding the US rates, America runs a market model.  Everything is about money.  We are a neighbourly society.  Society must decide how it wants to approach the issue of organ donation.<\/p> <p>In that regard, there has been a subtle but very effective change throughout Europe.  It is not a coincidence that all of the leading countries operate this model.  The York Group, which conducted the research for the UK's organ donation task force, and its document, Make Life your Legacy, has been circulated to members - which I assure them they can trust - and all other recognised studies incorporated into the UK donation task force report and, in turn, into the government programme, concluded that when all other variables are taken into account soft opt-out has a significant beneficial affect on organ donation rates.  <\/p><p> My second point is an important one.  I have circulated members with the Department of Health's circular to us and the comments by the head of the UK donation task force, Ms Elizabeth Buggins.  The new organ donation infrastructure in the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, has been in place now for five years.  Scotland is now considering moving to soft opt-out because the rates there have remained relatively static.  Wales is in the process of finalising its public consultation on the issue.  There is unanimity in Northern Ireland on this.  There is a reason for this.  After five years, the level has increased from an atrocious 13 to 14 donors per million to an acceptable 20 to 21 per million.  This has given us stability but nothing more.  After five years of flat out publicity to which a huge amount of resources was devoted - members will see in the documents circulated what has been devoted to this area - only 28% of people are on the organ donor register.  The rate of family refusal in Belgium hovers between 2% and 5%.  The rate of refusal in Spain is the same.  The reason there is not a strong living donor programme in Spain is they do not need it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800012#M02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Brolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366279500,"counter":915,"content":"<p>How is that verified?

I have worked with Mr. Nizam Mamode, head of transplant services at Guy's Hospital.  He has a very close working relationship with Dr. Rafael.  The document I have circulated was vetted by Mr. Mamode.  This is not my document.  While I put it together and my name is at the end of it, many other people contributed to it.<\/p><p>  In spite of the advances in England, while last year organ donation increased to approximately 20 per million of population there were 125 refusals by families, which equates to approximately 800 potentially life saving transplants of people on the organ donor register.  Within the constraints of the opt-in system the debate now beginning in England, with which we disagree because we believe that donation is a sacred and family gift because donation also affects the family of the deceased person, is on why a family should be allowed to override the consent of a person who signed up to the organ donor register.  We believe that is a dangerous route to go down because death is a communal thing in the end.  In an effort to move this on, the head of the organ donation task force in the UK has stated that she believes that family consent should be over-borne by a person's name being on the register.  The answer to the problem of family refusal is soft opt-out.  The reason for this is set out not only in the international research but in the British Medical Association's recent report, which is set out in the document circulated and which I will not bore members by reading.  <\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Regina Doherty's comments.  People with whom I usually discussed football are now raising this issue with me.  When the question becomes, \"Is there a reason we should not be organ donors?\" the cultural shift is affected.  As stated in the British Medical Association's report, organ donation then becomes the default position, which with public support changes cultural expectations in society and represents a more positive view of organ donation.  I do not believe there is any particular magic to that: it is just logic.  Appendix I, which was drafted by Dr. Paul Glover, who is the counterpart of Professor Jim Egan in the North, states that organ donation rates in the North have increased by 54% since the implementation of all of the changes.  However, attainment of the maximum donor potential has not been fully realised despite the creation of this infrastructure, which contains aspects of the Spanish model.  In a nutshell, this does not pose any threat: it is a good message.  People will be content once family consent is at the heart of what is proposed.<\/p><p>  On the issue raised earlier - I cannot recall which Member asked the question - about doctors asking questions, this does not arise where specialised nurses exist.  We have 14 specialised nurses in the North, who are embedded in the intensive care units.  Their first job is to ask the questions.  It is not the job of doctors to do so.  As Ms Cunningham will agree it would not be the job of someone like Dave Hickey, who at 2 a.m. is driving to Sligo hospital to help procure organs, to do so.  There are embedded people in the system whose job it is to spend time with the families and ask the questions in a sensitive way.  In those circumstances, the three-pronged approach of soft opt-out, proper infrastructure and good public awareness is the way to go, as is the case in the leading donor rate countries.  There is no reason we ought not to follow that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800013#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Brolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1366279500,"counter":917,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Finnegan like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013041800013#N00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1366279500,"counter":918,"content":"<p>I would like members to take the following away from today's meeting.

One sees that although it is not as consistent as we would like, over the past six years Ireland has been in the top ten in Europe with regard to the deceased donation process, although not for the living donation process, where we are lower.  We are not awful and we are far from it.  We can improve greatly and we have a willing population.

Transport Access for All, the Department's sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005, is the outcome of an extensive review process in which people with disabilities played a key role.  The 2012 edition of the plan which provides a roadmap for further advancement in public transport accessibility improvements has been largely shaped by the outcome of such a process.  However, advice received by the Department of Justice and Equality from the Office of the Attorney General indicates that, in compliance with section 31(6) of the Disability Act 2005, the 2012 edition of the Department's sectoral plan cannot take effect until a resolution on the plan has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  Today's discussion, the first of its kind, has been arranged for this reason.<\/p><p>  While the plan is a positive step, it is, by no means, a panacea for all of our public transport accessibility issues.  However, it represents an honest view of what is achievable.  Circumstances being different, we would have liked to achieve much more.  In recent years the number of accessible vehicles has increased significantly and access to much of the public transport infrastructure has improved.  For instance, the Dublin Bus fleet now comprises exclusively low floor, wheelchair accessible buses and a programme of bus stop upgrades is proceeding.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has met its objectives of having the Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford fleets entirely composed of low floor, wheelchair accessible buses.  <\/p><p>  On the issue of new or upgraded wheelchair accessible stops outside the greater Dublin area, the National Transport Authority is now managing this programme and provides funding directly to individual local authorities as resources allow on a case by case scenario.  While the existing Luas service is already accessible, developments in technology and best international practice are being monitored with a view to enhancing the system.  For example, the installation in 2011 of T-coil induction loops on all 64 trams which enhanced access for hearing impaired passengers was possibly a first in the world and the list goes on.<\/p><p>  Changes have occurred in the way transport services are delivered, as well as in the research and consultation necessary to provide the groundwork for further accessibility measures to be planned and progressed in the coming years.  Many targets have been achieved and significant progress has made towards the realisation of several others.  Notwithstanding this success, much remains to be done and work in this regard is ongoing, allowing for the significant economic challenges facing us.<\/p><p>  It is recognised worldwide that the provision of accessible, affordable and acceptable transport can make a significant difference to quality of life.  People can feel cut off from wider community life and experience serious difficulty in accessing basic services where access to transport is lacking.  This is particularly true in the case of older people and people with disabilities, although it also applies to many others.  One of the core principles of the sectoral plan is that through accessibility improvements to the public transport system for people with disabilities, access will be improved for everyone.  Inclusion, opportunity and participation in social, economic and cultural life should be available to everyone.  Design and planning for services and infrastructure should take this requirement into account from the beginning.  Social inclusion must never be viewed as an add-on to what we do but an integral component of our work.<\/p> <p>The plan was prepared following an extensive consultation process that included many meetings and discussions with transport providers, a wide range of groups in the disability sector and the public transport accessibility committee, PTAC.  The latter is the principal consultative forum on public transport accessibility in Ireland and it comprises representatives of older people, the main disability organisations, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, public and private transport operators, the National Disability Authority, the National Transport Authority, the Dublin Airport Authority, the Maritime Safety Directorate and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p> Approval and implementation of this plan will help to further address the public transport concerns of people with disabilities.  In addition, Transport Access for All will feed into the forthcoming national disability strategy implementation plan which is being developed under the auspices of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I understand the Minister of State's plan will provide for greater inter-linkages across Government Departments and their agencies.  I welcome this development.  The implementation plan will address the full needs of those Departments and allow for a whole-of-Government approach to be taken in respect of improving public service provision generally for people with disabilities.<\/p><p> The approval of Deputies and Senators for the 2012 edition of Transport Access for All is a key step in the process.  I fully support the plan, on which a great deal of work has been done.  In such circumstances, I ask members to endorse the plan because it will make a real difference going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041800002#A00300","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366290000,"counter":946,"content":"<p>I propose that we take all the members questions together because there are a number of people who are under pressure to get out of here as soon as possible.

We must have aims and goals and I am of the view that the plan is a good one.  Unfortunately, we do not always achieve the aims and goals that are set down.  There are a number of aspects of the plan which are extremely negative.  Dublin Bus has made significant strides forward and massive progress has been made in the area of transport in general.  I am concerned, however, with regard to wheelchair-accessible taxis.  One of the recommendations in the relevant review was that all taxis should be wheelchair accessible.  That is an ambition which probably will not be achieved in the near future.  Wheelchair-accessible taxis have a 15-year lifespan and many of them are approaching the end of this at present.  Such vehicles cost a large amount of money to replace.  If someone's vehicle ends up on the scrapheap after 15 years, he or she will be obliged to purchase a new wheelchair-accessible vehicle and that will cost him or her a fortune.  This is a matter to which the Minister of State will be obliged to give careful consideration because the need to replace vehicles will prove a real disincentive for people.  Should we not examine the possibility introducing an incentive - perhaps a write down of VAT, VRT or whatever - for those who will be obliged to change their vehicles?<\/p><p>  I also wish to refer to the cuts in the disability and mobility grants.  These cuts will have a very significant effect on those who live in rural areas in particular because they are obliged to travel long distances to reach various destinations.  Will the Minister of State comment on that matter?  Will he also outline his view on the position with regard to the motorised transport allowance?<\/p><p>  A large number of people are members of the public transport accessibility committee.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said in respect of some other bus operators.  I refer, in particular, to Aircoach, which is now owned by First Bus, the largest bus operator in the United Kingdom.  One of my constituents contacted Aircoach on behalf of a wheelchair user who wished to travel to Belfast.  The constituent in question was not able to obtain a guarantee that a wheelchair-accessible vehicle would be available and that advance notice would have to be given with regard to the time the person in the wheelchair proposed to travel.  Aircoach provides bus services between Dublin Airport and the city centre and I understand the same problem exists on these services.  Like Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and every other bus operator, this company is operating under licences provided by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport but it is not meeting its obligations in respect of providing wheelchair access.

During the debate on the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 in the Seanad, Senator Barrett referred to the legal position of existing taxi drivers as against that of those who are coming into the trade now.  He pointed out that existing drivers are not legally obliged to provide wheelchair access but that those entering the trade now are obliged to do so.  I am not sure whether that is the case but perhaps the Minister of State will indicate what is the current position for new entrants to the taxi industry.  Are these people legally obliged to provide wheelchair access?  If so, has the process in this regard been successful or has there been resistance to it?

Wheelchair-accessible vehicle, WAV, licences are available because the cars cost too much.  I am trying to create a solution in terms of the cars' specifications, which are too costly.  We must reach a happy medium and the cost must be reduced.  More than &euro;40,000 for a car is ridiculous.  Grants were available for a two-year period to people who wanted to begin providing these services.  Surprisingly, the take-up was low.<\/p><p>  There is an administrative issue.  The cars do not need to be new.  I am in discussions with the Department of Finance to determine whether a combination of reducing specifications and getting something in return for those who enter this industry is possible.  We are trying to get that pendulum swinging.<\/p><p>  There is a broader issue with the industry.  Often, I deal with a good group that is trying to get wheelchair taxis.  It monitors the situation with me.  A number of people who drive wheelchair accessible taxis do not provide that service.  This is unacceptable.  They are taking their golfing buddies out to the airport while someone needs a taxi.  This situation must be addressed.  I am putting in place a process to that effect because it should not be tolerated.  The instance of drivers who receive subsidies to enter the market yet who do not provide the service as intended must be prevented.<\/p><p>  We are also considering the creation of a centralised telephone number so that people with disabilities can access cars.  We will monitor it.  If operators refuse a certain number of journeys, we will inquire into why and examine their licences.  There must be respect for the car.  We will consider the issue with the Department of Finance.  We must ensure that operators do what they have their licences to do.<\/p><p>  Rural Ireland does not have enough of these licences.  With the National Transport Authority, NTA, which has jurisdiction in this regard, I am trying to create a process whereby more people can be brought into that space.  One has fewer options in rural Ireland.  I know this only too well, given that I live there.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kenny raised a good point.  Private operators are slightly different from public operators.  We are governed by European legislation.  As a result of being approached by the Deputy and others, I am making inquiries into why Aircoach and other private operators are not legally obliged to provide wheelchair access.  Under the rules, such services must be provided in cities and large urban areas in which buses operate internally.  Dublin Bus is a classic example.  This is the reason it has reached 100% accessibility.  Even though it could be argued that Aircoach buses travel from one end of Dublin to the airport, it and similar providers are not legally obliged to provide accessibility.  We have asked the NTA to examine this situation and I will report on its findings.<\/p><p>  Deputy Fleming raised the issue of WAVs in the context of the rural transport scheme, which has been a successful programme.  I have been working on it for many months and years.  I am supportive of it, but it needs to be brought into mainstream public transport.  Some of the best and most impressive people I have met as a Minister of State are involved in rural transport.  I have visited, met here or met at national events nearly every rural transport scheme in the country.  They should be a part of mainstream public transport because rural Ireland needs integration.  They must be placed on a sound footing and be brought into closer alignment with local authorities and the work of same.  There is no point in mini-buses going up and down roads in which local authorities have not invested.  The authorities should know the routes so that they might invest.<\/p><p>  There must also be greater integration with school transport and non-acute health-related transport.  It is crazy that school buses travel in and out of towns all over the country for nine months of the year and that there is no one on them for the return trips at 9 a.m. and 2.30 p.m.<\/p> <p>When I travelled on a school bus, the bus driver was allowed to stop and pick up people.  Obviously, there are various reasons that is no longer possible.  As far as I am concerned, school buses are public transport vehicles and they can act as such and provide a service where none exists.  It will not be a panacea but it is an example of what is required, namely, greater integration between all the services, which is not the case at present.<\/p><p> The rural transport groups provide much accessible transport as well.  For example, Clare Accessible Transport, which is part of the rural transport programme, RTP, does fantastic work.  That is just one example.  There is another example in Meath and there are many others.<\/p><p> Free travel was raised by one speaker.  That is a matter for the Department of Social Protection.  I accept the point in terms of coverage.  I also accept that certain points must be taken on board.  Broadly speaking, they are the areas covered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041800004#C00700","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1366291200,"counter":963,"content":"<p>What about school transport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041800005#D00200","speaker":"1019"},{"type":"speech","time":1366291200,"counter":964,"content":"<p>I apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041800005#D00300","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1366291200,"counter":965,"content":"<p>The Minister of State might also refer to the mobility allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041800005#D00400","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1366291200,"counter":966,"content":"<p>Could he also refer to disability grants and the motorised transport grant?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013041800005#D00500","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1366291200,"counter":967,"content":"<p>As the committee is aware, a report is being conducted by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on the mobility allowance.

The school transport scheme is operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann, which subcontracts many services.  Generally speaking, Bus &Eacute;ireann has knowledge of the requirements and takes them on board in the provision of a service or when contracting out a service.  It has to provide a range of services, for example, those requiring 45-seat buses or for a smaller capacity.
