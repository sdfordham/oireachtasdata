I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it today.  I am accompanied by Ms Jackie Harrington, who has policy responsibility for the humanitarian assistance scheme and who travelled from Sligo today, and by Ms Susan Kelleher, our area manager from Clare with responsibility for the community welfare service in Clare.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman, said this scheme is in place to provide supports to householders affected by the recent adverse weather events.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the lead Department for severe weather emergencies and the Office of Public Works has responsibility for capital flood relief activities.  However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as flooding.<\/p> <p>  The scheme, administered by the local community welfare service, CWS, is available to assist affected householders following severe flooding.  In 2012, the Department sought sanction from Government to activate this scheme in any future cases of flooding to facilitate an immediate response for householders following such devastating events.  The scheme, which is means-tested, is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by the severe weather and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and, in some instances, structural repair.<\/p> <p>  The income test for humanitarian assistance is significantly more generous than that which applies in the case of means-tested social welfare schemes generally.  The basic principle of the income test is that individuals and families with average levels of income will qualify for assistance.  For example, a family consisting of a couple and two children with a gross household income of &euro;70,000 or less will receive 100% of the amount allowable in respect of their application.  A reduced or tapered level of support can be provided in cases where such families have income more than &euro;70,000.  The income test determines the household&rsquo;s ability to meet the costs of restoring its home to a habitable condition.<\/p> <p>  The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to an individual household under this scheme.  Levels of payment depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs, ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted. <\/p> <p>  The Department immediately activated its humanitarian assistance scheme in response to the flooding in early December 2015.  The scale and extent of the flooding experienced in recent weeks is unprecedented and has impacted right across the country.  The Department has attended the daily meetings of the national co-ordination group to contribute to the co-ordinated interagency response which is being provided across the country.  I assure the committee that the necessary community welfare service staff are in place and are engaging with local authorities and emergency personnel to ensure supports are provided to those affected as swiftly as possible.  Department staff are proactive in assessing and meeting the demand for assistance through the establishment of emergency clinics and home visits.  The Department has opened emergency clinics in towns such as Ballinasloe, Crossmolina, Athlone, Gort and Carrick-on-Suir and in a number of towns in Kilkenny.<\/p><p>Staff are on standby to open emergency clinics in other towns if the need arises.<\/p><p> The humanitarian assistance scheme is demand-led and emergency payments have already been made to 270 households, with expenditure of more than &euro;235,000 to date.  These are mainly payments covering essential items, including clothing, food, toiletries, meals for families relocated to emergency accommodation and fuel.  To date, most support has been provided in Galway, Cork and County Mayo.  However, support has also been provided to affected households in other counties, including Tipperary, Westmeath, Clare, Kerry, Kilkenny, Waterford, Wicklow, Sligo and Roscommon.  A breakdown by county of the payments made to date has been circulated to the committee for information purposes.<\/p><p> In dealing with emergency events of this nature, the Department generally adopts a three-stage approach.  Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments in the immediate aftermath of the event to cover needs such as food, clothing, toiletries and fuel.  Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items after the flood water abates and the houses have dried out.  Stage 3 is to identify what longer-term financial supports or works are required.  These can include plastering, dry lining, relaying of floors, electrical rewiring and painting.  Throughout this process, the staff engage with the local authorities and other agencies to ensure supports are provided to persons affected as swiftly as possible.  It is expected that the number of claims and the costs in respect of the current flooding will increase in the coming weeks as we move into making stage 2 and stage 3 payments, which, as already stated, cover the replacement of furniture and white goods and longer-term financial supports.  Householders seeking assistance under the scheme are being advised to contact their local Department of Social Protection office, which will be able to offer assistance.  Contact telephone numbers are also available on the Department's website.  All the local authorities and emergency personnel have all the key local contact details.<\/p><p> Assistance is not provided under this scheme for losses covered by insurance, commercial or business losses or, generally, any loss or damage to private rented accommodation or local authority accommodation.  As the committee will be aware, there is a separate emergency scheme for small businesses and community, voluntary and sporting bodies affected by the recent flooding operated on behalf of Government by the Irish Red Cross.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has put assistance measures in place for the farming community as well in respect of animal welfare and fodder aid.  In the case of farms, support can be provided under the Department of Social Protection scheme towards the family home.<\/p><p> I assure the committee that the Department is providing reassurance to householders that financial support is available and is continuing to engage with the local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other emergency personnel to ensure that all available supports are provided to households affected by the recent flooding.  I hope this has been of assistance and we are happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016011300002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Faughnan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1452690000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>If members agree, I will take questions from Deputy O'Dea first because he will be obliged to leave for Question Time in the D&aacute;il.

At the minute there is no cap on the scheme which is demand-led.  We are in a position to provide for needs as they arise.  As it is means-tested, we are not compensating fully in all instances.  We are trying to repair houses to bring them back to a habitable condition; therefore, there is a balance to be struck.  Each individual case is assessed on its own needs.  Some people might have been able to move some of their white goods to a place of safety, while others could not do so.  Floors were destroyed, etc.  The staff are meeting and sitting down with individual households to discuss what their needs are.  People moving to stage 2 will generally be getting estimates of the cost of repairs to allow them to move back in.  We are, therefore, still at the early stages.  We are providing for fuel costs to help to dry out houses and providing for the hire of dehumidifiers in some areas.  We are also assisting the local authorities.  Where pumps have been provided for a lot of private houses, we are working in tandem with the local authorities in providing fuel to keep going on a regular basis.  While I am quite happy to say there is no cap, we are conscious, in terms of ensuring value for money, of the general cost of replacing various items.  We will be replacing to a good quality, durable level.  We will not be at the top end of the expensive market if we have to replace a kitchen, furniture or things like that, but we provide good quality, durable replacements.<br\/><br\/>In the case of people who are self employed, we are examining that issue.  If, for example, a self-employed person cannot go to work because he or she is manning the pumps etc. and cannot meet a bill or has other issues, absolutely he or she should come and talk to us.  We will see how we can assist the people concerned.  It may not be replacement of earnings <i>per se<\/i>, but if a person is in difficulty and unable to meet particular needs because of loss of earnings - it could be the case that he or she has difficulty in making a mortgage payment or whatever else - we will look at his or her various needs.  The scheme is designed to be flexible.<br\/><br\/>Like the Deputy, I pay tribute to community welfare service staff around the country.  They take the welfare aspect of their role particularly seriously.  They are looking at what is in the best interests of each householder to try to meet his or her needs which are far ranging.  A lot of people are under extreme stress and suffering anguish because of what has happened to them.  It is a question of dealing with the practical day-to-day pieces, for example, for families that have had to move out and are living in bed and breakfast accommodation.  Parents are trying to provide food, etc. for their family; we are, therefore, covering the cost of meals not covered in bed and breakfast accommodation.  It can even come down to other items.  Ms Kelleher was telling me about a family in County Clare that had two dogs but nowhere to put them.  In that case we are providing for kennel hire, which has removed one little worry from a family in meeting their needs.<br\/><br\/>In respect of the Red Cross scheme, I understand it covers the cost of returning a business premises to its pre-flood condition and includes the replacement of flooring, fixtures, fittings and damaged stock.<\/p><p>That is fairly comprehensive with regard to the need the Red Cross is trying to meet.  For the information of the joint committee, yesterday we also circulated data from the Red Cross on the payments it has made to date, but that process is ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016011300002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Faughnan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1452690000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Faughnan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016011300002#O00200","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1452690000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute at this time, as I must attend a Commencement debate in the Seanad.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance and pay tribute to the Department of Social Protection for being so proactive in this regard and for getting the scheme off the ground quickly.  Moreover, the information leaflet issued by the Department before Christmas containing contact numbers was helpful.<\/p> <p>  I sympathise with those affected by this flooding.  It is disastrous and soul destroying for a person when his or her house is destroyed.  In fairness, communities, neighbours and businesses have rowed in to help, and everyone thinks there is a great sense of community in the affected areas where people are helping.  That said, I have a few questions on the Department's presentation.  I find it hard that Ms Faughnan stated anyone \"with a gross household income of &euro;70,000 or less will receive 100% of the amount allowable in respect of their application\" but yet the Department cannot tell members what is the amount allowable.  Moreover, as Ms Faughnan has indicated that no cap will be applied, how does one know what constitutes 100% if the Department has not set an amount for such an application?  The witnesses are suggesting one will get 100% on a discretionary basis but 100% of what?  I find this to be contradictory.  If someone applies for humanitarian aid, I assume there will not be an inspection of the house because that would take time and so on.  How will a person provide proof?  Must he or she get something signed by the council or whoever to the effect he or she has been flooded?  How will the Department investigate that side of this issue?  Ms Faughnan also stated that people in rented accommodation would not get help in this regard.  What about people living in rented accommodation who have had their goods destroyed?  Many people furnish their own rented accommodation.  Will they be helped?<\/p> <p>  Although assistance to farmers may not be under the Department's remit, Ms Faughnan referred to it.  I welcome such assistance because I know of farmers whose fodder was destroyed.  However, no one in any Department or anywhere else has ever mentioned fishermen, who have been off the seas since November because of storms and so on.  They have lost pots and many other items and, being self-employed, have no income and are not receiving assistance.  I acknowledge this may not be under the remit of the Department of Social Protection, but at the same time, Ms Faughnan brought up the subject of farmers and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Perhaps she might be able to provide me with some answers in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016011300002#O00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1452690000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

They do a tremendous job.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions in regard to the scheme in general.  It is hard to explain to anybody how one feels when one's home has been flooded.  To walk into a person's home and see his or her belongings and prized possessions, including photographs, etc., destroyed is a terrible experience.  My constituency office was flooded between Christmas and the new year.  I spent a couple of hours on new year's eve sweeping human faeces from my office floor.  The odour that lingers in a property after it has been flooded is awful.  To have one's home devastated in that way is awful, as I know only too well because the properties of my neighbours in Clonakilty were flooded in 2012.  The fire brigade evacuated my wife and children from our house at 2.30 a.m. but it turned out not to be necessary as our house was not flooded.  Unfortunately, as I said, all of our neighbours' houses were flooded.  I called to those houses to see the damage done and the smell of them will remain with me forever.  <\/p> <p>  To call a scheme a humanitarian assistance scheme and then subject applicants for that assistance to a means-test goes against the grain.  That people whose lives and homes have been devastated will not, if earning more than &euro;70,000, be eligible for assistance under this scheme is cruel and wrong.  That provision must be reviewed.  The aim of a humanitarian scheme is to assist people whose homes have been destroyed and who cannot access insurance.  That people earning more than &euro;70,000 cannot receive assistance is cruel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016011300002#P00500","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speech","time":1452690000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Their disposable income would be a lot less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016011300002#P00600","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1452690000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Yes.  I know that a tiered arrangement applies.  As politicians, we pick up perceptions.  My perception of this scheme is that it does not do what was intended and that the spirit of the scheme is not being delivered to the people most in need who were affected by the recent flooding, as also happened in the aftermath of the flooding in 2012.  The reason so little of the money has been spent to date is because so few people have been able to access it.  That is a fault of the scheme rather than those administering it.  The criteria around the scheme are too strict.  There is also too much bureaucracy involved.  For example, the owners of a bed and breakfast facility, which is also their home, are precluded from applying for assistance because the property is, in part, a business.<\/p><p>There are many grey areas.  Of all the Departments that exercise discretion the Department of Social Protection is the top and I am aware that community welfare officers frequently exercise discretion.<\/p><p> I live in Clonakilty, which is a flood-prone area.

I have a negative interpretation which is why I requested today's meeting and I thank the Chair for accommodating that.<\/p><p> Has the scheme been reviewed since its inception in 2012?  What has been learned from that and what recommendations have come from it, if that is the case?  If not, I would like to see it being reviewed overall.

I put on record our gratitude to the public servants who have gone above and beyond the call of duty, not just those from the Department of Social Protection, but also those from the Department of Defence and the various emergency services.  The country has experienced fair devastation in the past month.  I am thankful that my colleague raised the issue of the fishermen, as I had not considered how they must have suffered.<\/p> <p>  A county councillor brought to my attention an issue that is analogous to some of the other stuff that has been said - the cost of running pumps.  He adverted to a person who had six pumps running.  The person is self-employed and will not qualify under the means test.  I agree with Deputy Jim Daly that there should be no means test where that sort of devastation is concerned.  Family lives are destroyed.  That is not an issue for the officials from the Department of Social Protection but more an issue for what goes on here in Leinster House.<\/p> <p>  The cost of keeping pumps running 24 hours a day and seven days a week during a crisis such as this is considerable.  We are penalising those who save their homes purely because they would not qualify under a means test and because they have gone the extra mile to keep the pumps running to keep their houses dry.  Entire families have, literally, had to abandon their jobs to keep the house dry.  There are simple things such as covering the cost of running the pump and compensating them in some way for lost income.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate what the officials have said.  Like Deputy Daly, I know the community welfare officers go out of their way to try to assist people in every way they can.  However, sometimes the officials' hands are tied.  Is there some methodology that the officials wish us to push forward on their behalf in order to give them some more flexibility in dealing particularly with those who will not qualify under the means test and whose only cost was the additional fuel they had to buy in order to keep pumps going?<\/p> <p>  I am horrified at the means testing.  I have seen the devastation of flooded houses and it is pretty frightening.  I am glad there is something there for landlords.  I would not be a great favourite of the capitalists of this world, but my concern is for those living in rented accommodation.  However, I am mindful of the \"sale agreed\" sign in the middle of a lake in the midlands, which indicates that the land has planning permission for 98 apartments.  There will be a lot of that sort of stuff around the place.<\/p> <p>  Is there something we need to do that will give the officials more flexibility?

When the humanitarian scheme was announced and being administered, even staff in the Department were proactive in some areas and knocked on doors to assess whether affected householders qualified for the scheme.<\/p> <p>  I share the concerns of Deputy Daly and others in regard to the cap and the gross household income qualifying limits.  I accept the allocation is on a reduced scale based on that, but in the broad scheme of things, over the past number of years the income of a couple in a double income household has been hit for everything.  These people pay for everything and qualify for very little.  They do not qualify for medical assistance and often do not even qualify for university grants for their children or anything else.  Deputy Daly has outlined the horror associated with any emergency or disaster, such as a flood, that befalls them.  Although the scheme allows for an income limit of &euro;70,000, the community welfare officers are good at using their discretion in terms of what is appropriate.  I believe greater discretionary powers would be appropriate.

Therefore, I disagree that &euro;70,000 is a middle income.  Perhaps it is an average income in a double income household, because the average industrial wage is approximately &euro;34,000.  However, it is important to remember that the majority of people and households are not on incomes of &euro;70,000.

If it is an emergency and the Senator needs to keep pumps going but does not have the disposable income available to him to do so, we will meet the costs involved.  We have met such costs throughout the country in various instances, particularly of practical items such as dehumidifiers, but each case is decided on its merits.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Jim Daly spoke about bureaucracy.  Under the scheme, we require basic information.  We need to verify who the person is and that he or she is living at household X that has been flooded but with the information we are receiving from the local authorities and the local knowledge of community welfare service staff, that is a straightforward matter.  If it is a family home, we are replacing elements related to it.  If it is a separate unit providing bed and breakfast accommodation, it may be a business, etc.  If members of the committee are concerned about particular cases, I ask them to bring them to our attention in order that we can examine each of them.<\/p> <p>  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell should know that the sum of &euro;235,000 is for the initial 270 households.  We have not received complaints to date.  On the feedback we are getting from members of the public, they are very pleased with the reassurance being provided by the staff.  As Deputy Noel Harrington said, the staff are proactive and calling to families.  We have set up emergency clinics.  Some people are not yet in a position to know what they need, but our staff are calling back to check in with them to see how they are doing.  We have quite a number of years of experience of dealing with the effects of flooding and our staff, particularly Ms Susan Kelleher, experienced the flooding in 2009.  Many families were referred to counsellors via the Health Service Executive because of the trauma of watching their home that could have been in the family for generations being destroyed.  We are working with the HSE and the authorities to try to meet people's needs as they arise.  In 2014, for example, &euro;1.2 million was provided under the scheme for 480 households and the payments differed, depending on need.  In terms of the division of that sum, it works out at about &euro;2,500, on average, but it could have been &euro;10,000 for one family or &euro;20,000 for another, depending on what had been destroyed and their capacity to meet their needs.<\/p><p>I want to get the message across that the &euro;70,000 is not a cap.  The members of the committee should please ask anyone they come across in their work as public representatives to apply and come to talk to us and not to assume they will not receive benefits.  Our supplementary welfare allowance scheme is there to assist people as their needs arise, including somebody who is self-employed and has not been in a position to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016011300002#T01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Faughnan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1452690000,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I got that wrong because on page 2 of the submission Ms Faughnan states: &ldquo;A reduced level of support can be provided in cases where such families have income over &euro;70,000.&rdquo;  Maybe Ms Faughnan said something else earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016011300002#U00200","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1452690000,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Ms Faughnan said &ldquo;tapered&rdquo;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016011300002#U00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1452690000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I used the word \"tapered\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016011300002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Faughnan"},{"type":"speech","time":1452690000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I cannot find the word \"tapered\", which I associate with something other than what Ms Faughnan is talking about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016011300002#U00500","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1452690000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Ms Faughnan said it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2016011300002#U00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1452690000,"counter":104,"content":"<p>It states:<\/p><blockquote>For example, a family consisting of a couple and two children with a gross household income of &euro;70,000 or less will receive 100% of the amount allowable in respect of their application.
