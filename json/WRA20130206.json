I am also aware that the previous Government was of the view that Travellers are not an ethnic minority. Dialogue between staff of my Department and representatives of Traveller organisations has taken place in the past on the issue, for example, during the course of a seminar on the third State report under the Council of Europe Convention on National Minorities.   In addition, the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee, on which sit representatives of all the national Traveller organisations as well as officials of the Department of Justice and Equality, in 2012 established a sub-group specifically to consider the issue of Traveller ethnicity.

The budgetary resources in the Fianna F&aacute;il National Recovery Plan were unacceptable and would have put the Garda Commissioner in an impossible position. Fortunately, I was able to secure additional funding for the three-year period 2012 to 2014 to ensure that sufficient money was available to the Commissioner to allow the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to continue to deliver an effective policing service.<\/p><p>  Specifically, I secured Euro 2.243 billion for the Justice Sector for 2012 which was Euro 118 more than had been allocated by Fianna F&aacute;il.  For 2013, I secured funding of Euro 2.2 billion which was Euro 191 million more than the Fianna F&aacute;il allocation.  For 2014, I secured Euro 2.065 billion, which was Euro 105 million more than the original Fianna F&aacute;il allocation.  Overall, had I not obtained this additional finance, the Garda&iacute; would have stood to lose an average of Euro 90 million each year under the Fianna F&aacute;il plan over the years 2012 to 2014.<\/p><p>  In 2013 the Garda financial allocation, which in gross terms amounts to over Euro 1.4 billion, is a substantial amount and I can assure the Deputy, and the House, that this allocation will be spent in the most effective way with the emphasis on the delivery of front-line services.  In that general context, a budget of Euro 5 million has been made available in 2013 for the purchase of additional Garda vehicles and, indeed, the modernisation of the Garda fleet is a crucial part of supporting policing operations throughout the State.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a programme of consolidating the Garda station network is currently under way.  This programme, which has been undertaken on the basis of recommendations made by the Garda Commissioner, yielded the freeing-up of over 160 Garda members in 2012 for operational policing duties.  Moreover, the Garda authorities have indicated that the consolidation measures for 2013 will result in an extra 61,000 Garda patrol hours.<\/p><p>  The overall objective of the consolidation process is to ensure effective policing.  Furthermore, it has been supplemented by the new Garda roster system which ensures that resources are optimally deployed when and where they are required, to every part of the community, both rural and urban.  In addition, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has available to it a class-leading computer system and a state of the art digital radio system.<\/p><p>  With regard to the fight against crime, the most recent crime statistics published by the Central Statistics Office show a welcome reduction in 12 of the 14 crime groups for which figures are given, compared with the previous 12 months.  The figures reflect how the Garda&iacute; are making an impact on crime and the Commissioner has indicated that the Force will maintain its focus on criminal activities.  In response to the rise in burglaries, Operation Fiacla has been set up by the Commissioner.  The operation has been very successful and up to the end of December 2012 it has resulted in 3,538 arrests and 1,924 charges.<\/p><p>  I am determined, as Minister for Justice and Equality, that the resources of our Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be used in the best, most effective and efficient way possible.

In accordance with this principle, the role of the Oireachtas has been to specify in law a maximum penalty and a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are, of course, a small number of situations where statute has created exceptions to this approach most notably by providing for mandatory sentences for murder and presumptive minimum sentences in the case of certain firearms and drug trafficking offences.  Except for exceptional circumstances, I am of the view that the Oireachtas should be cautious in prescribing mandatory sentences.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient.  The Law Reform Commission is currently examining the law in relation to mandatory sentences and I understand this work will be completed this year.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy may be aware that the Law Reform Commission, after detailed study some years ago, recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines but favoured non-statutory sentencing principles.  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  Information on over 1,000 cases is detailed on the website and the Committee recently announced that it is shortly to recommence populating the online database with information on sentencing in the criminal courts.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy may be aware that the ISIS committee also announced they are planning to recommence providing information on sentencing in relation to specific issues in which context an analysis has been published on rape sentencing prepared by the Judicial Researchers Office under the guidance of Mr. Justice Peter Charleton.  I understand that seminars are also planned, including one focusing on the work of the Sentencing Council in the UK.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, in September 2012, I announced a strategic review of penal policy. I have established a working group to carry out this review which will examine all aspects of penal policy and I expect the Group to report later this year.  <b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600102#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Accommodation","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600102#WRA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[5651\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600102#WRA03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason there are only nine detoxification beds in a 4500 bed prison system in view of the fact that 80% of persons there suffer from some form of drug problem and need services to help them detox and rehabilitate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1018","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service provides a comprehensive range of drug treatment services tiered to meet the needs of the prison population.  The nine beds referred to by the Deputy are allocated specifically for the therapeutic Drug Treatment Programme (DTP) based in the Medical Unit, Mountjoy Prison. This programme is 8 weeks in duration and the model used is a collaborative one using prison based staff and the community\/ voluntary sector.  Its aim is to assist prisoners in achieving a drug free status.  At present, any person entering prison giving a history of opioid use and testing positive is offered a medically assisted symptomatic detoxification if clinically indicated.  Patients can, as part of the assessment process, discuss with healthcare staff other treatment options.<\/p><p>  Drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.  Prisoners who on committal are engaged in an opioid substitution programme in the community will have their substitution treatment continued while in custody. Methadone substitution treatment is available in 9 of the 14 prisons (accommodating over 80% of the prison population).  Drug Treatment Pharmacist services are available in Mountjoy, D&oacute;chas, Midlands and Portlaoise Prisons. Pharmacists are responsible for all aspects of drug treatment (mainly methadone) dispensing, administration, recording, ordering, storage etc in those prisons, thus ensuring that drug treatment is provided on an equivalent basis to that available in the community while meeting all legal and professional requirements in those particular prisons. <\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive provides consultant led in-reach addiction services to Cloverhill and Wheatfield Prisons.  Merchants Quay Ireland provides a national addiction counselling service for prisoners with drug and alcohol problems in prisons and places of detention where prisoners require such a service (with the exception of Arbour Hill Prison).  Drug Free Units currently operate in Mountjoy Prison, Wheatfield Prison, Cloverhill Prison and St. Patrick's Institution. As part of the Irish Prison Service Strategic Plan 2012- 2014 Drug Free Units will be established in all closed prisons. Mountjoy Prison currently has two addiction nurses assigned. A clinical addiction team comprising the Primary Care Addiction Specialist GP, Addiction Nurses, Chief Nurse Officers, Merchants Quay Ireland personnel and Addiction Pharmacists provide a comprehensive overview of addiction services, which has resulted in a more streamlined service, better assessment and through-care outcomes.<\/p><p>  In line with Action 43 of the National Drug Strategy, the Irish Prison Service ensures the seamless transition of prisoners established on drug treatment into community drug treatment settings as agreed in the protocol developed with the Health Service Executive.  If the prisoner is on a community programme prior to committal to prison, the maintenance programme is continued during the prison term. Prior to a patient being commenced on methadone maintenance in prison, a drug treatment place in the community must be secured to ensure continuation of treatment upon release.<\/p><p>  The Irish Prison Service has conducted a review of its existing Drug Treatment programmes and proposals have been developed to reorient and extend the treatment options. Recent trends across prisons indicate a significant number of prisoners currently self-detoxing from methadone and a marked reduction in the average dose of methadone.  The proposals which have been adopted by the Irish Prison Service and are currently being rolled out on a phased basis include;<\/p><p>-  The establishment of a therapeutic Detoxification and Rehabilitation Treatment Programme (DRTP) with the allocation of 10 additional places from March 2013.  The DRTP will also operate in the Medical Unit and will be in addition to the existing DTP  which has 9 places;<\/p><p>- Circa 50 beds in the Medical Unit, Mountjoy Prison will be used exclusively for Drug Treatment Programmes including:<\/p><p>- The Drug Treatment Programme (DTP) &ndash; 8 week duration;<\/p><p>- Dextoxification &amp; Rehabilitation Treatment Programme (DRTP) &ndash; 6 week duration,<\/p><p>- Slow Detoxification Programme &ndash; maximum duration 6 months, <\/p><p>- Stabilisation Programme &ndash; maximum duration 6 months'.<\/p><p>- The Training Unit and Shelton Abbey are being designated as suitable for prisoners on methadone maintenance treatment. Loughan House will be designated as a facility for the treatment of prisoners seeking to return to a drug free lifestyle. <\/p><p>  The proposals set out above will provide an increased number of options for prisoners who demonstrate a commitment to addressing their substance misuse. Progression from these Programmes will include access to Drug Free Units, open prisons and ultimately the Community Return Scheme, subject to normal operational considerations. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will note that the Irish Prison Service is adding to the range of programmes, support services and through-care options for prisoners demonstrating a commitment to addressing their substance misuse. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600102#WRA03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Agreements","counter":51,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600102#WRA03550"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[57224\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600102#WRA03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the follow up action he has taken in the wake of his call for extension of British-Irish common travel area to assist tourism; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":53,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that in March last year the Government decided to extend for a four year period the Irish Short-stay Visa Waiver Programme to the end of October, 2016.  The programme, which was devised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department, was originally scheduled to run on a pilot basis until last October.  The Programme allows tourists or business people from certain countries who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  There has been a very positive response from tourism agencies and operators to this initiative.  Figures from the Central Statistics Office indicate that the number of visits to Ireland from the countries included in the programme increased by 21% in the twelve months following its introduction.  This is a significant increase and a very positive indicator of the success of the Programme.<\/p><p>  INIS is continuing to work closely with their UK counterparts towards the implementation of a common visa for short stay visitors.  It is anticipated that such a visa will prove an attractive option for tourists and business visitors, particularly in the context of the island of Ireland by facilitating visitors to travel freely between Northern Ireland and Ireland without the need for a separate Irish or UK visa. <\/p><p>  One of the prerequisites to its introduction is the requirement that all visa applicants supply fingerprint (biometrics) data electronically which is currently an essential element of applying for a UK visa.  Obviously Ireland does not have the capacity to capture such data for all visa applications worldwide; currently for UK visas this is done in over 150 countries.   Work is ongoing, through the regular Common Travel Area Forum meetings between INIS and the UK Home Office, on an agreed approach to this and other aspects prior to its introduction. <\/p><p>  The project demonstrates the mutual benefits of working in close cooperation with the UK immigration authorities and of adopting a practical approach which will both enhance the preservation of the integrity of the CTA as well as harnessing the potential to deliver economic and tourism benefits for both countries.

In the circumstances the Deputies will appreciate that the specific financial information they have sought is not readily available and I understand that the provision of such information would involve a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources which are required for other purposes.<\/p><p>  However, I have also been advised by  the Garda authorities that the average financial saving estimated to arise in respect of the closure of the stations designated for closure in the Garda Policing Plan for 2013 is Euro 4,000 per station.  To a large extent this estimate relates to heating and lighting costs and it does not take account of specific repair bills, which will vary from premises to premises.<\/p><p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the closure of the stations has been proposed by the Garda Commissioner in his Policing Plan for 2013 and I would stress that the key objective involved is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than to secure modest cash savings.  In this context the Commissioner has concluded in relation to certain stations that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if the stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In making his recommendations on the closure of Garda stations, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  In addition, the Commissioner has given a commitment that where a station is to be closed local Garda management will consult with local communities on the alternative policing arrangements to be put in place in their area.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, the Garda Commissioner has indicated he is confident that the implementation of the restructuring proposals contained in the 2013 Policing Plan will not lead to any diminution in the service provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In that regard he has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs. This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600102#WRA05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":73,"content":"<p>Question No. 28 answered with Question No. 8.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Equipment","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600102#WRA05150"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[5658\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600102#WRA05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on whether there are enough intoxilyser machines in Garda stations here to implement road safety legislation on the testing of drivers involved in a serious collision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety (MBRS), which is under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, has statutory responsibility for the testing, approval and supply of evidential testing machines and roadside breath testing screening devices to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently 64 evidential breath testing (intoxilyser) machines allocated by the MBRS to Garda stations nationwide.

In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following the consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.<\/p><p>  The person concerned would then appear to have left the State, on a date unknown, and travelled to the United Kingdom (UK). Given that he had no permission to remain in the UK, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 16(1)(c) of the Dublin II Regulations, a formal request was received from the UK's immigration authorities, on 23rd December, 2010, to 'take back' the person concerned. Ireland agreed to the 'take back' request on the basis that Ireland was the Member State responsible for examining the asylum claim by the person concerned. The person concerned was returned to Ireland on 3rd March, 2011 and was returned to the stage of the asylum\/immigration process where he had been before he departed for the UK.<\/p><p>  Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 30th December, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.<\/p><p>  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome. In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.<\/p><p>  The Deputy might also wish to note that the person concerned contacted the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in early April, 2011 indicating that he wished to return voluntarily to his country of origin. In response to that request, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service advised the person concerned of the voluntary return options open to him. Specifically, he was advised to contact the Dublin Office of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and while he did so, there were practical reasons as to why the voluntary return arrangement could not be concluded at that time. The person concerned again contacted the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service on 15th June, 2012 indicating that he wished to return voluntarily to his country of origin, but he later withdrew that request. As a result, his case will now be determined in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 and, if necessary, the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), in the order set out above.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that as the asylum claim of the person concerned has already been determined and refused, there is no basis under which he can now be granted refugee status.

As the Deputy will be aware, the criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served.  It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.<\/p><p>  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions.  There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.<\/p><p>  Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses.  The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.<\/p><p>  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.<\/p><p>  I believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.  Accordingly, my Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  My intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  I am also taking the opportunity to introduce some general improvements to bail law to improve the overall working of the bail system.  I will bring proposals to Government on the matter as soon as possible, having regard to other legislative priorities.<\/p><p>  In relation to the statistics requested by the Deputy regarding the number of offences committed by persons while remanded on bail, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide relevant statistics directly to the Deputy.<\/p><p>  Regarding the number of persons recorded as having absconded while on bail, I have requested the Courts Service to supply information on the number of bench warrants issued where a person on bail fails to attend court.  I will contact the Deputy again when the information is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600103#WRB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":130,"content":"<p>Question No. 50 answered with Question No. 8.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600103#WRB03050"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[6015\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600103#WRB03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he is satisfied with the operation of the Gosafe system; his plans to expand same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1084","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[6016\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600103#WRB03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if his attention has been drawn to any problems in relation to the manner in which data is collected by the Gosafe system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":134,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 62 together.<\/p><p>  I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the outsourced safety camera network commenced operations in November, 2010.  The objective of the network is to reduce the number of speed related collisions and so save lives, as excessive or inappropriate speeding is a major factor in road traffic collisions and fatalities.<\/p><p>  A targeted approach to speed enforcement is being undertaken in order to significantly reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injuries and improve road safety.  To this end, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with the National Roads Authority, completed an extensive analysis of the collision history on the road network.  Sections of road have been identified where a significant proportion of collisions occurred whereby speed was deemed the primary contributory factor.<\/p><p>  Based on this analysis, a list of speed enforcement zones has been developed with the aim of providing information to motorists in order to raise awareness of speeding in these zones.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilises these zones in order to direct speed enforcement activity, in a proportionate and targeted manner.<\/p><p>  I am also advised that safety cameras only operate on sections of road which have a history of collisions occurring where speed was a contributory factor.  The locations of these speed enforcement zones are in the public domain and are available on the Garda website www.garda.ie.<\/p><p>  These speed enforcement zones are continually reviewed in light of survey data, collision history and local feedback to ensure that enforcement activity is properly targeted.  Surveys continue to be conducted to ensure the appropriate deployment of safety cameras on roads which have been identified as subject of inappropriate speed and where fatal and serious injury collisions continue to occur.<\/p><p>  I am assured by the Garda authorities that, in accordance with the contract with Go Safe, the service provider is responsible for ensuring that all equipment used in connection with the service is installed, calibrated and maintained in accordance with approved standards.

As part of these plans, it is intended to expand the Inspector of Prison's role which I believe will greatly enhance his independent oversight of the prison system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600104#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Status Applications","counter":145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600104#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[5665\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600104#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will grant refugee status in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>The person concerned applied for asylum on 14th August, 2007.  In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following the consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.<\/p><p>  The person concerned would then appear to have left the State, on a date unknown, and travelled to the United Kingdom (UK). Given that he had no permission to remain in the UK, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 16(1)(c) of the Dublin II Regulations, a formal request was received from the UK's immigration authorities, on 23rd December, 2010, to 'take back' the person concerned. Ireland agreed to the 'take back' request on the basis that Ireland was the Member State responsible for examining the asylum claim by the person concerned. The person concerned was returned to Ireland on 3rd March, 2011 and was returned to the stage of the asylum\/immigration process where he had been before he departed for the UK.<\/p><p>  Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 30th December, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006. <\/p><p>  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome. In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.<\/p><p>  The Deputy might also wish to note that the person concerned contacted the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in early April, 2011 indicating that he wished to return voluntarily to his country of origin. In response to that request, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service advised the person concerned of the voluntary return options open to him. Specifically, he was advised to contact the Dublin Office of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and while he did so, there were practical reasons as to why the voluntary return arrangement could not be concluded at that time. The person concerned again contacted the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service on 15th June, 2012 indicating that he wished to return voluntarily to his country of origin, but he later withdrew that request. As a result, his case will now be determined in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 and, if necessary, the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), in the order set out above.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that as the asylum claim of the person concerned has already been determined and refused, there is no basis under which he can now be granted refugee status. However, his ultimate position in the State remains to be determined so he should await the outcome of his application for Subsidiary Protection.<\/p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600104#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600104#WRC00550"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[6008\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600104#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to introduce legislation on corporate manslaughter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":150,"content":"<p>A Government decision has approved, in principle, the preparation of a general scheme of a Criminal Justice (Corporate Manslaughter) Bill.

Although a bilateral meeting had been scheduled, the Prime Minister of Belgium was detained in Brussels by urgent business.   The focus of my discussions with Prime Ministers Ayrault and Katainen was primarily on the priority issues currently being addressed during the Irish Presidency of the European Union.  The meetings offered the opportunity for me to update both Prime Ministers on Ireland&rsquo;s domestic situation, in particular in relation to the EU-IMF Programme and bank debt.<\/p><p>  In the context of issues which are to the fore of our efforts as Presidency, we concentrated in both meetings on progress on Banking Union, and in particular in that context on advancing agreement with the European Parliament on the Single Supervisory Mechanism. It was agreed in each discussion that this was a very important first step in meeting the mandate of the European Council on Banking Union. We also had an opportunity to have an exchange of views on the next steps including on Bank Resolution and Deposit Guarantees. This discussion was in the context of bringing stability to the Eurozone through early delivery of the political commitments made by Heads of State and Government.<\/p><p>  On the MFF, the importance of the work underway amongst Member States and in discussions with the institutions was also a focal point in these bilateral exchanges.  Both Prime Ministers Ayrault and Katainen agreed that it would be extremely important to find a basis on which the European Council could agree at its forthcoming meeting and I briefed them on the informal consultations already underway with the European Parliament.<\/p><p>  On the matter of jobs and growth, we discussed the potential for progress on a series of single market measures, including the digital single market, public procurement and professional qualifications. The issue of youth unemployment was emphasised as a key priority for the EU as a whole and in that context it was agreed that special effort should be made to reach agreement on the Youth Guarantee. The important contribution which trade agreements with key strategic partners can make to the growth agenda received our full attention and in both meetings the prospects for agreement on a mandate on EU-US Trade, and completion of the EU-Canada agreement were discussed.<\/p><p>  Finally, I was happy to inform the Prime Ministers of Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing achievements in fulfilling the terms of 8 Troika Reviews of our EU-IMF Programme, which incorporate more than 190 actions, fully signed up to and fully delivered. Both Prime Ministers were generous in their praise of Ireland&rsquo;s delivery on its Programme and welcomed the update in terms of the positive news in terms of our exports and growth prospects. However, I underlined a major concern which remains in terms of the unacceptably high level of unemployment in Ireland, particularly amongst young people. Both Prime Ministers expressed political support for Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing negotiation with the ECB in an effort to resolve the issue of the Promissory Notes.

Tax Settlements made in accordance with Section 1086 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA), 1997 are published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il on a quarterly basis. That section provides for the publication of cases where a qualifying disclosure is not made, where the total settlement consists of tax, interest and penalties and is over &euro;33,000 and where the penalty element exceeds 15% of the tax. Publication takes place in the quarter following the quarter in which the settlement is finalised. Until the passing of the Finance Act 2011 on 6 February 2011, settlements reached with Revenue could not be published unless the settlement was either paid in full or was the subject of an agreed phased payment arrangement.  That Act brought in changes to the publication rules and extended the publication requirement to tax defaulters who either failed to agree a settlement or who failed to pay all or part of a settlement.  The change was designed to ensure that the public is aware of the identity of all relevant Tax Defaulters whether on not they have agreed a settlement with the Commissioners or made the relevant payments.<\/p><p>Accordingly the Commissioners now publish Tax Settlement details where payment in full has not been made and this new requirement first applied to the List of Tax Defaulters published in respect of Quarter 2 of 2011.

However, the Revenue Commissioners advise in relation to the years 2009 and 2010, since by law they were in a position to publish only amounts for those years where full payment was secured or an instalment arrangement was in place, they are satisfied that the vast bulk of the tax, interest and penalties that formed part of the published Tax Settlement was paid.   The Commissioners further advise that due to the Finance Act 2011 changes, they are in a position to provide the Deputy with some details of amounts unpaid from Quarter 2 of 2011 to Quarter 3 of 2012 as follows:<\/p><p>For 2011 &ndash; For Quarters 2,3 and 4, the total amount publishable was &euro;60.16m.  Of this, the total amount paid or subject to agreed phased payment arrangements was &euro;47.60m.  A further &euro;6.38m was referred for Collection Enforcement Proceedings.  The balance of &euro;6.18m was uncollected on the grounds of the taxpayer&rsquo;s inability to pay.<\/p><p>For 2012 &ndash; For Quarters 1,2 and 3, the total amount publishable was &euro;70.75m.

The balance of &euro;14.50m was uncollected on the grounds of the taxpayer&rsquo;s inability to pay.  To put these figures in context, the Commissioners advise me that the total yield from Revenue&rsquo;s Audit programme in the same period was &euro;275.45m. of which &euro;32.59m was referred for Collection Enforcement and &euro;15.26m was uncollected on the grounds of the taxpayers inability to pay.<\/p><p>Before the Commissioners accept that there is a substantive inability to pay a tax settlement, the taxpayer is subject to rigorous procedures, including the submission and examination of a formal Statement of Affairs. I am further advised that in considering enforcement options or write off of liabilities, the Commissioners have a clear focus on ensuring that that the tax and associated liabilities arising from an audit will be enforced as vigorously as properly declared liabilities which remain unpaid.<\/p><p>Finally, I am satisfied that the publication procedures contained in Section 1086 represent a significant power for the Revenue Commissioners, but a balanced one which is important in the Commissioners' efforts to optimise the level of tax compliance in the State.  In addition, the change introduced in the 2011 Finance Act now ensures that the public is aware of the identity of all significant Tax Defaulters audited by Revenue whether they have paid an agreed settlement with the Commissioners or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600104#WRC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Debt Restructuring","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600104#WRC02950"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[6165\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600104#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary question No. 77 of 30 January 2013, if a borrower who held a loan with an institution that was a party to the mortgage arrears resolution process may potentially have a lower level of protection in the event of finding themselves in mortgage difficulties should their loan be sold to an institution that is not subject to the MARP process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>Firstly, I must confirm to the Deputy that I have no statutory role in relation to the sale of mortgage books by regulated financial institutions.

The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of the Code under Part 111C of the Central Bank Act 1942. The Code provides a number of protections to borrowers. These include the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) to deal with mortgage customers who are in arrears or in pre-arrears, the establishment of a dedicated Appeals Support Unit and a separate internal appeals process by lenders to deal with individuals on a case by case basis.

Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits are not generally required to be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners by the administrators of pension schemes and personal pension arrangements. The estimated savings indicated at the time in respect the Budget and Finance Act 2011 change in the SFT were quite conservative, based as they were, on incomplete data and using very broad assumptions.

It is worth noting that one of key arguments for introducing a rebate for the haulage industry is the fact that a large quantity of fuel purchased by this industry is purchased abroad thus generating no tax revenue for the State.

The supplier, in effect, provides the full infrastructure required for all day-to-day office printing.  Research carried out by the National Procurement Service (NPS) has indicated that such an approach gives best value to the Irish public sector.<\/p><p>  The majority of public sector bodies currently have ad-hoc print arrangements in place.  A typical Government office has multiple print and imaging devices including photocopiers, scanners and faxes.  These devices can potentially come from a wide range of different suppliers with separate supply and servicing arrangements.   The ratio of print devices to staff is often in the region of 1:2 and in some cases as low as 1:1 where a large number of staff have their own desktop printer.  <\/p><p>  The MPS Framework Agreement offers all public sector bodies in the State access to a print solution that is strategic, cost efficient and that can be tailored to the specific needs of the individual organisation. Following an open competition, advertised on e-tenders and in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), the Framework Agreement for MPS was established on 8 February 2012. The Framework Agreement will be in place for two years, with an option to extend for a further two years.  The minimum turnover requirement for entry into the Framework was an average of &euro;10 million per annum for the three most recent years of audited accounts or where the date of establishment is more recent for each year the entity has been established.<\/p><p>  The value of the Framework Agreement over two years was estimated to be &euro;100 million. Taking into account the value of the Framework and the fact that suppliers are required to provide all of the print devices upfront, from their own resources, the view was taken by the NPS that the &euro;10 million minimum turnover requirement was proportionate.  Tenderers who did not have the required turnover in their own right were invited to partner with other entities to satisfy this requirement.  All of the Framework Members have operations in Ireland and provide local employment.   Four of the successful tenderers are indigenous small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (MJ Flood, Bryan S Ryan, Hibernian Business Equipment and Ergo). One of the tenderers did not have the required turnover in their own right to qualify for the Framework and formed an alliance with a large manufacturer to satisfy the turnover requirement.  Furthermore, the Framework Members have indicated in their tender submissions that they will use a further 11 indigenous SMEs in the delivery of MPS. <\/p><p>  Circular 6\/12 specifies that the MPS Framework is mandatory from 1 September 2012.  However, it is important to note that this Framework is only mandatory where a public sector body opts for an MPS solution.  If a public sector body simply wishes to purchase a printer or a photocopier they do not have to use the MPS Framework. It is a matter for each public sector body to determine which route offers the best value for their organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600106#WRE00300","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":259,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600106#WRE00350"},{"type":"question","counter":260,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[6238\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600106#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the constitutional and legal changes required to make changes to the pension arrangements for retired politicians and civil\/public servants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":261,"content":"<p>I am advised that as a pension is generally taken to be deferred income it is therefore covered by the constitutional protections that apply to property.

The national arrangements put in place by the National Procurement Service (NPS) are designed to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money. The majority of the aggregated arrangements are not new and have been available to the public service for a number of years. In utilising the national contracts, public bodies are able to take advantage of the NPS&rsquo;s buying power and as a result can purchase supplies at competitive prices. This facilitates ongoing service delivery within tighter operating budgets.<\/p><p>  In relation to the potential impact of aggregated procurement arrangements, it is worth noting that such arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money and also facilitates SME access. While certain categories of goods and services may be suited to single supplier arrangements (e.g. electricity and gas), it should not be taken that single supplier frameworks are to be accepted as the norm. The greater use where appropriate of multi-supplier frameworks &ndash; for example the supply of managed print services - can address local supplier issues while also ensuring ongoing cost competitiveness of the framework itself. In order to facilitate SMEs, the NPS has encouraged tenderers who did not have the capability in their own right of providing goods and services nationally to partner with other entities to satisfy this requirement. Such multi-supplier frameworks can also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions. <\/p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS over the past 3 years has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  In 2012 the NPS, working with InterTradeIreland, for the first time brought together a number of the lead Government agencies to create a programme of major events for the Island of Ireland. Attendees could avail of educational seminars on a variety of topics ranging from the technicalities of public service procurement to procedures around consortia-building for SMEs.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide.  Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600106#WRE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600106#WRE00950"},{"type":"question","counter":269,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[6270\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600106#WRE01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if there are any retired public sector workers from his Department, or any other part of the public sector, currently on his Department's payroll, for example, for sitting on a committee or preparing a report, but not exclusively these two areas; the number on the payroll; the cost to his Department; the services being delivered for this money; and the way that the positions were originally advertised.","asker":"1034","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":270,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question the Public Appointments Service (PAS), in the course of running recruitment competitions for the public service, avails, inter alia, of trained and experienced retired public servants as interviewers, assessors and as decisions arbitrators.

payment practices and monitors the operation of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997, and the Late Payment in Commercial Transactions Regulations 2002.  The European Communities (Late Payment in Commerial Transations) Regulations 2002 (SI No. 388 of 2002) repealed section 10 of the Prompt Payments of Accounts Act 1997.  The rate of late payment interest is now payable under Regulation 4 of this legislation.<\/p><p>The current penalty interest rate is the European Central Bank main refinancing rate plus 7 percentage points. The ECB rates in force on 1 January and 1 July apply for the following six months in each year. Only one rate will apply to a late payment - that is the rate in force on the payment date.  From the 1st January, 2013, the late payment interest rate is 7.75% per annum (that is based on the ECB rate of 0.75% plus the margin of 7%). That rate equates to a daily rate of 0.021%. Penalty interest due for late payments should be calculated on a daily basis.<\/p><p>As stated above, the issue of late payment is covered by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 388 of 2002).  Ireland must transpose the Recast of the Late Payment Directive (2011\/7\/EU) which repeals and modernises the old rules.  I signed the Statutory Instrument transposing Directive 2011\/7\/EU on 22 December 2012 and this will come into effect on 16 March 2013.<\/p><p>Details of Late Payment interest paid by my Department and the Agencies under its remit are listed below.  My   Department does not have responsibility for collecting information on late payment interest paid by other Departments and the statutory bodies under their remit.  The Deputy should contact the Government Departments directly in this regard.  As the Deputy is aware, it is a Government requirement that all central Government Departments, the local authorities and all other public sector bodies, (excluding commercial Semi-State bodies) pay their suppliers within 15 calendar days of receipt of a valid invoice. The latest set of quarterly composite figures published by my Department show that 98% of payments made by Government Departments, valued at &euro;1.25bn, were paid to suppliers within 15 days.<\/p><p>All Government Departments and Agencies are required to publish information in relation to the payment of late payment interest in their annual report.<\/p><p>Note*1   In the time available since this Question was tabled my Department has not been able to collect the extensive volume of information requested by the Deputy in respect of the 35 City and County Enterprise Boards.

The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of SEAI appointed Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage and via an area based approach.  Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation and are free of charge to the customer.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Better Energy Warmer Homes programme is an important element of the Affordable Energy Strategy that was launched in November 2011.  The energy efficiency measures are targeted at low income families and will make a lasting impact on households experiencing energy poverty.  Exchequer funding of over &#8364;101 million has been allocated to the programme since 2000, which has successfully delivered energy efficiency measures to 92,563 homes.  In 2012 the programme delivered energy saving measures to 12,175 homes.  Despite the current economic challenges, the Government is committed to continuing to deliver energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households.  The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of &#8364;20 million for 2013, and according to the most up to date analysis available to date, it is anticipated that the scheme will deliver upgrades to approximately 12,000 homes this year.<\/p><p><br \/>  The SEAI currently has 7,700 applications on hand which predate the application referred to by the Deputy.

The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI who are responsible for operational policing co-operation have repeatedly emphasised that the close and high quality co-operation between their forces has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives. Notably, the two police forces operate a joint Cross Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.  All of these are important elements in enabling the two forces to work more effectively together in tackling crime and promoting community safety for all communities on this island.<\/p><p>  The Cross Border Policing Strategy includes sections dealing with Operations, Cross-border Investigations, Intelligence-sharing and Security, Information and Communications Technology, Training, Human Resources, and Emergency Planning and both Forces are jointly engaged in developing initiatives in these areas.  I would point out also that the Strategy recognises the value of interagency co-operation in certain areas.  The two Police Services work closely with the Customs Services North and South and with other relevant law enforcement agencies in combatting cross-border organised crime and have had a number of significant successes in disrupting fuel smuggling and tobacco fraud activities.  There is also proactive co-operation with the Irish and British immigration services in managing the Common Travel Area on the island of Ireland. The Cross Border Policing Strategy is a positive and dynamic step in further enhancing and developing joint efforts between the police services on this island to address the common policing challenges which crime presents and, thereby, to underpin efforts to improve community safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600108#WRG03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations Refurbishment","counter":419,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600108#WRG03250"},{"type":"question","counter":420,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[6111\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600108#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps he will take ensure that a Garda Station (details supplied) in County Westmeath is immediately refurbished and appropriate maintenance afforded to it, such as painting and decorating; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":421,"content":"<p>The programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation around the country is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.

The Deputy will also be aware that judges are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.<\/p><p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Service is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are under ongoing review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum.<\/p><p>  Waiting times in the Circuit and District Courts vary from venue to venue based on the number and complexity of cases.  The Presidents of the various courts are determined to achieve improvements in waiting times and they are working with the Courts Service to target judicial resources at the areas with longest waiting times. It should be noted, for example, that in 2011 there were 674 weeks of Circuit Court sittings in venues outside Dublin. This increased to 767 weeks in 2012 and the President of the Circuit Court plans to increase capacity to 888 weeks during 2013, a 30% increase over 2011. The additional weeks will be provided across crime, family law and civil matters.  Arrangements are underway to appoint a small new cadre of specialist judges of the Circuit Court to deal with the new work arising as a result of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. The President of the District Court is also concentrating judicial resources in the areas of greatest need and is currently considering the allocation of additional judicial resources to the hearing of Family Law cases to address delays in this area.<\/p><p>  The President of the High Court keeps waiting times under continuous review and has introduced a number of initiatives such as reorganising sittings of the High Court outside Dublin and arranging for additional court sittings during court recesses to reduce waiting times. In addition, the delegation to court officials of administrative functions previously dealt with by High Court judges has increased judicial availability for trial work. These initiatives continue to be reviewed and expanded. While the waiting time for asylum pre-leave applications is high, the allocation of more judges and, particularly, more research support for judges has helped to reduce the waiting time for post-leave applications to its lowest level in over two years. The Courts Service has also advised that despite significant pressure the waiting times in the High Court lists have generally reduced considerably.<\/p><p>  The Supreme Court, however, continues to experience lengthy waiting times of up to 40 months at present.

In counteracting these groups and their activities An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na undertake a range of targeted activities designed to disrupt and dismantle their activities. In doing so, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na co-operate seamlessly with their counterparts in Northern Ireland. The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland have repeatedly emphasised to me that the close, high quality co-operation between their forces has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives. The two police forces operate a joint Cross Border Policing Strategy that includes initiatives on intelligence-sharing and security to enhance co-ordinated efforts to combat the threat from such groups.<\/p><p>  At the broader international level, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na actively contribute to international law enforcement efforts in tackling serious cross border criminality through, for example,  initiatives co-ordinated by Europol and Interpol.

Details in respect of each category are as follows:<\/p><p><b><i>Civil Legal Aid<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  State funding of &#8364;32.9 million was allocated to the Legal Aid Board in 2012 and this level of funding has been maintained for this year. This covers funding for civil legal aid and advice, including legal services for asylum seekers, and also funding for the provision of the Family Mediation Service, for which the Board assumed responsibility in late 2011. There has been a significant increase in demand for civil legal aid services in recent years, with a much greater number of people financially eligible as a result of the economic downturn.  Unfortunately, the deterioration in public finances in recent years has meant that it has not been possible to allocate further resources to the Board to meet the increased demand.  As a result, the waiting times to access services have lengthened somewhat.<\/p><p><br \/>  In view of the substantial demand for civil legal aid and the associated waiting times, the Legal Aid Board is focusing on maximising the effectiveness of the resources available to it to deliver a meaningful service. Amongst the measures taken recently to this end are initiatives to increase the use of mediation to resolve family disputes, which leads to reduced legal costs, and the introduction of a 'triage' service to ensure that clients receive initial legal advice within one month of making an application for legal services. The Board is also striving to make its law centre network as effective and efficient as possible and the recent introduction of a new legal case management system will help in this regard. I should also point out that the Board introduced new conditions for retaining barristers in August 2012 which will result in lower fees paid to barristers in cases where they are instructed by Legal Aid Board solicitors.<\/p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  There are no waiting lists associated with the granting or processing of criminal legal aid.  As the Deputy may be aware, under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the judiciary are responsible for the granting of criminal legal aid.  The nature of the Scheme is that it is demand-led, driven by the incidence of crime, detection rates and prosecutions of cases through the courts systems. This makes it difficult to anticipate and control costs. A number of measures have been taken however since I took office including a reduction of 10% in the fees payable.  A reduction of 50% was also applied to payments in respect of adjourned sentence hearings and travel and subsistence.  Following these and other measures introduced in the course of 2011, a 10% reduction in total expenditure was recorded in 2012 compared with 2011 which is the first substantial reduction ever recorded under this Scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, the Working Group on Efficiencies in the Circuit and District Courts has been pursuing initiatives which can contribute to achieving efficiencies and cost reductions in the system such as, for example, introducing a pilot programme centralising custody cases in four court Districts and the introduction of the pre-trial procedure for criminal trials in the Dublin, Midland and South Eastern Circuits.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, a new Legal Aid Bill is planned to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  I hope it will be possible to publish the Bill during the course of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600109#WRH02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Costs","counter":466,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600109#WRH02650"},{"type":"question","counter":467,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[6230\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600109#WRH02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which legal costs incurred by the State in respect of cases brought before the courts on constitutional grounds; the extent to which the complainants and\/or plaintiffs contributed towards the costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":468,"content":"<p>I have no responsibility to the D&aacute;il for legal costs incurred by the State in respect of cases brought before the Courts on constitutional grounds.

This was in response to budgetary and service issues in relation to Galway and the movement of services between Roscommon and Portiuncula hospital in line with the principles of the smaller hospitals framework, that service should be delivered as close to a person&rsquo;s home as possible. This is commensurate with the need to ensure quality and safety in service delivery such that more complex work generally needs to be carried out in larger hospitals. The Group consists of University College Hospital, Galway, Merlin Park Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and Roscommon Hospital.  The Group was established on a co-operative, administrative basis as significant legislative work is required to allow hospitals to form Hospital Trusts.  <\/p><p>  In June 2012 I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. A Project Team was tasked with developing criteria to assist my Department in the development of policy in relation to the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, current management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions.  The Team carried out a comprehensive consultation process with all acute hospitals and other health service agencies as well as reviewing a significant number of written submissions. The experiences of both the Galway\/Roscommon University Hospital Group and of the Mid-Western Hospital Group, which were related to the project team as part of that consultation process, were both useful and informative.<\/p><p>  Work is nearing completion on the draft report on the wider issue of hospital groups.  Prof. John Higgins will submit that report to me in early February; I will then bring it to Cabinet for decision. The Government will then decide on the initial make up of hospital groups which will be established on an administrative basis pending the legislation required to set up hospital trusts by 2015. Before those trusts are established the composition and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed. As such I cannot comment at this time on the final composition of the new Hospital Groups.<\/p><p>  The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients. Under the Programme for Government 2011-2016, the Government committed to developing a universal, single-tier health service, which guarantees access to medical care based on need, not income.  On foot of this commitment the Government will introduce a system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI).  The development of independent not-for-profit hospital trusts is a key stepping stone to this new system.<\/p><p>  Each Hospital Group will have a single consolidated management team with responsibility for performance and outcomes.  It is intended that non-executive Boards, consisting of persons with expertise in key competencies such as clinical\/business\/legal\/medical academic\/patient advocacy, will oversee each Hospital Group management team and will have responsibility for decisions in relation to services in all hospitals in the Group.  The Galway\/Roscommon University Hospital Group has gone some way towards realising the governance arrangement which will be recommended by the Report with the appointment of Mr. Noel Daly as chairperson of the Board in May 2012.  Mr. Daly is former Chief Executive of An Bord Altranais and he has also served in senior management posts in the health services in Ireland and in the UK.<\/p><p>  On 29th January 2013 the HSE established an interim Board on an administrative non-statutory basis, pending the establishment of Hospital Trusts to manage public hospitals in line with the Government's programme for reform of the health service. The competencies of the individuals appointed are the key to better management of hospitals and it was on this basis that the interim Board appointments were made. No meeting of the Board has yet taken place. The interim Board will be replaced in due course by a Trust Board on a statutory basis and may be dissolved and reconstituted at any time to facilitate the development of Hospital Trusts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600112#WRL01500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":629,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600112#WRL01550"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[6219\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600112#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the epilepsy monitoring units in Cork and Dublin; if they will be opened as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1104","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":631,"content":"<p>Cork and Beaumont are two of six regional centres which have been identified for the provision of specialist epilepsy services under the HSE's National Clinical Care Programme for Epilepsy.

There were a number of meetings between the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner, representatives from my Department, the HSE, and the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street which resulted in agreement that NSCs older than 10 years would be destroyed. Retention of NSCs for ten years was deemed appropriate for the purposes of checking an initial diagnosis.<\/p><p>  I requested the HSE to conduct a review of this decision. This review examined both the legal and ethical basis for the retention of NSCs and the potential use of the existing cards for research purposes. The Review Group report and recommendations were submitted to me in January 2012. Having carefully considered the issue, I accepted the recommendation of the review group that in order to meet our legal and ethical obligations, particularly in relation to the Data Protection Acts, NSCs older than ten years will be destroyed. The review group also explored how the material could be made available to the research community in a way which was compatible with our ethical and legal obligations.<\/p><p>   However, I recognise the potential value of the material for research purposes. As deputies are aware, the HSE has begun an information campaign offering members of the public the opportunity to have their NSC returned to them prior to any destruction of the cards taking place. This will ensure that anyone who wishes to donate their or their child's Newborn Screening Card to research will be afforded the opportunity to do so. The HSE is actively engaging with the research community to facilitate the direct transfer of cards where this may be more convenient for parents. To this end, the HSE has contacted a number of research organisations to inform them of this position and has invited these organisations to provide a plan setting out a governance system for the storage and future use of the card or cards for clinical or research purposes, prior to any agreed transfer.  I consider that the people to whom the NSCs relate, or their parents if they are under 18 years of age, are the people who should choose what happens to their cards.

As such, health service management must tightly control the extent to which agency staff are used, particularly to substitute for staff who have left the health service, given the requirement to reduce employment levels to a net 98,955 wholetime equivalents by the end of 2013.<\/p><p>  The HSE's National Service Plan 2013 notes that considerable savings have to be achieved from changes to the manner in which staff are deployed, with tight control of the use of higher-cost staffing arrangements and in particular the use of agency staffing and overtime. The Plan includes a target saving of &euro;10m set against the recruitment of graduate nurses to directly offset spend on agency and overtime. It also recognises the need for systematic reviews of rosters and a focused approach to addressing staff absenteeism and implementing revised new sick leave arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600112#WRL03100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":653,"content":"<p>Question No. 228 answered with Question No. 215.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600112#WRL03250"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[6301\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013020600112#WRL03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide in detail and tabular form the number of cases for the Lucan area, County Dublin, which incorporates all of Lucan, Adamstown, Strawberry Beds and Foxdene, that St James' Hospital, Dublin, has provided a service for in the past ten years up until December 2012 which involved home care, end of life care, who died at home and separately who died under their care in St James' Hospital;
