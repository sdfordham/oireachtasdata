Special national legislative measures were introduced in November 2012 under the Destructive Insects and Pest Acts 1958 and 1991 to regulate the import of ash seed, plants and wood.  Similar legislation was introduced in tandem by Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.<\/p><p>  Following confirmation of a finding of the disease in Ireland in October 2012 (on plants imported from continental Europe), a major winter survey of Ash plantations was undertaken, focusing on trees planted between 2008<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font> and 2012.  Following this survey further findings of the disease have been confirmed.  The survey has now been broadened to an ongoing growing season survey of ash planted over a much wider period.  In addition to the plantation survey, my officials are also surveying hedgerows, nurseries, roadside, landscape and farm plantings. <\/p><p>  There have been a total of 96 confirmed findings located throughout the country.  Of these, 11 were confirmed since July of this year.  3 of these most recent confirmations were in forestry plantations, 1 was in a horticultural nursery, 1 was located on a farm and the remaining 6 were in roadside plantings.  <\/p><p>  In terms of controlling the disease, arrangements have been put in place to remove all ash trees from the 39 forest sites where the disease has been confirmed and from the associated sites where trees from the same infected batches have also been planted.  Eradication is also being carried out under Departmental supervision at the 57 non-forest locations (i.e. roadsides, horticultural nurseries, garden centres, AEOS\/REPS farms and private gardens). <\/p><p>  In addition to the 39 forest plantations that to date have tested positive there are 161 additional associated forest sites that were planted with ash from the same batches of trees, a total therefore of 200 sites that require clearance.  Forest Service has worked with the forestry contractors, the IFA and the landowners to ensure as smooth a process as possible.  <\/p><p>  Finally, in March of this year the Department launched a reconstitution scheme to help forest owners participating in afforestation schemes who have been<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font> affected by Ash dieback.  A grant of up to a maximum of &euro;1,500 per ha is available to cover the cost of clearing the site.  Additional funding is also available to cover the cost of replanting with an alternative species.  So far 169 applications have been received for support under this scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400054#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equine Passports","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400054#WRB00525"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[39541\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400054#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he has taken to date to deal with the identification of horses; the progress made to date on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>The identification and registration of equidae is governed by EU Council Directives 90\/426\/EEC and 90\/427\/EEC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 504\/2008 of 6 June 2008.

It also provides that all equine animals registered from 1 July 2009 must be identified with a passport and a microchip.<\/p><p>  The EU legislation has been transposed into national legislation via S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended).  Amendments to this legislation strengthened the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of a passport issuing body, prosecutions, offences on forgery or tampering with a passport.  Moreover provision was made for the withdrawal of a passport in the event of doubts on the reliability of a passport and issue of a new passport.  My Department is currently in the process of drafting a new comprehensive Statutory Instrument to provide for further enhancement of the powers of the Minister. <\/p><p>  A central equine database has been established on the Animal Identification and Movement [AIM] system which already contained data on cattle, sheep and pigs.  The central equine database is now used to supplement the checks carried out by Department staff in slaughter plants, in particular to check that horses presented for slaughter are correctly identified and eligible for the food chain.  Aside from the usual veterinary checks, the passport of an animal presented for slaughter is examined to ensure eligibility for the food chain, absence of evidence of tampering and that the markings recorded on the passport match the animal.    <\/p><p>  Furthermore in association with the introduction of a requirement for registration of horse premises, the database is interrogated to check whether a horse presented for slaughter has originated in registered premises while keepers from outside the State are accommodated through the use of a generic herd number.

I will move to the final stage in the establishment of a single Passport Issuing Agency once EU legislation provides me with the required legal basis.  In the meantime, the EU Commission has published proposals for a new regulation designed to enhance the controls on passports.

Of this total number, 72 are on hand for more than 3 months, 22 for more than 6 months, 18 for more than 9 months, 16 for more than 12 months and 75 for more than 15 months.  There are a number of reasons for the time taken to process applications and I will set out the major ones.<\/p><p>  Once an applicant receives approval from my Department to plant forestry he or she may proceed to establish the forestry plantation to the Forest Service standards.  Upon completion of the establishment the person may submit an application for payment of the establishment grant and the associated premiums.  In order to receive payment promptly an applicant or his forester, on his behalf, must submit all the required documentation including the Form 2 signed by both the applicant and his forester, maps, provenance certificates, evidence of ownership, tax clearance certificates, if required, mandate for payment of the grant directly to the forester if required, farmer proof if appropriate and any other relevant documentation.  <\/p><p>  Most applications for payment of grants and premiums following establishment of a forestry plantation are processed and finalised very quickly.  However, delays can occur when incomplete documentation is submitted by the applicant.  For instance, a Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC) will be required if the payment exceeds &euro;10,000.  In many cases this is not submitted with the application for payment and this can result in significant delays while a TCC is sought by the applicant from the Revenue Commissioners. <\/p><p>  Likewise ownership documents, clearly showing the applicant as the owner of the property the subject of the plantation, are often missing from applications.  An application for payment can therefore be delayed for a number of months whilst the ownership evidence is sought.  Other documentation such as provenance certificates for the plants used may also be absent.  Some of the delays in processing payment applications to finality relate to the applicant claiming farmer status to receive farmer rate premium but are not able to produce documentation to prove it. <\/p><p>  Following the completion of the planting, the new forestry plantation may be subject to an inspection by a Forest Service Inspector.  From a silvicultural aspect there can be a delay in making the final decision on payment when it appears to the Forestry Inspector that the plantation is not up to Forest Service standards.  In those cases the applicant is notified of the work required to bring the plantation up to the required standard.  Payment in these cases will be delayed until the appropriate remedial work is carried out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400054#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licences Applications","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400054#WRB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[39517\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400054#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a decision will be made on an application by Bord Iascaigh Mhara for a licence for a fish farm in Galway Bay; the progress made to date in evaluating this application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>An application by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) for an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of finfish near Inis Oirr in Galway Bay was received by my Department last year.

Operations in a total of four plants were suspended (in some cases on a voluntary basis) for varying periods arising from the investigation.  My Department is actively considering the possibility of instituting legal proceedings where appropriate, as indicated in the report.  It is important to note in that context that while some of the failures referred to in the report risked reputational damage to the Irish food sector, they did not breach EU or national law. Information in relation to activities by traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain outside of the jurisdiction has been passed to Europol and other Member States to facilitate continuing investigations in other countries. <\/p><p>  Other actions taken in relation to this issue at both national and EU level include a programme of DNA testing of beef products and testing of horse meat for the presence of phenylbutazone. Meat traders and agents will be required to register as food business operators.  Controls relating to horse identification are being strengthened and my Department has taken responsibility for the supervision of all horse abattoirs in Ireland. <\/p><p>  It was because of the vigilance of Ireland&rsquo;s testing and control regime that this pan European problem was exposed.  Exposure of this malpractice will result in improved consumer protection across the EU.  In that regard, the EU Commission is pursuing an action plan over the remainder of 2013 and into 2014 which includes specific actions and measures on the following basic elements: fighting food fraud, testing programmes, horse passports, official controls and origin labelling.  It is important that controls in this area are strengthened on a pan European basis, not just at national level, and some of the measures envisaged will require legislative change at EU level.<\/p><p>  With regard specifically to horse identification, my Department implements official controls in relation to horse identification at marts and other sales venues, in abattoirs and at points of entry to the country.  All equines are required to be identified in accordance with EU and national legislation.  Equines issued with a passport after 1 July 2009 must have a corresponding microchip implanted by a veterinarian, which is recorded in the passport and creates a link between the passport and the animal.  The passport includes information on any veterinary medicines administered to equines.  An equine for slaughter for human consumption must be accompanied to the slaughterhouse by its passport and the information on the passport determines whether the animal can be slaughtered for human consumption.  Horses treated with certain veterinary medicines such as phenylbutazone, known in the industry as &lsquo;bute&rsquo;, are permanently excluded from the human food chain in order to protect public health. <\/p><p>  The Department has established a centralised equine database, which will be used at abattoirs to assist in verifying the authenticity of horse passports for the animal presented and to record its date of slaughter.  Detailed procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs have been communicated, together with details of the identity checks required, both to Departmental staff and the business operators.  Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400054#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400054#WRB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[39525\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400054#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payments will commence under the 2013 disadvantaged area scheme; the number of estimated payments that will be paid in the first week of payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>Payments under the 2013 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme will begin issuing, on target, tomorrow, 25 September.

It should be appreciated, however, that many applicants, who declare land situated in a Disadvantaged Area are not eligible for payment under the Scheme.  Many of these applicants do not maintain any animals and those that do maintain animals do not keep sufficient livestock to meet the minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per hectare. This is a normal feature of the Disadvantaged Area Scheme.  For example, in excess of 5,000 applicants under the 2012 DAS Scheme were found to be non-compliant, as they had insufficient stocking density on their holdings.  The figure for 2013 is almost 10,000, in addition to which, there are in excess of 6,000 applicants who held no stock during 2013.  I should emphasise, however, that many of those currently showing as having insufficient stock will ultimately satisfy the requirement &ndash; the minimum retention period being seven consecutive months; there will be a steady flow of cases each month where compliance with this retention period will be confirmed, thereby allowing payments to issue. <\/p><p>  In addition, in excess of 15,000 applications have been identified with area-related issues; these are being addressed and resolved though direct correspondence with the individual applicants, in line with normal procedures.

As I have indicated previously, while it is generally accepted that this is a very complex matter and requires a very detailed action plan to cover the various issues, I intend in the near future to set out proposals on how these matters will be progressed.  My firm intention is that the process will be fully inclusive and that all stakeholders, particularly farmers and their representatives, will be central to the process.  It is only by adopting this approach that the desired result can be achieved.<\/p><p>  With regard to the specific recommendations of the Committee contained in their Report, I can confirm that these will be included among the range of issues to be addressed in the process that will shortly be commenced by my Department - it very clear that matters to be resolved are very wide ranging and complex; it is self-evident that the process required to adequately address these must be fully inclusive and focused.  To this end, I am determined, as indicated, to convene a broad group of all relevant stakeholders, charged with comprehensively addressing the range of issues.  <\/p><p>  Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the West Coast.  They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of bio-diversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns e.g. tourism.  However, there is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under Direct Aid and Agri-Environment Schemes and leads to risk of financial corrections being imposed by EU Commission.  It is vital, therefore, to maintain the commonages in GAEC (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition), or where there is under-grazing, to return the habitat to GAEC.<\/p><p>  Following the successful completion of the negotiations on CAP reform under the Irish Presidency on 26 June 2013, I launched a consultation process with all relevant stakeholders to ascertain their views on the most appropriate application of the Direct Payment Regulation.  The final date for submissions on the Consultative Paper is 20th September.  The agreement provides that where there is marginal land the applicant or applicants must graze that land if he or she is to satisfy the eligibility criteria to be deemed an active farmer for the purposes of benefiting from payment under the Direct Payment Scheme.  As most of the commonage land declared in Ireland can only be maintained by grazing, this matter will also have to be dealt with in the context of maintaining commonages in Ireland.    <\/p><p>  Taking all of these matters into account, it is my stated aim is to ensure that a practical solution is reached, which will ensure that the current farmers actively farming these lands are protected; that the land is maintained or returned to GAEC and that the requirements of the governing EU Regulations are met.  In my view, this can best be achieved by working with the farmers directly managing the lands, relevant State Agencies, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.  I have no doubt that work undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture will greatly assist in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400054#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Milk Supply","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400054#WRB02550"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[39520\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400054#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he has had any discussions with his Northern counterpart Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill in relation to ensuring the security of supply of liquid milk in the island of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>The National Milk Agency, which operates under the aegis of my Department, was set up in 1994 to ensure an indigenous year round supply of milk for liquid consumption.

Fairness of course informed my approach to perhaps the most high-profile issue in the negotiations, namely, the redistribution of direct payments within Member States.  It also underpinned my approach to the negotiations on the rural development regulation, which I believe will contribute in a significant way to the socio-economic development of rural areas over the coming decade and ensured a balanced overall outcome to the reform process.<\/p><p>  The distribution of direct payments within Member States was the single most important issue for Ireland in the CAP reform negotiations.  I agreed very strongly with the argument that it was no longer justifiable to pay farmers on the basis of out-of-date historic entitlements. However, I also felt that it was not justifiable to transfer very large amounts of money over a relatively short period of time from our most productive farmers, as had been proposed by the Commission.  I therefore pressed for an alternative model, which adopted a more measured approach, in that it acknowledged the Commission&rsquo;s desire to move away from historical references, while not moving as far or as fast.  I consider the final outcome - which also provides for a minimum payment of at least 60% of the national average payment - to be a fair one for all farmers, and one that will continue to support the ongoing development of the agri-food sector as envisaged under the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.<\/p><p>  Of course many decisions remain to be taken on how the reform outcome will be implemented in Ireland.  On direct payments, outstanding questions include whether entitlements should move towards the full national average or 90% of the national average, and at what level the minimum payment should be fixed.  Over the coming weeks I will be reflecting on the views of stakeholders and interested parties on these and a range of other issues, as submitted to my Department during the consultation process which concluded last Friday, 20 September.  My deliberations, and the decisions I make on the future structure of the direct payments system, will continue to be underpinned by the need for a fair and balanced approach. <\/p><p>  In relation to Pillar 2, preparatory work for the next Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020 is already well underway.  An initial consultation process was launched in 2012, and written submissions were received from over 80 stakeholders.

One of the key ways in which I do this is by negotiating on behalf of Ireland at the annual December EU Fisheries Council Meeting.  As the Deputy is aware, fishing quotas for all EU Member States are set each year at this Council. My primary aim has always been, and always will be, to achieve an outcome that protects the overall interests of the Irish fishing industry while respecting the most up-to-date scientific advice for stocks of critical importance to our fleets.  I will once again aim to ensure a fair and balanced outcome for Ireland at the EU Fisheries Council Meeting next December.  It will as always be challenging, but under the newly reformed CFP, the changes proposed, once implemented and embedded, will provide the basis for a significant period of growth in the Irish fishing industry.<\/p><p>  In relation to Area VIa specifically, I will be aiming to achieve the best possible outcome with regard to the stocks of most importance to our vessels operating in that area such as haddock, megrim, monkfish, herring, mackerel, and boarfish.  The formal proposals for 2014 quotas have not yet issued from the Commission but they are expected to be published within a matter of weeks.  Once they have been received and analysed I will initiate a consultation process with all major stakeholders and expert contributions from the Marine Institute(MI) and Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM).

While it is the responsibility of horse owners to ensure the welfare of horses in their ownership and\/or their care and to dispose of them appropriately, my Department is consulting with relevant stakeholders involved in the horse sector, including farming\/industry representatives, Local Authorities, Teagasc and welfare bodies to gauge the extent of any developing problem in relation to the welfare of horses.  In this context, I have noted the positive message from Teagasc&rsquo;s recent fodder census survey which indicates good grass growth throughout the country and adequate fodder stocks.  In view of this, there is no evidence of an immediate problem in relation to the welfare of horses.

Such action will help prevent the emergence of long-term and severe animal welfare problems.  The Council also stresses that where a horse is being sold, the seller must do his or her utmost to ensure that the person buying the horse has the capacity to take care of the animal and meet all its health and welfare needs.  The seller bears a responsibility to ensure that the welfare of the horse will not be compromised in the future.

An independent evaluator has been contracted to prepare the ex-ante evaluation report, SEA and AA and to advise on the SWOT analysis. <\/p><p>  An initial consultation process was launched in 2012, and written submissions were received from over 80 stakeholders.  These submissions have been analysed by my Department and have fed into the development of the SWOT and needs analyses.  A second consultation was held in July, where stakeholders attended a full day workshop on the draft SWOT and needs analyses.  Based on the outcome of these processes, the drafting of a new programme is being advanced in my Department, and it is intended that further stakeholder consultation will form part of this.<\/p><p>  The submission of a new RDP will be interlinked with the submission by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform of an overall Partnership Agreement which will form the framework document for EAFRD funding and the other structural funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400055#WRC00800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licences Applications","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400055#WRC00850"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[39149\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400055#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the proposal by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for development of deep-sea fish farms off the Atlantic coast; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department is bound, under EU Regulations, to maintain the accuracy the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), which underpins the processing of applications under these Schemes as well as REPS and AEOS.<\/p><p>  At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter. In that letter, farmers are reminded to examine each map carefully and to identify and exclude from their application all ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes etc. included in the land parcels. There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate. They are also given the means to do so by making the ortho-photos available to them on an annual basis. These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers at the commencement of the application period each year. In view of the size and structure of farm enterprises in Ireland, farmers are fully aware of all of the non-eligible areas of their holdings.       <\/p><p>  In addition to any changes submitted by farmers, in order to insure the integrity of the LPIS, my Department continuously reviews the eligibility of lands claimed by farmers for the Single Payment Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes.  <\/p><p>  In line with this position, all lands claimed under Direct Payment Schemes in respect of the 2009 &ndash; 2012 scheme years are currently subject to ongoing review for eligibility purposes.  As a result of this phase of this review, any payments made to farmers in respect of claimed areas, which were found to be ineligible, must be reimbursed. In such circumstances farmers were advised they could either refund the over-payment directly to my Department or the overpayment could be recouped from their next payment(s) due from my Department. Such reviews can only be undertaken when up-to-date imagery becomes available to my Department.

I have not therefore made any decision at this stage with regard to how forestry should be funded in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fodder Crisis","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRD01950"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[39508\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRD02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he has put in place contingency plans in the event of bad weather this winter causing another animal food crisis.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>There were a range of measures put in place in recognition of the difficulties experienced by a great number of farmers across the country resulting from the unseasonable weather in 2012 and earlier this year which led to an extraordinary fodder shortage.<\/p><p>  An InterAgency Fodder Committee was established in early summer under the Chairmanship of Dr Tom Kelly, Teagasc. The Committee includes representatives of all Agricultural Stakeholders, including a representative from my Department. The Committee not only monitored the fodder situation but also coordinated actions to ensure that there would be sufficient fodder conserved for next Winter. The Committee ensured a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of a strong advisory campaign to encourage farmers to maximise grass growth and conserve sufficient fodder for next winter. They produced a fodder budget worksheet which was widely publicised and allowed farmers to make decisions regarding feed planning for next winter. <\/p><p>  At my request, the InterAgency Fodder Committee reported to the Food Harvest 2020 High Level Implementation Committee, which I chair, on the actions being taken and the progress being made.<\/p><p>  In April this year I established a Fodder Transport Subsidy Scheme to help alleviate the difficulties being encountered by farmers.<b><\/b>  The Scheme reduced the cost of imported fodder to farmers by approximately a third. The Scheme supported the importation of almost 2,800 loads of imported fodder, amounting to over 40,000 tons of fodder into the country.<\/p><p>  In recognition of the severe difficulties experienced by farmers due to a shortage of fodder and the serious risk of a further shortage this Autumn\/Winter, Ministers Hogan and I announced temporary and targeted adjustment of 2 provisions of the Nitrates Regulations to support additional fodder production on Irish farms earlier this year, i.e., extension of the period for the application of chemical fertiliser from the 15<sup>th<\/sup>   to the end of September and the discounting of the phosphorus content a portion of meal fed.<\/p><p>  The InterAgency Fodder Committee conducted a <b>Fodder Survey<\/b> earlier this month.

The survey noted that with prudent management of existing fodder stocks, along with appropriate supplementation with concentrate feeds, farmers are well positioned to come through this winter. <\/p><p>  The very favourable grass growing conditions in August and September to date have been of great benefit to farmers in addressing the fodder issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Administration","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRD02150"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[39535\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if in the event of payments being made on land deemed not eligible for payment under the single farm payment the EU disallow re-imbursement on that land or if they also fine the paying State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department is bound, under EU Regulations, to maintain the accuracy the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), which underpins the processing of applications under these Schemes as well as REPS and AEOS.<\/p><p>  At the start of each year, my Department issues colour maps of all land parcels declared by farmers in the previous year together with a covering letter. In that letter, farmers are reminded to examine each map carefully and to identify and exclude from their application all ineligible features such as buildings, farmyards, scrub, roadways, forests, lakes etc. included in the land parcels.   There is, therefore, an onus on all farmers to ensure that the area of land declared by them as eligible for payment under the Direct Payment Schemes is accurate. They are also given the means to do so by making the ortho-photos available to them on an annual basis. These requirements are also made clear in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes, which accompanies the pre-printed application form issued to all farmers at the commencement of the application period each year. In view of the size and structure of farm enterprises in Ireland, farmers are fully aware of all of the non-eligible areas of their holdings.       <\/p><p>  In addition to any changes submitted by farmers, in order to insure the integrity of the LPIS, my Department continuously reviews the eligibility of lands claimed by farmers for the Single Payment Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes.  <\/p><p>  In line with this position, all lands claimed under Direct Payment Schemes in respect of the 2009 &ndash; 2012 scheme years are currently subject to ongoing review for eligibility purposes. As a result of this phase of this review, any payments made to farmers in respect of claimed areas, which were found to be ineligible, must be reimbursed. In such circumstances farmers are advised they could either refund the over-payment directly to my Department or the overpayment could be recouped from their next payment(s) due from my Department. <\/p><p>  Finally, I can confirm that in the event of the European Commission determining that EU monies have been paid on ineligible land, it would recover the relevant amount from the paying agency that made the payment. However, this would not be the case where that Member State took the appropriate measures to recoup the amounts involved from the farmers, who made the over-claims that led to the over-payments, and repaid these amounts to the Commission. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fodder Crisis","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRD02350"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[39550\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount of money paid out to date for the fodder transport subsidy; the number of applications received; the number of applications paid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":144,"content":"<p>In light of the difficulties experienced by farmers in sourcing fodder supplies, earlier this year I announced the allocation of funding for an imported fodder transport scheme, designed to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage (hay, silage, haylage) from outside the island of Ireland.

The changes to be introduced to Oireachtas Committees in this D&aacute;il term include the following.<\/p><p><b>Pre-Legislation<\/b><\/p><p>  More public involvement in law making by expanding the current Oireachtas Committee Pre-Legislative Stage.  The Pre-Legislative stage before the relevant Oireachtas Committee will be required for all non-emergency legislation. Where a Minister does not bring a Bill to Committee for Pre-Legislative Stage, they will be required to outline to both the Cabinet and the D&aacute;il the reasons for this decision.  This will allow for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public in law making. The Committee can consult with citizens with expertise in the area, civic society groups and other interested groups - crucially, this will take place before the Legislation is drafted. Where there has been Pre-Legislative Stage the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee will have an equal right to speak as the Minister and the Opposition spokespersons before the D&aacute;il to outline the Committee's work.<\/p><p><b>Post-Legislation<\/b><\/p><p>  A Minister will report to the relevant Oireachtas Select Committee within 12 months of enactment to review the functioning of the Act. This will allow for the Committee to consult with civil society groups and individuals with expertise in the relevant area.<\/p><p><b>Enhancing the role of Oireachtas Committees in the Budget Process<\/b><\/p><p>-  <i>April to September<\/i>  :  In April each year the Stability Programme Update is presented by the Government to the EU. Committees can review this information and report before the Budget in October.<\/p><p>-  <i>October to December:<\/i>   The Budget and Spending Estimates will be published in October.<\/p><p>  The D&aacute;il and Committees will, for the first time, scrutinise the Budget proposals and the Estimates before the beginning of the financial year before any money is spent.<\/p><p>  If the people support the proposal to abolish the Seanad, in the next D&aacute;il, under a unicameral system, a number of Oireachtas Committee reforms will be required, including:<\/p><p>  -  A Pre-Enactment Stage will be introduced between Report Stage and Final Stage.  This would be undertaken by the Committee which had considered the Bill at Pre-Legislative and Committee Stages and will allow for that Committee to make recommendations to the D&aacute;il for approval. This will take place with all Bills except in the case of emergency legislation.<\/p><p>  -  A new structure for the Oireachtas Committee System will be established.  This enhanced Committee System will have 14 D&aacute;il Committees including:<\/p><p>    - Four strategic committees: They will focus on issues of major strategic and political importance (including PAC, Finance &amp;amp; Budget, EU scrutiny and Social Affairs). They will be granted additional powers to carry out their work such as those currently allowed to PAC. They will take precedence over the sectoral committees. <\/p><p>   - Seven sectoral committees: They will shadow Government Departments; and <\/p><p>  - Three thematic committees: They would focus on specific issues (Oversight &amp;amp; Petitions, Good Friday Agreement, members' interests).  <\/p><p>  Committee Chairs will be appointed using the d'Hondt system for a proportionate distribution of Committee Chairs between the Government and Opposition.<\/p><p>  These Committees will have the power to consult civil society groups, advocacy groups and individuals with expertise in a specific area to inform and assist them in their work.<\/p><p>  The provision of Constitutional status to Oireachtas Committees would be a matter to be considered in light of these developments.<\/p><p>  Similarly, the commitment in the Programme for Government to amend Standing Orders so that Written Parliamentary Questions have to be answered within a certain number of days even during the D&aacute;il recess will be considered as part of the ongoing D&aacute;il Reform agenda being implemented over the lifetime of this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1098"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Statutory Instruments","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[37420\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRE00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the measures taken to ensure all that Statutory Instruments are placed on the Irish Statute Book website in a timely manner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1103","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p>The electronic files for Statutory Instruments (SIs) are produced through the electronic Statutory Instrument system (eSIS) by the Government Publications Office and sent to the Attorney General's Office in batches of 30-50. <\/p><p>When received, they are processed for publication on the electronic Irish Statute Book web site (eISB), in a searchable format, with relevant cross referencing\/linking as required.<\/p><p>The time taken to process the SIs varies depending on the complexity and number of SIs received.

Data for 2012 is not yet available as it is dependent on the receipt of administrative data which are not filed until 2013 and are not fully available to CSO until 2014. The latest CSO Business Demography returns for 2011 were released on 25 July 2013. The primary purpose of Business Demography is to provide estimates of numbers of enterprises and numbers of persons engaged. The data for Business Demography is based on the CSO Central Business Register. The Business Register is a register of all enterprises that are active in the State. There is no lower size limit, but for practical reasons, Business Demography data is based on enterprises that are registered with the Revenue Commissioners. The first reference year covered is 2006.<\/p><p>Table 1 below contains the number of Persons Engaged in NACE Rev 2 sector 64 (less 64.20, Activities of Holding Companies) <i>&ldquo;Financial service activities excluding activities of holding companies&rdquo;<\/i> (including retail banking), and sector 77.35 <i>&ldquo;Renting and leasing of air transport equipment.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>Persons Engaged includes employees, proprietors and family members. The number of employees is calculated on an annualized equivalent basis for the reference year. The total number of weeks worked by an employee over the course of the year is divided by 52 to get the fraction of their full annual employment. So for example, a person who has worked for 52 weeks in the year will contribute 1 to the employment figures, while a person who has worked 26 weeks of the year will contribute 0.5. No distinction is made between full time and part time employment, so an employee who works on a part time basis for a full year is still counted as 1 employee.<\/p><p>Table1: Number of Persons Engaged in Ireland in selected activities by Sector, 2006-2011<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Number of Persons Engaged<\/th><th>Year<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Sector<\/td><td>2006<\/td><td>2007<\/td><td>2008<\/td><td>2009<\/td><td>2010<\/td><td>2011<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Financial service activities excluding activities of holding companies<\/td><td>45,161<\/td><td>51,812<\/td><td>53,236<\/td><td>50,289<\/td><td>48,369<\/td><td>48,402<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Renting and leasing of air transport equipment<\/td><td>373<\/td><td>511<\/td><td>635<\/td><td>713<\/td><td>754<\/td><td>843<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>Business Demography figures are based purely on administrative data. This results in some differences with survey based Structural Business Statistics (SBS) releases, like the Census of Industrial Production, Building and Construction Inquiry, and Annual Services Inquiry.<\/p><p>1) Administrative data sources allow better coverage of small enterprises, which do not show up using survey methods.<\/p><p>2) Administrative data counts active Revenue registrations as active enterprises. This generally lines up with the definition of an enterprise in survey areas, but there can be some differences, especially in enterprise groups.<\/p><p>3) Business Demography counts employment data based on P35 employer returns, while other SBS releases measure employment based on survey returns. This is particularly significant for enterprise groups, where the whole group may make one P35 return, which results in all its employees being counted against the overall enterprise group NACE code. Survey based releases may divide this employment across different enterprises, and therefore different NACE codes.<\/p><p>Further information is available from recent CSO Business Statistics releases.<\/p><p>The Business Demography Press Release of 25 July 2013 is available at;<\/p><p><i>http:\/\/www.cso.ie\/en\/releasesandpublications\/er\/bd\/businessdemography2011\/<\/i><\/p><p>The Business in Ireland Release of November 2012 is available at;<\/p><p><i>http:\/\/www.cso.ie\/en\/media\/csoie\/releasespublications\/documents\/multisectoral\/2010\/businessinireland2010.pdf<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRF02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1098"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Board Remuneration","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRF02925"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[39285\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRF03000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the full year saving to the Exchequer if all State agency board members' fees, non-commercial State sponsored bodies and commercial semi-State companies, under the aegis of his Department were reduced by 25%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Since 2004, Irish groups ranging from those providing front line services to those most at need including the elderly, isolated, vulnerable and new arrivals to those working in the culture and heritage space have received grants of over &euro;100 million under the Programme. At present, we work with almost 200 Irish community organisations in over 20 countries and despite the economic situation, I ensured the ESP budget for 2013 - &euro;11.6 million - remained at the same level as in 2012. <\/p><p>The programme provides extensive funding to organisations that act as first port of call for new emigrants, including the GAA, the London Irish Centre, the Irish Canadian Immigration Centre in Toronto and several similar groups in Australia. We also support a wide range of business and graduate networks around the world.<\/p><p>Among the Irish based organisations who receive ESP funding is Crosscare Migrant Project which offers pre-departure services to Irish citizens considering emigration. Crosscare also provide training to mainstream service providers on emigration and returners' issues and work in conjunction with Irish welfare organisations abroad (many also funded by ESP) and statutory and voluntary service providers in Ireland including the probation service, Salvation Army and Safe Home.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department met with the National Youth Council of Ireland to discuss some of the findings and recommendations from their report with a view to seeing if there are areas the NYCI and the Department might be able to cooperate on in future. <\/p><p>The second strand of our diaspora engagement programme is our partnership with the Global Irish Network, a group of over 300 of the most influential Irish connected business figures drawn from almost 40 countries, which provide invaluable advice, facilitation and practical assistance to the Government and Irish companies.

In addition, since 2005, the Cork- Omdurman partnership was been awarded grant funding of over &euro;200,000 from the Irish Aid Civil Society Fund for capacity building initiatives, including for the training of village midwives in rural areas in newborn resuscitation techniques.  The partnership has shown very encouraging results and is a fine example of a healthcare partnership model in maternity care.<\/p><p>  Preventing and responding to HIV and AIDS and improving health outcomes for women and children will continue to be a priority for the Irish Aid programme.

In its approach to exemptions, the Group considered that the LPT should be centred on the principles of equity, transparency and simplicity.  In terms of these principles, it was considered that a universal liability should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  The Government accepted the recommendations of the Thornhill Group when considering the implementation of the LPT.  Old age pensioners do not have a specific exemption related to age.  They may qualify for one of the exemptions provided for in the legislation, or may be entitled to a deferral based on their income level.  <\/p><p>  The Government accepted the income thresholds recommended by the Thornhill Group for a full deferral, and adapted the income thresholds for a partial deferral so that they are &euro;10,000 rather than &euro;5,000 above the thresholds for a full deferral, thus allowing more persons the potential to avail of the deferral provisions. <\/p><p>  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The income thresholds for a full deferral will be &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their income will not, &#8220;as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date&#8221; exceed these thresholds in that year.  <\/p><p>  An increased income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  This deferral option will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress. <\/p><p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons\/civil partners\/cohabitants.  A deferral of 50% of the LPT will also be available where gross income does not exceed the above thresholds (&euro;25,000 single, &euro;35,000 couple) as increased by 80% of the gross mortgage interest payments that a liable person expects to make by the end of the year for which the gross income is being estimated. This type of deferral will also be available until 31 December 2017.<\/p><p>  Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred.  Interest of c. 4% per annum will apply to any amounts deferred. The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.<\/p><p>  To determine whether deferral applies for 2013, a person is required to estimate on 1 May 2013 what his or her total gross income for 2013 will be. Gross income from all sources consists of total income before any deductions, allowances or reliefs that may be taken off for income tax purposes and includes income that is exempt from income tax and income from the Department of Social Protection but excludes Child Benefit.  <\/p><p>  I appreciate some property owners may find themselves unable to pay LPT but do not qualify for a deferral under the existing legislation.  For this reason, the legislation provides that a person who has entered an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may apply for deferral of the LPT that is due during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect.  The legislation also provides that a person who suffers both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay their LPT without causing financial hardship, may apply for full or partial deferral.  Claims for this type of deferral will require full disclosure of the person's financial circumstances, supporting documentation and any other information required by Revenue and following an examination of the information provided, Revenue will determine whether deferral should be granted.  The detail of how this type of deferral will operate and the criteria that will be used to determine eligibility are set out in guidelines published by the Revenue Commissioners.  <\/p><p>Details of the deferral arrangements are available on Revenue's website <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.revenue.ie<\/font><\/i>, where the Commissioners have published a useful Guide to Local Property Tax.  <\/p><p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for, or does not wish to avail of, a deferral, phased payment of LPT can be used to assist with budgeting.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that taxpayers have a wide choice of payment options for the LPT from which they can choose the method most suited to their individual circumstances.  There are currently eight options available, including the option to pay the tax through phased cash payments. <\/p><p>  The cash payment option is available through three different approved payment service providers, which are An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.  The appointed service providers have extensive nationwide outlets and can process payment of LPT either in full as a single payment or by phased payments on a weekly or monthly basis as best suits individual needs. Payment via service providers is subject to transaction charges - these are at the discretion of the individual service providers and Revenue has no role in this regard.  I understand An Post charges &euro;1 per transaction; Payzone charges 75 cents per transaction for payments up to &euro;50, &euro;1 per transaction for payments between &euro;50.01 and &euro;100 and &euro;2 per transaction for payments over &euro;100; and Omnivend charges a fee of 4% per transaction.<\/p><p>  Revenue provides two further facilities to make phased payments.  Firstly, since 1 July 2013 payment of LPT can be made by way of deduction at source from employment, occupational pension income or from certain payments made by the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This option does not incur any fees or charges and facilitates payment of LPT in even amounts across the year.  Secondly, phased payments can be made by way of direct debit from the property owner's current account in a bank or other financial institution, including a credit union.  Direct debit deductions commenced from 15 July 2013 and are deducted on the 15th day of each month.  Normal direct debit fees charged by financial institutions apply to these payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRG03000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Ratings","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRG03050"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[39173\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the manner in which lending institutes and the Irish Credit Bureau report and record will be reformed in view of the high volume of restructuring of debt taking place and the five year impact that this has on a person's credit rating; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The tax rates that are being quoted are, emphatically, not the rate of tax paid by such companies, or by any company, on their Irish activities.<\/p><p>  All companies resident in Ireland are chargeable to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate on the profits that are generated from their trading activities in Ireland.  A higher 25% rate applies in respect of investment, rental and other non-trading profits. Chargeable capital gains are taxable at the capital gains tax rate of 33%.<\/p><p>  There are different ways of measuring the effective rate of corporation tax depending on the variables that are used.  As there is no such single internationally agreed methodology to calculate the effective rate of corporation tax, there is no reliable basis upon which to calculate the current 'effective rate' of corporate tax in Ireland without being potentially misleading.  <\/p><p>  Therefore, neither I, nor my Department, would be in a position to introduce a minimum 'effective rate' in Ireland in the way the Deputy has suggested.<\/p><p>To illustrate the debate on the topic, I have previously referred to an estimate from a report produced by the World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers which put the effective rate in Ireland at 11.9% (<i>Paying Taxes, 2013<\/i>).  I also referred to a study by the European Commission (<i>Taxation Trends in the EU 2011<\/i>), which indicates Ireland has an effective corporate tax rate which is close to or indeed higher than the statutory 12.5% rate (this is likely because of the 25% rate that applies generally to non-trading income).<\/p><p>I have been clear that my Department does not take ownership of these reports, but they do indicate that the 'effective' rate of tax paid by companies in Ireland is close to the headline rate of 12.5%.<\/p><p>  Some other countries have a high headline rate of corporation tax which is then supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs which reduce the overall rate of tax paid.  By contrast, the approach in Ireland is transparent: we have a competitive headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base.<\/p><p>  We therefore have only a small number of tax incentives in Ireland, and we make sure that those we do have are specifically targeted.  They are focussed firstly, on the creation of additional employment as is consistent with current Government policy, and secondly on areas of innovation with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.  The small number of reliefs we have include, for example, the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit and the 3-year exemption from corporation tax for start-up companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRJ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRJ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[39503\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRJ02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason VAT could not be waived in respect of a service (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>The application of VAT is determined by the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

This was done at a time when rates in the deposit market generally were coming down, and with the objective of remaining competitive while not incurring interest costs above the levels generally prevailing in the market on Government borrowings.

There are constant flows into and out of the Exchequer account and all  moneys  within  it are fungible.  The Government must ensure through its management of expenditure, tax and non-tax receipts and borrowings that there are prudent and adequate balances in the Exchequer account at all times. This also provides investors with the assurance they require that they will be repaid upon the redemption of debt.   For small open economies such as Ireland, budgetary aggregates are generally more susceptible to the negative effects of external  and  internal  shocks.  In general terms  the overall  level  of cash reserves held depends on the State's  risk appetite in relation to such shocks. Particular factors which arise in that context include the international economic situation, the State's debt maturity profile and the projected pattern of Exchequer receipts and expenditure. In Ireland, where we are seeking to achieve sustainable access to the debt markets while still running a significant budget deficit, the need to hold appropriate cash balances as we emerge from the EU\/IMF programme is paramount. In line with this, the Troika's funding projections for Ireland envisage sufficient cash in hand as at the end of the programme in December 2013 to cover the Exchequer's full needs for the calendar year 2014.  <\/p><p>  The April 2013 <i>Stability Programme Update<\/i>   forecasts estimated  the cumulative Exchequer deficit over the years 2013-2015 at some &euro;25 billion, with the 2014 deficit estimated at just under &euro;9 billion.  In fact with 40% of the 2014 EBR forecasted to accrue in the first quarter along with the significant bond redemption of &euro;6.85 billion in January 2014, much of the prefunded cash balances will be utilised in the first 3 months of 2014. Indeed  visibility  as  to  our  2014  funding  is essential  if  Ireland is to  successfully  exit  the programme on schedule.<\/p><p>  Decisions on the level of cash reserves take account of various factors in addition to the cost of maintaining such reserves. These factors include the potential risks of not maintaining an adequate and prudent cash balance, including the risk that the Exchequer would be unable to meet its obligations and that market funding rates for Ireland would therefore be higher than would otherwise be the case due to the perception that the State had a precarious liquidity position. <\/p><p>  The State earns a return on these cash balances and deposits, which the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) manages in a prudent manner consistent with minimising risk and always having sufficient cash on hand to cover any volatility which might arise.  I am informed by the NTMA that they have calculated that, during 2013,  based on bond issuance yields and the cost of funding under the EU-IMF Programme, the net interest differential (cost) on the cash balances held is in the region of 2.7% which equates to about &euro;2.2 million per month for each &euro;1 billion borrowed. The key elements of the marginal cost of funds in 2013 include the two long-term bond syndications done in early 2013, the pooled funds received from the EFSF and disbursements received from the IMF, United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark. The NTMA continues to keep the quantum, maturity and timing of market funding under review based on its assessment of what is required to regain full market access and the overall level of cash balances that it is prudent to maintain.<\/p><p>  It is the intention to run lower cash balances in the coming years, once sustainable market access has been established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Yield","counter":416,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRK00750"},{"type":"question","counter":417,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[39568\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRK00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a breakdown, in tabular form, of the amount of money raised from the local property tax in each local authority area in County Wicklow; the level of compliance and non-compliance in County Wicklow to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged.

","asker":"1005","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 to 214, inclusive, together. \t<\/p><p>  The VAT rating of goods and services is governed by the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. The VAT Directive generally provides that supplies of goods and services should be subject to VAT at the standard rate, which in Ireland is 23%. Regarding reduced rates of VAT, the VAT Directive is restrictive in relation to the application of such rates, whereby Member States may apply up to two reduced rates of VAT of between 5% and 15% but only to specific goods and services set out in Annex III of that Directive.  In addition, Member States may retain a zero rate of VAT, or a rate of VAT less than 5%, on goods and services where that rate applied to those goods and services on 1 January 1991.  However, no new activity can apply at those rates, and once removed activity cannot be reinstated at those rates.  The VAT Directive also allows the continuation of a reduced rate on goods and services not listed in Annex III, where they carried a reduced rate on 1 January 1991, however, the Directive requires that a reduced rate of at least 12% apply to those goods and services.<\/p><p>  In general, the VAT rates applying to the goods and services referred to by the Deputy are a result of these EU VAT rules. However, I would draw to the Deputy&rsquo;s attention that catheters used for use solely or principally with urinary drainage kits or colostomy\/ostomy devices apply at the zero rate of VAT.  In addition, while solar panels apply at the 23% standard rate, Irish and EU law provide that where the installation of a solar panel accounts for at least one third of the cost of the supply, then the 13.5% reduced VAT rate can be applied.  In relation to the hire of a limousine with a driver, this service is exempt from VAT on the basis of a derogation from EU VAT law, where Ireland applies a VAT exemption to the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage. Furthermore, the EU VAT Directive contains detailed rules regarding the VAT treatment of investment gold in order to avoid VAT fraud, which is why the supply of gold is exempt from VAT. <\/p><p>  In general, Ireland applies a reduced VAT rate and zero rate of VAT to a far greater range of goods and services than other EU Member States.  In this regard, Ireland already applies the zero rate of VAT to basic foods, and the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% applies to most services, while tourist related services currently apply at the 9% rate. In addition, the 23% standard rate applies to most luxury goods.  In this context, while there is generally scope to apply a higher rate of VAT to many goods and service, there is very little scope to do the reverse.<\/p><p>  With regard to undertaking a comprehensive review of the different rates of VAT that are applied to different product types, the VAT system and its structure are reviewed on an annual basis in the lead up to the Budget, bearing in mind the constraints of the EU VAT Directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Promissory Note Issues","counter":439,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRK02550"},{"type":"question","counter":440,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[39688\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRK02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the first of the promissory notes bonds of &euro;500 million has been sold and if not, if he will instruct the Central Bank of Ireland to put a stay an any such sale until after the legality or otherwise of the original promissory notes has been established in court.

There are currently eight separate options available, including the option to pay the tax through phased cash payments from 1 July 2013 to the end of the year.    The cash payment option is available through three different approved payment service providers, which are An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.  The appointed service providers have extensive nationwide outlets and can process payment of LPT either in full as a single payment or by phased payments on a weekly or monthly basis as best suits individual needs. The imposition of transaction charges is at the discretion of the individual service providers and Revenue has no role in this regard.  I understand An Post charges &euro;1 per transaction; Payzone charges 75 cents per transaction for payments up to &euro;50, &euro;1 per transaction for payments between &euro;50.01 and &euro;100 and &euro;2 per transaction for payments over &euro;100; and Omnivend charges a fee of 4% per transaction.<\/p><p>  Revenue provides two further facilities to make phased payments.  Firstly, since 1 July 2013 payment of LPT can be made by way of deduction at source from employment, occupational pension income or from certain payments made by the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This option does not incur any fees or charges and facilitates payment of LPT in even amounts across the year in question.  Secondly, phased payments can be made by way of direct debit from the property owner&rsquo;s current account in a bank or other financial institution, including a credit union.  Direct debit deductions commenced from 15 July 2013 and are deducted on the 15 day of each month.

In this regard, the issue of telephone recordings featured in the discussions under the Irish Presidency on the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ('MiFID II') and the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR).  <\/p><p>  The Irish Presidency secured a Council agreement in MiFID II and an agreement between Council and European Parliament in relation to the MAR. The provisions in relation to telephone recording by investment firms and other financial services providers were strengthened in both files.

In relation to market abuse, which I understand is both the main focus of the Deputy's question and primary driver of the UK legislative changes referred to, the MAR agreement ensures that the competent authorities can require the handing over of existing recordings of telephone conversations, electronic communications or other data traffic records held by investment firms, credit institutions or other financial institutions.  <\/p><p>  The transposition or implementation date for the MAR has not yet been determined as a technical alignment MiFID II will be required when the negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament have concluded on that file.

Intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected cigarette smuggling operations has already yielded significant results. To date in 2013, Enforcement officers have seized 10.42 million cigarettes in operations carried out in the border counties. In the same period, there have been 6 convictions for selling illegal cigarettes and tobacco in the border area. Financial penalties were imposed by the District Courts in five of these cases and a sentence to community service was imposed in the sixth case.   Revenue is an integrated tax and customs administration and has around 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance. These activities include anti-smuggling, audit, assurance checks, debt management, investigations, prosecutions and anti-avoidance. There are over 200 staff engaged on these activities in the border counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth. Revenue has an enforcement presence at all key strategic locations and enforcement strength at particular locations is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk-assessment basis, or when particular operations are taking place. The Revenue Commissioners assure me that their enforcement resources have been prioritised and are reinforced as necessary for specific operations.<\/p><p>  In line with best practice in tax administration worldwide, Revenue regards the development of information and intelligence as critical to the detection of evasion and smuggling, including cigarette smuggling. Revenue will maintain its approach of seizing illicit cigarettes and prosecuting those who do not comply with the legislation in relation to the illegal importation of cigarettes.  In this regard, if the Deputy has specific intelligence which would be helpful, I&rsquo;m sure the Revenue Commissioners would welcome it.<\/p><p>  Government policy on the reduction in civil service numbers overall applies to the Revenue Commissioners in common with other Departments and agencies. However, decisions on priorities for enforcement and compliance activities and on the deployment of Revenue resources to these activities are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.

The underpinning legislation for this measure was contained in the Finance Act 2013, which was passed by the Oireachtas and signed in to law on 27 March 2013.      It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes. These include long-term payments such as Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment, as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  <\/p><p>  I am fully aware that some employers do not pay a top up payment to their employees whilst on maternity leave.  However, in such circumstances many mothers will not be subject to income tax on their maternity benefit payments as their personal credits will ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself. Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case, depends on the total level of income that the individual or couple concerned has in the relevant tax year or years.  <\/p><p>  I would point out that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI. <\/p><p>  Given the current budgetary constraints, I have no plans to provide an exemption along the lines suggested.

The level of intake to these Colleges has decreased in recent years in light of available resources and factors impacting on demand.  The funding provided to primary providers is set out in the attached tables.  The figures shown for the HEA funded Colleges include amounts provided for courses other than ITE. <br \/>  There are 15 providers of post-primary initial teacher education courses; the majority of these are state-funded institutes of technology\/universities funded by the HEA.  It is not possible to easily extract the funding for the initial teacher education elements provided by these higher education institutes from their overall funding allocations. <br \/>Neither my Department, nor any other State body, currently has a role in regulating the number of students enrolled in institutions providing privately-run courses.<br \/>In relation to the numbers entering teacher education programmes, my Department is keen to ensure that forecasting mechanisms are developed to ensure an adequate supply of teachers with the required qualifications. However, even with the best possible systems in place, securing equilibrium between demand and supply is not an exact science, and is subject to quite a number of variables. Recent developments, such as the EU rules on mutual recognition of qualifications and increased numbers qualifying from privately-run courses, have also meant that supply is more difficult to control and predict. <br \/>I have asked the Teaching Council to advise on this issue.

The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. Therefore it is not possible to give the derogation proposed by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  However, I understand that the European Commission issued guidance in 2010 that identified a range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement including promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards. This guidance stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU Treaty Principles and the Procurement Directives. The EU procurement directives primarily envisage that social considerations may be included as contract performance conditions, provided they are not discriminatory and are included in the contract notice or in the contract documents and relate to the performance of the contract. For example, the EU Directives state that contract performance conditions may be intended to favour on-site vocational training, the employment of people experiencing particular difficulty in achieving integration, the fight against unemployment or the protection of the environment.<\/p><p>  Therefore the use of social clauses in public procurement is limited to instances where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.<\/p><p>  Challenges arise from the need to ensure that: value for money is not adversely affected; additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract.<\/p><p>  The inclusion of social clauses in the procurement process would appear to be most suited to situations where the social benefit could be considered a core requirement and can be directly linked to the contracting authority&rsquo;s policy or strategic plan. Experience in other Member States, would also indicate that social clauses will tend to be used for services and works contracts rather than supply contracts.  A further consideration is the ability of contracting authorities to effectively monitor compliance with the social clause; this may be more difficult where some of the work is to be performed in another Member State.<\/p><p>  Social Clauses are currently being piloted under the Devolved Schools Build Programme Design and Build Framework, which is being procured and delivered by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC) earlier this year approved the pilot initiative to be included in the NDFA Devolved Schools Programme.  Currently 3 bundles are out to tender, which consist of a mix of new builds, extensions and some remedial works to existing schools both at a primary and post primary level.  The projects will be constructed using the public works contract for Building Works designed by the Contractor.  A clause has been included in the contract which requires that 10% of the person weeks worked on the contract be undertaken by individuals recruited from the ranks of the long-term unemployed.  There is also a requirement for 2.5% of the person weeks on the contract are undertaken by apprentices. The contractor&rsquo;s compliance with this clause will be carefully monitored in accordance with the terms set out in the contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRO01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":628,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRO01850"},{"type":"question","counter":629,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[39219\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will confirm, in respect of the alleged defrauding of EU grants which had been the subject of a report to the DPP in 1999 causing the dismissal of the CEO of an NGO (details supplied), that the Department recorded in March 2002 that there had been no irregularities.

Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and creating a full-time position, employers will receive a direct cash incentive over two years if the person they hire has been unemployed for a prolonged period.  The level of payment is higher where a person who has been unemployed for a longer period is recruited and retained. <\/p><p>  Up to Friday 20th September 2013, the Department had received and processed applications from 1,121 employers.

The remaining 548 applications are eligible for a payment of &euro;7,500 over two years, having been unemployed for between 12 and 24 months.<\/p><p>  At present, 400 eligible employers and eligible jobseekers have been matched.

Criteria considered by management in making such decisions include the distance between clinics, available transport, the number of customers attending clinics, times and duration of clinics while continuing to ensure that best use is made of available resources and that an efficient service is provided to those who rely on the service.<\/p><p>  Where the service has been restructured the frequency of clinics has being increased providing customers improved access to services.  Alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the community welfare service.  If a person is unable to travel to a new clinic, for example due to illness, alternative arrangements are in place including arranging a visit to the client's home if necessary.<\/p><p>  I am very conscious of the need to provide efficient and effective customer facing services at a local level for clients of the Department. It is therefore essential that the services provided are reconstituted to meet the changing needs of Irish society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRT00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":821,"content":"<p>Question No. 354 answered with Question No. 307.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teanga Gaeilge","counter":822,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRT01000"},{"type":"question","counter":823,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[39805\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRT01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"an f&eacute;idir l&eacute;i a chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; poibl&iacute; a shol&aacute;thra&iacute;onn an Roinn chomh maith leis an tSeirbh&iacute;s Leasa Pobail ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1110","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":824,"content":"<p>Geallann mo Roinnse (an tSeirbh&iacute;s Leasa Pobail san &aacute;ireamh) seirbh&iacute;s ardchaighde&aacute;in a chur ar f&aacute;il do chustaim&eacute;ir&iacute; i nGaeilge agus i mB&eacute;arla.

His mass mobilisation of the Irish people with a view to the peaceful advancement of their cause through the parliamentary process was an inspirational template followed by many in later years. Not only 'The Liberator' to his people, O'Connell was also a leading figure in the development of democracy and human rights in Europe and beyond.  The vision and achievements of Daniel O'Connell distinguish him as one the greatest Irishmen and I hold him in enormous personal regard.

Working with Glasnevin Trust, I was a partner in the introduction some years ago of an annual commemoration at the O'Connell mausoleum each May.  Supported by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the County Mayor of Kerry, the O'Connell Schools, the O'Connell family and many others &ndash; including the British Embassy - this annual occasion has grown to include a Memorial Mass in the Church of St Andrew at Westland Row, Dublin 2 (of which O'Connell was a benefactor), and a Memorial Lecture organised by Glasnevin Trust on a topical theme. As the coming year is the bi-centenary of the birth of Thomas Davis, the programme will consider the relationship between O'Connell and the Young Ireland movement.<\/p><p>  I have also been working with the Office of Public Works in relation to events at Derrynane, Co Kerry, to promote the consciousness of O'Connell.  A special event there in September 2012 considered the European perspective on O'Connell and his significant influence on the African-American, Frederick Douglass.<\/p><p>  In the absence of any framework or tradition for the official designation of National Memorial Days in respect of Irish persons of historic achievement and renown, I welcome the commitment that brings people together to organise such commemorations and consideration of O'Connell.

The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.  My Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users. Throughout the contract period, network utilisation and performance data is submitted by &ldquo;3&rdquo; to my Department on a monthly basis. The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on &ldquo;3&rdquo;, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.

The plan outlined the main management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement to the sea. The four main management actions were:<\/p><p>- a cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market;<\/p><p>-  mitigation of the impact of hydropower, including a comprehensive trap and transport plan to be funded by the ESB;<\/p><p>-  ensuring upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers; and<\/p><p>-  improvement of water quality.<\/p><p>  I can advise that the overall requirement and objective is to provide, with high probability, a long-term 40% escapement to the sea of the biomass of silver eel, relative to pristine conditions (i.e. if the stock had been completely free of man-made influences including commercial fishing).<\/p><p>  The scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Group does not support any assertion that &ldquo;stocks are above conservation limits&rdquo;. In 2011, the status of the European Eel in Ireland was defined by the United Nations as critically endangered. <\/p><p>  The ICES advice is that the eel stock continues to decline and urgent action is needed. ICES advice is that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pollution) should be reduced to as close to zero as possible until there is clear evidence that both recruitment and the adult stock are increasing. In 2011, glass eel recruitment fell to 5% of their 1960-1979 level in the Atlantic region and less than 1% in the North Sea area, and showed no sign of recovery.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, recruitment has been declining at many monitoring sites since the mid-1980s. In the 2000-2011 period, the glass eel catch in the Shannon was at 2% of the pre-1980 numbers. In summary, recruitment of glass eels and elvers remained extremely low during the 2009 to 2011 period. It is anticipated that there will be a considerable decline in silver eel production, as indicated by recruitment history, yellow eel stock indicators and modelled projections for index stocks. <\/p><p>  In 2012, as required by the EU, a review of the management of Eel in Ireland was undertaken. This process included a robust public consultation during which many issues were raised and considered. Full details of the outputs of the public consultation are available on the IFI web site. The European Commission will report on the review of all EMPs, including Ireland. <\/p><p>  While I recognize fully the difficulty facing eel fishermen, the review of scientific and management advice and inputs from the public consultation informed a decision to continue with the cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market for the period from 2012 to 2015. Ireland&rsquo;s EMP will be reviewed again in 2015. <\/p><p>  It is up to each jurisdiction, including the UK, to ensure that they are achieving 40% escapement of silver eel biomass relative to pristine conditions. As already advised the review by the European Commission will evaluate all management plans including those of the UK. <\/p><p>  With regard to the Waterford region, I am advised that a survey of eel stocks was carried out in the Waterford estuary in 2009 and 2011 as part of surveys of transitional or estuarine waters under Ireland&rsquo;s EMP. The highest catch per unit effort values were recorded in the transitional waters of the Barrow\/Nore\/Suir. <\/p><p>  I am advised by IFI that low recapture of tagged eels most likely indicate high levels of movement within these transitional waters and make population estimation difficult. The current data make it very challenging to provide an estimate of silver eel escapement\/production for such a large transitional water body.<\/p><p>   Due to the difficulties in obtaining density estimates for eels in large water bodies and the migratory habits of eels moving upstream into the rivers and\/or leaving the transitional water as silver eel, estimating silver eel escapement\/production for transitional waters remains extremely challenging. I am advised by IFI that telemetry eel tagging studies undertaken in 2012, and continuing in 2013, will assist in giving a clearer indication of the movement habits of eels in estuaries and improve population density estimates. <\/p><p>  Given the challenges outlined above, the precautionary approach was also adopted, based on ICES advice and in accordance with the recommendations of the National Eel Working Group and the eel fishery in transitional and tidal waters was also ceased.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":876,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRU02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Priory Hall Development","counter":875,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRU02000"},{"type":"question","counter":876,"qnumday":375,"qnumall":"[39158\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if and when Mr. Justice Finnegan ceased to conduct the resolution process in relation to Priory Hall, Dublin 13; the reason a possible conclusion of the Priory Hall resolution process was not indicated in reply in this Deputy's earlier questions.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigns the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the water metering programme. It is a matter for Irish Water to comply with all national and European legislation in the discharge of its functions.      <\/p><p>  The installation programme commenced in August 2013 and will be implemented nationally as quickly as possible. The approach to procurement has been structured by Irish Water to ensure that there are sufficient boundary boxes, meters and installation contracts available for deployment to allow for the ramping up of the programme above the initial level once work is underway. It is important that all of these works are carried out safely and to a high quality standard with the minimum disruption and I expect that Irish Water will monitor and supervise all works accordingly.<\/p><p>  Responsibility for the administration of my Department's Rural Water Programme, under which funding is provided towards the capital costs of group water schemes, and of the subsidy scheme under which funding is provided towards the operational costs of group water schemes, has been devolved to local authorities since 1997.  My Department will remain responsible for the overall policy and funding of the non-public water sector, including the group water sector.  Over the past decade, substantial improvements have been made in the group water sector, reflected in improved infrastructure and management and leading to greater compliance with drinking water standards.  This has been accomplished through a partnership approach between my Department, the local authorities and the group water sector itself, with the important involvement of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.<i> This co-operative approach will be maintained as the reform of water services provision is progressed.<\/i><\/p><p>  Some group water schemes currently purchase water from water services authorities.

These standards represent a significant improvement on those previously in place since 1993 and the revisions took account of comfort, hygiene and safety issues. The standards specify requirements in relation to a range of matters such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.   <\/p><p>  Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened, updated legislative and regulatory framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations under the regulations, and fines for continuing non-compliance with the regulations have also been significantly increased. <\/p><p>  Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992 as amended by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 , provides that any person who by act or omission, obstructs an authorised person in the lawful exercise of the powers in, or contravenes a provision of, or a regulation made under, section 17, 18 or 20 of the 1992 Act, or fails to comply with an improvement notice, or re-lets a house in breach of a prohibition notice, is guilty of an offence and is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.

Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB). <\/p><p>  It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide the specific details of its enforcement strategy and inspection arrangements. However, in discharging their responsibilities in relation to the rental sector, authorities have been asked to have regard to the <i>Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement<\/i> published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which make a range of recommendations on relevant issues, including targeting inspection activities. <\/p><p>  Details of the number of inspections carried out and the a mounts paid to each local authority are available on my Department's website .

The situation as outlined by An Taoiseach at that time has not changed. No further contact has been made by or on behalf of the individual in question and no valid asylum application has been received which can be processed in accordance with the statutory provisions in this Jurisdiction.  <\/p><p>  As I also indicated in my response to Parliamentary Questions 498, 584 and 585 on 18th July, 2013, the Deputy will note that it is a generally accepted principle internationally, and one which Ireland applies, that a person should seek asylum in the first safe host country in which they arrive.

The granting of refugee status in Ireland is considered in accordance with the definition contained in the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by the 1967 New York Protocol thereto, and as defined in Section 2 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended).

It would not be a matter for me as Minister to comment on any case a person might make to the courts in relation to an extradition application.  It may be helpful to add, however, in the context of a person seeking asylum here, that the Refugee Act, 1996 makes it clear that nothing in it shall be construed as preventing the extradition of a person in accordance with the provisions of the Extradition Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRW04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Management Company Issues","counter":992,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":993,"qnumday":419,"qnumall":"[39662\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to introduce regulations in relation to property management companies (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU.

Plainly, I could not comment in any way on issues arising in another jurisdiction other than to note that Ireland does not have an Immigration Removal Centre and that residents in RIA centres are free to come and go as they please. In relation to any allegations of sexual assault in asylum accommodation centres in this jurisdiction I would refer the Deputy to the answer I gave to D&aacute;il Question no. 923 on 16 July, 2013 on the same subject.<\/p><p>  Any action of a criminal nature brought to the attention of RIA would immediately be referred to the Garda&iacute;. RIA takes the protection of its residents very seriously and already has in place a number of policies and procedures to ensure that they do not suffer acts of sexual harassment or assault or misbehaviour of any kind.<\/p><p>  Firstly, RIA's House Rules and Procedures set out the type and standard of service that an asylum seeker should expect whilst residing in direct provision accommodation. The Rules set out the entitlements and obligations placed on centre management and on residents and, in the event that these aren't being met, a complaints procedure to be invoked by either party. This complaints system is considered by RIA to be broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Office of the Ombudsman for &lsquo;internal complaints systems&rsquo;.  Sexual harassment, by any party, is specified as being unacceptable behaviour in respect of which the complaints procedure can be invoked.<\/p><p>  Secondly, over and above the House Rules themselves, the interests of asylum seekers are protected through regular 'clinics' in centres where residents can speak directly to RIA headquarters staff without local centre management being present.  Allegations of improper behaviour by any party could be reported in that context and acted upon immediately.<\/p><p>  Thirdly, RIA has a Code of Practice for persons working in accommodation centres which specifically prohibits sexual harassment.<\/p><p>  Fourthly,  RIA has a fully staffed Child Protection and Welfare section and has a Child Protection Policy based on the HSE&rsquo;s Children First -National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children. These guidelines were developed in order to assist people identifying and reporting child abuse and welfare concerns. Staff of centres are trained to recognise abuse and how it should be reported and each RIA accommodation centre has a designated Child Protection officer.  A draft revised Child Protection Policy designed to be even more transparent and accessible is currently with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for observations.<\/p><p>  Finally, along with Cosc (the National Organisation for the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender based violence) RIA has been engaged in a working group with a number of non - governmental organisations including Akidwa and the Rape Crisis Centre to develop a RIA policy around incidences of domestic, sexual and gender based violence and harassment within its centres.  The UNHCR has also been involved and has made suggestions from its perspective.<\/p><p>  The working group is now an advanced stage of deliberation and it is expected that a policy will finally be agreed in the course of the next few weeks.  A training programme for staff and residents will follow from agreement on this policy. In advance of this, the working group has approved an information poster which has already been distributed to all RIA centres. These posters - available in five languages including English - provide information on accessing professional help if residents have suffered or are suffering from domestic, sexual or gender based violence or harassment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drugs Crime","counter":1053,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1054,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[39741\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the advertising and sale of certain drugs (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1055,"content":"<p>The emergence of new psychoactive substances specifically designed to circumvent drug controls has been a matter of particular concern in recent years both here in Ireland and at international level.

The prevalence of these substances in Ireland was the subject of a report published in July 2011 by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol (NACDA) entitled \"An Overview of New Psychoactive Substances and the outlets supplying them\".<\/p><p>  In tackling the problem, a number of measures were introduced in this jurisdiction.

It introduced offences relating to the illegal sale, import and export of such substances in circumstances where a person knows or is reckless as to whether that substance is being acquired or supplied for human consumption.

At these meetings, the US Attorney General provided clarity on a number of issues, in particular with regard to the nature of the information collected and processed, i.e. phone numbers, duration of calls etc - but not the content of calls.  He also advised that the data was collected under judicial authority and only where there was a reasonable suspicion of serious crime.<\/p><p>  We cannot ignore the very important fact that there is a recognised need to protect our citizens from terrorist threats and dealing with that does require access to certain data.  I will continue to make the point at international level that in doing so it is necessary to ensure that the information used is properly obtained and subject to appropriate safeguards.  I have previously emphasised the importance of protecting privacy rights and ensuring respect for individual human rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights. I also recognise the crucial need to ensure that any security surveillance undertaken is balanced and appropriate.<\/p><p>  It was agreed that data protection and security experts from the US and from the EU would meet to clarify remaining matters as necessary.

These include the Report of the OSCE Special Representative which was published earlier this year, the US Trafficking in Persons (TIPs) Report which was published in June and ranked Ireland Tier 1 (the highest ranking available) for its efforts to combat human trafficking and the detailed Report of the Council of Europe expert group (<i>GRETA<\/i>) which will be available shortly.

The data from my Department&rsquo;s Animal Identification and Movement system, which is also used to provide data to the CSO, indicates that, as of mid September 2013, suckler cow numbers were 1.107 million or 3.6% down on the previous year. There is also evidence of a 9% reduction in the number of calves born to suckler cows in the year to July 2013 compared to the same period in the previous year, although this comes against the background of increases in such calvings in both 2011 and 2012.<\/p><p>Against this background, the available evidence does not suggest that there has been a drop of 20% in the size of the suckler cow herd. Patterns emerge over several years and it would be premature to draw definitive conclusions solely on the basis of the evidence available for 2013. Despite the drop recorded this year, the size of the suckler herd has remained consistently strong at over one million head, allowing valuable export markets to be developed from the quality beef produced from this herd.  While registrations are subject to cyclical fluctuations, the composition of the national herd, however, is constantly reviewed by my Department so that the necessary structural supports are in place to enable the industry to meet future market requirements.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the ongoing consolidation of the public finances, my Department and the agencies under its remit continue to provide an array of financial and infrastructural supports to underpin production in the beef sector. These include initiatives such as the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP), which is designed to equip beef farmers with the knowledge to improve output and efficiency at farm level. To date, some &euro;5 million has been paid to almost 5,500 farmers in respect of the 2012 BTAP.<\/p><p>Other financial supports include residual payments under the Suckler Cow Scheme, of which approximately &euro;8.4m has been disbursed to date in 2013, and the establishment of the Beef Data Programme (BDP) for which a sum of &euro;10 million has been allocated in respect of 2013-born animals. The BDP retains essential elements from the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme and will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of their livestock and will maintain a data flow to ICBF that will generate further advances in cattle breeding and, ultimately, in producer profitability. In addition, my Department provides funding to support the work of ICBF in delivering sustainable genetic gain in the national herd. On the advisory side, Teagasc provides a best practice model for suckler farmers through its participation in an expanded BETTER Beef Farm Programme.<\/p><p>I am committed to the development of a strong and sustainable suckler cow sector.

Under the current draft Rural Development Regulation, my Department must undertake an ex ante evaluation, a public consultation, a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) a needs assessment, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and an appropriate assessment (AA) in developing our Rural Development Programme.

I believe that Europe needs to continue to ensure that the food that it produces is safe and that agricultural methods are environmentally sustainable.  But it is also necessary to ensure that the Union&rsquo;s agriculture sector is competitive, particularly given the importance of the sector as a major exporter and the strong links between the sector and rural development in Europe. <\/p><p>  The CAP provides the framework within which the sustainable development of a competitive and efficient agriculture sector is pursued, as well as the resources to assist in its achievement.  In providing this framework the CAP has underpinned the modernisation of the European agriculture sector, making a vital contribution not only to economic growth in the EU, but also to sustainable, long-term global food security.  The CAP also underpins the socio-economic development of rural areas.  The most recent reform of the CAP is marked by three major advances:<\/p><p>  - First there is a greater emphasis on environmental sustainability through the greening of direct payments and the requirement to support agri-environment measures in rural development programmes.<\/p><p>  - Second, concerted efforts are being made to tackle the problem of generation renewal through new and enhanced supports for young farmers;<\/p><p>  - Third, the phasing out of production quotas for key products such as sugar and milk, backed up by safety-net provisions in cases of severe market disturbance, continues the increased orientation towards the market.<\/p><p>  Overarching these changes is the flexibility that has been allowed to Member States to adapt the policy measures under both the first and second pillar to deal with their own specific challenges within the common policy.  It is my firm belief that these changes amount to a useful and progressive reform of the CAP making it fit for purpose to 2020.  They are consistent with the smart, green, growth objectives of Food Harvest 2020 and provide farmers and the agri-food sector with policy certainty for the years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRAA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Milk Quota Cessation","counter":1165,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRAA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1166,"qnumday":475,"qnumall":"[39832\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRAA01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he has evaluated the opportunities for the Irish and European dairy sectors in the aftermath of the abolition of milk quotas; if he expects that Irish producers will be adequately equipped to avail of such opportunities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":1167,"qnumday":479,"qnumall":"[39836\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRAA01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which his Department has identified opportunities for the expansion of the export of dairy produce globally; the degree to which such prospects are likely to affected by the lifting of milk quotas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

More than 85% of Irish dairy production is exported and Ireland has access for dairy products to over eighty countries worldwide.  Nevertheless I am working with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa and elsewhere.  I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.  On this note I am leading a trade mission to the Gulf States in the near future.<\/p><p>  The ending of the milk quota regime does represent an exceptional opportunity to increase milk output, both in Ireland and in other Member States where milk production forms a significant part of their agricultural output. A Report published by the EU Commission last December on how markets are evolving, as the ending of milk quotas approaches, found that medium and long term prospects for the dairy sector are favourable.  This conclusion is based on population growth projections and interest for Westernisation of diets in emerging economies. The Report did caution, however, that this outlook did not rule out short term market fluctuations.<\/p><p>  Ireland strongly supported the decision to abolish milk quotas with effect from 1 April 2015 on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy sector and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.  I expect the abolition of quotas to facilitate an expansion in the sector and through the Food Harvest 2020 Report the industry has set itself an ambitious target for a 50% increase in milk production by 2020.  For my part I have been working on a number of fronts to prepare the industry for the move to a quota free environment and equip it to respond to the market opportunities arising.<\/p><p>  A key element of this market strategy is to optimise the already positive green image of Ireland in order to create a point of differentiation for Irish dairy products on international markets.  In this context, stakeholders are at present engaged, through Bord Bia, in technical discussions to finalise a dairy sustainability and quality scheme.  At processing level, Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green Programme is providing a vehicle for industry to commit itself to sustainability targets by reducing energy inputs, minimising overall carbon footprint and mitigating the impact on the environment.  This pro-active approach to environmental sustainability has a strong resonance with procurement strategists in the many multi-national food companies who are interested in using Ireland as a source of high quality food ingredients and processed products. <\/p><p>  Of course the industry itself has a responsibility to focus its efforts on market and product development.  Supported by Government, the Irish dairy sector has succeeded in positioning itself as a major international player, and we have seen industry announcements in relation to the development of supply arrangements between Irish companies and multi-national players in third countries, and the development of value added products which can maximise the value of our dairy output. <\/p><p>  At farm level my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has been working with, and will continue to work towards helping the industry prepare for this move to a quota free environment. A range of supports have been provided to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to reduce costs and improve efficiency at farm level. Such supports include the Dairy Efficiency Programme, which has facilitated a significant increase in Discussion Group participation, and the Dairy Equipment Scheme, which provides grant aid for milking machines, cooling equipment and other related ancillary equipment.<\/p><p>  Taking all this into account, I am confident that the collaborative efforts of Government, the processing industry and the producers will ensure a thriving and sustainable dairy sector that can use the opportunity afforded by the abolition of quotas to fully leverage the natural advantage of Ireland&rsquo;s grass-based production system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRAA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1169,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 476 and 477 answered with Question No. 470.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Exports","counter":1170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRAA01750"},{"type":"question","counter":1171,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[39835\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRAA01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the degree to which potential new markets for beef, lamb and pig meat, in the EU and globally have been identified; the extent to which any such markets can be accessed in the short and medium term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1172,"content":"<p><b>Beef<\/b><\/p><p>  Over the past decade, the profile of Irish beef exports has changed from reliance on volatile international markets to targeting higher-value consumer markets in the UK and Continental Europe. While international markets provide valuable options for Irish traders, the preponderance of Irish beef exports consists of chilled boneless product destined for other EU member states. According to Bord Bia estimates, the UK accounted for 52% of total export volumes in 2012 with virtually all the remainder going to Continental Europe where the main destinations (in order of importance) were France, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden and Spain. <\/p><p>  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across EU markets. This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia's differentiation and premiumisation strategy which focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality. Among Bord Bia's key initiatives this year is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of its Origin Green initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink. Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop, and commit to, sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.<\/p><p>  Recent data from the British Cattle Movement Service indicates that calf registrations in Great Britain in the first half of the year were 5% lower than in the same period in 2012. Partly resulting from a decline in the suckler beef breeding herd, non-dairy calf registrations were 7% down year on year. This downward trend will impact on future production of high-quality beef and signals that cattle availability is likely to remain constrained in the medium-term creating potential opportunities for Irish exporters.<\/p><p>  Regarding the EU market situation, tight supplies and firm prices have attracted more imports to compete with domestic production. Commission data shows that overall beef and veal production for the first 6 months of 2013 was 5% down compared to the corresponding period in 2012. Imports for the period January to July 2013 were 8% up with Brazil, Uruguay and Australia shipping substantially higher volumes than last year. Future export performance will depend on economic developments, including consumer demand and price competitiveness, in our principal markets.<\/p><p><b>Pigmeat<\/b><\/p><p>  Whilst the UK, as the largest single destination, and Continental Europe together account for the majority of pigmeat exports, there has been a continued shift in recent years towards Third Country markets for pigmeat. This differs from developments in other meats, particularly beef.  Approximately one-third of Irish pigmeat export volumes are destined for international markets, with China, the USA and Russia accounting for the majority of this trade. This trend has continued upwards in recent years as markets outside of the European Union become more attractive to exporters. The value of exports was in excess of &euro;500 million in 2012 and this value has increased by 9% in the first half of 2013.<\/p><p><b>Sheepmeat<\/b><\/p><p>  Irish sheep processors have made significant ground in growing exports into a number of key European markets such as Belgium, Germany and Sweden.  These high potential markets are delivering a higher-value return and interest in the Irish lamb offering is growing as New Zealand lamb has become less available.  Overall, exports of Irish sheepmeat for the first 7 months of the year stood at almost 24,000 tonnes, equivalent to a 4% increase on the same period last year.<\/p><p><b>International Markets<\/b><\/p><p>  I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets for beef, lamb and pigmeat, raising the profile of Ireland and guaranteeing confidence in Irish production and control systems; this provides a platform for long-term trading relationships into the future.  Since my appointment, I have led trade missions to China, the US and Algeria. I will shortly lead a trade mission to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. My Department continues to engage on market access issues with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies' personnel. <\/p><p>  These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing agreement to import from authorities in Singapore, Egypt and Iran which allow the import of Irish beef; with Singapore, South Africa, UAE, Canada and the Russian Federation-Customs Union for the import of Irish sheepmeat and with Australia and Serbia for the import of Irish pork.  There is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus is to enable Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1173,"content":"<p>Question No. 479 answered with Question No. 475.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Industry Development","counter":1174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRAA02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1175,"qnumday":480,"qnumall":"[39837\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRAA02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he and his Department expect to be able to capitalise on the expansion of the agri-food sector with a view to maximising opportunities for economic recovery having particular regard to the success to date in the area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1176,"content":"<p>I am confident that the industry developed targets set out in Food Harvest 2020, our comprehensive plan for the development of the sector, are achievable and can be met.

The 2013 Fisheries Impact Assessment which I presented to the Oireachtas late last year acknowledges that while many stocks in which the Irish fleet have an interest are not in a healthy biological state, there has been an improvement in 2012 on the state of the resource base in relation to pressure and state indicators. Of the 59 stocks in which Ireland has a share of the EU TAC, 42% are now fished below FMSY compared to 36% in 2011. The state of the resource base in terms of SSB in relation to biomass trigger points has also improved, with 34% above Btrigger  , an increase of 8% on last year. The number of depleted stocks has declined from 12 to 8 and now 14% of stocks are assessed to be depleted.  <\/p><p>  A Communication from the EU Commission concerning fishing opportunities for 2013 stated that in the Atlantic and nearby areas, the proportion of overfished stocks has fallen almost by half, down to around 47% from 94% in 2004.  The new Common Fisheries Policy reform agreement, negotiated to completion under the Irish Presidency will mean real meaningful reform to how EU waters are fished in the future. The agreement is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters, utilising best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas in the future.<\/p><p>  A practical and phased discards policy is being introduced where in early years of implementation, TACs and quotas will be set to take account of current levels of discards, which should see quotas increase over time.  This means that fishermen will have time to adjust and implement changes that will allow for the avoidance of non target species where there are particular problems with the relevant by-catch (such as that the stock is overfished and needs to be allowed to rebuild).   <\/p><p>  Setting fishing levels on the basis of the MSY Principle (Maximum Sustainable Yield) will lead to increased fish stocks and ultimately to higher quotas for Irish fishermen over time. It will end the practice of widespread overfishing and mean a more viable fishing industry for the longer term. Setting annual fishing quotas respecting best scientific advice will inevitably lead to increased fish stocks and more sustainable fishing patterns over time.<\/p><p>  Technical measures are being introduced to avoid and minimise catches of juvenile fish and the reforms contain a commitment to continue and further strengthen conservation measures in the biologically sensitive area off the South and West coast of Ireland (new Irish box). The commitment to develop and strengthen biologically sensitive areas, with spawning grounds and high populations of juvenile fish will also protect the livelihoods of coastal communities by ensuring that fish are allowed to grow to maturity, are more plentiful and fished in a environmentally responsible manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRAA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cereal Sector","counter":1194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRBB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1195,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[39844\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRBB00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he is satisfied in respect of the future prospects for the cereal growing sector over the next ten years; and if he will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1196,"content":"<p>The maintenance of an efficient and viable cereals sector in Ireland is clearly very important to the well being of the agrifood industry.  Indigenous production of cereals is of course, an important part of primary agriculture production.  In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector.  Annual cereals production in Ireland has fluctuated around 2 million tonnes in recent years and it is desirable to try and sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals.  According to the CSO Cereals Supply Balance sheet Ireland had 74% self-sufficiency in cereals in 2010\/2011.<\/p><p>  A feature of Irish grain prices over the past seven years has been the significant degree of volatility between years, with Irish grain prices inextricably linked to prices available on international markets.  Prices are linked to world harvest output in any given year, with world prices showing increased volatility due to extreme weather influences and speculation by traders entering the commodities markets.  In recent years, excess world supply of coarse grains and maize has forced down the price for Irish cereals, while reductions in world cereal harvests have created price spikes.<\/p><p>  Teagasc estimates for green prices from 2004 to 2013 demonstrates the volatility of Irish cereal prices over this period.  From 2004 to 2006 the farm gate green price of the main cereals in Ireland (wheat and barley) was relatively stable at just over &euro;100\/tonne.  A reduction in the world harvest in 2007 saw prices peak at &euro;200\/tonne, before falling back to less than &euro;100\/tonne in 2009.  Prices rose steadily in 2010 to &euro;155\/tonne, &euro;165\/tonne in 2011, before peaking again at &euro;200\/tonne in 2012 following a major reduction in world grain supplies due to unfavourable weather conditions in the USA, Australia and Eastern Europe.  Grain prices for 2013 have been falling steadily from the peak of 2012 as world harvest estimates for cereals, and especially maize in the USA, are showing an increased level of output over previous years.  Current green farm-gate prices for barley are in the region of &euro;145\/tonne and &euro;155\/tonne for wheat.  This volatility in prices is likely to become a constant feature of Irish cereal prices in future and grain producers should factor such fluctuations into their planning and marketing strategies.<\/p><p>  My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency of, quality and viability of cereal production.  These services include seed certification, seed testing and recommended list of varieties, research funding through the &lsquo;Stimulus&rsquo; programme, and funding for the quality assurance scheme.  In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers.  The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world.<\/p><p>  Food Harvest 2020 outlined a number of challenges facing the cereal sector in the coming years including price volatility, climatic and disease issues, high input prices, small and fragmented holdings and the cost of rented land.  However, the report also pointed to positive projections for cereal prices as markets are relatively well-balanced and world cereal prices are projected to be higher than in the last decade.  It is known that global grain production is struggling to meet the increasing demand for food, feed and industrial uses.  In addition to a rising global population creating a bigger demand for cereals, an increasing demand for meat is disproportionately increasing grain demand even further.  It is predicted that global demand for cereals will reach 3 billion tonnes by 2025 compared with 2.3 billion tonnes currently.<\/p><p>  Global grain stocks are known to be reducing over time and this should also lead to improved market prospects for Irish cereals.  With the world population projected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, it is vital that the agriculture sector, including the Irish cereal sector, can meet the increased demand for food, not just in the next ten years, but through to 2050.  Signalling an intention to migrate away from the use of food in the production of biofuels, in October last, the European Commission published a proposal that seeks to introduce a 5% ceiling on the use of biofuels derived from sugar, cereals and rapeseed as part of the count towards the EU&rsquo;s 10% target for renewable energy in the transport sector by 2020.  The proposal seeks to encourage future investment in advanced biofuels such as municipal waste and agricultural residues that do not compete directly with food and feed crops.<\/p><p>  Food Harvest 2020 highlighted the importance of optimising yields, tackling high costs and targeting higher priced domestic markets in order to reverse declining production trends and made a number of recommendations on competitiveness, branding and marketing.  Some progress has been made on these recommendations and in recent months the Tillage Stakeholder Group presented their development plan to the Food Harvest High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC).  This plan identified opportunities and was devised to stimulate concerted action by the sector so as to exploit to the maximum the potential identified by the stakeholders.  The HLIC welcomed this report and noted that many of the issues required a strong cross-industry approach if they are to be progressed. They advised that industry should start this process and the group should revert back to the HLIC at a later date on the progress achieved.<\/p><p>  The primary growth in requirement for Irish cereals in the years ahead is likely to be for animal feed given the targets for increased livestock output proposed in Food Harvest 2020.  However, considerable potential also exists in grains for the drink industry such as malting barley and recent significant investments by the large brewing and distilling companies here in Ireland are proof of such potential.  Further, it is envisaged that there will be increased demand for Irish oats milled for human food for the home and export markets and in this context, the success of the Agribusiness sector in securing, long-term contracts with US-based Foods companies to supply milled Irish oats to a premium Irish oatmeal brand in the US market, is particularly welcome.  Production of oats is also declining globally and therefore it is envisaged new export markets will continue to come on stream for Irish oats.  I am confident that demand will be sustained for a strategic supply of native cereals as raw material for our brewing, distilling, flour and oat milling industry and for the expanded livestock and dairy production foreseen in the Food Harvest 2020 report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRBB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Technology Adoption Programme Payments","counter":1197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRBB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1198,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[39845\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRBB00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason payment did not issue to a person in County Galway (details supplied) under the 2012 beef technology and adoption scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I have received a large volume of representations on behalf of the applicants involved and I and my officials have actively been trying to assist those affected.  Following queries I initiated through diplomatic channels the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation has confirmed to the Irish Embassy that new legislation came into force on 3rd July 2013 which requires a child to be on the national adoption database for twelve months before that child is deemed eligible for intercountry adoption and may be placed on an international adoption database.  The previous period was eight months.  I understand the purpose of the amendment is to extend the period during which possibilities for domestic adoption are considered.<\/p><p>  The Adoption Act, 2010, provides for adoptions from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention on adoption and from countries where there is a bilateral agreement in place.  During the drafting of the Act a considered and detailed transitional process to deal with the change from previous legislation to the new Act was put in place.  The transitional measure contained in Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, allows applicants with a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt who had commenced the adoption process at the time of the commencement of the Act to continue with that adoption, from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country.  Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three year period to complete these particular adoptions from non-Hague countries, and must complete the process by the 31st October 2013.  The Adoption Authority has advised that the time period to complete the adoption process in Russia is generally less than a year and a large number of applicants with Section 63 declarations have successfully adopted from Russia during the period of validity of these Section 63 declarations.  The issue that has arisen is that the changes introduced by the Russian authorities mean that a small number of Irish applicants will not be able to conclude their adoption of a Russian child by the 31st October 2013.<\/p><p>  In an effort to assist I have been using diplomatic channels to seek solutions for the applicants involved.  These diplomatic channels have been used to fully outline the difficult situation these applicants have been put in following the change in Russian procedures and to explore possible solutions.  The Irish Ambassador to Russia met with the Deputy Foreign Minister Titov in Moscow on 10th September 2013.  The Ambassador has highlighted the concerns of the specific applicants.  He has also outlined the position and noted our desire for a degree of flexibility in relation to the implementation of the changes recently introduced, which has affected a small number of Irish applicants who were at an advanced stage in the adoption process.<\/p><p>  I have also recently met with the Embassy Attach&eacute; from the Russian Embassy to Dublin who was representing the Russian Ambassador to highlight the current difficulties the sudden change in Russian legislation has created.  This meeting was positive and the Attach&eacute; indicated that officials from the Ministry of Education in Moscow are aware of the issues and are examining them closely.  Amongst the representations I have received is a proposal to amend the Adoption Act, 2010 to address this situation.  As the Act is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Adoption Act, 2010 must be carefully examined.  Issues also arise in confining any such amendment to the cases immediately affected by the recent changes in Russia.  Nevertheless, these legislative issues are receiving consideration by my Department in parallel with the ongoing engagement with the Russian authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRBB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Work Projects Funding","counter":1210,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRBB01250"},{"type":"question","counter":1211,"qnumday":492,"qnumall":"[39460\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRBB01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the discussions her Department has had with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to funding allocations for youth work services in 2014; if her Department highlighted the 30% cuts in funding for youth services since 2008; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1212,"content":"<p>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector.

A key policy output on this theme is the Council Conclusions on <i>Maximising the potential of Youth Policy in addressing the goals of Europe 2020, <\/i>with particular emphasis on youth employment which were adopted by the Council of EU Youth Ministers in May.  Being acutely aware of the huge significance and impact of youth employment, I hosted an international Expert round-table event in Castletown, Co Kildare to examine the issue of Youth Employment, focusing on how both youth policy and youth work practice are addressing youth employment.  This event brought together, for the first time, youth representatives, academics, business leaders, industry, innovators and policy makers on a national and European level, to discuss the contribution of youth work to youth employment.  This two-day event examined a range of key issues, themes and trends relating to youth employment and showcased a range of Irish and European good-practice examples in addressing youth employment and the problem of NEETs.  The central emphasis of this event focused on optimising the youth work sector's response to youth employment. As part of a wider approach, it is clear that youth work offers a significant infrastructure, reach and capacity to play a highly-relevant role in developing young people's skill-sets and competencies and supporting their job-readiness.<\/p><p>  Young people through their engagement in youth work attain specific and transversal skills which enhance employability.  These 'soft' skills include learning to learn, social and civic competence, leadership, communication, teamwork, and entrepreneurship.  These skills actively support young people's participation, development and progression in education, training and employment, in ways that are relevant and applicable to industry and valued and sought after by employers.<\/p><p>  The key output from this Expert Roundtable Event resulted in the <i>Dublin Declaration on the contribution of Youth Work to Youth Employment.<\/i>  This Declaration set out to maximise the contribution, visibility and viability of youth work amongst all stakeholders working with and for young people at European, national and local levels.  It clearly outlines the contribution youth work can make in supporting the employability and employment of young people under a range of principles and actions.  This Declaration has been brought to the highest levels in both Ireland and Europe ensuring greater visibility and recognition of the contribution of youth work to youth employment.<\/p><p>  The outcomes from this Expert Roundtable Event are directly informing our national agenda in addressing youth employment, including the identification of actions for progression by my Department in the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.

The actions include:<\/p><p>- Increasing the qualification requirements for all staff in pre-school services to a minimum standard at FETAC Level 5.<\/p><p>- Improving the quality and curricular supports for pre-school services when implementing the Siolta Framework and Aistear Curriculum.<\/p><p>- Implementing the new National Pre-School Standards.<\/p><p>- Introducing a registration system for all pre-school services.<\/p><p>- Taking steps to make the inspection system more consistent and more robust.<\/p><p>- Publishing inspection reports online.<\/p><p>- Ensuring appropriate action is taken in response to findings of non-compliance.<\/p><p>- Increasing and widening the sanctions which can be taken for non-compliance.<\/p><p>Since July, about 900 pre-school inspection reports have now been published on the Pobal website.<\/p><p>  In July, the Government approved the heads of new legislation to amend the Child Care Act 1991.  This legislation will increase the penalty for an offence under the Act to a maximum Class A fine.  However more significantly, this legislation will provide a statutory basis for registration of pre-school services and will introduce a range of new enforcement powers for Inspectors at pre-prosecution level.  Under the proposed new system, all pre-school services will have to be registered in order to operate. Inspectors will be empowered to specify improvement conditions that a service must comply with; and the threat of removal of registration will be available.  This system will, for the first time, provide for timely and effective regulation and enforcement of standards in pre-school services, backed up by statutory registration.  This legislation is currently being finalised in conjunction with Parliamentary Counsel and it is my intention to bring it before the Oireachtas during the current term.  In addition my Department, in conjunction with the Pre-School Inspectorate, is working to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance to provide greater clarity and consistency of approach in the way inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance as opposed to minor breaches and full compliance.<\/p><p>  New National Quality Standards for pre-school services which will be launched before the end of the year.  These Standards will complement the existing Pre-School Regulations replacing previous explanatory notes; and will set out the quality outcomes and supporting criteria against which inspection under the pre-school regulations will be measured.  Discussions are continuing in the context of Budget 2014 on additional resources for the inspection system.<\/p><p>  I have decided to introduce new qualification requirements for childcare services starting in September 2014.  The current minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a new pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  These requirements will be effective from September 2014 for new services and from September 2015 for existing services.  My Department is currently examining measures to support training for childcare staff in line with the increased qualification requirements.<\/p><p>  Since my appointment as Minister I have consistently highlighted the importance of investing and supporting quality interventions in the early years of children&rsquo;s lives.  There is an increasing body of Irish and International evidence which quantify the benefits of early year&rsquo;s interventions in terms of improving children&rsquo;s outcomes and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the state.  In line with this commitment I announced that I would lead the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s first Early Years Strategy which I indicated should represent an innovative and dynamic blueprint addressing a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education.<\/p><p>  The Early Years Strategy will represent one of three, more detailed strategies under the high-level Children and Young People's Policy Framework is currently being developed by my Department and which is due to be launched later this year.  I appointed an Expert Advisory Group, chaired by Dr. Eilis Hennessy of UCD to advise my Department and I on recommendations for inclusion in the Strategy.  This Group has now completed its work and I have this week received its Report and recommendations which I will publish very shortly.   I wish to thank the members of the group for the dedication and enthusiasm which they have shown and the time they have committed to the work of the group.<\/p><p>  The Expert Advisory Group Report represents a key step in the development of the Early Years Strategy and will provide a very strong foundation for a robust and meaningful Strategy.  I expect the finalised Strategy to be published later this year.  Budget discussions are on-going at present and will determine funding provision for 2014.  I expect the Early Years Strategy to identify opportunities for more effective utilisation of existing resources and funding, as well as priority areas for further investment through funding availability over the life of the Strategy.  The issue of funding to support vetting legislation is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRBB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":1232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRBB02800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Ambulance Service Provision","counter":1231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRBB02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1232,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[39369\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRBB02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the review of the operation of the aeromedical service will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1233,"qnumday":526,"qnumall":"[39370\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for the development of the air ambulance service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1234,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 500 and 526 together.<\/p><p>  The Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) was a joint 12 month pilot project between the National ambulance Service (NAS) and the Air Corps, providing dedicated aeromedical support to the NAS in the west, specifically where land ambulance transit times would not be clinically appropriate.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population.<\/p><p>  It has become clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. <\/p><p>  However, the Government is firmly committed to introducing a universal service within this term. The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the delay in the initial step and the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. <\/p><p>  It has been agreed that a number of alternative options should be set out with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  As part of this work, consideration is being given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation of this universal health service.  A range of options are under consideration with a view to bringing developed proposals to Government over the next few months.<\/p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources totalling &euro;30 million in the two most recent budgets. <\/p><p>  To conclude,this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRCC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":1249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRCC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1250,"qnumday":505,"qnumall":"[39195\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRCC00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the cutbacks in St. Michael's House (details supplied) can be reversed as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

HCAIs represent a major cause of preventable patient harm and increased healthcare costs. <\/p><p>Established as an independent statutory body under the Health Act 2007, the Health Information and Quality Authority's (HIQA) mandate extends across the quality and safety of the public, private and voluntary sectors.  Since late 2012 the Health and Information Quality Authority (HIQA) has been carrying out a monitoring programme against the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs), 41 of which have been completed.   Both I and my Department welcome the publication of HIQA's reports and note the concerns raised in these, and indeed, previous reports about hand hygiene practices particularly among medical staff.  With regard to hand hygiene the findings of the Authority suggest that hand hygiene best practice needs to become more operationally embedded at all levels.  <\/p><p>Achieving a culture of patient safety in which best practice in hand hygiene is embedded requires actions at all levels.  It is the responsibility of management and clinical leadership to make this a priority and ensure that the correct conditions to allow for the improvements in hand hygiene compliance are in place. <\/p><p>It must be emphasised that it is of vital importance that healthcare workers recognise their personal responsibility to protect patients by maintaining their own good hand hygiene.  It is extremely disappointing to note that despite the Health Service Executive's (HSE) initiatives to develop an organisational culture of hand hygiene, a significant number of healthcare staff, including doctors, are still not adhering to the basic principles of hand washing.<\/p><p>I very much support the HSE's ongoing work through its national programme of activity to raise awareness amongst staff, monitor compliance with national standards and to take action to reduce HCAIs in hospitals. A key element of this programme is the HSE's continuing bi-annual hand hygiene audits which occur in both the acute sector and in the long stay area as well.  Additionally, from July of this year it has become mandatory for all staff to receive hand hygiene training as part of staff induction and an education programme every two years is being put in place.  The HSE audits have shown an encouraging improvement in hand hygiene compliance with a most recent figure of 84.3% compliance overall (October 2012). <\/p><p>The Director General of the HSE has instructed that all hospitals act immediately on the following:<\/p><p>- Ensure that a member of the senior management team is responsible for hygiene.  This person must give a report to the facility management team on the facilities performance against the 2006 cleaning manual with a remediation plan and on the facilities performance multimodal hand hygiene plan by the end of 2013.<\/p><p>- Ensure that there is a hygiene programme in place by the end of 2013 which clearly demonstrates the hospital's commitment to hygiene, specifically focusing on patient care equipment, the patient environment and hand hygiene.  The programme should be based on the WHO multimodal framework.<\/p><p>- Ensure that 100% staff have received hand hygiene education and training by June 2014.<\/p><p>Hospitals are to provide monthly reports on progress to the National Director for Acute Services.  The HSE is also working with the main medical professional bodies to address the issue of doctor attitudes and behaviour around hand hygiene. <\/p><p>The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the Department of Health has written to the Chair of the Health and Social Regulatory Forum asking that the Forum consider the matter and submit proposals as to how it might adopt a common approach to raise awareness of hand hygiene in particular and support and reinforce compliance with this very important patient safety issue.  It has also been agreed that the CMO will meet with the Director General of the HSE to discuss the issue of governance in the control and prevention of HCAIs. <\/p><p>I have asked HIQA to provide details of the unannounced inspections by hospital as requested by the Deputy and I will have this information supplied to him as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRCC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1259,"content":"<p>Question No. 508 answered with Question No. 506.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRCC01250"},{"type":"question","counter":1261,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[39209\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRCC01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there are plans to develop a gastroenterology centre at the Mercy University Hospital, Cork; the timeframe for the development and investment being made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1262,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRCC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":1263,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRCC01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1264,"qnumday":510,"qnumall":"[39211\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400056#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will support the case of the person (details supplied) in Dublin 3 with a disability in relation to the cuts to St. Michael&rsquo;s House.

Acute adult asthma guidelines and associated care pathways, treatment protocols and care bundles have been developed for use in all care settings (primary and secondary care levels), in conjunction with other relevant programmes and the Irish College of General Practice (ICGP).  These include:<\/p><p>  - An in-hospital practical asthma education programme for nurses to underpin and support the implementation of the acute adult guidelines; and<\/p><p>  - General management asthma guidelines for use in all healthcare settings especially in primary care.<\/p><p>  The Acute Adult Emergency Guidelines are available through the HSE website.  This user friendly resource will facilitate all healthcare staff in optimising the management of adult patients attending services with an acute asthmatic episode.<\/p><p>  2. Guidelines for acute paediatric asthma have also been completed and should be available soon on the HSE website.

This is a key deliverable of the National Asthma Programme for 2013.

Also in August I announced the appointment of members to the Children's Hospital Group Board (CHGB).  The CHGB will oversee the operational integration of the three existing paediatric hospitals in advance of the move to the new hospital and is also the client for the new hospital, and hence is critically important for the project as a whole.

Data for 2012 is not yet available as it is dependent on the receipt of administrative data which are not filed until 2013 and are not fully available to CSO until 2014. The latest CSO Business Demography returns for 2011 were released on 25 July 2013. The primary purpose of Business Demography is to provide estimates of numbers of enterprises and numbers of persons engaged. The data for Business Demography is based on the CSO Central Business Register. The Business Register is a register of all enterprises that are active in the State. There is no lower size limit, but for practical reasons, Business Demography data is based on enterprises that are registered with the Revenue Commissioners. The first reference year covered is 2006.<\/p><p>Table 1 below contains the number of Persons Engaged in NACE Rev 2 sector 64 (less 64.20, Activities of Holding Companies) <i>&ldquo;Financial service activities excluding activities of holding companies&rdquo;<\/i> (including retail banking), and sector 77.35 <i>&ldquo;Renting and leasing of air transport equipment.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>Persons Engaged includes employees, proprietors and family members. The number of employees is calculated on an annualized equivalent basis for the reference year. The total number of weeks worked by an employee over the course of the year is divided by 52 to get the fraction of their full annual employment. So for example, a person who has worked for 52 weeks in the year will contribute 1 to the employment figures, while a person who has worked 26 weeks of the year will contribute 0.5. No distinction is made between full time and part time employment, so an employee who works on a part time basis for a full year is still counted as 1 employee.<\/p><p>Table1: Number of Persons Engaged in Ireland in selected activities by Sector, 2006-2011<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Number of Persons Engaged<\/th><th>Year<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Sector<\/td><td>2006<\/td><td>2007<\/td><td>2008<\/td><td>2009<\/td><td>2010<\/td><td>2011<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Financial service activities excluding activities of holding companies<\/td><td>45,161<\/td><td>51,812<\/td><td>53,236<\/td><td>50,289<\/td><td>48,369<\/td><td>48,402<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Renting and leasing of air transport equipment<\/td><td>373<\/td><td>511<\/td><td>635<\/td><td>713<\/td><td>754<\/td><td>843<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p>Business Demography figures are based purely on administrative data. This results in some differences with survey based Structural Business Statistics (SBS) releases, like the Census of Industrial Production, Building and Construction Inquiry, and Annual Services Inquiry.<\/p><p>1) Administrative data sources allow better coverage of small enterprises, which do not show up using survey methods.<\/p><p>2) Administrative data counts active Revenue registrations as active enterprises. This generally lines up with the definition of an enterprise in survey areas, but there can be some differences, especially in enterprise groups.<\/p><p>3) Business Demography counts employment data based on P35 employer returns, while other SBS releases measure employment based on survey returns. This is particularly significant for enterprise groups, where the whole group may make one P35 return, which results in all its employees being counted against the overall enterprise group NACE code. Survey based releases may divide this employment across different enterprises, and therefore different NACE codes.<\/p><p>Further information is available from recent CSO Business Statistics releases.<\/p><p>The Business Demography Press Release of 25 July 2013 is available at;<\/p><p><i>http:\/\/www.cso.ie\/en\/releasesandpublications\/er\/bd\/businessdemography2011\/<\/i><\/p><p>The Business in Ireland Release of November 2012 is available at;<\/p><p><i>http:\/\/www.cso.ie\/en\/media\/csoie\/releasespublications\/documents\/multisectoral\/2010\/businessinireland2010.pdf<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400058#WRF02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1098"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Board Remuneration","counter":1553,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400058#WRF02925"},{"type":"question","counter":1554,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[39285\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400058#WRF03000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the full year saving to the Exchequer if all State agency board members' fees, non-commercial State sponsored bodies and commercial semi-State companies, under the aegis of his Department were reduced by 25%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

While the Government is committed to implementing policies which will in the future ensure that no Irish citizen has to endure emigration by economic necessity, we have also been extremely robust in ensuring that those who are emigrating today receive assistance from the Government and Government supported organisations at home and abroad.

Since 2004, Irish groups ranging from those providing front line services to those most at need including the elderly, isolated, vulnerable and new arrivals to those working in the culture and heritage space have received grants of over &euro;100 million under the Programme. At present, we work with almost 200 Irish community organisations in over 20 countries and despite the economic situation, I ensured the ESP budget for 2013 - &euro;11.6 million - remained at the same level as in 2012. <\/p><p>The programme provides extensive funding to organisations that act as first port of call for new emigrants, including the GAA, the London Irish Centre, the Irish Canadian Immigration Centre in Toronto and several similar groups in Australia. We also support a wide range of business and graduate networks around the world.<\/p><p>Among the Irish based organisations who receive ESP funding is Crosscare Migrant Project which offers pre-departure services to Irish citizens considering emigration. Crosscare also provide training to mainstream service providers on emigration and returners' issues and work in conjunction with Irish welfare organisations abroad (many also funded by ESP) and statutory and voluntary service providers in Ireland including the probation service, Salvation Army and Safe Home.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department met with the National Youth Council of Ireland to discuss some of the findings and recommendations from their report with a view to seeing if there are areas the NYCI and the Department might be able to cooperate on in future. <\/p><p>The second strand of our diaspora engagement programme is our partnership with the Global Irish Network, a group of over 300 of the most influential Irish connected business figures drawn from almost 40 countries, which provide invaluable advice, facilitation and practical assistance to the Government and Irish companies.

In addition, since 2005, the Cork- Omdurman partnership was been awarded grant funding of over &euro;200,000 from the Irish Aid Civil Society Fund for capacity building initiatives, including for the training of village midwives in rural areas in newborn resuscitation techniques.  The partnership has shown very encouraging results and is a fine example of a healthcare partnership model in maternity care.<\/p><p>  Preventing and responding to HIV and AIDS and improving health outcomes for women and children will continue to be a priority for the Irish Aid programme.

We will draw in particular, draw more attention to effective prevention, including by addressing inequality and gender-based violence, as part of a coherent approach to the issue.

In its approach to exemptions, the Group considered that the LPT should be centred on the principles of equity, transparency and simplicity.  In terms of these principles, it was considered that a universal liability should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  The Government accepted the recommendations of the Thornhill Group when considering the implementation of the LPT.  Old age pensioners do not have a specific exemption related to age.  They may qualify for one of the exemptions provided for in the legislation, or may be entitled to a deferral based on their income level.  <\/p><p>  The Government accepted the income thresholds recommended by the Thornhill Group for a full deferral, and adapted the income thresholds for a partial deferral so that they are &euro;10,000 rather than &euro;5,000 above the thresholds for a full deferral, thus allowing more persons the potential to avail of the deferral provisions. <\/p><p>  To qualify for a deferral, the residential property must be occupied as a sole or main residence.  The income thresholds for a full deferral will be &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their income will not, &#8220;as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date&#8221; exceed these thresholds in that year.  <\/p><p>  An increased income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.  In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  This deferral option will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress. <\/p><p>  A deferral of up to 50% of the LPT liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;35,000 for married persons\/civil partners\/cohabitants.  A deferral of 50% of the LPT will also be available where gross income does not exceed the above thresholds (&euro;25,000 single, &euro;35,000 couple) as increased by 80% of the gross mortgage interest payments that a liable person expects to make by the end of the year for which the gross income is being estimated. This type of deferral will also be available until 31 December 2017.<\/p><p>  Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred.  Interest of c. 4% per annum will apply to any amounts deferred. The deferred amount, including interest, will attach to the property and will have to be paid before the property is sold or transferred.<\/p><p>  To determine whether deferral applies for 2013, a person is required to estimate on 1 May 2013 what his or her total gross income for 2013 will be. Gross income from all sources consists of total income before any deductions, allowances or reliefs that may be taken off for income tax purposes and includes income that is exempt from income tax and income from the Department of Social Protection but excludes Child Benefit.  <\/p><p>  I appreciate some property owners may find themselves unable to pay LPT but do not qualify for a deferral under the existing legislation.  For this reason, the legislation provides that a person who has entered an insolvency arrangement under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 may apply for deferral of the LPT that is due during the period for which the insolvency arrangement is in effect.  The legislation also provides that a person who suffers both an unexpected and unavoidable significant financial loss or expense, as a result of which he or she is unable to pay their LPT without causing financial hardship, may apply for full or partial deferral.  Claims for this type of deferral will require full disclosure of the person's financial circumstances, supporting documentation and any other information required by Revenue and following an examination of the information provided, Revenue will determine whether deferral should be granted.  The detail of how this type of deferral will operate and the criteria that will be used to determine eligibility are set out in guidelines published by the Revenue Commissioners.  <\/p><p>Details of the deferral arrangements are available on Revenue's website <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.revenue.ie<\/font><\/i>, where the Commissioners have published a useful Guide to Local Property Tax.  <\/p><p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for, or does not wish to avail of, a deferral, phased payment of LPT can be used to assist with budgeting.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that taxpayers have a wide choice of payment options for the LPT from which they can choose the method most suited to their individual circumstances.  There are currently eight options available, including the option to pay the tax through phased cash payments. <\/p><p>  The cash payment option is available through three different approved payment service providers, which are An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.  The appointed service providers have extensive nationwide outlets and can process payment of LPT either in full as a single payment or by phased payments on a weekly or monthly basis as best suits individual needs. Payment via service providers is subject to transaction charges - these are at the discretion of the individual service providers and Revenue has no role in this regard.  I understand An Post charges &euro;1 per transaction; Payzone charges 75 cents per transaction for payments up to &euro;50, &euro;1 per transaction for payments between &euro;50.01 and &euro;100 and &euro;2 per transaction for payments over &euro;100; and Omnivend charges a fee of 4% per transaction.<\/p><p>  Revenue provides two further facilities to make phased payments.  Firstly, since 1 July 2013 payment of LPT can be made by way of deduction at source from employment, occupational pension income or from certain payments made by the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This option does not incur any fees or charges and facilitates payment of LPT in even amounts across the year.  Secondly, phased payments can be made by way of direct debit from the property owner's current account in a bank or other financial institution, including a credit union.  Direct debit deductions commenced from 15 July 2013 and are deducted on the 15th day of each month.  Normal direct debit fees charged by financial institutions apply to these payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400059#WRG03000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Ratings","counter":1606,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400059#WRG03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1607,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[39173\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400059#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the manner in which lending institutes and the Irish Credit Bureau report and record will be reformed in view of the high volume of restructuring of debt taking place and the five year impact that this has on a person's credit rating; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

By including provisions relating to access to data and security measures as well as provisions to help to deal with identity theft, this legislation should inspire confidence in businesses and in the consumer.<\/p><p>  - The legislation will extend the role of the Data Protection Commissioner to deal with complaints from micro enterprises and SMEs (with a turnover of less than &euro;3m) in respect of their data held on the Credit Register. <\/p><p>  - The legislation also extends to loans acquired or issued by NAMA and to loans issued by local authorities.<\/p><p>  - In line with international norms, it provides for a retention period of 5 years in relation to credit information with respect to debts from the day on which it is entered on the Register. The Bill provides for the retention of information for a period of 6 months in relation to credit applications from the day it is entered on the Register. Anonymised information may be retained indefinitely.<\/p><p>  The new Bill and oversight by the Central Bank will provide the statutory framework for a robust and well regulated credit reporting system for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400059#WRG03200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Debt","counter":1609,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400059#WRG03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1610,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[39201\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400059#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of funding each bank has received for the purpose of dealing with distressed family mortgages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":1611,"content":"<p>In early 2011, as part of the agreement with the External Partners, the Central Bank commissioned a detailed and data-driven evaluation of the possible loan losses that would be incurred by the banks in a severe, but not utterly implausible, stress scenario.

I also referred to a study by the European Commission (<i>Taxation Trends in the EU 2011<\/i>), which indicates Ireland has an effective corporate tax rate which is close to or indeed higher than the statutory 12.5% rate (this is likely because of the 25% rate that applies generally to non-trading income).<\/p><p>I have been clear that my Department does not take ownership of these reports, but they do indicate that the 'effective' rate of tax paid by companies in Ireland is close to the headline rate of 12.5%.<\/p><p>  Some other countries have a high headline rate of corporation tax which is then supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs which reduce the overall rate of tax paid.  By contrast, the approach in Ireland is transparent: we have a competitive headline rate of corporation tax which is applied to a broad base.<\/p><p>  We therefore have only a small number of tax incentives in Ireland, and we make sure that those we do have are specifically targeted.  They are focussed firstly, on the creation of additional employment as is consistent with current Government policy, and secondly on areas of innovation with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.  The small number of reliefs we have include, for example, the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit and the 3-year exemption from corporation tax for start-up companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400061#WRJ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":1689,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400061#WRJ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1690,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[39503\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400061#WRJ02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason VAT could not be waived in respect of a service (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":1691,"content":"<p>The application of VAT is determined by the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.

This was done at a time when rates in the deposit market generally were coming down, and with the objective of remaining competitive while not incurring interest costs above the levels generally prevailing in the market on Government borrowings.  This would mean that the future interest payments from State Savings products will be lower, which in turn means the yield from imposing DIRT on State Savings would be less than would be suggested by applying the DIRT rate to the interest paid in 2012.

There are constant flows into and out of the Exchequer account and all  moneys  within  it are fungible.  The Government must ensure through its management of expenditure, tax and non-tax receipts and borrowings that there are prudent and adequate balances in the Exchequer account at all times. This also provides investors with the assurance they require that they will be repaid upon the redemption of debt.   For small open economies such as Ireland, budgetary aggregates are generally more susceptible to the negative effects of external  and  internal  shocks.  In general terms  the overall  level  of cash reserves held depends on the State's  risk appetite in relation to such shocks. Particular factors which arise in that context include the international economic situation, the State's debt maturity profile and the projected pattern of Exchequer receipts and expenditure. In Ireland, where we are seeking to achieve sustainable access to the debt markets while still running a significant budget deficit, the need to hold appropriate cash balances as we emerge from the EU\/IMF programme is paramount. In line with this, the Troika's funding projections for Ireland envisage sufficient cash in hand as at the end of the programme in December 2013 to cover the Exchequer's full needs for the calendar year 2014.  <\/p><p>  The April 2013 <i>Stability Programme Update<\/i>   forecasts estimated  the cumulative Exchequer deficit over the years 2013-2015 at some &euro;25 billion, with the 2014 deficit estimated at just under &euro;9 billion.  In fact with 40% of the 2014 EBR forecasted to accrue in the first quarter along with the significant bond redemption of &euro;6.85 billion in January 2014, much of the prefunded cash balances will be utilised in the first 3 months of 2014. Indeed  visibility  as  to  our  2014  funding  is essential  if  Ireland is to  successfully  exit  the programme on schedule.<\/p><p>  Decisions on the level of cash reserves take account of various factors in addition to the cost of maintaining such reserves. These factors include the potential risks of not maintaining an adequate and prudent cash balance, including the risk that the Exchequer would be unable to meet its obligations and that market funding rates for Ireland would therefore be higher than would otherwise be the case due to the perception that the State had a precarious liquidity position. <\/p><p>  The State earns a return on these cash balances and deposits, which the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) manages in a prudent manner consistent with minimising risk and always having sufficient cash on hand to cover any volatility which might arise.  I am informed by the NTMA that they have calculated that, during 2013,  based on bond issuance yields and the cost of funding under the EU-IMF Programme, the net interest differential (cost) on the cash balances held is in the region of 2.7% which equates to about &euro;2.2 million per month for each &euro;1 billion borrowed.

This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged.

","asker":"1005","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":1745,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 to 214, inclusive, together. \t<\/p><p>  The VAT rating of goods and services is governed by the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply. The VAT Directive generally provides that supplies of goods and services should be subject to VAT at the standard rate, which in Ireland is 23%. Regarding reduced rates of VAT, the VAT Directive is restrictive in relation to the application of such rates, whereby Member States may apply up to two reduced rates of VAT of between 5% and 15% but only to specific goods and services set out in Annex III of that Directive.  In addition, Member States may retain a zero rate of VAT, or a rate of VAT less than 5%, on goods and services where that rate applied to those goods and services on 1 January 1991.  However, no new activity can apply at those rates, and once removed activity cannot be reinstated at those rates.  The VAT Directive also allows the continuation of a reduced rate on goods and services not listed in Annex III, where they carried a reduced rate on 1 January 1991, however, the Directive requires that a reduced rate of at least 12% apply to those goods and services.<\/p><p>  In general, the VAT rates applying to the goods and services referred to by the Deputy are a result of these EU VAT rules. However, I would draw to the Deputy&rsquo;s attention that catheters used for use solely or principally with urinary drainage kits or colostomy\/ostomy devices apply at the zero rate of VAT.  In addition, while solar panels apply at the 23% standard rate, Irish and EU law provide that where the installation of a solar panel accounts for at least one third of the cost of the supply, then the 13.5% reduced VAT rate can be applied.  In relation to the hire of a limousine with a driver, this service is exempt from VAT on the basis of a derogation from EU VAT law, where Ireland applies a VAT exemption to the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage. Furthermore, the EU VAT Directive contains detailed rules regarding the VAT treatment of investment gold in order to avoid VAT fraud, which is why the supply of gold is exempt from VAT. <\/p><p>  In general, Ireland applies a reduced VAT rate and zero rate of VAT to a far greater range of goods and services than other EU Member States.  In this regard, Ireland already applies the zero rate of VAT to basic foods, and the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% applies to most services, while tourist related services currently apply at the 9% rate. In addition, the 23% standard rate applies to most luxury goods.  In this context, while there is generally scope to apply a higher rate of VAT to many goods and service, there is very little scope to do the reverse.<\/p><p>  With regard to undertaking a comprehensive review of the different rates of VAT that are applied to different product types, the VAT system and its structure are reviewed on an annual basis in the lead up to the Budget, bearing in mind the constraints of the EU VAT Directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400062#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Promissory Note Issues","counter":1746,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400062#WRK02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1747,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[39688\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400062#WRK02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the first of the promissory notes bonds of &euro;500 million has been sold and if not, if he will instruct the Central Bank of Ireland to put a stay an any such sale until after the legality or otherwise of the original promissory notes has been established in court.

There are currently eight separate options available, including the option to pay the tax through phased cash payments from 1 July 2013 to the end of the year.    The cash payment option is available through three different approved payment service providers, which are An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.  The appointed service providers have extensive nationwide outlets and can process payment of LPT either in full as a single payment or by phased payments on a weekly or monthly basis as best suits individual needs. The imposition of transaction charges is at the discretion of the individual service providers and Revenue has no role in this regard.  I understand An Post charges &euro;1 per transaction; Payzone charges 75 cents per transaction for payments up to &euro;50, &euro;1 per transaction for payments between &euro;50.01 and &euro;100 and &euro;2 per transaction for payments over &euro;100; and Omnivend charges a fee of 4% per transaction.<\/p><p>  Revenue provides two further facilities to make phased payments.  Firstly, since 1 July 2013 payment of LPT can be made by way of deduction at source from employment, occupational pension income or from certain payments made by the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This option does not incur any fees or charges and facilitates payment of LPT in even amounts across the year in question.  Secondly, phased payments can be made by way of direct debit from the property owner&rsquo;s current account in a bank or other financial institution, including a credit union.  Direct debit deductions commenced from 15 July 2013 and are deducted on the 15 day of each month.

In relation to market abuse, which I understand is both the main focus of the Deputy's question and primary driver of the UK legislative changes referred to, the MAR agreement ensures that the competent authorities can require the handing over of existing recordings of telephone conversations, electronic communications or other data traffic records held by investment firms, credit institutions or other financial institutions.  <\/p><p>  The transposition or implementation date for the MAR has not yet been determined as a technical alignment MiFID II will be required when the negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament have concluded on that file.

Intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected cigarette smuggling operations has already yielded significant results. To date in 2013, Enforcement officers have seized 10.42 million cigarettes in operations carried out in the border counties. In the same period, there have been 6 convictions for selling illegal cigarettes and tobacco in the border area. Financial penalties were imposed by the District Courts in five of these cases and a sentence to community service was imposed in the sixth case.   Revenue is an integrated tax and customs administration and has around 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance. These activities include anti-smuggling, audit, assurance checks, debt management, investigations, prosecutions and anti-avoidance. There are over 200 staff engaged on these activities in the border counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth. Revenue has an enforcement presence at all key strategic locations and enforcement strength at particular locations is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk-assessment basis, or when particular operations are taking place. The Revenue Commissioners assure me that their enforcement resources have been prioritised and are reinforced as necessary for specific operations.<\/p><p>  In line with best practice in tax administration worldwide, Revenue regards the development of information and intelligence as critical to the detection of evasion and smuggling, including cigarette smuggling. Revenue will maintain its approach of seizing illicit cigarettes and prosecuting those who do not comply with the legislation in relation to the illegal importation of cigarettes.  In this regard, if the Deputy has specific intelligence which would be helpful, I&rsquo;m sure the Revenue Commissioners would welcome it.<\/p><p>  Government policy on the reduction in civil service numbers overall applies to the Revenue Commissioners in common with other Departments and agencies.

The underpinning legislation for this measure was contained in the Finance Act 2013, which was passed by the Oireachtas and signed in to law on 27 March 2013.      It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle, the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes. These include long-term payments such as Disablement Benefit, the State Pension, Widows, Invalidity and Blind Pensions, Carers Allowance and the One Parent Family Payment, as well as short term benefits such as Job Seekers Benefit. Treating these payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  <\/p><p>  I am fully aware that some employers do not pay a top up payment to their employees whilst on maternity leave.  However, in such circumstances many mothers will not be subject to income tax on their maternity benefit payments as their personal credits will ensure that no tax arises on the social welfare income itself. Of course, the extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case, depends on the total level of income that the individual or couple concerned has in the relevant tax year or years.  <\/p><p>  I would point out that maternity benefit payments will remain exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI. <\/p><p>  Given the current budgetary constraints, I have no plans to provide an exemption along the lines suggested.

The level of intake to these Colleges has decreased in recent years in light of available resources and factors impacting on demand.  The funding provided to primary providers is set out in the attached tables.  The figures shown for the HEA funded Colleges include amounts provided for courses other than ITE. <br \/>  There are 15 providers of post-primary initial teacher education courses; the majority of these are state-funded institutes of technology\/universities funded by the HEA.  It is not possible to easily extract the funding for the initial teacher education elements provided by these higher education institutes from their overall funding allocations. <br \/>Neither my Department, nor any other State body, currently has a role in regulating the number of students enrolled in institutions providing privately-run courses.<br \/>In relation to the numbers entering teacher education programmes, my Department is keen to ensure that forecasting mechanisms are developed to ensure an adequate supply of teachers with the required qualifications. However, even with the best possible systems in place, securing equilibrium between demand and supply is not an exact science, and is subject to quite a number of variables. Recent developments, such as the EU rules on mutual recognition of qualifications and increased numbers qualifying from privately-run courses, have also meant that supply is more difficult to control and predict. <br \/>I have asked the Teaching Council to advise on this issue.

The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. Therefore it is not possible to give the derogation proposed by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  However, I understand that the European Commission issued guidance in 2010 that identified a range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement including promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards. This guidance stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU Treaty Principles and the Procurement Directives. The EU procurement directives primarily envisage that social considerations may be included as contract performance conditions, provided they are not discriminatory and are included in the contract notice or in the contract documents and relate to the performance of the contract. For example, the EU Directives state that contract performance conditions may be intended to favour on-site vocational training, the employment of people experiencing particular difficulty in achieving integration, the fight against unemployment or the protection of the environment.<\/p><p>  Therefore the use of social clauses in public procurement is limited to instances where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.<\/p><p>  Challenges arise from the need to ensure that: value for money is not adversely affected; additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract.<\/p><p>  The inclusion of social clauses in the procurement process would appear to be most suited to situations where the social benefit could be considered a core requirement and can be directly linked to the contracting authority&rsquo;s policy or strategic plan. Experience in other Member States, would also indicate that social clauses will tend to be used for services and works contracts rather than supply contracts.  A further consideration is the ability of contracting authorities to effectively monitor compliance with the social clause; this may be more difficult where some of the work is to be performed in another Member State.<\/p><p>  Social Clauses are currently being piloted under the Devolved Schools Build Programme Design and Build Framework, which is being procured and delivered by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The Government Contracts Committee for Construction (GCCC) earlier this year approved the pilot initiative to be included in the NDFA Devolved Schools Programme.  Currently 3 bundles are out to tender, which consist of a mix of new builds, extensions and some remedial works to existing schools both at a primary and post primary level.  The projects will be constructed using the public works contract for Building Works designed by the Contractor.  A clause has been included in the contract which requires that 10% of the person weeks worked on the contract be undertaken by individuals recruited from the ranks of the long-term unemployed.  There is also a requirement for 2.5% of the person weeks on the contract are undertaken by apprentices. The contractor&rsquo;s compliance with this clause will be carefully monitored in accordance with the terms set out in the contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400066#WRO01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":1935,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400066#WRO01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1936,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[39219\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400066#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will confirm, in respect of the alleged defrauding of EU grants which had been the subject of a report to the DPP in 1999 causing the dismissal of the CEO of an NGO (details supplied), that the Department recorded in March 2002 that there had been no irregularities.

The level of payment is higher where a person who has been unemployed for a longer period is recruited and retained. <\/p><p>  Up to Friday 20th September 2013, the Department had received and processed applications from 1,121 employers.  Over the same period, applications from 2,125 jobseekers had been received.  Of these, 1,577 applications have been deemed eligible with 1,029 qualifying on the basis of being 24 months unemployed and, therefore, attracting a payment to an employer of &euro;10,000 paid over two years.  The remaining 548 applications are eligible for a payment of &euro;7,500 over two years, having been unemployed for between 12 and 24 months.<\/p><p>  At present, 400 eligible employers and eligible jobseekers have been matched.  Of these, 250 employment contracts commenced in July and August and grant payments in respect of 236 cases will be made before the end of September.

His mass mobilisation of the Irish people with a view to the peaceful advancement of their cause through the parliamentary process was an inspirational template followed by many in later years. Not only 'The Liberator' to his people, O'Connell was also a leading figure in the development of democracy and human rights in Europe and beyond.  The vision and achievements of Daniel O'Connell distinguish him as one the greatest Irishmen and I hold him in enormous personal regard.

Working with Glasnevin Trust, I was a partner in the introduction some years ago of an annual commemoration at the O'Connell mausoleum each May.  Supported by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the County Mayor of Kerry, the O'Connell Schools, the O'Connell family and many others &ndash; including the British Embassy - this annual occasion has grown to include a Memorial Mass in the Church of St Andrew at Westland Row, Dublin 2 (of which O'Connell was a benefactor), and a Memorial Lecture organised by Glasnevin Trust on a topical theme. As the coming year is the bi-centenary of the birth of Thomas Davis, the programme will consider the relationship between O'Connell and the Young Ireland movement.<\/p><p>  I have also been working with the Office of Public Works in relation to events at Derrynane, Co Kerry, to promote the consciousness of O'Connell.  A special event there in September 2012 considered the European perspective on O'Connell and his significant influence on the African-American, Frederick Douglass.<\/p><p>  In the absence of any framework or tradition for the official designation of National Memorial Days in respect of Irish persons of historic achievement and renown, I welcome the commitment that brings people together to organise such commemorations and consideration of O'Connell.

The plan outlined the main management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement to the sea. The four main management actions were:<\/p><p>- a cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market;<\/p><p>-  mitigation of the impact of hydropower, including a comprehensive trap and transport plan to be funded by the ESB;<\/p><p>-  ensuring upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers; and<\/p><p>-  improvement of water quality.<\/p><p>  I can advise that the overall requirement and objective is to provide, with high probability, a long-term 40% escapement to the sea of the biomass of silver eel, relative to pristine conditions (i.e. if the stock had been completely free of man-made influences including commercial fishing).<\/p><p>  The scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Group does not support any assertion that &ldquo;stocks are above conservation limits&rdquo;. In 2011, the status of the European Eel in Ireland was defined by the United Nations as critically endangered. <\/p><p>  The ICES advice is that the eel stock continues to decline and urgent action is needed. ICES advice is that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pollution) should be reduced to as close to zero as possible until there is clear evidence that both recruitment and the adult stock are increasing. In 2011, glass eel recruitment fell to 5% of their 1960-1979 level in the Atlantic region and less than 1% in the North Sea area, and showed no sign of recovery.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, recruitment has been declining at many monitoring sites since the mid-1980s. In the 2000-2011 period, the glass eel catch in the Shannon was at 2% of the pre-1980 numbers. In summary, recruitment of glass eels and elvers remained extremely low during the 2009 to 2011 period. It is anticipated that there will be a considerable decline in silver eel production, as indicated by recruitment history, yellow eel stock indicators and modelled projections for index stocks. <\/p><p>  In 2012, as required by the EU, a review of the management of Eel in Ireland was undertaken. This process included a robust public consultation during which many issues were raised and considered. Full details of the outputs of the public consultation are available on the IFI web site. The European Commission will report on the review of all EMPs, including Ireland. <\/p><p>  While I recognize fully the difficulty facing eel fishermen, the review of scientific and management advice and inputs from the public consultation informed a decision to continue with the cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market for the period from 2012 to 2015. Ireland&rsquo;s EMP will be reviewed again in 2015. <\/p><p>  It is up to each jurisdiction, including the UK, to ensure that they are achieving 40% escapement of silver eel biomass relative to pristine conditions. As already advised the review by the European Commission will evaluate all management plans including those of the UK. <\/p><p>  With regard to the Waterford region, I am advised that a survey of eel stocks was carried out in the Waterford estuary in 2009 and 2011 as part of surveys of transitional or estuarine waters under Ireland&rsquo;s EMP. The highest catch per unit effort values were recorded in the transitional waters of the Barrow\/Nore\/Suir. <\/p><p>  I am advised by IFI that low recapture of tagged eels most likely indicate high levels of movement within these transitional waters and make population estimation difficult. The current data make it very challenging to provide an estimate of silver eel escapement\/production for such a large transitional water body.<\/p><p>   Due to the difficulties in obtaining density estimates for eels in large water bodies and the migratory habits of eels moving upstream into the rivers and\/or leaving the transitional water as silver eel, estimating silver eel escapement\/production for transitional waters remains extremely challenging. I am advised by IFI that telemetry eel tagging studies undertaken in 2012, and continuing in 2013, will assist in giving a clearer indication of the movement habits of eels in estuaries and improve population density estimates. <\/p><p>  Given the challenges outlined above, the precautionary approach was also adopted, based on ICES advice and in accordance with the recommendations of the National Eel Working Group and the eel fishery in transitional and tidal waters was also ceased.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400072#WRU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":2183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400072#WRU02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Priory Hall Development","counter":2182,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400072#WRU02000"},{"type":"question","counter":2183,"qnumday":375,"qnumall":"[39158\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400072#WRU02100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if and when Mr. Justice Finnegan ceased to conduct the resolution process in relation to Priory Hall, Dublin 13; the reason a possible conclusion of the Priory Hall resolution process was not indicated in reply in this Deputy's earlier questions.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigns the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the water metering programme. It is a matter for Irish Water to comply with all national and European legislation in the discharge of its functions.      <\/p><p>  The installation programme commenced in August 2013 and will be implemented nationally as quickly as possible. The approach to procurement has been structured by Irish Water to ensure that there are sufficient boundary boxes, meters and installation contracts available for deployment to allow for the ramping up of the programme above the initial level once work is underway. It is important that all of these works are carried out safely and to a high quality standard with the minimum disruption and I expect that Irish Water will monitor and supervise all works accordingly.<\/p><p>  Responsibility for the administration of my Department's Rural Water Programme, under which funding is provided towards the capital costs of group water schemes, and of the subsidy scheme under which funding is provided towards the operational costs of group water schemes, has been devolved to local authorities since 1997.  My Department will remain responsible for the overall policy and funding of the non-public water sector, including the group water sector.  Over the past decade, substantial improvements have been made in the group water sector, reflected in improved infrastructure and management and leading to greater compliance with drinking water standards.  This has been accomplished through a partnership approach between my Department, the local authorities and the group water sector itself, with the important involvement of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.<i> This co-operative approach will be maintained as the reform of water services provision is progressed.<\/i><\/p><p>  Some group water schemes currently purchase water from water services authorities.  In such cases the distribution network remains under the control of the group scheme.

However, seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion.  In the interest of fairness and equity, Garda vetting applications are processed in chronological order based on the date of receipt in the GCVU and all organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.  <\/p><p>  It is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and I have given this matter particular priority. In that regard I have been actively engaged with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 134 whole-time equivalent staff (130 civilians and 4 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013. Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU. This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170 which, when compared to the average staff allocation of 78 at the Unit over the past two and a half years, represents an increase of 117%.<\/p><p>  Development of an e-Vetting solution is underway.

The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place in the fourth quarter of 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400075#WRX02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Personal Insolvency Act","counter":2341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400075#WRX02950"},{"type":"question","counter":2342,"qnumday":433,"qnumall":"[39450\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400075#WRX03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the bankruptcy element of the Personal Insolvency Act will commence; the reason for the delay in implementing this section; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2343,"content":"<p>The commencement of the reforms of bankruptcy legislation contained in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 and the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 are contingent on the making of the relevant rules of Court which are currently awaited.

Plainly, I could not comment in any way on issues arising in another jurisdiction other than to note that Ireland does not have an Immigration Removal Centre and that residents in RIA centres are free to come and go as they please. In relation to any allegations of sexual assault in asylum accommodation centres in this jurisdiction I would refer the Deputy to the answer I gave to D&aacute;il Question no. 923 on 16 July, 2013 on the same subject.<\/p><p>  Any action of a criminal nature brought to the attention of RIA would immediately be referred to the Garda&iacute;. RIA takes the protection of its residents very seriously and already has in place a number of policies and procedures to ensure that they do not suffer acts of sexual harassment or assault or misbehaviour of any kind.<\/p><p>  Firstly, RIA's House Rules and Procedures set out the type and standard of service that an asylum seeker should expect whilst residing in direct provision accommodation. The Rules set out the entitlements and obligations placed on centre management and on residents and, in the event that these aren't being met, a complaints procedure to be invoked by either party. This complaints system is considered by RIA to be broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Office of the Ombudsman for &lsquo;internal complaints systems&rsquo;.  Sexual harassment, by any party, is specified as being unacceptable behaviour in respect of which the complaints procedure can be invoked.<\/p><p>  Secondly, over and above the House Rules themselves, the interests of asylum seekers are protected through regular 'clinics' in centres where residents can speak directly to RIA headquarters staff without local centre management being present.  Allegations of improper behaviour by any party could be reported in that context and acted upon immediately.<\/p><p>  Thirdly, RIA has a Code of Practice for persons working in accommodation centres which specifically prohibits sexual harassment.<\/p><p>  Fourthly,  RIA has a fully staffed Child Protection and Welfare section and has a Child Protection Policy based on the HSE&rsquo;s Children First -National Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children. These guidelines were developed in order to assist people identifying and reporting child abuse and welfare concerns. Staff of centres are trained to recognise abuse and how it should be reported and each RIA accommodation centre has a designated Child Protection officer.  A draft revised Child Protection Policy designed to be even more transparent and accessible is currently with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for observations.<\/p><p>  Finally, along with Cosc (the National Organisation for the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender based violence) RIA has been engaged in a working group with a number of non - governmental organisations including Akidwa and the Rape Crisis Centre to develop a RIA policy around incidences of domestic, sexual and gender based violence and harassment within its centres.  The UNHCR has also been involved and has made suggestions from its perspective.<\/p><p>  The working group is now an advanced stage of deliberation and it is expected that a policy will finally be agreed in the course of the next few weeks.  A training programme for staff and residents will follow from agreement on this policy. In advance of this, the working group has approved an information poster which has already been distributed to all RIA centres. These posters - available in five languages including English - provide information on accessing professional help if residents have suffered or are suffering from domestic, sexual or gender based violence or harassment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400076#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drugs Crime","counter":2360,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400076#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2361,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[39741\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400076#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the advertising and sale of certain drugs (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2362,"content":"<p>The emergence of new psychoactive substances specifically designed to circumvent drug controls has been a matter of particular concern in recent years both here in Ireland and at international level.  In Ireland this trend became particularly evident in the rapid growth in headshop outlets during the period 2009 to 2010.  The prevalence of these substances in Ireland was the subject of a report published in July 2011 by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol (NACDA) entitled \"An Overview of New Psychoactive Substances and the outlets supplying them\".<\/p><p>  In tackling the problem, a number of measures were introduced in this jurisdiction. These measures included education and awareness raising initiatives informing the public and particularly our young people of the potential dangers of the use of substances which were on sale in headshops or available online. In addition, a number of specific legislative measures have been introduced to target the trade in these substances.<\/p><p>  In particular, the Department of Health, in the period 2010 to 2011, brought in excess of 250 such substances under the controls of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 and 1984. This legislation prohibits the unauthorised sale and\/or supply of all controlled substances, including any advertising of such trade and also prohibits any unauthorised importation of controlled substances including where such activity is facilitated by the Internet.<\/p><p>  I am further advised that the Department of Health are currently finalising regulations which will  bring a number of further such unregulated substances under the controls of that legislation.<\/p><p>  In addition, the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 was brought into effect. This legislation introduced further criminal justice measures targeting the trade in unregulated psychoactive substances. It introduced offences relating to the illegal sale, import and export of such substances in circumstances where a person knows or is reckless as to whether that substance is being acquired or supplied for human consumption. In addition, it introduced a prohibition on the advertising of any such trade including where this may be conducted online.<\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to investigating any breaches of legislation arising from the availability on the internet of products traditionally sold by &lsquo;head shops&rsquo;.

At these meetings, the US Attorney General provided clarity on a number of issues, in particular with regard to the nature of the information collected and processed, i.e. phone numbers, duration of calls etc - but not the content of calls.  He also advised that the data was collected under judicial authority and only where there was a reasonable suspicion of serious crime.<\/p><p>  We cannot ignore the very important fact that there is a recognised need to protect our citizens from terrorist threats and dealing with that does require access to certain data.  I will continue to make the point at international level that in doing so it is necessary to ensure that the information used is properly obtained and subject to appropriate safeguards.  I have previously emphasised the importance of protecting privacy rights and ensuring respect for individual human rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights.

In the interest of fairness and equity, Garda vetting applications are processed in chronological order based on the date of receipt in the GCVU and all organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time-frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.<\/p><p>  It is essential that the GCVU has the resources required to perform this most critical of roles effectively and I have given this matter particular priority. In that regard I have been actively engaged with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. As a result of that engagement, I am pleased to say that the Commissioner has confirmed to me that there are now 134 whole-time equivalent staff (130 civilians and 4 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na) assigned to the GCVU, some 41 of whom have been redeployed from elsewhere in the public service since the end of March 2013. Some of these redeployed staff have only recently completed their training in the vetting process, and the full impact of their work will be seen in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I have also recently received sanction for the redeployment of 40 additional staff to the GCVU. This brings the total number of staff in that service to over 170 which, when compared to the average staff allocation of 78 at the Unit over the past two and a half years, represents an increase of 117%.<\/p><p>  Development of an e-Vetting solution is underway. This will facilitate the processing of all applications in an e-format, thus removing the time-consuming current process of manually managing all applications received . The initial phase of testing this e-vetting system will take place in the fourth quarter of 2013.  When this is achieved, this system will streamline the overall vetting process in this jurisdiction, and further contribute to reductions in processing times for all vetting applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400076#WRY01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Policy","counter":2378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400076#WRY01950"},{"type":"question","counter":2379,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[39822\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400076#WRY02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will sign up to the European Convention on Preventing and Combatting Violence against Women and Domestic Violence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1181","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2380,"content":"<p>Ireland supports, in principle, the aims and terms of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.<\/p><p>  The provisions of the convention and the legislative and administrative arrangements that would be necessary to allow signature and ratification of the convention by Ireland are being examined in conjunction with the government commitment to introduce consolidated and reformed domestic violence legislation to address all aspects of domestic violence, threatened violence and intimidation, in a way that provides protection to victims.

The Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the HSE develops individual comprehensive Care Plans for persons who are potentially victims of human trafficking addressing all of the support services that are required.  My Department also provides funding to two NGO organisations, Ruhama and the Migrant&rsquo;s Rights Centre of Ireland, who work with victims of human trafficking.

A new National Action Plan to cover the period from 2013 to 2016 is currently being drafted and will have regard to recent international evaluations of Ireland's response to human trafficking. These include the Report of the OSCE Special Representative which was published earlier this year, the US Trafficking in Persons (TIPs) Report which was published in June and ranked Ireland Tier 1 (the highest ranking available) for its efforts to combat human trafficking and the detailed Report of the Council of Europe expert group (<i>GRETA<\/i>) which will be available shortly.  In addition to these international reports there will also be a process of consultation with other state agencies and civil society which will significantly inform the direction and content of the new National Action Plan.<\/p><p>The prevention and detection of human trafficking and the protection of its victims has been a policing priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the past number of years and it remains a priority in 2013.

The data from my Department&rsquo;s Animal Identification and Movement system, which is also used to provide data to the CSO, indicates that, as of mid September 2013, suckler cow numbers were 1.107 million or 3.6% down on the previous year. There is also evidence of a 9% reduction in the number of calves born to suckler cows in the year to July 2013 compared to the same period in the previous year, although this comes against the background of increases in such calvings in both 2011 and 2012.<\/p><p>Against this background, the available evidence does not suggest that there has been a drop of 20% in the size of the suckler cow herd. Patterns emerge over several years and it would be premature to draw definitive conclusions solely on the basis of the evidence available for 2013. Despite the drop recorded this year, the size of the suckler herd has remained consistently strong at over one million head, allowing valuable export markets to be developed from the quality beef produced from this herd.  While registrations are subject to cyclical fluctuations, the composition of the national herd, however, is constantly reviewed by my Department so that the necessary structural supports are in place to enable the industry to meet future market requirements.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the ongoing consolidation of the public finances, my Department and the agencies under its remit continue to provide an array of financial and infrastructural supports to underpin production in the beef sector. These include initiatives such as the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP), which is designed to equip beef farmers with the knowledge to improve output and efficiency at farm level. To date, some &euro;5 million has been paid to almost 5,500 farmers in respect of the 2012 BTAP.<\/p><p>Other financial supports include residual payments under the Suckler Cow Scheme, of which approximately &euro;8.4m has been disbursed to date in 2013, and the establishment of the Beef Data Programme (BDP) for which a sum of &euro;10 million has been allocated in respect of 2013-born animals. The BDP retains essential elements from the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme and will assist farmers in improving the genetic quality of their livestock and will maintain a data flow to ICBF that will generate further advances in cattle breeding and, ultimately, in producer profitability. In addition, my Department provides funding to support the work of ICBF in delivering sustainable genetic gain in the national herd.

Under the current draft Rural Development Regulation, my Department must undertake an ex ante evaluation, a public consultation, a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) a needs assessment, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and an appropriate assessment (AA) in developing our Rural Development Programme.

I believe that Europe needs to continue to ensure that the food that it produces is safe and that agricultural methods are environmentally sustainable.  But it is also necessary to ensure that the Union&rsquo;s agriculture sector is competitive, particularly given the importance of the sector as a major exporter and the strong links between the sector and rural development in Europe. <\/p><p>  The CAP provides the framework within which the sustainable development of a competitive and efficient agriculture sector is pursued, as well as the resources to assist in its achievement.  In providing this framework the CAP has underpinned the modernisation of the European agriculture sector, making a vital contribution not only to economic growth in the EU, but also to sustainable, long-term global food security.  The CAP also underpins the socio-economic development of rural areas.  The most recent reform of the CAP is marked by three major advances:<\/p><p>  - First there is a greater emphasis on environmental sustainability through the greening of direct payments and the requirement to support agri-environment measures in rural development programmes.<\/p><p>  - Second, concerted efforts are being made to tackle the problem of generation renewal through new and enhanced supports for young farmers;<\/p><p>  - Third, the phasing out of production quotas for key products such as sugar and milk, backed up by safety-net provisions in cases of severe market disturbance, continues the increased orientation towards the market.<\/p><p>  Overarching these changes is the flexibility that has been allowed to Member States to adapt the policy measures under both the first and second pillar to deal with their own specific challenges within the common policy.  It is my firm belief that these changes amount to a useful and progressive reform of the CAP making it fit for purpose to 2020.

More than 85% of Irish dairy production is exported and Ireland has access for dairy products to over eighty countries worldwide.  Nevertheless I am working with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa and elsewhere.  I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.  On this note I am leading a trade mission to the Gulf States in the near future.<\/p><p>  The ending of the milk quota regime does represent an exceptional opportunity to increase milk output, both in Ireland and in other Member States where milk production forms a significant part of their agricultural output. A Report published by the EU Commission last December on how markets are evolving, as the ending of milk quotas approaches, found that medium and long term prospects for the dairy sector are favourable.  This conclusion is based on population growth projections and interest for Westernisation of diets in emerging economies. The Report did caution, however, that this outlook did not rule out short term market fluctuations.<\/p><p>  Ireland strongly supported the decision to abolish milk quotas with effect from 1 April 2015 on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy sector and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.  I expect the abolition of quotas to facilitate an expansion in the sector and through the Food Harvest 2020 Report the industry has set itself an ambitious target for a 50% increase in milk production by 2020.  For my part I have been working on a number of fronts to prepare the industry for the move to a quota free environment and equip it to respond to the market opportunities arising.<\/p><p>  A key element of this market strategy is to optimise the already positive green image of Ireland in order to create a point of differentiation for Irish dairy products on international markets.  In this context, stakeholders are at present engaged, through Bord Bia, in technical discussions to finalise a dairy sustainability and quality scheme.  At processing level, Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green Programme is providing a vehicle for industry to commit itself to sustainability targets by reducing energy inputs, minimising overall carbon footprint and mitigating the impact on the environment.  This pro-active approach to environmental sustainability has a strong resonance with procurement strategists in the many multi-national food companies who are interested in using Ireland as a source of high quality food ingredients and processed products. <\/p><p>  Of course the industry itself has a responsibility to focus its efforts on market and product development.  Supported by Government, the Irish dairy sector has succeeded in positioning itself as a major international player, and we have seen industry announcements in relation to the development of supply arrangements between Irish companies and multi-national players in third countries, and the development of value added products which can maximise the value of our dairy output. <\/p><p>  At farm level my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has been working with, and will continue to work towards helping the industry prepare for this move to a quota free environment. A range of supports have been provided to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to reduce costs and improve efficiency at farm level. Such supports include the Dairy Efficiency Programme, which has facilitated a significant increase in Discussion Group participation, and the Dairy Equipment Scheme, which provides grant aid for milking machines, cooling equipment and other related ancillary equipment.<\/p><p>  Taking all this into account, I am confident that the collaborative efforts of Government, the processing industry and the producers will ensure a thriving and sustainable dairy sector that can use the opportunity afforded by the abolition of quotas to fully leverage the natural advantage of Ireland&rsquo;s grass-based production system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400078#WRAA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2476,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 476 and 477 answered with Question No. 470.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Exports","counter":2477,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400078#WRAA01750"},{"type":"question","counter":2478,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[39835\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400078#WRAA01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the degree to which potential new markets for beef, lamb and pig meat, in the EU and globally have been identified; the extent to which any such markets can be accessed in the short and medium term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2479,"content":"<p><b>Beef<\/b><\/p><p>  Over the past decade, the profile of Irish beef exports has changed from reliance on volatile international markets to targeting higher-value consumer markets in the UK and Continental Europe. While international markets provide valuable options for Irish traders, the preponderance of Irish beef exports consists of chilled boneless product destined for other EU member states. According to Bord Bia estimates, the UK accounted for 52% of total export volumes in 2012 with virtually all the remainder going to Continental Europe where the main destinations (in order of importance) were France, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden and Spain. <\/p><p>  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across EU markets. This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia's differentiation and premiumisation strategy which focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality. Among Bord Bia's key initiatives this year is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of its Origin Green initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink. Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop, and commit to, sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.<\/p><p>  Recent data from the British Cattle Movement Service indicates that calf registrations in Great Britain in the first half of the year were 5% lower than in the same period in 2012. Partly resulting from a decline in the suckler beef breeding herd, non-dairy calf registrations were 7% down year on year. This downward trend will impact on future production of high-quality beef and signals that cattle availability is likely to remain constrained in the medium-term creating potential opportunities for Irish exporters.<\/p><p>  Regarding the EU market situation, tight supplies and firm prices have attracted more imports to compete with domestic production. Commission data shows that overall beef and veal production for the first 6 months of 2013 was 5% down compared to the corresponding period in 2012. Imports for the period January to July 2013 were 8% up with Brazil, Uruguay and Australia shipping substantially higher volumes than last year. Future export performance will depend on economic developments, including consumer demand and price competitiveness, in our principal markets.<\/p><p><b>Pigmeat<\/b><\/p><p>  Whilst the UK, as the largest single destination, and Continental Europe together account for the majority of pigmeat exports, there has been a continued shift in recent years towards Third Country markets for pigmeat. This differs from developments in other meats, particularly beef.  Approximately one-third of Irish pigmeat export volumes are destined for international markets, with China, the USA and Russia accounting for the majority of this trade. This trend has continued upwards in recent years as markets outside of the European Union become more attractive to exporters. The value of exports was in excess of &euro;500 million in 2012 and this value has increased by 9% in the first half of 2013.<\/p><p><b>Sheepmeat<\/b><\/p><p>  Irish sheep processors have made significant ground in growing exports into a number of key European markets such as Belgium, Germany and Sweden.  These high potential markets are delivering a higher-value return and interest in the Irish lamb offering is growing as New Zealand lamb has become less available.  Overall, exports of Irish sheepmeat for the first 7 months of the year stood at almost 24,000 tonnes, equivalent to a 4% increase on the same period last year.<\/p><p><b>International Markets<\/b><\/p><p>  I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets for beef, lamb and pigmeat, raising the profile of Ireland and guaranteeing confidence in Irish production and control systems; this provides a platform for long-term trading relationships into the future.

The 2013 Fisheries Impact Assessment which I presented to the Oireachtas late last year acknowledges that while many stocks in which the Irish fleet have an interest are not in a healthy biological state, there has been an improvement in 2012 on the state of the resource base in relation to pressure and state indicators. Of the 59 stocks in which Ireland has a share of the EU TAC, 42% are now fished below FMSY compared to 36% in 2011. The state of the resource base in terms of SSB in relation to biomass trigger points has also improved, with 34% above Btrigger  , an increase of 8% on last year. The number of depleted stocks has declined from 12 to 8 and now 14% of stocks are assessed to be depleted.  <\/p><p>  A Communication from the EU Commission concerning fishing opportunities for 2013 stated that in the Atlantic and nearby areas, the proportion of overfished stocks has fallen almost by half, down to around 47% from 94% in 2004.  The new Common Fisheries Policy reform agreement, negotiated to completion under the Irish Presidency will mean real meaningful reform to how EU waters are fished in the future. The agreement is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters, utilising best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas in the future.<\/p><p>  A practical and phased discards policy is being introduced where in early years of implementation, TACs and quotas will be set to take account of current levels of discards, which should see quotas increase over time.  This means that fishermen will have time to adjust and implement changes that will allow for the avoidance of non target species where there are particular problems with the relevant by-catch (such as that the stock is overfished and needs to be allowed to rebuild).   <\/p><p>  Setting fishing levels on the basis of the MSY Principle (Maximum Sustainable Yield) will lead to increased fish stocks and ultimately to higher quotas for Irish fishermen over time. It will end the practice of widespread overfishing and mean a more viable fishing industry for the longer term. Setting annual fishing quotas respecting best scientific advice will inevitably lead to increased fish stocks and more sustainable fishing patterns over time.<\/p><p>  Technical measures are being introduced to avoid and minimise catches of juvenile fish and the reforms contain a commitment to continue and further strengthen conservation measures in the biologically sensitive area off the South and West coast of Ireland (new Irish box).

","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2503,"content":"<p>The maintenance of an efficient and viable cereals sector in Ireland is clearly very important to the well being of the agrifood industry.  Indigenous production of cereals is of course, an important part of primary agriculture production.  In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector.  Annual cereals production in Ireland has fluctuated around 2 million tonnes in recent years and it is desirable to try and sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals.  According to the CSO Cereals Supply Balance sheet Ireland had 74% self-sufficiency in cereals in 2010\/2011.<\/p><p>  A feature of Irish grain prices over the past seven years has been the significant degree of volatility between years, with Irish grain prices inextricably linked to prices available on international markets.  Prices are linked to world harvest output in any given year, with world prices showing increased volatility due to extreme weather influences and speculation by traders entering the commodities markets.  In recent years, excess world supply of coarse grains and maize has forced down the price for Irish cereals, while reductions in world cereal harvests have created price spikes.<\/p><p>  Teagasc estimates for green prices from 2004 to 2013 demonstrates the volatility of Irish cereal prices over this period.  From 2004 to 2006 the farm gate green price of the main cereals in Ireland (wheat and barley) was relatively stable at just over &euro;100\/tonne.  A reduction in the world harvest in 2007 saw prices peak at &euro;200\/tonne, before falling back to less than &euro;100\/tonne in 2009.  Prices rose steadily in 2010 to &euro;155\/tonne, &euro;165\/tonne in 2011, before peaking again at &euro;200\/tonne in 2012 following a major reduction in world grain supplies due to unfavourable weather conditions in the USA, Australia and Eastern Europe.  Grain prices for 2013 have been falling steadily from the peak of 2012 as world harvest estimates for cereals, and especially maize in the USA, are showing an increased level of output over previous years.  Current green farm-gate prices for barley are in the region of &euro;145\/tonne and &euro;155\/tonne for wheat.  This volatility in prices is likely to become a constant feature of Irish cereal prices in future and grain producers should factor such fluctuations into their planning and marketing strategies.<\/p><p>  My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency of, quality and viability of cereal production.  These services include seed certification, seed testing and recommended list of varieties, research funding through the &lsquo;Stimulus&rsquo; programme, and funding for the quality assurance scheme.  In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers.  The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world.<\/p><p>  Food Harvest 2020 outlined a number of challenges facing the cereal sector in the coming years including price volatility, climatic and disease issues, high input prices, small and fragmented holdings and the cost of rented land.  However, the report also pointed to positive projections for cereal prices as markets are relatively well-balanced and world cereal prices are projected to be higher than in the last decade.  It is known that global grain production is struggling to meet the increasing demand for food, feed and industrial uses.  In addition to a rising global population creating a bigger demand for cereals, an increasing demand for meat is disproportionately increasing grain demand even further.  It is predicted that global demand for cereals will reach 3 billion tonnes by 2025 compared with 2.3 billion tonnes currently.<\/p><p>  Global grain stocks are known to be reducing over time and this should also lead to improved market prospects for Irish cereals.  With the world population projected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, it is vital that the agriculture sector, including the Irish cereal sector, can meet the increased demand for food, not just in the next ten years, but through to 2050.  Signalling an intention to migrate away from the use of food in the production of biofuels, in October last, the European Commission published a proposal that seeks to introduce a 5% ceiling on the use of biofuels derived from sugar, cereals and rapeseed as part of the count towards the EU&rsquo;s 10% target for renewable energy in the transport sector by 2020.  The proposal seeks to encourage future investment in advanced biofuels such as municipal waste and agricultural residues that do not compete directly with food and feed crops.<\/p><p>  Food Harvest 2020 highlighted the importance of optimising yields, tackling high costs and targeting higher priced domestic markets in order to reverse declining production trends and made a number of recommendations on competitiveness, branding and marketing.  Some progress has been made on these recommendations and in recent months the Tillage Stakeholder Group presented their development plan to the Food Harvest High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC).  This plan identified opportunities and was devised to stimulate concerted action by the sector so as to exploit to the maximum the potential identified by the stakeholders.  The HLIC welcomed this report and noted that many of the issues required a strong cross-industry approach if they are to be progressed. They advised that industry should start this process and the group should revert back to the HLIC at a later date on the progress achieved.<\/p><p>  The primary growth in requirement for Irish cereals in the years ahead is likely to be for animal feed given the targets for increased livestock output proposed in Food Harvest 2020.  However, considerable potential also exists in grains for the drink industry such as malting barley and recent significant investments by the large brewing and distilling companies here in Ireland are proof of such potential.  Further, it is envisaged that there will be increased demand for Irish oats milled for human food for the home and export markets and in this context, the success of the Agribusiness sector in securing, long-term contracts with US-based Foods companies to supply milled Irish oats to a premium Irish oatmeal brand in the US market, is particularly welcome.  Production of oats is also declining globally and therefore it is envisaged new export markets will continue to come on stream for Irish oats.  I am confident that demand will be sustained for a strategic supply of native cereals as raw material for our brewing, distilling, flour and oat milling industry and for the expanded livestock and dairy production foreseen in the Food Harvest 2020 report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Technology Adoption Programme Payments","counter":2504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":2505,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[39845\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason payment did not issue to a person in County Galway (details supplied) under the 2012 beef technology and adoption scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"953","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2516,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 491 and 497 together.<\/p><p>  I have the utmost concern for the position that the prospective adopters who were close to finalising adoptions from Russia now find themselves in following the recent changes to the Russian adoption process.  I have received a large volume of representations on behalf of the applicants involved and I and my officials have actively been trying to assist those affected.  Following queries I initiated through diplomatic channels the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation has confirmed to the Irish Embassy that new legislation came into force on 3rd July 2013 which requires a child to be on the national adoption database for twelve months before that child is deemed eligible for intercountry adoption and may be placed on an international adoption database.  The previous period was eight months.  I understand the purpose of the amendment is to extend the period during which possibilities for domestic adoption are considered.<\/p><p>  The Adoption Act, 2010, provides for adoptions from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention on adoption and from countries where there is a bilateral agreement in place.  During the drafting of the Act a considered and detailed transitional process to deal with the change from previous legislation to the new Act was put in place.  The transitional measure contained in Section 63 of the Adoption Act, 2010, allows applicants with a valid declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt who had commenced the adoption process at the time of the commencement of the Act to continue with that adoption, from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country.  Such applicants were thus afforded an additional three year period to complete these particular adoptions from non-Hague countries, and must complete the process by the 31st October 2013.  The Adoption Authority has advised that the time period to complete the adoption process in Russia is generally less than a year and a large number of applicants with Section 63 declarations have successfully adopted from Russia during the period of validity of these Section 63 declarations.  The issue that has arisen is that the changes introduced by the Russian authorities mean that a small number of Irish applicants will not be able to conclude their adoption of a Russian child by the 31st October 2013.<\/p><p>  In an effort to assist I have been using diplomatic channels to seek solutions for the applicants involved.  These diplomatic channels have been used to fully outline the difficult situation these applicants have been put in following the change in Russian procedures and to explore possible solutions.  The Irish Ambassador to Russia met with the Deputy Foreign Minister Titov in Moscow on 10th September 2013.  The Ambassador has highlighted the concerns of the specific applicants.  He has also outlined the position and noted our desire for a degree of flexibility in relation to the implementation of the changes recently introduced, which has affected a small number of Irish applicants who were at an advanced stage in the adoption process.<\/p><p>  I have also recently met with the Embassy Attach&eacute; from the Russian Embassy to Dublin who was representing the Russian Ambassador to highlight the current difficulties the sudden change in Russian legislation has created.  This meeting was positive and the Attach&eacute; indicated that officials from the Ministry of Education in Moscow are aware of the issues and are examining them closely.  Amongst the representations I have received is a proposal to amend the Adoption Act, 2010 to address this situation.  As the Act is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Adoption Act, 2010 must be carefully examined.  Issues also arise in confining any such amendment to the cases immediately affected by the recent changes in Russia.  Nevertheless, these legislative issues are receiving consideration by my Department in parallel with the ongoing engagement with the Russian authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Work Projects Funding","counter":2517,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB01250"},{"type":"question","counter":2518,"qnumday":492,"qnumall":"[39460\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the discussions her Department has had with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to funding allocations for youth work services in 2014; if her Department highlighted the 30% cuts in funding for youth services since 2008; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2519,"content":"<p>The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector.

A key policy output on this theme is the Council Conclusions on <i>Maximising the potential of Youth Policy in addressing the goals of Europe 2020, <\/i>with particular emphasis on youth employment which were adopted by the Council of EU Youth Ministers in May.  Being acutely aware of the huge significance and impact of youth employment, I hosted an international Expert round-table event in Castletown, Co Kildare to examine the issue of Youth Employment, focusing on how both youth policy and youth work practice are addressing youth employment.  This event brought together, for the first time, youth representatives, academics, business leaders, industry, innovators and policy makers on a national and European level, to discuss the contribution of youth work to youth employment.  This two-day event examined a range of key issues, themes and trends relating to youth employment and showcased a range of Irish and European good-practice examples in addressing youth employment and the problem of NEETs.  The central emphasis of this event focused on optimising the youth work sector's response to youth employment. As part of a wider approach, it is clear that youth work offers a significant infrastructure, reach and capacity to play a highly-relevant role in developing young people's skill-sets and competencies and supporting their job-readiness.<\/p><p>  Young people through their engagement in youth work attain specific and transversal skills which enhance employability.  These 'soft' skills include learning to learn, social and civic competence, leadership, communication, teamwork, and entrepreneurship.  These skills actively support young people's participation, development and progression in education, training and employment, in ways that are relevant and applicable to industry and valued and sought after by employers.<\/p><p>  The key output from this Expert Roundtable Event resulted in the <i>Dublin Declaration on the contribution of Youth Work to Youth Employment.<\/i>  This Declaration set out to maximise the contribution, visibility and viability of youth work amongst all stakeholders working with and for young people at European, national and local levels.  It clearly outlines the contribution youth work can make in supporting the employability and employment of young people under a range of principles and actions.  This Declaration has been brought to the highest levels in both Ireland and Europe ensuring greater visibility and recognition of the contribution of youth work to youth employment.<\/p><p>  The outcomes from this Expert Roundtable Event are directly informing our national agenda in addressing youth employment, including the identification of actions for progression by my Department in the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs.  It is also in directly informing the work of my Department on the high-level group interdepartmental group on the Implementation of the Youth Guarantee.  My Department is working collaboratively with officials of the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Education and Skills, Department of Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, my Department is currently developing a proposal as to how the youth work sector can contribute to the implementation of the Youth Guarantee.  This proposal is also being directly informed by a mapping of activities within the Youth sector in the areas of employment, employability and entrepreneurship being carried out by my Department at present.  The design and development of this study is being directly informed by key stakeholders in the Youth sector.  I am confident that these developments will ensure that we harness the collective efforts of all key informants in the Youth sector so that we maximise the contribution of this sector to the effective implementation of the Youth Guarantee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":2524,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":2525,"qnumday":494,"qnumall":"[39462\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide details of all the staff in her Department with a breakdown by function and grade; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2526,"content":"<p>My Department is structured across three broad functional areas and the staffing levels at end of August, 2013 were:<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Sum of  Revised WTE<\/th><th><b>-<\/b><\/th><th><b>-<\/b><\/th><th><b>-<\/b><\/th><th>Programme Area<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>General Grade Description<\/td><td><b>Child &amp;amp; Family Support Programme<\/b><\/td><td><b>Sectoral Programmes for Children<\/b><\/td><td><b>Policy &amp;amp; Legislation Programme<\/b><\/td><td><b>Grand Total<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Secretary General<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1.00<\/td><td>1.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Secretary<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1.00<\/td><td>1.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Director<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>2.00<\/td><td>2.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ministerial Staff<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>4.50<\/td><td>4.50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Principal Officer<\/td><td>5.73<\/td><td><\/td><td>6.30<\/td><td>14.03<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal Officer<\/td><td>10.33<\/td><td>2.00<\/td><td>13.00<\/td><td>26.13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officer<\/td><td>10.70<\/td><td>2.80<\/td><td>6.00<\/td><td>23.30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Administrative Officer<\/td><td>2.00<\/td><td>6.60<\/td><td>3.00<\/td><td>5.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Executive Officer<\/td><td>5.73<\/td><td><\/td><td>10.60<\/td><td>28.43<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Staff Officer<\/td><td><\/td><td>12.10<\/td><td><\/td><td>2.10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clerical Officer<\/td><td>4.60<\/td><td>2.10<\/td><td>13.00<\/td><td>25.30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Services Officer<\/td><td><\/td><td>7.70<\/td><td>3.00<\/td><td>3.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Grand Total<\/b><\/td><td>39.09<\/td><td>33.30<\/td><td>63.40<\/td><td>135.79<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Work Projects Funding","counter":2527,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB01950"},{"type":"question","counter":2528,"qnumday":495,"qnumall":"[39463\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when the value for money review of youth work funding will be completed and published; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2529,"content":"<p>A Value for Money and Policy Review on a number of youth schemes in receipt of funding from my Department is currently being carried out.

This legislation will increase the penalty for an offence under the Act to a maximum Class A fine.  However more significantly, this legislation will provide a statutory basis for registration of pre-school services and will introduce a range of new enforcement powers for Inspectors at pre-prosecution level.  Under the proposed new system, all pre-school services will have to be registered in order to operate. Inspectors will be empowered to specify improvement conditions that a service must comply with; and the threat of removal of registration will be available.  This system will, for the first time, provide for timely and effective regulation and enforcement of standards in pre-school services, backed up by statutory registration.  This legislation is currently being finalised in conjunction with Parliamentary Counsel and it is my intention to bring it before the Oireachtas during the current term.  In addition my Department, in conjunction with the Pre-School Inspectorate, is working to develop new protocols on regulatory compliance to provide greater clarity and consistency of approach in the way inspection reports deal with findings of serious non-compliance as opposed to minor breaches and full compliance.<\/p><p>  New National Quality Standards for pre-school services which will be launched before the end of the year.  These Standards will complement the existing Pre-School Regulations replacing previous explanatory notes; and will set out the quality outcomes and supporting criteria against which inspection under the pre-school regulations will be measured.  Discussions are continuing in the context of Budget 2014 on additional resources for the inspection system.<\/p><p>  I have decided to introduce new qualification requirements for childcare services starting in September 2014.  The current minimum requirement of Level 5 for pre-school leaders delivering the pre-school year will be increased to Level 6.  In addition, all pre-school assistants, and all other staff caring for children in a new pre-school service, will be subject to a minimum requirement of Level 5.  These requirements will be effective from September 2014 for new services and from September 2015 for existing services.  My Department is currently examining measures to support training for childcare staff in line with the increased qualification requirements.<\/p><p>  Since my appointment as Minister I have consistently highlighted the importance of investing and supporting quality interventions in the early years of children&rsquo;s lives.  There is an increasing body of Irish and International evidence which quantify the benefits of early year&rsquo;s interventions in terms of improving children&rsquo;s outcomes and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the state.  In line with this commitment I announced that I would lead the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s first Early Years Strategy which I indicated should represent an innovative and dynamic blueprint addressing a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as child health and well-being, parenting and family support, learning and development, play and recreation and early childhood care and education.<\/p><p>  The Early Years Strategy will represent one of three, more detailed strategies under the high-level Children and Young People's Policy Framework is currently being developed by my Department and which is due to be launched later this year.  I appointed an Expert Advisory Group, chaired by Dr. Eilis Hennessy of UCD to advise my Department and I on recommendations for inclusion in the Strategy.  This Group has now completed its work and I have this week received its Report and recommendations which I will publish very shortly.   I wish to thank the members of the group for the dedication and enthusiasm which they have shown and the time they have committed to the work of the group.<\/p><p>  The Expert Advisory Group Report represents a key step in the development of the Early Years Strategy and will provide a very strong foundation for a robust and meaningful Strategy.  I expect the finalised Strategy to be published later this year.  Budget discussions are on-going at present and will determine funding provision for 2014.  I expect the Early Years Strategy to identify opportunities for more effective utilisation of existing resources and funding, as well as priority areas for further investment through funding availability over the life of the Strategy.  The issue of funding to support vetting legislation is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":2539,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB02800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Ambulance Service Provision","counter":2538,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB02750"},{"type":"question","counter":2539,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[39369\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the review of the operation of the aeromedical service will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2540,"qnumday":526,"qnumall":"[39370\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400079#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for the development of the air ambulance service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2541,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 500 and 526 together.<\/p><p>  The Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) was a joint 12 month pilot project between the National ambulance Service (NAS) and the Air Corps, providing dedicated aeromedical support to the NAS in the west, specifically where land ambulance transit times would not be clinically appropriate.

This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population.<\/p><p>  It has become clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic. Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness. While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. <\/p><p>  However, the Government is firmly committed to introducing a universal service within this term. The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the roll-out of the universal GP service. In doing so, it has considered the delay in the initial step and the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, with the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay. <\/p><p>  It has been agreed that a number of alternative options should be set out with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  As part of this work, consideration is being given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation of this universal health service.  A range of options are under consideration with a view to bringing developed proposals to Government over the next few months.<\/p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources totalling &euro;30 million in the two most recent budgets. <\/p><p>  To conclude,this Government is determined to expedite the implementation of a national GP service for the entire population, something to which no previous Government has ever aspired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":2556,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":2557,"qnumday":505,"qnumall":"[39195\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the cutbacks in St. Michael's House (details supplied) can be reversed as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

HCAIs represent a major cause of preventable patient harm and increased healthcare costs. <\/p><p>Established as an independent statutory body under the Health Act 2007, the Health Information and Quality Authority's (HIQA) mandate extends across the quality and safety of the public, private and voluntary sectors.  Since late 2012 the Health and Information Quality Authority (HIQA) has been carrying out a monitoring programme against the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs), 41 of which have been completed.   Both I and my Department welcome the publication of HIQA's reports and note the concerns raised in these, and indeed, previous reports about hand hygiene practices particularly among medical staff.  With regard to hand hygiene the findings of the Authority suggest that hand hygiene best practice needs to become more operationally embedded at all levels.  <\/p><p>Achieving a culture of patient safety in which best practice in hand hygiene is embedded requires actions at all levels.  It is the responsibility of management and clinical leadership to make this a priority and ensure that the correct conditions to allow for the improvements in hand hygiene compliance are in place. <\/p><p>It must be emphasised that it is of vital importance that healthcare workers recognise their personal responsibility to protect patients by maintaining their own good hand hygiene.  It is extremely disappointing to note that despite the Health Service Executive's (HSE) initiatives to develop an organisational culture of hand hygiene, a significant number of healthcare staff, including doctors, are still not adhering to the basic principles of hand washing.<\/p><p>I very much support the HSE's ongoing work through its national programme of activity to raise awareness amongst staff, monitor compliance with national standards and to take action to reduce HCAIs in hospitals. A key element of this programme is the HSE's continuing bi-annual hand hygiene audits which occur in both the acute sector and in the long stay area as well.  Additionally, from July of this year it has become mandatory for all staff to receive hand hygiene training as part of staff induction and an education programme every two years is being put in place.  The HSE audits have shown an encouraging improvement in hand hygiene compliance with a most recent figure of 84.3% compliance overall (October 2012). <\/p><p>The Director General of the HSE has instructed that all hospitals act immediately on the following:<\/p><p>- Ensure that a member of the senior management team is responsible for hygiene.  This person must give a report to the facility management team on the facilities performance against the 2006 cleaning manual with a remediation plan and on the facilities performance multimodal hand hygiene plan by the end of 2013.<\/p><p>- Ensure that there is a hygiene programme in place by the end of 2013 which clearly demonstrates the hospital's commitment to hygiene, specifically focusing on patient care equipment, the patient environment and hand hygiene.  The programme should be based on the WHO multimodal framework.<\/p><p>- Ensure that 100% staff have received hand hygiene education and training by June 2014.<\/p><p>Hospitals are to provide monthly reports on progress to the National Director for Acute Services.  The HSE is also working with the main medical professional bodies to address the issue of doctor attitudes and behaviour around hand hygiene. <\/p><p>The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the Department of Health has written to the Chair of the Health and Social Regulatory Forum asking that the Forum consider the matter and submit proposals as to how it might adopt a common approach to raise awareness of hand hygiene in particular and support and reinforce compliance with this very important patient safety issue.  It has also been agreed that the CMO will meet with the Director General of the HSE to discuss the issue of governance in the control and prevention of HCAIs. <\/p><p>I have asked HIQA to provide details of the unannounced inspections by hospital as requested by the Deputy and I will have this information supplied to him as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2566,"content":"<p>Question No. 508 answered with Question No. 506.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":2567,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC01250"},{"type":"question","counter":2568,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[39209\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there are plans to develop a gastroenterology centre at the Mercy University Hospital, Cork; the timeframe for the development and investment being made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2569,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":2570,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC01450"},{"type":"question","counter":2571,"qnumday":510,"qnumall":"[39211\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will support the case of the person (details supplied) in Dublin 3 with a disability in relation to the cuts to St. Michael&rsquo;s House.

The agreement provides a framework and opportunities for managers within the health services, including agencies such as St Michael's House, to reduce their costs associated with agency and overtime and a wide range of other pay costs, particularly through measures such as additional working hours and revised rates in respect of overtime.   <\/p><p>The HSE has advised the Department of Health that the recent application of additional budget cuts under the HRA has presented a significant challenge to St Michael's House.   A process is now underway between the HSE and St Michael's House to identify the impact of these budget reductions on services.   The Department of Health has received assurances from the HSE that both organisations are committed to working within the terms of the HRA to ensure that services are impacted upon only as a measure of last resort.  <\/p><p>In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy, as these are service issues they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2576,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC01850"},{"type":"question","counter":2577,"qnumday":512,"qnumall":"[39216\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a child (details supplied) will be admitted for surgery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2578,"content":"<p>The National Waiting List Management Policy, <i>A standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, January 2013,<\/i> has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.

Current estimates suggest that there are approximately 450,000 people with doctor-diagnosed asthma in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The initial focus of the work of the Programme has been primarily on three main areas:<\/p><p>  - The development and implementation of national asthma guidelines based on international best practice for acute and ongoing asthma management and in relation to this, national asthma education initiatives for patients and health care professionals;<\/p><p>  - The organisation and better integration of national asthma services at primary and secondary care levels through development of a national model of care; and<\/p><p>  - A national project of auditing acute asthma deaths.<\/p><p>  Work in relation to Asthma Guidelines has included:<\/p><p>  1. Acute adult asthma guidelines and associated care pathways, treatment protocols and care bundles have been developed for use in all care settings (primary and secondary care levels), in conjunction with other relevant programmes and the Irish College of General Practice (ICGP).  These include:<\/p><p>  - An in-hospital practical asthma education programme for nurses to underpin and support the implementation of the acute adult guidelines; and<\/p><p>  - General management asthma guidelines for use in all healthcare settings especially in primary care.<\/p><p>  The Acute Adult Emergency Guidelines are available through the HSE website.  This user friendly resource will facilitate all healthcare staff in optimising the management of adult patients attending services with an acute asthmatic episode.<\/p><p>  2. Guidelines for acute paediatric asthma have also been completed and should be available soon on the HSE website.  An associated educational programme is being developed at present.<\/p><p>The National Asthma Programme is developing a National Model of Care (MOC) for Asthma with an implementation plan which will detail how physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals will work with engaged patients to make the clinical decisions most appropriate to their circumstances; and to collaborate with specialist colleagues in providing a safe, seamless patient experience within the health system in Ireland.  This is a key deliverable of the National Asthma Programme for 2013.  As 85 per cent of asthma is managed in primary care without the need for hospital specialist services, the Programme is aiming to provide at primary care level a yearly programme of assessment for asthma called Chronic Disease Watch (CDW) - Asthma, also known as <i>Asthma Check.<\/i><i>Asthma Check,<\/i>   which has been submitted to the ICGP for review, outlines the step-by-step process for the implementation of guideline based asthma management in primary care to deliver optimal outcomes for patients.<\/p><p>  The Model of Care will also focus on:<\/p><p>  - Improving access to hospital based specialist asthma services from primary and secondary care services, through Scheduled \/ Rapid access asthma services (adult\/paediatric), and access to specialist asthma therapies.<\/p><p>  - Improving links through Clinical \/ Asthma Nurse Specialists within the community services.<\/p><p>  - Developing and implementing a standard referral pathway to asthma services.<\/p><p>  - Developing structured assessment and review protocols throughout the system.<\/p><p>  - Establishing uniform discharge protocols.<\/p><p>  - Facilitating access to accurate asthma diagnostics.<\/p><p>  - Examining solutions to develop and subsequently implement an Asthma database \/ register linked into all care levels (GP, Community Pharmacist and Hospital).<\/p><p>    The draft model of care has been circulated for stakeholder consultation.  The National Asthma Programme is aiming to have the Model of Care published by the end of this year. <\/p><p>  Implementation of the National Clinical Programme for Asthma, which was included in the HSE's 2013 Operational Plan is ongoing and will continue in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Appeals","counter":2595,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC03150"},{"type":"question","counter":2596,"qnumday":519,"qnumall":"[39321\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013092400080#WRCC03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will expedite a medical card appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2597,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

No effort will be spared in expediting its completion.   The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) is the body with statutory responsibility for building the new children's hospital.  Last month I announced appointments to the NPHDB to replace the transitional Board which had been in place since January 2013.  These appointments ensure appropriate professional membership with the necessary capital development expertise and experience in complex healthcare capital projects.  Also in August I announced the appointment of members to the Children's Hospital Group Board (CHGB).  The CHGB will oversee the operational integration of the three existing paediatric hospitals in advance of the move to the new hospital and is also the client for the new hospital, and hence is critically important for the project as a whole.  Earlier this month, Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman was selected as CEO of the Children's Hospital Group following an open recruitment process through the Public Appointments Service. <\/p><p>  With regard to the progress of the capital project, the tender process for the procurement of a new design team is well underway, and the aim is to have the new design team in place by the end of 2013.  Pre-application planning discussions have commenced and the aim is to secure planning permission by December 2014.  A review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is almost complete; the number and location of these satellite centres in the Dublin area is a key decision, as the size, activity and infrastructure of these satellite centre(s) has implications for the main hospital brief.  In parallel, St. James's Hospital is leading on the decant and enabling work, and is working closely with HSE Estates and the NPHDB in this regard. <\/p><p>  The new children's hospital is a priority for me and for this Government.
