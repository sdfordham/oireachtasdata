The consultation runs until 20 January 2015.  The objective of the consultation is to collect stakeholder views on the draft guidelines.  The Commission has previously sought member states' views on state aid earlier this autumn through its advisory committee, on which the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine was represented.<br\/>The new guidelines are intended to replace the present guidelines of the same title, which have been in force since 2007.  Under the treaties, the Commission is responsible for considering state aid notifications and, as such, the Commission will make the final decision on the wording of these guidelines and on how they will perform that task.  The new guidelines will set out the principles that the Commission will apply when assessing whether proposed aid to the fishery and aquaculture sector can be considered to be compatible with the internal market.  The guidelines apply to all state aid granted by member states to the fishery and aquaculture sector that has been notified, or should have been notified, to the Commission in accordance with the treaties.  The Commission is moving to update the current guidelines in order to regularise references to legal acts mentioned in the guidelines, thereby aligning them with the Commission's state aid modernisation initiative, the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund regulation. <br\/>State aid rules for the fisheries and aquaculture sector differ from the rules applying generally to other areas of the food industry.  The Commission's proposed new guidelines should be viewed as part of a broader legal framework for state aid to the fisheries and aquaculture sector.  That broader legal framework includes four elements: the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund regulation; the <i>de minimis<\/i>regulation for the fisheries and aquaculture sector; the fisheries block exemption regulation; and these guidelines for the examination of state aid to the fishery and aquaculture sector.  It is important to note that these are essentially a form of cascade where a proposed support measures for the seafood sector will generally only be notified to the Commission through a state aid notification if it is not possible legally to implement that measure through one of the other three options.By way of example, during the last EU funding round from 2007 to the present, it has not been necessary to submit a state aid notification to the Commission for any of the many schemes implemented in Ireland to support the development of the seafood sector.  The guidelines come into play only when it is necessary to submit a state aid notification.<br\/>I will very briefly explain the nature of each of the four instruments.  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, regulation is undoubtedly the most important.  The EMFF is one of the four European structural and investment funds together with the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.  Together, these European Structural and Investment Funds are intended to support measures to address the EU 2020 strategy.  The EMFF is intended in particular to support the new Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, and is considered the financial instrument of the CFP.  <br\/>The EMFF is solely concerned with measures that are co-funded by the EU.  It does not have anything to say about measures funded solely by the Irish Exchequer.  The majority of measures implemented through the EMFF do not require state aid notification.  They are considered to automatically comply with state aid rules.  There are two exceptions which are not covered by this exemption: support to fishery local action groups and supports under the Integrated Maritime Policy both of which are provided for in the EMFF regulation.  These two measures are excluded from the state aid notification exemption that generally applies to EMFF measures as they are outside the CFP.  However, they may potentially be covered by non-fisheries block exemptions.  That remains to be examined but in any case those measures are also outside the scope of these guidelines, again for the same reason they are not covered by the CFP.<br\/>The Minister is preparing a new seafood development programme, SDP, for the period 2014 to 2020 to implement investment in the seafood sector with co-funding from the EMFF.  The committee will have seen previous announcements from the Minister as part of budget 2015 announcing that the new SDP will have total funds of &euro;241 million, of which &euro;146.7 million is from EU funds and &euro;93.9 million is from the Irish Exchequer.  The new SDP will include a range of investment measures to encourage and foster the further sustainable development and growth of our seafood industry, including aquaculture, processing, the fishing fleet and coastal communities.  Some &euro;142 million of the SDP funds will go towards this core sectoral development purpose, which is more than twice the &euro;66 million available under the previous programme, which was the European Fisheries Fund.  The SDP will also directly fund &euro;46 million in new investments to support our capacity to enforce the rules of the CFP and a further &euro;41 million to fund the science that supports our fisheries management together with &euro;11 million for implementation of the new EU Integrated Maritime Policy and &euro;1.3 million for storage aid supports.  The Government has made available &euro;15 million in 2015 to commence investment measures under the new SDP and this will rise significantly in following years as the programme is fully rolled out.<br\/>The second measure is the <i>de minimis<\/i>regulation.  A new <i>de minimis<\/i>regulation for the seafood sector was adopted by the Commission in June 2014.  The so-called fisheries <i>de minimis<\/i>regulation is concerned solely with measures funded by the Exchequer.  Measures implemented through <i>de minimis<\/i>are not considered state aid.  The fisheries <i>de minimis<\/i>regulation provides wide scope to member states to provide nationally funded supports to enterprises in the seafood sector up to a maximum of &euro;30,000 per beneficiary and up to &euro;20.8 million nationally over a rolling three-year period and subject to certain exclusions specified in the regulation.  While the &euro;30,000 cap restricts its usefulness somewhat, it is a very useful instrument for smaller interventions that are not permitted under instruments such as the EMFF or the fisheries block exemption regulation.<br\/>BIM implements its fleet safety grants through <i>de minimis<\/i>as these are not eligible under the EMFF or its predecessor, the European Fisheries Fund, nor under the block exemption.  BIM also implemented the pot replacement scheme earlier this year through <i>de minimis<\/i>, while Enterprise Ireland uses it to implement its marketing assistance programme for seafood companies.  A separate general <i>de minimis<\/i>regulation applies to the food sector generally, excluding seafood, and this has a significantly higher cap of &euro;200,000 per beneficiary.  The significant difference in the cap applying to food companies in different sectors has been highlighted by Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia as a difficulty.  However, the Commission is not open to increases in the cap on the fisheries <i>de minimis<\/i>.<br\/>The third regulation is the fisheries block exemption regulation.  The fisheries block exemption regulation or so-called FIBER is concerned solely with measures funded by the Exchequer.  <\/p> <p>Like the guidelines at present and the fisheries <i>de minimis<\/i>regulation earlier this year, the fisheries block exemption regulation, FIBER, is being revised by the Commission and the new instrument is expected to be adopted before the end of 2014.  The new FIBER closely mirrors the European maritime and fisheries fund, EMFF, regulation.  It allows member states to provide supports to the seafood sector based on the measures included in the EMFF and subject to the rules specified in the EMFF, without EU co-funding.  This is useful where a member state wishes to implement particular EMFF measures, but has insufficient EU co-funding to cover all of the measures it may wish to implement.  Measures implemented through FIBER generally do not require state aid notification.  I say generally because there is an exception where aid exceeds &euro;1 million to an individual beneficiary.  <br\/>In a departure from the previous FIBER, the draft new FIBER allows block exemption of measures to assist the seafood sector with the impacts of natural disasters.  The draft regulation defines &quot;natural disaster&quot;, <i>inter alia<\/i>, as floods, tornadoes and hurricanes.  The Commission&rsquo;s definition is taken from the existing EU legal definition of natural disasters, so while it is a useful addition, it is questionable whether it would have applied to the storm events we experienced earlier this year.However, the draft FIBER mirrors the EMFF provision which allows for a state contribution to a mutual fund for adverse climatic events.  That provision is broad in nature and would cover similar storm events as we experienced this year.<br\/>Fourth, I will deal with the guidelines for the examination of state aid to the fishery and the aquaculture sector.  It is when a proposed measure is not covered by the other three instruments that a state aid notification is required.  Only in that situation do we need to have regard to the new proposed Commission guidelines in designing a proposed new scheme and in drafting the state aid notification for it.  The guidelines set out the principles by which the Commission will assess such state aid notifications.  While the guidelines are quite detailed, they can be summarised as setting out certain principles that are common to all economic sectors and additional principles that are specific to the seafood sector.  The general principles common to all sectors include: contribution to a well-defined objective of common interest; need for state intervention; appropriateness of the aid measure; incentive effect; proportionality of the aid; avoidance of undue negative effects on competition and trade between member states; and transparency of the aid.  The additional principles specific to the seafood sector relate to the Common Fisheries Policy and the EMFF.  These include: exclusion of operators who have infringed CFP rules, a similar rule exists in the EMFF regulation; a Commission delegated act will specify the waiting periods appropriate to particular types of infringements; a requirement to repay aid if an infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy rules happens after payment of aid; any aid measure similar to one described in the EMFF regulation must comply with the rules applying under the EMFF; measures ineligible under the EMFF regulation will not be permitted; and a proposed aid measure must identify how exactly it will contribute to the general and specific objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy.  <br\/>Aside from these principles, which are the core of the guidelines document, the remaining notable element of the proposed new guidelines is the specific recognition they give to natural disasters, to so-called &quot;exceptional occurrences&quot; and to so-called &quot;adverse climatic events&quot;.  Natural disasters or exceptional occurrences must have been formally recognised as such by the member state.  Natural disasters are defined somewhat to include exceptionally severe storms and floods, tornadoes and hurricanes among other things.  Exceptional occurrences are defined somewhat to include war, internal disturbances, strikes, major industrial and nuclear accidents, and fires resulting in widespread loss.  A very widespread outbreak of a new animal disease may be accepted by the Commission as an exceptional occurrence.  Aid related to these natural disasters or exceptional occurrences must relate to the costs of the damage incurred to assets or loss of income arising from destruction of production or means of production.  Separately, the guidelines indicate that the Commission may accept as compatible with the treaties aid to make good the damage caused by &quot;adverse climatic events&quot;.  This separate classification is somewhat defined as including storms, gusts of wind causing exceptionally high waves, heavy and persistent rainfall, floods, and elevated water temperatures over a long period.  The bar is set higher in relation to these types of events in terms of eligible costs.  The damage caused must amount to more than 30% of the average annual turnover of the operator concerned in the preceding three years.  These provisions appear to be useful, particularly<b><\/b>those relating to adverse climatic events.  Given our experiences earlier this year with a series of exceptionally severe storms, we may potentially need to make use of them in the future.<br\/>With regard to the next steps, the Commission proposes to apply the new guidelines from 1 April 2015.  The Commission will be requesting that each member state adapt its existing aid schemes to these guidelines by 30 September 2015 and to give its agreement to this adaptation process within two months of the publication of these guidelines.  At present we cannot foresee any difficulty with giving such an agreement, or in adapting our schemes to the guidelines.  All existing measures are covered by either the European fisheries fund regulation, the fisheries <i>de minimis<\/i>regulation or the FIBER.  The EMFF, <i>de minimis<\/i>and FIBER regulations provide sufficient scope for foreseen future measures, with the exception of the measures concerning fisheries local action groups, FLAGs, and the integrated maritime policy, IMP, to which I alluded earlier.  We will be examining the state aid situations of measures relating to the FLAGs and the IMP in the coming months with regard to other non-fisheries block exemptions and, if necessary, we will submit a state aid notification.  We do not foresee those measures having any difficulty in securing Commission state aid approval, given that they are provided for in the EMFF regulation and will likely be implemented in all member states. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600005#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paschal Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418739600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Hayes.

He mentioned that 20 January is the deadline for submissions from stakeholders.  I presume the Department has made a submission based on what he said when it was asked for its views from the Commission in the autumn.  Can Mr. Hayes share with us what was the Department's opinion?  Are the submissions from the stakeholders, who would include more than likely those in the industry, being made via the Department or directly to the Commission?  Has Mr. Hayes any idea of the number of submissions made and what they may reflect?  Obviously, they would relate to the de minimis regulation and that affects every element of state aid rules, whether it be funding through the IDA, Enterprise Ireland or any of the funding streams from Europe, and there is nothing new in that.  The new element is the increase in funding from Europe under the seafood development fund and there will be a knock-on consequence to have an increased fund available from the Department as well.  In terms of the economic benefit of the fund over the lifetime of the programme, has any analysis been done of a breakdown of where the money will be spent, in other words, the sectoral elements of spend and the beneficial consequences of it in terms of the growth of the industry?<br\/>The aquaculture sector is one of the strands that can be funded from the programme.  In light of some of the concerns of local communities around the country, how will they fit in with the funding mechanisms?  If there are local concerns, they will have to feed into the mix of funding programmes based on business plans alone.  Will a social cost benefit analysis be carried out on the unintended consequences, given that it is set out in the 2013 public spending code that social benefit analysis must be taken into consideration as well?  Presumably, there would have to be some level of awareness and some way of building the social concerns of communities into whatever funding is made available.<b><\/b><\/p> <p>For example, in Galway, Donegal and Mayo, where there are plans to develop salmon-farming facilities off the coast, there have been suggestions, whether scientifically proven or not, that these enterprises could be to the detriment of local communities.  Will those types of social costs be taken into account when it comes to deciding how the funding should be used?  Where investment comes from private sector interests, including multinational organisations, the main concern, at the end of the day, is their own stakeholders, who are the shareholders of the company.  Their bottom line is profit.<\/p><p> There are issues to be addressed in terms of how these proposals can be implemented in a beneficial way while ensuring the concerns of local communities are not diminished.  There are genuine concerns about how this money will be spent if it does go towards aquaculture.  The State, which should have the best interests of citizens and local communities at heart, needs to be very much aware of this.  There is a lot of money to be made in the sector.  Salmon farming is one of the cornerstones of what the Minister is driving in terms of the seafood element of Food Harvest 2020 and his efforts to develop outputs.  At the same time, we must be very much aware of the consequences that go along with that.  I might be going off on a tangent, but it is very much related to how the money is spent.  Europe will have an eye on that and we may well see complaints from local communities to the European Commission in regard to how the money is carved up.  Perhaps the delegates might enlighten us as to whether there has been any discussion with the Commission on these matters, particularly regarding the aquaculture element of the seafood development programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600006#G00300","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418740200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hayes for his presentation.

According to my information, that scheme turned out to be an absolute disaster because the criteria attaching to it were too strict.

I am trying to get my head around these guidelines in terms of how and to which types of funding they will apply.  It seems from the presentation that anything under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and the fisheries block exemption regulation is not covered by these state aid guidelines.  Therefore, I presume it is only state funding outside any of those regulations to which these particular proposals would apply.  Under the previous guidelines, no applications were made by the State to waive the state aid rules in this regard.  Do the delegates foresee any such applications being made in the future under these guidelines?<br\/>Deputy Ferris referred to compensation for operators impacted by storm damage.  Mr. Hayes referred to various terms contained in the proposals such as &quot;adverse climatic events&quot;, &quot;natural disasters&quot; and &quot;exceptional occurrences&quot;.  I understand that natural disasters are already mentioned in the treaties.  Is the notion of &quot;adverse climatic events&quot;something new that is being added?  I am wondering what is the rationale for setting two different qualifications separate from the treaty element.  Does Mr. Hayes see an opening to ease these criteria in some way to make them more beneficial for fishermen?  In the light of the effects of adverse weather earlier this year, it would be helpful if the State could make better provision for those affected rather than having to keep it under the <i>de minimis <\/i>rules.<br\/>Mr. Hayes also referred to &quot;elevated water temperatures over a long period&quot; in the context of the proposals regarding adverse climatic events.  Might these provisions cover fish farmers whose stock is affected by amoebic gill disease, which is caused by high water temperatures, thereby making them eligible for some degree of state aid?<br\/>My final question concerns what will actually constitute the state aid.

As the issue with FLAGs is not a Common Fisheries Policy initiative, it is not automatically exempt from state aid.

However, we must examine other regulations in place to ascertain whether FLAGs can be funded without a state aid notification.  In the event that we find a difficulty in this respect, we will submit an application for state aid to funding FLAGs.  We do not envisage any difficulty arising in allowing FLAGs to be funded.<\/p><p>  The Department was involved in committees at which this draft was initially discussed.  We have asked the agencies that deal with grant aid to the fishing industry, for example, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and Enterprise Ireland, for their opinions on the draft and requested that they revert to us by early January.

We had a number of consultations with a broad range of stakeholders, namely, the stakeholders we had in place for the current programme, the European Fisheries Fund, with some additions.  We also had a number of bilateral meetings with other State agencies on their requirements.  An operational programme is being drafted and will set out priorities for spending this money and the measures that will be implemented under the programme.

This is a bar that applicants must get over, which means that losses must be greater than 30% of average turnover in the preceding three years.  It does not mean that grant aid will be limited to 30% of their turnover in the past three years.

One sees a pattern running through the different state aid instruments to which Mr. Hayes referred.  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund includes references to adverse climatic events and tools that are in place to deal with that specific scenario.  Similarly, the block exemption includes both the adverse climatic events and natural disasters categories.  The latter are defined by reference to existing instruments such as the general <i>de minimus<\/i>and block exemption regulations in which they are defined, as well as European Union case law.  The adverse climatic events category is of much more interest to us as it is much more likely to be useful to us.  Natural disasters refer to events such as tornados or hurricanes.  God forbid, that we will ever have those types of events in Ireland.  The adverse climatic events category is much more relevant, for example, in respect of the storms we experienced earlier this year.  The Commission's thinking appears to be that because these types of climatic events are much more likely to occur, the bar should be set higher.  The obvious reason for imposing a 30% loss threshold is that one cannot have claims being submitted annually or as a matter of routine because the intervention would cease to be for exceptional events.<\/p> <p>It does seem to be a high loss threshold and it is an issue we raised ourselves in previous discussions with the Commission.  Many member states would have liked to have seen it perhaps a little lower.  However, the Commission's view on that was that it could not legislate or make new legislation.  It is there to implement it.  It is looking to what the co-legislators have already said in the EMMF, and that 30% threshold is built into the EMMF by the co-legislators.  For that reason, the Commission is essentially implementing the same policy in these guidelines.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600008#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Clarke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418741400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Is it a case then of it just putting it in for window dressing?

The total land area affected by this designation is 169,000 hectares which affects more than 4,400 farmers.  The aim of IFDL is to restore the value of designated land to the same value as neighbouring non-designated land and that of similar type land elsewhere and an equal payment on every designated hectare to be paid to farmers.  We have attended several meetings throughout the regions affected by the designation.  At these meetings, farmers have expressed their real concerns at the realisation that their land value has been completely decimated.  We have very solid examples of financial stress that this designation has put on farmers within these regions.  Prospective buyers have indicated that it was too risky to purchase lands designated for hen harrier SPA.  Some farmers, wanting to sell their lands, could not get a bid.  The main reasons for the devaluation include the suspension of the national parks and wildlife hen harrier farm plan scheme, which means that farmers who own land affected by the designation were not compensated.  This will result in farmers abandoning some of these lands and moving from these communities.<\/p> <p>At meetings we have attended in the past two months at which this issue was discussed and considered, it was very clear that communities are devastated by the realisation that the value of their land has disappeared.  A resolution which is satisfactory to the farmers who own land in these regions must be found.<\/p><p> There is now a general blanket ban on the planting of trees for forestation purposes in hen harrier SPA regions.  There is also a restriction on forestry planting on lands adjoining these regions.  The 2010 hen harrier survey indicates that the hen harrier population decreased by 18% in SPA designated areas.  This led to the ban on afforestation being introduced, despite the fact that the national population appears to be stable.<\/p><p> Farmers are being fined in respect of their single farm payments as a result of the fact that their SPA designated land does not qualify under the good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, criteria.  In 2007, farmers with land in these regions were offered compensation through the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  This amounted to compensation of &euro;350 per hectare for the first 40 hectares, &euro;25 per hectare for land between 41 to 120 hectares and &euro;5 per hectare thereafter.  At that time, farmers in the main accepted this compensation on the understanding that new afforestation would generally be permitted on these lands.  However, this has not proven to be the case and the compensation to which I refer would not be adequate to compensate farmers who own land with the SPA hen harrier designation.<\/p><p> In the context of resolutions, a proper level of compensation must be put in place and this must be guaranteed to remain in effect during the designation period.  The amount of compensation should be reviewed every five years.  The payment must be made on every designated hectare in view of the fact that every hectare is devalued and affected by the designation.  All farmers with designated land must be exempt from GAEC criteria when claiming their single farm payments.  Afforestation must be reintroduced and restrictions on non-designated land adjoining SPA hen harrier regions should be removed.  Non-intensive viable farming needs to be central to the formation of a new hen harrier scheme, which needs to be flexible, workable and reasonable.<\/p><p> Until such time as the Commission decides on a mechanism to remove land from designation, farmers must be compensated adequately.  A long-term, viable scheme must be put in place to ensure that farming in these regions is as viable as forestry.  Our aim is to protect the value of the lands which are designated for the protection of the hen harrier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600009#K01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jason Fitzgerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418742000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fitzgerald for his presentation.

I read their submission with interest.  We need to move forward and find solutions.  We must consider those solutions in the context of both European and national law.  IFDL makes a case for compensation.  The latter can mean different things to different people.  If a payment were to be put in place in the long term to maintain our guests' system of farming in such a way as to maximise the chances of the hen harrier not only surviving but also propagating, would this be acceptable as a way forward?  I do not mind how many hectares of land a farmer owns but if one of those hectares is useful to the hen harrier, then all other hectares are also useful.  I do not understand the logic of paying a certain amount in respect of the first 40 hectares.  If the land is designated, then all of it is designated and if the relevant action must be taken in respect of every hectare, then farmers should get the requisite payment.  I would make the case that farmers who are affected should receive payment in respect of every hectare of designated land they own.  Rather than putting in place a scheme such as those relating to compensation for not obtaining planning permission for windmills or for not receiving grants, I am of the view that a payment would be made in respect of farmers who follow a prescription plan to maximise the hen harrier population.  I am also of the view that this would take into account the losses or costs farmers will incur as a result of not having the freedom to farm in the way they want.<\/p><p>  On the GAEC criteria, is Mr. Fitzgerald saying - this would be a sensible proposition - that if it is good for the hen harrier, then, by definition, it should be eligible for the single farm payment.  In other words, if it is necessary to provide certain kinds of cover, scrub land or ecological focus areas - whatever the powers that be may wish to call them - then the land involved should not be excluded from the calculations relating to the single farm payment scheme.  Is Mr. Fitzgerald stating that it cannot be the case that the National Parks and Wildlife Services, NPWS, may state that it wants the land to be maintained in a particular way and then those responsible for administering the single farm payment scheme saying the land in question does not qualify because it does not meet the criteria relating to forage areas?<\/p><p>  On the reintroduction of afforestation, I understand that some work is being done at present to assess whether forestry is good or bad for hen harriers.  Is Mr. Fitzgerald saying that afforestation should be allowed even if it is detrimental to hen harriers or is he stating that where it is proven to be neutral or favourable to them, then it should be allowed?  Perhaps he will clarify the position in this regard.<\/p><p>  I am fascinated by the restrictions which apply in respect of undesignated land.  When land is designated, anything one proposes to do on adjacent lands will have an impact on the former.  For example, if one were going to do work on an adjacent plot of land which might result in a designated bog being drained, this can be taken into account when a decision in respect of planning permission is being made.  Is Mr. Fitzgerald stating that there should be no restrictions on what can be done on adjacent lands even if this might affect the designated land?  Is he stating that if there are restrictions, then farmers should be paid compensation?  Clarity is required in respect of that matter.  As already stated, I am of the view that it is time to move on and find a resolution.<\/p><p>  The key sentence in Mr. Fitzgerald's presentation is that which reads, \"Non-intensive viable farming needs to be central to the formation of a new hen harrier scheme, which needs to be flexible, workable and reasonable.\"  I have travelled widely and attended many farmers' meetings throughout the country.  As our guests are aware, I criticised the Government roundly for its handling of the single farm payment issue and its refusal to level the playing pitch in respect of high nature value farming.  Europe will not pay single farm payments to people if we do not protect high nature value farming.  One of the best ways in which we could have helped farmers such as those represented at this meeting would have been to increase the single farm payment to a fair level.  In fairness to the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Michelle O'Neill, MLA, this has been done in Northern Ireland and farming there has not fallen apart.  What is Mr. Fitzgerald's view in respect of the lead-in review of the CAP in the context of ensuring that the single farm payment will take into account that our guests would farm more intensively if they were permitted to do so?  Of course, the Government and the EU are telling them that they cannot farm more intensively.<\/p><p>  Does Mr. Fitzgerald believe the payment in respect of areas of natural constraint - our guests probably know this as the disadvantaged areas payment - should actually relate to natural constraint?<\/p> <p>If the land can produce only half of what it could because most of it is moorland and because of its designation, should the payment for the areas of natural constraint be higher to take into account the natural constraint?<\/p><p> There must be a payment.  I am a bit shy of the word \"compensation\" because I have a funny feeling if it is included we will get a bang on the head and be told to go home, that we cannot pay compensation.  In a legal sense, special area of conservation designation does not provide for compensation for the refusal to get a grant or planning permission, if this is what we are discussing.  However, a substantial payment for carrying out actions which are good for the hen harrier would be perfectly doable and it is only a matter of political will and the need to put up the money.  We need to be clear about what we are seeking because we are more likely to be successful with one approach rather than the other.<\/p><p> As farmers, the witnesses probably have more knowledge of the hen harrier than most.  In their view, allowing that hen harrier numbers are small, how long do they think it would take and how long a programme would we require to ensure not only the survival of the hen harrier but its re-propagation to an adequate level?  This is the key question.  My experience is that four or five year programmes are far too short for nature.  Nature does not work in five year cycles.  Do the witnesses have any knowledge on how long they think it will take?  How long does the scheme need to be to ensure it has the impact on the hen harrier which everybody desires?  I am sure the witnesses are not against the hen harrier as long as the hen harrier does not take away their living.  How long a cycle would be required before we see a significant improvement in the hen harrier situation?  Do the witnesses wish the grant to be available throughout this cycle?  Would it be ten or 15 years?  Bringing back the corncrake is a long-term project and it will not happen overnight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600010#L00300","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418742600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fitzgerald for his presentation and I welcome the witnesses.

The main concern is that farmers are not able to make an income from their lands.  The other issue is that farmers cannot sell their land; it is completely worthless.  Those issues have to be addressed.  A viable long-term scheme has to be introduced.  Certainty on the value of land and the future of farming in these areas must be reintroduced.  If farmers cannot survive in these areas, hen harriers will not either.<\/p><p>  In terms of a long-term scheme, realistically one would want a commitment that as long as a designation will remain in place, funding will be put in place to incentivise farmers to provide a habitat and protect the hen harrier to a level that will cover the costs of farming and the losses as a result of the designation. <\/p><p>  The issue of adjoining designated lands has arisen when farmers have been turned down for forestry planting because their land adjoins a designated area.  The payments for disadvantaged areas should be larger, but we would prefer if the scheme to deal with the hen harrier issue was properly funded and covered all farmers in the area.  The funding has decreased in recent years.  The payment sought to make good land equal to bad land, but the payments have been too small for many farmers.  <\/p><p>  Farmers are probably the best people to protect the hen harrier in these areas because they have lived with them for years and understand their needs.  I do not think farmers get credit for the knowledge they have of the bird.  Many people want to tell them what to do, order them around and impose designations and restrictions on their land which is causing havoc.  The hen harrier population prior to the designation was better.  The designated areas were selected for a reason.  <\/p><p>  I understand about 9% of the people who applied were approved for the scheme.  It was impossible for many people to be approved for the scheme.  Many people were involved in REPS.  Others were renting land and there was a requirement that land was rented for five years previous to the designation.  Land had to be purchased three years prior to the designation.  People on commonage were not allowed to take part in the scheme.  The scheme was designed to be very difficult to get into, but it should have encouraged as many people as possible to participate.  <\/p><p>  The end goal is to protect the hen harrier.  It is very important that farmers are encouraged to do that and are not out of pocket as a result.  Most farmers love to farm their land and to protect the nature around them.  They have been squeezed into a situation whereby they have to ask to plant or sell their land or realise its value.  It is devastating communities.  Some farmers in these areas are farming the most challenging arable land in the country.  If their only alternative is to plant their land, they will want to do that.  A long-term scheme has to be put in place to make farming as attractive and viable as forestry so they are not out of pocket.<\/p><p>  The GLAS scheme was mentioned.  The biggest problem with the scheme is that it is a five year scheme.  A farmer who has no designation could be farming some of the best land in the country, and could be entitled to a maximum GLAS payment of &euro;5,000.  With a free and clear deed, he or she can sell his or her land when he or she wishes; he or she simply has to comply with the restrictions of the GLAS.  <\/p><p>  Our situation is completely different.  In 2007 farmers were offered a scheme and were to be incentivised to protect the hen harrier.  Land was redesignated on the back of that agreement in EU law.  It was wrong to pull money from the scheme.  It was not like REPS or similar schemes because they do not affect land values.  Farmers were dependent on this scheme to underpin the value of their land and their future on the land.  <\/p><p>  Many farmers are suffering from severe mental stress and depression as a result of this designation.  Farmers do not know where to go and have been offered no support.  This has gone on for four years and they are at their wits' end.  They are abandoning the land and, in many cases, have given up hope.  There is nobody to whom these people can turn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600012#N00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jason Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1418743200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for the presentation.  One might say that farmers did not know where to go for four years.  I have seen parts of Ireland in which farmers did not know where to go for the past 17 years because of designations.  We know that down through the years farmers and nature lived hand-in-hand.  Fundamental environmentalism and ridiculous legislation now mean that a farmer or bird can live in an area, but both will not survive.  It is a sad statement to have to make about bad legislation and people, who did not know what they were talking about, making decisions.<\/p><p>  Compensation was mentioned.  If people want to sell their land, it is valueless.  The witnesses and other groups have heard from auctioneers how land is being devalued in different parts of Ireland because of designations.  <\/p><p>  In Sligo a farmer on designated land, like that to which the witnesses referred, who was required to fence land where stakes were rotten had to get an appropriate environmental assessment and planning permission.  A farmer in another field in Ireland can fence his or her land any day of the year.  What is compensation?  I have dealt with this issue for many years.  Promises from organisations such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service will be made, but they will not deliver, as has been proven down through the years.  <\/p><p>  The sad reality is that in different parts of Ireland people's survival is now under threat.  Unless politicians and the legislators in Europe wake up to this, we will face a revolt.  I have heard farmers who live near me, as well farmers from elsewhere around the country, say it is a sad day when people decide to get rid of a bird because either they or the bird can stay, but not both.  That did not happen when I was younger.  We need to rectify the situation very quickly.<\/p><p>  The witnesses are 100% correct.  I have seen it right around the country.  People not in designated areas do not realise the type of impositions that are being put on people.  If one agrees with it, that is fine.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will say the agreement with farming organisations in 1997 was not worth the paper on which it was written.  It was agreed that while a designation was in place, people would be compensated for it.  I have read the agreement and can show it to the committee.<\/p> <p>However, it has never been adhered to.<\/p><p> I urge the delegation to keep at it.  In parts of Ireland, there is trouble over the single farm payment.  I was in a field one day and one person from a Department was telling me to pull a furze bush and another person was telling me not to.  The farmer was in the middle and did not know where to go.  This demonstrates the bureaucracy that has featured.  Politicians need to sort out something for the delegates and others who have designated land throughout the country.  What is happening must not continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600012#N00200","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418743800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates.  I live in the middle of a hen harrier designated area.  All of west Limerick is designated.  I have heard about this in chapter and verse for many years.  It is not today or yesterday that this issue has become a problem but it is now coming to a head.  To be fair, most landowners do not really have a difficulty with the designation and understand the reasons for it and the requirement for habitat protection.  The latter is a given.  What they have difficulty with, however, is land valuation and farm practices.  I refer to what farmers can and cannot do with their own land and how their land is adversely affected by virtue of the designation.<\/p><p>  The delegates might respond to the threat response plan of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht through the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  It is very focused on the bird.  In my part of the world, we are talking about 20 birds.  This is a very small number considering that parts of west Limerick, north Cork and east Kerry have been converted to virtual wilderness.  The number of birds is depleting year on year and nobody can say definitively whether intensive agriculture, farm practices, wind energy development or scrub affects their population.  Is the bird just dying out because such things happen?  No one seems to know.<\/p><p>  Could I get the delegation's opinion on how this could be brought to a head?  The designation will not be lifted - we know that - and this is very clear from the birds directive.  In fact, some elements of the threat response plan suggest that even more land might be designated, which would cause its own problem.  Could the delegates give some practical suggestions as to what could be done in the short term to make life easier for the landowners under the threat response plan, bearing in mind habitat protection?<\/p><p>  Reference was made to GLAS.  The delegates might give an example of what a farmer whose land has been designated must go through by comparison with a farmer whose land has not been designated.  What payments would be made to them if the only scheme were the GLAS?  Those who do not really have the grasp of this matter that the delegates have might argue that if the farmers get a GLAS payment, they will be fine.  Could we have a practical example of what designation has meant to the delegates as landowners, even in terms of what auctioneers are saying about what the land is worth?<\/p><p>  This issue has featured for a long time and successive Governments have not dealt with it.  It needs to be dealt with now out of fairness.  The committee's deliberations will be a matter for itself.  In the context of the new rural development programme being drafted, all I ask for is that, if the committee is satisfied based on representations made to it by those present, we question whether it is fair that one landowner is subject to very onerous requirements regarding the protection of a habitat while a neighbouring landowner is subject to no such requirements.  If the system is not fair, something should be done about it.  Having travelled around west and east Limerick on a road trip of public meetings about this issue, I realise people are just seeking acknowledgement of the fact that designation imposes responsibility on a landowner that would not be imposed on him otherwise.<\/p><p>  I thank the Chairman for his time and patience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600013#O00200","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1418743800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I will be brief because pretty much everything I wanted to say has been said already.  The delegates mentioned that they were in Brussels.  What response did they receive there?  Deputy O'Donovan mentioned the designation of land and that it is very unlikely that it will be lifted.  I would like to see it being lifted but that could be a dream that will not be realised.  The concern is over the solution.  Even in south Galway and north Clare, which are heavily designated, a number of individuals - I am not saying they are representative of everybody else - would love the opportunity to plant their land and get an income from it in that way.  What was the response in Brussels?<\/p><p>  Responsibility for the problem falls between two departments, which have very different outlooks.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is more concerned with the farmer and the National Parks and Wildlife Service is more concerned with the restrictions.  Both cannot keep handing responsibility to each other to solve it.  Ultimately, the delegates are squeezed in the middle and unfortunately cannot farm the land they want to farm.  It is not a question of farmers who want something for nothing.  The farmers want to have the opportunity to farm the land in the way they know how or to be compensated properly.  I would like a body to have sole responsibility for this because we cannot continue to have circumstances year on year in which one Department says it is the problem of another.

What have they done to take up the cause on their behalf?  Representative bodies should be fighting this.  I am from the midlands and am familiar with callows and wetlands, which are the equivalent of the designated areas in question.  I have been deeply involved with cases in this regard and fought the odd one fairly successfully.<\/p><p>  On the sterilisation of land by the ESB without appropriate compensation, I refer to a basic principle decided by the Supreme Court.  Designation seems to be the equivalent in that one does not get compensation.  As far as I can gather from the presentation, fewer than 1% of the affected farmers have gained compensation.  That statistic is horrendous and frightening.  The matter arises owing to environmental restrictions linked to the protection of the hen harrier bird of prey.  The population of the bird seems to be declining according to the recent study of 2010, as referred to by the delegates.  It would be interesting to learn what a study from 2014 or 2015 would state.  The delegates are basically being left in limbo.  In terms of securing fairness, justice and equity, this is an absolute disgrace.  To have been left in limbo for some years is pretty appalling for anybody.<\/p><p>  The delegates' case is well made.  They seek the payment of fair and proper compensation for landowners due to losses likely to arise as a result of their lands being included for designation as a special protection area.<\/p><p>  Documentary evidence has been provided on the negative impact of designation on the sale value of land.  One cannot even plant forests in the designated area.  The significant evaluation amounts to sterilisation.<\/p><p>  Have the delegates sought legal advice on the impact?  I would be interested in seeing where that will go.  If the potential of the land to be utilised is severely affected, this surely must be taken into account.  One cannot carry on reseeding or with normal improvements because of the sensitivities at play.<\/p><p>  I am not very familiar with the threat response plan to which Deputy O'Donovan referred.  He indicated there could be further restrictions.  That is a frightening scenario.  Somebody in the midlands is not affected but could be.  It is important that we fight for everybody across the country, irrespective of their location.  That is why I am here.<\/p> <p>What support has IFDL got from the wider farming community?  Just because only 4,000 farmers are affected does not mean this cannot reach out in various ways to the 100,000 or so farmers out there.  Before Deputy Fitzmaurice came in here I was always a strong advocate for rural people because many of these measures are imposed by people who have no knowledge of the impact or consequences they have on people in rural Ireland who are trying to eke out a living in difficult circumstances, often not of their own making.  Many are isolated too.  I support any measure but it has to be done within the context of this special protected area, SPA, with respect to European as well as national law.<\/p><p> There is a negative impact on the witnesses&rsquo; legal rights.  That may have its own consequences for the implementation of any plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600013#O00400","speaker":"1063","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418744400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I refer back to the response plan.  This is a consultative committee being formed to discuss the threat to the hen harrier from forestry, intensive agriculture and wind energy.  We will participate in that committee&rsquo;s work but the farmer is being left out again.  The farmer has to be looked after if the bird is to be looked after.  We hope to participate in the response consultative committee and inform people of the needs of farmers in these areas.<\/p><p>  We need a long-term scheme to match the value of forestry because the majority of farmers want to farm their land.  They want to plant it because it is the easiest way out.  They have been told they are entitled to nothing and that is why they want forestry.  We understand that a limited amount of forestry, if any, will be accepted on the response plan.  For the people who really need to plant their land that is their best chance and the people who just want to farm their land but find that is the only way out, should be compensated properly for a new scheme.  The scheme has to match forestry in every way to take the heat away from the demand to plant the land.  That is why it has to be long term.  It has to equal the demand for forestry in monetary terms. <\/p><p>  In respect of the Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme, GLAS, if one farm in an area is designated and another is not, that farmer can still draw the &euro;5,000 under GLAS, like the person on the hen harrier scheme.  If a farmer has 100 or 200 acres under GLAS it all has to be farmed to the same level even though the farmer is being compensated for only the first 13.5ha.  The restrictions in that scheme would reduce productivity on the farm by between 75% and 80%.  The farmer is allowed only 40 units of nitrogen, artificial and natural, organic.  That ground can be used for only rough grazing for cattle.  There will be no nice lush green grass to feed them.  They will be fed on stemmy, coarse grass.  The cattle are used to provide the habitat for the hen harriers as opposed to the land being used to produce livestock.  The farmer&rsquo;s stocking rate will be significantly reduced to 0.6 of a livestock unit per hectare and in some cases 0.01 livestock unit per hectare.<\/p><p>  When we went to Europe one regulation stood out, EC73\/2009, Article 34(2)(b)(i), which states that if a farmer&rsquo;s land qualified for single farm payment in 2008 and has lost eligibility since then, as a result of scrub and does not qualify for the Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition, GAEC, it should qualify for payments under the single farm payment scheme.  That makes sense to us, that farmers cannot be penalised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine because there is scrub growing on the land while the National Parks and Wildlife Service will not allow them to remove the scrub.  It is a ridiculous situation. <\/p><p>  We have considered legal advice but 4,000 farmers are affected.  They would need a substantial sum of money to take a case on this.  Surely a government could see sense in protecting these farmers and rural areas rather than forcing farmers down the legal road to get value from their land and to continue their existence in these areas.  Surely people on the sides of hill and on some of the most challenging agricultural land in the country cannot be forced down these roads because these farmers have not been represented over the past four years, despite what people say.  We were told bluntly there was no more money under GLAS and that we were to be left in this situation for another four to six years until the next round.  We had no choice but to bring this to people&rsquo;s attention to get some justice for these farmers, otherwise there is a strong possibility they will not be there in six years&rsquo; time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600014#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jason Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418744400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>We held meetings around the country.

Many of these farmers, big, small and medium, had designated 20% or 25% of their land which could be used as an insurance policy to sell or plant if they needed money to put someone through college or if a member of the family became ill or needed to go into a nursing home.  Now that is gone and that has upset many people.  In the documentation we received it was made clear that the Government is committed to payment of a fair and proper level of compensation to landowners and land users who are at a financial loss as a result of the designation of this SPA.

However, we are where we are.  Going back to 1997, we should read the small print.  What was there in 1997, which S&iacute;le de Valera and I inherited when we came into the Department, was that a person would be compensated for any loss of income arising from a change from current practice.  That always excluded and always will the inability to get a grant or a planning permission which was clear from the legislation passed in the very beginning, which the IFA knew.  In other words, if a person was cutting turf at that time in a bog and was stopped, he or she had to be compensated.  It was black and white because that was a current activity.  On the other hand, if there was a loss of potential value into the future due to windmills or whatever needed planning permission, it was not compensable.  I say this because it is not just a problem here, but is one in Europe.  Much as I hate a lot of European law which is destroying the environment instead of helping it, I learned one hard lesson in all of this which is that one must study the book or one will get no answer.  Prescription farming has done more damage than good to the wildlife it purports to protect.<\/p><p>  If tomorrow those with responsibility for the OPW and natural heritage were totally on one's side and wanted to bring in a scheme and give one money, but had to do it legally, it would pose significant problems.  I found that when I tried to do it.  I remember when we destocked the hills the first time and wanted to pay farmers for the sheep we were taking down out of Exchequer funds, S&iacute;le de Valera and I went over to Europe.  I will not bore the committee with the details, but the conversation was very interesting and basically boiled down to us being told we could not pay the farmers.  I asked why not, given that it was our money, and I was told that we could not pay farmers as they were polluting the hills.  In other words, overstocking was equivalent to polluting.  Under the polluter-pays principle, one cannot compensate people for farming according to good practice.  What I came around to when I was in government, if Deputy O'Donovan wishes to listen, was to say let us pretend that the hills are 20% overstocked on average and that therefore we will only compensate farmers for 80 of every 100 sheep we take away.  I managed to persuade a good official in Teagasc, God rest his soul, to give me a good price for the sheep and 80% of the price he gave me was &pound;3 more per euro - and it was punts at the time - than the IFA had sought in compensation.  In that little slight of hand, I worked around the stupid and bizarre rules of the time.  I could not go straight at it even though I was the Minister because of what they were telling me.  We did not have permission to do it and it took six years to get permission for the scheme.  We just went off and paid for six years without approval and eventually the permission came through on that formulation.  The reality is that talking about potential value will lead one to hit the wall.  One will not get compensation.<\/p><p>  I happened to be travelling one day with a certain MEP from the north west who is still a member of the European Parliament.  I said that something had to happen in Europe given the way designation and environmental policy was decimating our country.  I said the MEP would have to go over, bang the table and get some change.  I received a very short answer and was told to forget it as most countries liked it the way it was as most of their designated areas were well away from habitation.  They do not have it our way.  I was told we would not get any sympathy over there for that, which closed off that door.  If one wanted to do it at this stage, the only legal approach would be to bring in a scheme and take certain actions.  I would be very interested to hear if anyone has told the witnesses otherwise.  We could not call it compensation but would price up the actions.  Europe would insist on each action being priced.  As long as those actions were carried out, we would agree to pay so much per hectare which we reckoned to be the economic cost of income foregone and the cost of carrying out the actions, including labour and time.  A scheme could be brought in on that basis by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The second thing that would put Europe and the Government on the back foot would be to provide that if 15 or 20 years is required for hen harriers as the minimum timescale, a scheme should last for that period.  It should be a National Parks and Wildlife Service scheme, should not have rules on commonages and should allow everybody in.  If they are serious about the hen harrier, everybody should be in the gig and there is no point in not having it.<\/p><p>  Unless the IFDL bends what it is looking for - and I know what that is - it will not get it in its current form.  If it bends what it is looking for in accordance with the realities of the law and in a way that could be done by a sympathetic Minister, it might get damn near in cash terms what it wants.  We should be honest and acknowledge that a rose by any other name is still a rose.  Money is still money no matter how it is given.  There is a need for everyone to move into a space as to what is legally possible.  Some of the things I have been asked about do not seem legally possible.<\/p><p>  Finally, my dream is that we take a leaf out of David Cameron's book and renegotiate certain terms of our membership of the European Union, in which case, this issue should be on the agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600015#Q00100","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1418745000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>That is another day's work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600015#Q00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418745000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Would the fact that we are not polluting the hills like the hill farmers make a difference?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600015#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1418745000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I have a point I want to make on that.  First, I thank the witnesses for attending.  In the context of the steps they are trying to take, all members here have a concern that justice is seen to be done.  That is what we are looking for.  If we can assist in that, we are willing to do so.  This is a public forum where the people affected have an opportunity to present their cases before the Houses of Parliament and to put matters on the public record.  We must be careful that what we say here, we mean.<br\/>While I tend to agree with the last point that was made, it strikes me that in many ways this is a National Parks and Wildlife Service problem for which agriculture is being asked, possibly, to compensate.  I note that Mr. Fitzgerald is quoted in<i>The Corkman<\/i>as saying that in 2007 the Irish Government was given &euro;528 million which was ringfenced for natural amenities such as natural heritage areas, special areas of conservation and special protection areas, but only &euro;93 million of the money was applied to these areas and not 1 cent went to the hen harrier scheme.  If that was the case, my understanding is that it is a matter for the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht as opposed to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<br\/>When we looked at commonages more than 18 months ago, one presentation made to us was from the BurrenLIFE project.  The end product there was species-rich grassland in the same way that other farmers' product is milk or beef.  In respect of the matter before us, the end product is a healthy hen harrier population.  It seems then that a BurrenLIFE type scheme would compensate farmers on the basis of the number of years a scheme must remain in place and deal with a lot of the problems.  I may be wrong.  We should get officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to come here on foot of the presentation made here today.  We have been given a great deal of information of which I, certainly, was not aware on the historical situation, where we are now and where we should be going.<\/p> <p>This is not over yet by any means.  We have a role to play.  As a farmer, it would appear to me that what has been does is an injustice.  It is unfair.  Much has been said about the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and Rural Development Programme.  Under future CAP programmes public good is an important factor.  As such, this issue also crosses over into the CAP.  We will need to examine the rural development programme from the point of view of the agricultural aspect of this and to also look at other areas such as the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht that might have responsibility for this area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014121600015#Q00400","speaker":"1103","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418745600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>It is important to point out that the washing of the hands in public is all very well and good but the reality is that these people are living with a problem that was created under the negotiations carried out by the Irish Government at the time when the directive was being drawn up by the European Commission.

It is important to put our resourcing in the context of the operating priorities we have had since 2011.  The statement of strategy for the Department from 2012 to 2014 set out a mission and key goals for the Department on the taking of office by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.<\/p> <p>The mission the Minister set was to support the creation of good jobs by promoting the development of a competitive business environment in which enterprises will operate to high standards and grow in sustainable markets.  Our Department was structured to meet this mission, and resources in a resource-constrained environment were allocated accordingly.  Our strategy sought to clearly articulate the challenges facing the organisation, identify the options for meeting those challenges and plot the milestones towards delivering solutions.  In framing our mission in 2011, the Department had particular regard for the Programme for Government priorities, especially employment creation, against a backdrop of a very challenging economic context framed by acute financial and human resource constraints.  In summary, our mission was centred on a strategy for jobs, with an ambitious vision of Ireland having 2 million people in work by 2020.<\/p><p> The key supporting goals for that jobs mission were framed around getting the business environment right and helping enterprises to develop their own potential.  Those goals, and therefore priority areas for the allocation of resources, both financial and staffing, were set as championing enterprise through making Ireland the best small country in which to do business and enlisting the widest possible support within and outside Government for this goal and, secondly, improving competitiveness and access to finance to regain the competitive edge necessary to underpin a successful small open economy.  The third goal focused on enterprise development and jobs and maximising jobs growth, especially through the development of a strong indigenous enterprise base, the attraction of foreign direct investment and the development of cross-enterprise networks.  The fourth goal was to increase exports and to support enterprises achieve challenging export targets. The fifth goal focused on regulation and making markets, including the labour markets, work more efficiently through smart regulation which encouraged innovation, keen competition, high standards of compliance and consumer protection, but without unnecessary regulatory costs.  A further goal focused on innovation and developing a broad based innovation strategy to make our enterprises more competitive and developing sectors with potential so as to prioritise sectors of opportunity and systematically remove obstacles and develop enabling policies. <\/p><p> That jobs mission and those key supporting goals informed decisions, since 2011, and resource allocation across the Department and our agencies.  Such resource prioritisation was a key management challenge for the Department, and for our individual agencies, at a time when resources were being reduced as the national finances were being brought into better shape.  Since the economic downturn in 2008, the Department has had to operate, as have all publicly-funded agencies, in an environment of reduced resources.<\/p><p> The well known phrase of \"doing more with less\" was a goal.  Our Department saw its resources reduced from approximately &euro;2 billion, which included the budget for F&Aacute;S and related activity, to &euro;804 million in 2014 and from 1,075 posts to 802 by the end of 2014.  Some 200 posts were lost separate to the F&Aacute;S related Departmental transfers.  It is on record that the Department advised the Minister that it had, in its view, reached the limit of its capacity to downsize while delivering the Government's ambitious agenda on the jobs, regulatory, enforcement activity and related fronts.  On the reduction of posts, the net loss of 200 staff, since the moratorium on recruitment was introduced in 2009, is a decrease of over 20%.  Naturally, as a result of that decrease in staffing, pressure points have developed in the Department as well as in some of our agencies.  This has required careful workforce planning responses such as, for example, the assignment of additional resources to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement at the height of its work in the Anglo and related investigations.  In addition, we proactively prioritised tasks to match the reduced staffing levels as well as working with staff to work smarter and more efficiently, including, for example, streamlining business processes for the workplace relations bodies and merging various activities in the employment permit application process.  Also, on foot of Government decisions and at the request of the Minister, Forf&aacute;s was reorganised and its core policy staff integrated into the Department.<\/p> <p>That decision was taken to streamline policy-making on the enterprise, science, technology and innovation and broad competitiveness agenda and to enhance the Department's capacity to directly influence those key areas of policy across other Departments and agencies which would be crucial to the delivery of the action plan for jobs and fostering economic recovery.<\/p><p> The priority since 2011 has centred on the jobs agenda in particular and ever more scarce resources have been allocated accordingly in the context of aggregate resources reducing significantly.  We have taken steps to address that shortage of resources and have worked with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to obtain sanctions to fill critical posts because now that we have come below the employment control framework target that was set for us we are in a position to do that.  We have received sanction to fill several critical vacancies.  We are in the process of doing that at principal and assistant principal level and at other grades.  We will also, for the first time in five years, recruit at the recruitment grade levels in the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014121600003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418737200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Every Department has had to deal with constrained resources.  It is one of the facts of post-crisis Ireland and every Department has had to ensure that it delivers but had to do more with less.  Against the backdrop of the objectives we set ourselves, which the Secretary General read out, we have delivered very strongly with diminishing resources on championing enterprise and seeking to make this a good business environment.  We have gone up in all the rankings for ease of doing business, recorded by the World Bank and the various competitiveness bodies and even the National Competitiveness Council has recorded very significant improvements in key areas.<\/p><p>  There is also a strong resurgence in start-ups.  Many of the policies we have pursued, such as the establishment of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, have helped deliver that.  Our most recent initiative was the Young Entrepreneur of the Year competition, which was massively oversubscribed.  More than 1,000 young entrepreneurs applied and we announced the winner last week.  This resurgence is due in no small part to the efforts of the Department.<\/p><p>  The harmonised competitiveness index has improved and for access to finance we have put out a large number of new non-bank financial sources that were not there before, some administered through our Department such as the micro-finance, the loan guarantee, the development capital fund, the seed and venture capital funds and the innovation funds.  They have shown significant take-up and impact in filling what all Members recognise as a gap in access to finance.  Most recently the Strategic Bank Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, is being developed and the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, has put money into that.<\/p><p>  The Industrial Development Authority, IDA, has had a record performance in each of the past three years, each one better than the one before, the best in over a decade.  We have protected the IDA from any diminution in resources.  Even though we have cut staff numbers we have protected the IDA because in the teeth of the crash we believed that winning new external investment was an absolute priority. <\/p><p>  On the other front, Enterprise Ireland had a record year last year.  It has battled back from a tougher environment.<\/p> <p>Enterprise Ireland companies hit their target for 2015 exports in 2013.  They well exceeded the targets set by the previous Government and are now setting themselves more ambitious targets.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will be publishing their strategies for the coming years within the next month or two, in which they will set out their ambition to continue this high level of performance and address some of the issues that the committees have frequently raised around regional enterprise.<\/p><p> In terms of regulation, we have undertaken a lot of rationalisation to deliver, as stated by the Secretary General, more effectively in a constrained environment.  There has been a number of elements to this, including the merger of the Competition Authority with the National Consumer Agency into a single market focused agency and the reorganisation, by way of legislation currently before the Houses, of the five employment rights bodies to create a single first point of access and a single appellant body.  The performance of those bodies is already showing great improvement.<\/p><p> In regard to work permits for Irish based and overseas companies, for which there is considerable demand, the legislation in this regard has been rationalised to ensure more efficient procedures and delivery of the current service in a much more effective manner.  A major amendment to our company law structure was recently passed, in respect of which I thank committee members for their support.  As a result of this more streamlined legislation it is now easier for businesses to understand their obligations to comply in terms of the management of their businesses.<\/p><p> Our objective throughout all of this is to maintain the highest standards in terms of observation of competition law, observation of employment rights, observation of health and safety standards and so on, while at the same time creating a back office that is more efficient and allows us to deliver in these areas with fewer resources.  Much of the same has been done in the area of innovation.  Members will be aware of the research prioritisation exercise which examined how our resource budget was being deployed.  We sought to focus in that exercise on areas where we could sustain a long-term competitive advantage while having world-class science.  We are delivering that reprioritisation of our resources.  A measure of this is that all of our science budget allocation now requires a 30% non-Exchequer element as standard.  In other words, companies must show they can leverage additional resources to those that we put in.<\/p><p> On developing sectors, we have looked hard at what sectors have a long term and sustainable future and have sought to create an environment within which we can build on them.  We have looked at sectors such as the big data initiative, innovation health hub and so on where we can grow long-term competitive advantage and have sought to deploy our resources within those sectors.  In terms of resourcing, there will always be a need for more resources and more things we could do if allocated more.  To be fair to Government colleagues, they have recognised the importance of enterprise and employment and while we have suffered constraints on the manpower side, we have been able to maintain our capital budgets, which most other Departments were not permitted to do.  This has allowed us to support the type of employment expansion we are enjoying.  We are determined to continue to support this area.  This relates to our central mission, which is a balanced mission that puts employment at the heart of what we do but in enterprises that work in sustainable ways to high standards, protecting employment rights and environmental standards and observing competition and health and safety.  That is our mandate.  I hope that we are delivering it effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014121600005#F00200","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418737500,"counter":95,"content":"<p>The first speaker is Deputy Calleary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014121600006#G00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1418737800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Secretary General and the officials for their input.

There was an issue about a shortage of people, not just of officers in the Department, but of somebody with exactly the right background and skills that knew the context in which the material had been provided and would be in a position to review it.  It is a matter of regret that it was not processed as quickly as it might have been or should have been.  I have no difficulty in saying that.<\/p><p>  One must also understand the volume and complexity of what we were trying to deliver in that particular part of the Department.  The receipt of the statement and supporting documentation exactly coincided with finalising the Companies Bill.  We had to put together a large team, for example, just to proofread the document, which contained more than 1,000 sections.  It coincided with the beginning of a very busy EU Presidency.  Our Department had the largest role in the 2013 EU Presidency, because we directly service Council formations across a number of areas including competitiveness, research and employment.  We had an extremely busy workload at that time, not just in the immediate division but also across the rest of the Department.  Ms Breda Power is from the division and can confirm that.  The Minister referred to a number of the things we have been seeking to deliver in that period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014121600008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1418738100,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I am on record as acknowledging the huge input of the Department in the Presidency.

The Secretary General spoke about the highest standards of compliance being an aim of the Department.  The Minister spoke about maintaining the highest standards.  Surely, when a new dossier arrived in December 2012, alarm bells should have gone off immediately and an attempt should have been made to get the proper skills, as had been done previously?  I point to the recruitment of a Queen's Counsel previously from outside the jurisdiction to examine some of the issues involved.

When this statement was presented to me, I took advice from the officials and it was decided that the witness statement should be issued to the Garda.  It was pointed out very clearly that provisions were very particular and not, as the Deputy suggested, a case of bundling this up and sending it to the Garda.  The Department can only release information in accordance with companies legislation.  It was made very clear that this research would have to be undertaken as to whether the witness statement and information could comply with a release process.<\/p> <p>As the Deputy knows, to wrongfully release information under that Act would be a criminal offence so this was something that had to be done.  I think the officials have explained the position.  This was an inquiry that started back in 1997.  It had run over a long number of years through a number of Ministers.  A number of documents were produced.  Every one of those documents was furnished to the authorities with the power to prosecute or proceed depending on their context.  It went to the Revenue Commissioners, the ICDE, the Moriarty tribunal and the Mahon tribunal.  All of that information had already been released to bodies that had the power.<br\/>The powers under section 19 as I understand it - the officials can explain it more fully - are preliminary investigation powers.  The intention always is that where a <i>prima facie<\/i>case is found it would be forwarded to the authorities; that had all been done.  However, clearly when this witness statement, which had been requested in 2006, arrived in 2012, it had to be examined by the Department and, as I said, that took longer than expected.  However, there are understandable reasons for that taking longer than expected - the very detailed work that had to be put into investigating the matters going back through the history of this and the requirement to ensure it was complaint with the terms of release under the Companies Act coupled with the fact of retirement.<br\/>There are obviously extenuating circumstances here.  It took longer than expected.  However, I remind the Deputy that every piece of information on which the witness statement was based was released to the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda, the Moriarty tribunal, the Mahon tribunal and the ODCE.  The Revenue Commissioners have already signalled that they dealt with the matter.  The Garda has also signalled that it dealt with the matter and reported to the DPP as appropriate.<br\/>I understand one of the issues was to ensure that the material was furnished to the Moriarty tribunal in time and it was furnished to that tribunal.  The Moriarty tribunal also had full access to the material.  That is the backdrop.  As the Secretary General has indicated, it would have been better if this could have been processed more quickly, but nothing fundamentally hinged on it, in that all the evidence on which it was based had already been furnished to the various authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014121600010#L01100","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418739000,"counter":130,"content":"<p>People watching this now will be aware that a civil servant was involved in investigating a number of very serious allegations, created a witness statement and provided that witness statement to the Department.

It is proposed that the committee consider the merit of the submission of a political contribution on this proposal.  The political contribution would focus on the following: the committee's concern regarding the lack of clarity in the scope of the agreement from a sufficiently early stage; the fact that an exemption was not carved out for Ireland and other member states, as had been done previously; the issue of proportionality; and that the committee recommends in future proposals which relate to sector policy areas within which certain member states have traditionally been exempted should indicate clearly from the beginning the intended scope of application, and this would allow member states the full opportunity to scrutinise the proposal and submit a reasoned opinion within the allowed 56 day timeframe.

As you are aware, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has asked the committee to scrutinise the heads of the general scheme of the planning and development (No. 1) Bill 2014 and to report to him prior to the Bill being published.  We will have three meetings, including the meeting today, to consider the issue.  The other two meetings will be in January 2015, after which we will prepare and agree a report for submission to the Minister.  We have invited several organisations to address us at these meetings and we have invited written submissions from several other organisations.  It will be interesting and it is appropriate to start the process today with an outline from the Department on why this legislation is being introduced and on what the Department hopes it will achieve by its enactment.  I call on Mr. Sheridan from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to deliver an opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014121600003#J00200","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418739300,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman and committee members for offering us the opportunity to contribute to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the planning and development (No. 1) Bill.  As the Vice Chairman indicated, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is keen to progress the Bill and have it enacted as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The primary background to the general scheme is the housing supply shortage issue, one of the most political and high-priority challenges faced by Government.  The supply shortage is particularly acute in Dublin, where demand far outstrips supply, with consequential effects on house prices and rents.<\/p><p>  Let us put the issue in context.  At the height or peak of construction activity in 2006, over 93,000 houses were built nationally.  The figure plummeted to a little over 8,000 units in 2013.  There is a real need to increase the number of house completions gradually over several years to return to market equilibrium where supply equals demand.<\/p><p>  The measures in the general scheme emanate largely from the Government's Construction 2020 strategy.  These measures alone will not resolve the housing supply problems, which are multifaceted and require a broad&ndash;ranging co-ordinated approach.  However, the intention is that they will help to make a start in addressing these problems.<\/p><p>  The measures proposed in the general scheme include the amendment of the Part V provisions on social and affordable housing; the introduction of a vacant site levy aimed at incentivising the development of vacant and under-utilised sites in central urban areas; revised arrangements to enable the application of reduced development contribution levies by planning authorities; and the introduction of a mechanism to enable planning authorities to reduce the duration of planning permission in specific circumstances.<\/p><p>  I will address these issues individually, starting with the proposed amendment to the Part V provisions.  The general scheme proposes that the current obligation on developers to provide up to 20% of the land in a development for social and affordable housing be reduced to 10%, and that this be now apportioned for social housing only.  The existing Part V arrangements, involving a 20% requirement for social and affordable housing, are a significant burden for developers in the current economic climate and one of the factors rendering many developments financially non-viable at present.  It is further proposed that the affordability aspect of the current Part V arrangements should instead be pursued through other wider policy areas and, therefore, be removed from Part V, with only the social housing provisions being retained.<\/p><p>  In addition, it is proposed that the on-site provision of social housing will become the predominant or default option for developers and local authorities under the new Part V provisions, with the alternative off-site option, for example, dwellings on other sites, only possible in specific exceptional circumstances, for example, where there is insufficient social housing demand at the location of the proposed development or where there is greater demand at another location.  Furthermore, it is proposed that the option under the current Part V arrangements of developers making cash contributions to local authorities instead of providing housing units be discontinued.<\/p> <p>It militates against the immediate delivery of social housing units and the mixed tenancy model which was one of the positive outcomes of Part V as it was originally constituted.  In effect, it is proposed that the provision of housing units on-site or off-site will become the only possibilities under the new Part V arrangements.<\/p><p> The second main proposal in the general scheme relates to the proposed application of a vacant site levy by local authorities, if they wish to do so, to incentivise the development of vacant under-utilised sites in central urban areas, thereby ensuring such sites are brought into beneficial use.  This is in line with action 23 in the Government&rsquo;s Construction 2020 strategy.  It is proposed that the levy will be applied on the registered owners of vacant and under-utilised sites in cities and towns with populations of more than 3,000 at a rate of 3% of the market valuation of the site, increasing by 1% per year up to a maximum of 6% in any individual year.  These rates are broadly in line with those already applied under the derelict site levy.  There are numerous vacant under-utilised urban sites throughout the length and breadth of the country.  Dublin City Council has advised that approximately 600 sites in the area between the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal are lying dormant and undeveloped but are capable of being developed.  If local authorities are to be entitled to apply the levy, in the first instance they will be required to provide for the development of vacant sites in specific locations within urban areas as a specific objective in their local development plans.  This proposed measure would be supplemented by the application of reduced development contributions on such sites when planning permission is granted, having regard to the likelihood that when such sites are developed, their central locations will mean they will be able to avail of existing infrastructure rather than rely on the provision of new infrastructure at extra cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014121600003#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terry Sheridan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418739900,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I have to advise Mr. Sheridan that a vote has been called in the Seanad.

In essence, the levy will entail a carrot and stick approach, incentivising developers to develop vacant under-utilised sites while also applying lower development contribution levies on the development of such sites, and only penalising those who opt not to bring forward proposals to develop the sites in question.<\/p><p>  Further to action 14 of the Construction 2020 strategy, it is also proposed that developers be allowed to avail of reduced development contribution levies in specific circumstances.  Under the current legislation, developers are obliged to pay the levies which are in place at the time a planning permission is granted.  Where a development contribution scheme is subsequently revised by a local authority to apply lower development levies, a developer with an existing planning permission is unable legislatively to avail of the revised lower levies. <\/p><p>  Accordingly, it is now proposed that the current provisions be amended so that developers with planning permissions granted under previous development contribution regimes can avail of the reduced development contribution charges introduced under new development contribution schemes.  This flexibility measure is intended to assist in making developments more economically viable and thereby bring them on-stream earlier than might otherwise be the case.<\/p><p>  The final measure in the general scheme listed as action 20 in the Construction 2020 strategy proposes that applicants for planning permission in respect of housing developments of scale, ten houses or more, shall be required to indicate their proposed development schedule on their application form.  Where the development is subsequently not progressed in line with the indicated schedule, without reasonable justification, planning authorities will be enabled to reduce the duration of the permission.  In essence, this proposal is aimed at incentivising developers to activate permissions earlier rather than later, a form of &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; provision, so that developments can come on stream earlier and not be unduly delayed.<\/p><p>  I should also add that this general scheme is being progressed in association with a separate general scheme of a planning and development (No. 2) Bill, dealing with the establishment of an office of the planning regulator as recommended by the Mahon tribunal; the commencement of the preparation of a new national planning framework as a successor to the National Spatial Strategy 2002; the introduction of e-planning relating to online planning applications and appeals and certain other streamlining measures relating to the planning system; and other miscellaneous provisions.<\/p><p>  The general scheme of the (No. 2) Bill is expected to be published this week and we are willing to avail of pre-legislative scrutiny for the second Bill should the committee so desire.  In terms of timeframes, the Minister is anxious that the (No. 1) Bill is enacted as quickly as possible with the (No. 2) Bill to be enacted by the end of 2015.  Splitting the provisions into two Bills is intended to facilitate the earlier enactment of those provisions which are required most urgently to help address the current housing supply shortage.  We thank the Vice Chairman for affording us the opportunity to outline the provisions in the forthcoming planning and development (No. 1) Bill to him and the committee today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014121600005#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terry Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1418740200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Mr. Sheridan&rsquo;s statement summarised the heads of the Bill very well.  There are some good ideas in it but it is important that they are workable and that there are no get out of jail clauses in it.  I am concerned about the subjective aspects.  What scrutiny will there be on the vacant site levy because much of it will be done at local level?  Will it be exclusively the executive that makes decisions or will it be a cross between the executive and a reserved function?<\/p><p>  Why was the 10% exclusively for social housing increased from four to nine houses?  The smaller schemes will be in rural areas and there will be a higher dependence on a direct provision for social housing there because there will not be the throughput.  Was that considered?  A point made on page ten in the general scheme is that \"In the light of current conditions and the substantial improvement in housing affordability in the last six years for persons in employment, there is no longer a justification for providing 10% affordable housing under Part V\".<\/p> <p>I do not think that statement stands up if we are to look at the increases in house prices, the issue of affordability for the increasing number who are at work but on low pay plus the requirement for a 20% deposit.  Will the witnesses comment on the issue of affordability?  Will affordability be exclusively determined by market forces?  Have they anything in mind on equalising the provision of social and affordable housing?  Have they considered a third type of delivery of the housing strategy such as the heightened involvement of housing agencies not exclusively for social housing, but for the provision of housing for renting in general?  It is very hard to see how that will be overcome.<\/p><p> I will address the third point in head 4C of the general scheme of the planning and development (No. 1) Bill 2014 regarding \"entering into a rental accommodation available agreement or a leave agreement\".  What I found is that, in theory, some of the provision of Part V might work but, in practice, the construction industry has been very capable of negotiating to its own advantage.  My argument is that much of our planning legislation has been far too influenced by the construction sector.  Local authorities do not have specialist negotiators and do not have an equality in terms of negotiating skills to enter into discussions with the very capable negotiators from the construction sector.  Instead of getting houses, they will enter into a rental accommodation availability agreement or lease arrangements with the planning authority.  I have serious reservations about that and I ask the witnesses to expand on that point.<\/p><p> We need to increase the number of houses built but what struck me is that we are making a decision in light of the current economic environment.  I wonder if the insertion of a sunset clause has been considered so that it can be reviewed and there is a definite date for review of the reduction from 20% to 10% in Part V, as well as the additional sweeteners in the development contribution scheme.  This would ensure this offer is available in the current environment, but could be reviewed when the current environment is no longer applicable.<\/p><p> I am concerned about the subjective nature of the vacant site levy and some of the aspects of the non-application of the levy.  It is a good idea in principle, but I found the implementation of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 very frustrating.  There was a provision for an annual levy on derelict sites, but most local authorities were not enforcing that provision because of the heavy legal and administrative burden in respect of the title of some of the properties.  How will that differ from the vacant site levy and have those issues been thought out?.  Have soundings been taken from the people who did the practical work of implementing the Derelict Sites Act?  That did not and does not work in the way it had been intended.<\/p><p> The development contributions have not been enforced for water and wastewater in the past 12 month because of the handover to Irish Water.  It appears to me that a new development scheme will need to be introduced for each planning authority to take account of the possibility of a reduced development contribution in the situations that are outlined in the heads of the Bill and also in respect of Irish Water.  I think sunset clauses would be useful as a mechanism to review the operation of the legislation.<\/p><p> The argument for the redevelopment of vacant sites was well made.  Reusing these sites reduces the need for new infrastructure.  I do not think we have given sufficient consideration to the additional cost of fragmented development, which is much more costly in terms of the delivery of roads, water and wastewater services, footpaths and associated services.<\/p><p> I have a number of individual questions which I will submit to the Department and I would appreciate a written response to them.  We need to get this new legislation on planning right.  It seems to me that the input of the construction sector is very evident.  I appreciate the need to increase the housing supply, which is to the benefit of everybody, but it appears that the construction industry held off building new houses until they got the changes they are looking for.  We will see how that transpires next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014121600005#M00300","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418740800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Sheridan like to deal with some of those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014121600006#N00200","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418740800,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy for her detailed comments.  I will respond to her questions on planning, the vacant site levy and development contributions and my colleagues, Mr. Terry Dunne and Mr. John O'Connor, will respond on Part V related issues.<\/p><p>  On whether the introduction of the vacant site levy will be an executive or a reserve function of the local authority members, the idea is that the levy will be an integral part of the adoption of the development plan by a local authority.  It is an optional exercise for local authorities.  The local authorities can adopt this provision if they so desire or can decide not to pursue it initially and wait to see how some local authorities implement it.  It will be a reserve function to be adopted as part of the adoption of a development plan for the local authority area in question.<\/p><p>  Deputy Murphy raised her concerns about the subjective aspects of the application of the levy, in particular to the application of the derelict sites levy.  I admit that the derelict sites levy has been difficult to administer and relatively easy to circumvent.  All the property owner has to do is put a hoarding around the development to keep the public from gaining access to it. <\/p> <p>It is intended to be applied to sites and buildings that are dangerous in structure in order that a hoarding is erected around them.  The vacant site levy will be a different animal and it will apply where there is hoarding of vacant and under-utilised sites with a view to getting them back into beneficial use.<\/p><p> On the development contributions, we can possibly consider the idea of a sunset clause.  We wrote to local authorities in 2013 asking them to reduce the levies they apply with a view to reducing the burden on the construction sector and they virtually all responded positively and reduced the levies they applied.  The four Dublin local authorities applied an average reduction of 26%.<\/p><p> As the Deputy will be well aware, we have had some engagement on the issue of Irish Water and water services infrastructure.  We asked and advised local authorities at the end of 2013 to ensure development contributions in respect of planning permissions granted before the establishment of Irish Water covered the cost of the water services infrastructure and planning permissions granted after the establishment of Irish Water on 1 January this year should not be applied in respect of water services infrastructure.

If the Deputy would like to send in a written submission if she feels I have not addressed issues she raised in this regard, I would be happy to take it.  We have increased the minimum number of houses in a development from five to ten because when the minimum number was five, under the 20% clause there was one of the houses taken out and because we have done away with the cash and site alternative meaning the options are reduced.  That touches on the other issue raised by the Deputy regarding developers having greater negotiating skills than the local authority in this regard.  We have reduced the options in terms of negotiation.  The focus is on increasing the supply of housing because without private housing, there is no Part V benefit and we are back to where we were prior to 2000.  With regard to the supply of units be they on site as a default option or another site if there is no demand where the development is taking place, the cash alternative is being taken away.<\/p><p>  The scope in terms of having a mishmash as happened in the past where the developer would pay some cash and provide a house or land elsewhere is gone.  Now it is about getting units and going back to the core of what Part V is about, which is providing social housing in mixed tenure developments and moving away from large social housing developments to social housing developments within private housing developments.  It is the mixed tenure model, which is probably one of the greatest successes of it.<\/p><p>  I note what the Deputy said about the affordability issue.  I accept house prices are increasing.  They have gone up again since the heads were published but there are other ways in which they can be addressed.  In the social housing strategy, we are looking at approaches such as cost rental and so on.

First, we have the biggest housing emergency in the history of the State and we urgently need social housing on a mass scale.  Second, house prices are rising faster than they did during the boom.  What is being proposed in this Bill will reduce the proportion of social housing from 20% to 10%.  Why is it proposed to take affordable housing out of these planning permissions given that house prices are rising faster than they have for years?  It is suggested that the requirement to build affordable housing is too much of a burden on developers.  Why would that matter to the developer if he or she is getting a price for the housing?  Most of the affordable housing was supplied through the local authorities, which took the hit for the claw back.<\/p><p>  The Bill also provides for an off-site option.  I saw how this was applied when I was a councillor in Fingal.  I live in Mulhuddart, which has the highest concentration of social housing in one square mile.  However, there is very little social housing in Castleknock or Malahide.  The Bill proposes that the off-site option would only be permitted in exceptional cases or where there is insufficient social housing demand at the location of the proposed development.  People in Killiney or Malahide might say there is not much demand for social housing.  We will continue to see social housing being built in certain areas but not in others.  That is the end of mixed tenure.<\/p><p>  I am probably in a unique situation in that I live in a mixed estate of 700 units.  The estate is a mixed private, social and affordable housing development and, in fairness to Fingal County Council, nobody knows who lives in what unit.  Why is that concept being dropped?  Part V was ineffective.  It only delivered 15,000 units between 2002 and 2011, or 2.5% of all houses built.  However, it delivered a higher number of affordable housing for people who, like me, were single and unable to buy in the market.  Surely we need more housing of this nature.  Why is that provision being removed?<\/p><p>  The development levies, which we were told were urgently needed to provide community centres, etc., are being reduced.  I see in this Bill a continuation of our reliance on and worship of private developers in the belief that somehow they will solve the social housing situation.  Senator Hayden estimated that 45,000 houses would have been built under the old scheme if it had been properly enforced.  If this policy was in place, it would have delivered 15,000 units.  It is an easing of the compulsion on developers to provide social and affordable housing.<\/p><p> What is the basis for the claim that house prices have fallen?  House prices are rocketing.  The Bill is premised on the notion on the notion that we no longer need affordable housing.  I might have agreed with that five years ago, when I saw estates in which social housing could not be sold because it was cheaper to find housing on the private market.  That is no longer the case.  It is certainly not the case if we are to build mixed housing in areas where the demand is high.<\/p> <p>This confirms my opinion that old-style public housing construction, which involved councils being given the money to build social and affordable housing, is needed.  These kinds of schemes will deliver very little for the people out there who are desperate.  As public representatives, we deal with such people in our clinics every day.  I think we need compulsory purchasing of sites that are not being used.  We should forget about trying to incentivise these people.  Compulsory purchase orders should be used.  There is an absolutely dire social crisis out there.  It is an unbelievable crisis.  I will not even bother going into the types of cases we are coming across here.  Surely we need to take extraordinarily radical measures, such as acquiring sites that are not being used and providing compensation at a minimal rate.  We should give money to councils to build.<\/p><p> I was very disappointed to hear that we are going to see more rental accommodation scheme-type houses or more leasing of houses.  I thought that council houses and social houses would be provided to people.  We all know about the instability.  We know a load of people who are being evicted from rental accommodation scheme houses right now.  Their landlords want to sell those houses in a rising housing market.  People are being made homeless.  This is adding to the instability.  Not only is the current approach disappointing, but in addition it is based on the wrong premise that house prices are falling.  They are not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014121600008#P00900","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418742600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>The main aim of the proposed changes to Part V is to make it clearer and simpler in relation to its implementation.  The primary aim is to ensure there is 10% social housing in every development.  The Deputy spoke about what was achieved previously.  Housing was provided.  There were cash payments.  There was off-site land.  Once that was fully operational, it resulted in an average of 5% of each development being provided for social and affordable housing.  Just one in three of those houses was deemed to be social housing.  The aim is to ensure we get 10% social housing in each development.  It will be possible for that to be provided off-site in exceptional circumstances only, for example, if the local authority does not have a demand in a particular area.  Local authorities should be seeking to reach the 10% social housing level in the locations mentioned by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also asked about the negotiations.  The local authority has the say.  If it wishes to acquire housing for social housing purposes, or if it wants to get a voluntary housing body to acquire that housing, it is up to it to negotiate and take that option.  She also asked about adding in the long-term leasing or rental of those properties.  This would mean that a local authority which does not have the capital funding - if there is an issue in terms of funding the acquisitions - would have the fall-back option of leasing or renting those houses in the long term.  I would expect that local authorities should take up the option of acquiring them so that they are owned by local authorities or approved housing bodies.  It is a question of trying to get greater certainty with regard to the acquisition of social housing.  The cash option and the off-site land option have been removed to try to achieve the main social housing objective.<\/p><p>  I agree with the Deputy that the affordability of housing is a huge issue.  If we are to try to achieve housing affordability in a broader sense, we need to stimulate housing supply.  A large amount of housing supply is needed to ensure housing is generally affordable to everyone and to all households, as opposed to trying to provide a limited number of affordable houses.  This will be kept under review.  If there is a need to introduce incentives or measures to make housing affordable and support people in buying houses, provisions have been and can be made in that regard.  The Deputy spoke about the provision of broader public housing by local authorities.  A number of them are actively looking at that.  Rather than relying on developers to provide housing, we need to provide public housing.  The other issue, which is part of the social housing strategy and the broader 2020 construction strategy, involves looking at cost rental.  I refer to the provision by local authorities and voluntary housing bodies of housing that is rented on a broader basis and made affordable for households.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014121600009#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1418742600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I welcome the initiative to try to get more houses on the ground.  As one of the officials said, this is the main aim of the Bill.  Developers and builders are not building.  I hope this Bill will incentivise houses and developers.  I do not suppose the Government can build every house.  We have to ensure the people who can build houses start building again.  The banks are a huge problem there as well.  That will have to be looked at as well.  I welcome the incentives that are there, including the 10% to actually get it on the ground.  I welcome the fact that there is no buy-out for developers.  They will have to provide it on the ground.<\/p><p>  I have a question about the different interpretation of the Shackleton case.  There is only payback now in one direction.  The local authorities will have to put the 10% on the ground.  The funding for that 10% will come from the local authorities.  Will they have to take it from parks or whatever?  If we are to ensure this is provided on the ground, we have to ensure they will have the cash to do that there as well.<\/p><p>  I would like to speak about the affordability aspect.  I was reading somewhere that it will be pursued through other policies.  I think we should try to pursue that alongside.  I know it is not planning and whatever.  It is social and affordable.  Some of the speakers have said that the price of housing is going up.  I think it has to be looked at in conjunction with, if perhaps not part of, the planning Bill.  It should be part of our deliberations to ensure affordability.<\/p><p>  That brings me on to the vacant site levy, which is welcome in every community where there is a derelict site.  I think there is a difference between a derelict site and a vacant site.  The derelict site levy puts the onus on the developer.  It should only stay there.  The site levy tax will be passed on to the purchaser.  Therefore, it will make the price of houses dearer as well.  I know what we are trying to do.  We have to ensure they are not left vacant there.  How does one incentivise them to get it?  Are they left vacant because they cannot get money from the bank?  Would the developers get out in the morning if they could get the money to develop these vacant sites, as opposed to derelict sites?  They will say \"right, there is a levy there\".  They will ask how they are going to get their money back.  They will put up the house even more on the purchaser.  Could it hinder instead of help?  We are trying to get more houses on the ground.  We are trying to make them less expensive, rather than more expensive.<\/p><p>  There is another thing as well.  The onus has been changed from four houses to nine houses.  The actual acreage of land is not increased at all in the Bill.  It was set at 0.2 acres in section 96 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Would it be an incentive for a developer to have that increased upwards, given that the housing numbers were increased upwards as well?  The development contribution will be reduced in specific circumstances to enable people to avail of that.  I think that is a good development.<\/p><p>  I would like to see the phrase \"exceptional circumstances\" defined.  They can opt out in exceptional circumstances.  One person's exceptional circumstances might be very different from my exceptional circumstances.  I do not know if it is defined anywhere.  Maybe it will be in the Bill.  What would constitute exceptional circumstances if there is to be an opt-out?  We saw what happened before.<\/p> <p>That is why Part V did not work in practice the way it was supposed to work in theory.  There were too many cases made of exceptional circumstances and too many buy outs.<\/p><p> On the vacant site levy in areas of population of 3,000, obviously that would apply to every part of Dublin.  In the urban area where I live there is a population of 3,000 in most areas.  That would include most urban populations.  I wish to question the exemption for developments of nine houses.  If a developer had a site that could hold 36 houses, he or she could submit the applications in tranches so that the site could be developed in sections.  Would he or she be exempt for each tranche of nine houses?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014121600009#Q00300","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418743200,"counter":232,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Sheridan like to define \"exceptional circumstances\"?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014121600010#R00200","speaker":"1087"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418743200,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I will leave that question related to Part V to my colleagues.<\/p><p>  I will address the vacant site levy and the question of the charge being passed on to purchasers, increasing the price of housing.

This is my first experience of pre-legislative scrutiny.  <br\/>I wish to query Mr. O'Connor about his contribution on the purchase of the Part V units.  He said that acquisition will not be a problem for the voluntary housing groups, approved housing bodies or local authorities.  Will he clarify who will have the first option of buying the units when they have been completed?  How is it decided which body will have priority?  Does the local authority have priority over an approved housing body?  Who allocates the units?  Is the allocation based on the local authority housing waiting list or on the approved housing body list?  <br\/>I wish to raise the issue of &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, as mentioned in the preamble and in the explanatory note.  Only one example is given.  The proposed Bill states:<blockquote>The alternative off-site option should only be possible in specific exceptional circumstances, for example where there is insufficient social housing demand at the location of the proposed development and where there is greater demand at another location. <\/blockquote>Unlike Senator Keane, I am from a rural area and I do not know one local authority in the country that does not have a waiting list for housing.  In that case, is the provision of &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; ruled out?  If I am wrong, please correct me.  I do not think there is a local authority in the country that does not have a waiting list.  It is very serious that we are inserting an out for exceptional circumstances, but we cannot identify any exceptional circumstances, because one can rule out the example given.  Is it possible that the provision for exceptional circumstances will be removed from the Bill altogether?<br\/>Is the proposed vacant site levy just another name for the derelict sites levy, in particular on brownfield sites in built up areas in towns and cities?  It states that the local authorities can implement this measure should they wish to do so.  Will the witnesses clarify what they mean by that?  Does that mean a local authority must bring forward a by-law or an agreement voted through by all the local authority members, which in my view will end up as a political issue?  I see no reason a local authority should be given the option of wishing to do so or otherwise, because it will vary from one local authority to another.  I do not think that is in the best interests of seeing more units on the ground.  <br\/>Will the local authorities who do not collect this levy be subject to a penalty?  At present the levy on derelict sites is 3% and in many local authorities this money is not being collected and the matter is being pushed to one side.  In fairness to the local authorities it is very difficult to collect it .  People are running away from it and the local authorities are chasing their tails.  We need to strengthen in legislation the ability of the local authorities to collect the levy.  I would like to know if there will be a penalty on the local authorities who do not collect this levy?  Does the levy fall when the site is sold or the property is with a company that changes hands? <\/p> <p>Companies are set up and closed down the next day and another one is set up.  The law is being circumvented.  I ask for clarity on this point.  <\/p><p> Will the reduction of the levies apply to all planning permissions without exception?  Mr. Sheridan referred in his submission to the development contribution levies in specific circumstances.  I ask him to outline the specific circumstances.  Is this not open to political interference whereby a local authority will decide that specific circumstances do not exist and it may decide not to levy it on certain properties depending on who owns them? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014121600010#R00900","speaker":"1162","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418743800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I will deal with the levy aspect with regard to vacant sites.  The first question is whether the vacant site levy is another name for the derelict sites provisions.  It is slightly different.  As the member implied, the derelict sites levy has been difficult for local authorities to enforce and to implement.  The intention is that this vacant site levy will be easier to enforce.  The derelict sites levy can be circumvented as I have outlined, by simply putting a hoarding around the site which makes it no longer dangerous.  The vacant site levy will be applied irrespective of whether there is a hoarding in place.  It will be applied if the site is not developed.  There is no obligation to develop the site under the derelict site levy provisions.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked for clarification as to the meaning of local authorities being enabled, should they wish to do so, to apply the levy.  That is meant to indicate that the levy will be optional for local authorities to apply; it will be up to them to decide whether they wish to apply it in their local areas, depending on their local circumstances.<\/p><p>  As I have outlined, it will be a matter for the elected members to decide when adopting the development plan whether they wish to go down the route of applying the levy in designated areas in the function area of their local authority.  <\/p><p>  On the collection issue and whether there should be a penalty for non-collection of the levy by local authorities, there are fairly stringent provisions in the general scheme, in the heads of the Bill, which outline that non-payment of the levy will expose the property owner to interest payments from day one, in the event of late payments.  In addition, the levy will remain a charge on the property until such time as the levy is discharged to the local authority.  Therefore, there is an incentive for the property owner to pay on time.  That will help to ensure speedier collection by local authorities.<\/p><p>  The Senator also referred to whether the levy would stay with the site if sold.  That is the intention.  If a site is not developed and if planning permission is not obtained within a specified period or development does not commence within a specified period, the levy would apply.  It will pass from one site owner to another if the site is sold.  <\/p><p>  The Senator asked about reduced development contributions and how they would be applied in specific circumstances.  What is intended is that the specific circumstances relate to where a developer has a permission granted under a previous development contribution scheme operated by a local authority.  Where the scheme changes in the meantime the developer will be able to avail of the reduced development contribution that has been introduced under the new development contribution scheme agreed by the local authority.  These are the specific circumstances.  There is no legislative provision or mechanism for developers to avail of the reduced development contributions at present.  This is intended to address that gap in the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014121600011#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terry Sheridan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418743800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>On Part V, local authorities are the planning authorities and housing authorities and they have the power.

By way of background information, in 99% of cases, in the case of any housing owned by voluntary housing bodies, the local authority has 100% nomination rights.  In the case of some sheltered housing funded under the capital assistance scheme, the local authority has 75% nomination rights to those properties.  Local authorities hold the principal nomination powers for housing.  If members have any issues with regard to allocation nominations I ask them to come back to me because the local authorities have strong powers and should be making all the allocations or the majority of allocations to any properties that become vacant and are owned by voluntary housing bodies.<\/p><p>  The executive of some local authorities were looking for flexibility with regard to exceptional circumstances.  For example, Cork County Council was very active on acquiring units for social and affordable housing under Part V.  The council wanted some flexibility so that if there was not a demand in a town for social housing but there was a demand in an neighbouring town, it would be enabled to use flexibility in order to provide housing in the location in which it was required.<\/p><p>  If, for example, very large houses were being built on a site and it was not appropriate to build smaller houses on that site and the local authority would not acquire large houses, the local authority could require that smaller houses be built on the site.

People were totally frustrated.  It was seriously bad planning.<\/p><p>  There has been an over-centralisation by this and previous Governments of services within Dublin city.  If we looked at the national spatial strategy overall, it would eliminate many of the bad planning decisions that have taken place over the years.  In recent times, the headquarters of Irish Water was located on Foley Street in the city centre.  The headquarters of Inland Fisheries Ireland is located here in Dublin as is the administration of SUSI grants and medical cards.  Everything is pulled into the city rather than decentralising those services back down to the country to provide for an even spread of people.  Within 100 km of this city, three and four bedroom houses can still be bought for less than &euro;30,000.  Only two months ago in my own village, six fine houses were sold at a knock-down bargain price of &euro;160,000 for all six.  Those properties were built during the boom years. In many counties across the midlands they are pulling down unfinished estates. <\/p><p>  Mr. Sheridan referred to overzoning of towns and villages.  While that was a serious problem, will the withdrawal of the zoning in those areas now lead to people suing local authorities up and down the country for compensation because what was valued at X euro is now worth less?<\/p><p>  A great deal needs to be done if town centres are to survive.  There is a significant problem with town centres because bad planning was allowed to take place.  Some of the larger stores were allowed to locate on the outskirts of towns and provide free car parking with the result that town centres with expensive car parking were killed off.  We need a strategy to bring forward measures to support business growth and job creation in town centres.  Many town centres are dying a slow death and we need incentives such as reduced rates in weak town centres.  What will further destroy town centres is the abolition of town councils which were there to support the nucleus of towns.  They are no longer in place but we will need some sort of town teams going forward to market and develop town centres.  We need guidelines for the development of town centres too.<\/p><p>  Another issue during the Celtic tiger years was that many heritage sites and buildings were destroyed.  We need guidelines built into the legislation to protect sites.  On the northside of Dublin as one walks to Croke Park, there was a fine structure of a Methodist church which was hit with a crack of a bulldozer one night.

He referred to the lack of green areas in urban city centres.  It is possible that the vacant site levy could be a mechanism to deliver more green areas in central urban areas.  We are possibly envisaging in the legislation a provision that no levy would be applied on a vacant site where its use was converted into a playground or green area as long as it was not vacant.  These are the kinds of details we are teasing out currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is something we are looking at and it may well be incorporated when the Bill is published.  We are only at the initial stage of proposing the heads of the general scheme, but it is something we are contemplating.<\/p><p>  A replacement national spatial strategy will be addressed in the second planning Bill and aimed at providing an overarching framework for balanced regional development.

I agree completely with him.  One of the purposes of the vacant site levy is to incentivise development of not just inner city areas, but country towns with populations of more than 3,000.

Is there, will there be or should there be a levy on unauthorised development?  Is there a timescale - such as two or five years - for how long an unauthorised development can last?

These will include assessing whether decisions generally are made in accordance with the planning guidelines and policy directives issued by the Minister, whether any formal systematic discrimination is applied in assessing planning applications, the procedures adopted and whether they give rise to any potential corruption risks and if appropriate standards of administration are applied.  These are the type of things the planning regulator will look at.  It will be an overseeing function of the regulator in assessing the performance of planning authorities.

We have spoken a lot today about affordability but the architects of the Bill would seem to place an unjust burden and would certainly make one-off houses that bit more unaffordable, given the extreme cost that is added as a result of the Bill, which is in the range of &euro;8,000 to &euro;10,000.  Has the Department looked at this issue?  Has the Department or the Minister any intention of introducing a Bill that will remove this clause, which would be very important, particularly to people living in rural Ireland?  Deputy Coppinger said earlier that prices in Dublin had rocketed.  That may be so but they certainly have not rocketed in rural Ireland, where there are also housing problems, as it is important to point out to the Department officials and which should never be forgotten.<\/p><p>  We speak a lot about social and affordable housing.  The Department should have a policy designed to take away the stigma from such housing.  We are trying to get a uniformity of housing across the country.  While we currently describe it as social and affordable housing, is there not better terminology or could we not blend it in better with local buildings and local developments by private builders that would remove that aspect from it?  I see a number of sites are already identified for housing as a result of the housing crisis.  Many of the people in those areas fell victim to the Celtic tiger and people who built homes at an enormous cost during the Celtic tiger era are now in negative equity, with some in substantial negative equity.  Now, local authorities are proposing to build houses and it is causing serious problems for some people, particularly as many of these will be on already established sites.  Could the Department come up with a better terminology, given it sounds alarm bells the minute social and affordable housing is mentioned?<\/p><p>  Planning is very much open to the interpretation of an individual planner.  There was always a huge problem where one planner would not have red brick or any brick on a house, while another would want all brick on a house.  There are huge inconsistencies in the interpretation of the planning rules and guidelines.  Is this problem being addressed and can the Department bring some uniformity to this area?<\/p><p>  Is it not true to say the planning system has failed town centres?  This has been added to by the imposition of parking charges in that people are afraid of their lives to park in the centre of a town because adequate parking has not been provided over the years.

It is very kind of the committee to have Mr. Fennessy, Ms Kerrigan and me before it for the second time.  The European Court of Auditors publishes its annual report every year and, in accordance with the Lisbon treaty, sends that report not just to the European Parliament, but also to national parliaments.  Our attendance here is to show that we exist, have some information to convey that may be of interest to the committee and are available today and at other times to inform members if we can.<\/p><p>  In regard to the 2013 report, the first point to make is that the accounts of the European Union are proper.  That is to say, we have not found any significant failings in the accounts themselves.  They are, in other words, a fair representation of the Union's balance sheets, inflows and outgoings.  There is always some confusion every year in that the claim is made that we do not actually sign off on the accounts.  In fact, we do sign off on them, as well signing off as on the EU's revenue.  We are saying, in effect, that the funds it raised were raised in a legal and proper way.  What we do not do in any year is say the accounts are entirely legal and regular, or at least that spending is entirely legal and regular.  This is because when we investigate individual payments on a random basis, as we are required to do by the treaty, we find that some of them are made without any appropriate sanction or, more likely, with small, medium or large errors in the transactions.  The accounts are fine, in other words, but some of the spending is done in an irregular fashion.  In fairness to the European Commission, which is in charge of most of this, it makes a real effort to keep that level of errors low, and we give an estimation of the impact of that effort in our annual report.  Were it not for its efforts both to make corrections in a given year and claw back moneys that should not have been spent, the 4.7% figure referred to on page 3 of our submission would have been nearly 6.5%.  That effort by the Commission makes a real difference.<\/p> <p> The key messages of the 2013 annual report will seem quite similar to last year but a few items are worth noting from an Irish point of view.  First, as for last year and indeed for quite a few years, the most error prone spending areas were regional policy, energy and transport, and rural development, environment and fisheries, most of that being in the rural development area.  As I said, the Commission makes real efforts to make corrections and recoveries, as do the member states.  Without those efforts the estimated error rate would have been 6.3%.<\/p><p> While we measure individual transactions on a random basis and sample basis, and estimate the level of error in those, we also look at the supervisory and control systems member states and the Commission use in maintaining control over the spend.  Some 80% of the EU spend happens at the member state level so it is important that member state systems are quite good.  <\/p><p> In this year's report there were some investigations of Irish systems in the agricultural area, particularly on direct payments, and we had some criticisms.  I suspect that if we did the same audit in two years' time things would be different because perhaps we would have caught the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the change of the system.  It had been updating its systems for mapping agricultural land and evaluating whether the land involved is properly claimed for but at the time we did the audit we found that those systems were not fully compliant.  We also found there was a backlog of corrections in that some individuals who had perhaps over-claimed were only being approached some years later in terms of recoveries and so forth.  To put it in perspective, we did not say that the systems were ineffective but that they were partially effective and we pointed out where improvements could be made and, I suspect, are already being made.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, from the Irish point of view, although it is not really a function of our work, the European Commission also did an audit and made some similar discoveries.  There is a discussion between the Irish authorities and the European Commission about whether and how much the European Commission should recover funds from Ireland in respect of those errors.  That is not my business.  I cannot tell the members about it because it is between the Commission and the member state.  There is a system called the conciliation process where the member state and the Commission engage about this, and I understand there were meetings under that conciliation process even last week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014121600004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Cardiff","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418739000,"counter":285,"content":"<p>What figures are involved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014121600005#F00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418739000,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I suspect tens of millions at least.

In other words, in every year, as with anybody, certain cash payments are made but certain commitments for the future are made also.  The European Court of Auditors has a concern that over time the future commitments are growing.  We regularly recommend that the European Commission should produce more focused, extensive cash flow projections so that it can keep control of this small risk.<\/p><p>  We also know that this year, spending in the 2007 to 2013 programming period - this report was in respect of the last year of that - tended to be focused on absorption.  In other words, when member states receive money the last thing they want to do is hand it back to the EU so they could find a way to spend it but sometimes there is pressure to spend it even where the rules are not fully followed or, more likely, where the actual objectives of the particular scheme will not be fully met by the particular spending.<\/p><p>  I will show the members the trajectory over the years.  In the mid-2000s the figure was very high at 6.9%.  In fact, in 2006 it would have been even higher.  It has been relatively stable in the past few years at 4.7%, 4.8% and 3.9%.  We give a point estimate but as with an opinion poll it is this number plus or minus an amount, and the upper and lower level lines show that.<\/p> <p>Therefore, it could be said that the rate has been relatively stable for the past two or three years.<\/p><p> In regard to the 2% rate, which is what we say is material, we do not decide what is acceptable.  It is the European Parliament and the Council which are the discharge authorities and they decide whether they accept that or not.  Whether a 5% level is either a good achievement or a bad achievement probably depends on the particular scheme.  In other words, some schemes are very difficult to control while other schemes are less difficult to control.<\/p><p> I will move on to the issues that tend to be of more importance in Ireland because we are net receivers.  In the rural development area, most issues come from non-compliance with eligibility requirements for particular schemes or projects, especially in regard to agri-environment commitments.  When one receives money in the rural development area, there is very often a commitment to particular agricultural practices which have to be met, and there may be specific requirements for investment projects which are sometimes not met or there are procurement rules which are sometimes not met.  Some people ask whether that means there is a lot of waste.  In fact, in many cases it means that the money is not wasted in that the particular project the money is being paid over for may be carried through, but some of the conditions of that project, for example, that the member state will do X, Y and Z, may not be fully met.<\/p><p> We regularly find that if the member states had used all the information available to them, the error rate could have been maintained at a much lower rate - in theory, at 2% instead of at 6.7%.  In practice, that would probably be very difficult to achieve but, nonetheless, it does show there is a scope for improvement at the member state level.<\/p><p> We are often asked whether this is all about fraud.  It is not.  Most of the errors we find are mistakes or failures to comply with conditions.  We report some 14 suspected fraud cases to OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, every year.  In addition to those 14 cases, we would also pass on some cases that are referred to us in error by members of the public which were more appropriate for OLAF.  After that, while we keep an eye on them, those cases are really for OLAF to follow up on from that point on, and sometimes also for the national authorities, which might also start a criminal case.<\/p><p> Those are the basics on the annual report.  This year, we have been making a real effort to produce some other products.  The year 2013 was the end of a seven-year programme period so we were trying to do a little bit more strategic thinking.  We produced three or four projects this year that are aimed at looking back over the past few years and looking into the future with regard to what ought to be addressed by policymakers and what might be useful to policymakers from our work, by bringing together various aspects of our work.<\/p><p> Two of these products are called landscape reviews, which are overview studies that are not audits but are based on the experience and evidence we have collected in the course of audit work.  The first of these, for which I was the reporting member, concerns accountability and public audit arrangements.  In other words, we looked at the way the European Union accounts for its spending and activities, whether that meets reasonable standards and also whether the audit arrangements in place are reasonable.  It turns out this is quite a big question.<\/p> <p>In a way the system is quite simple, the European Commission spends most of the money and accounts for its activities to the European Parliament and Council, and the European Court of Auditors steps in to inform the process with our studies and work.  It should be relatively simple, but although the European Commission is the principal spender, many bodies use European money and European legal frameworks to progress the European agenda.  Approximately 40 separate agencies, banks and funds, including the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the ECB and the Court of Auditors, and the European Court of Justice spend European money.<\/p><p> Much of the European effort is done in partnership, with many types of international bodies or through PPP arrangements.  A total of 80% of the spend is managed through national, regional and local authorities.  The beneficiaries themselves have reporting obligations.  I believe there are 12 million farmers and &euro;8 million for the Common Agricultural Policy alone.  The number of people who must account for their activities with European money is pretty substantial.  The number of people to whom they must account is also substantial.  We have 750 MEPs and ten different configurations of the European Council.  There are also obligations to be accountable to national parliaments and we are all supposed to account to our people, who amount to 500 million.  As with everything else, there are quite a few auditors in the mix, including ourselves and national audit officers.  Some of the institutions have their own audit boards and committees or hire private external auditors and the Commission has internal auditors.  There is a lot going on in this.<\/p><p> European Union accountability is itself a complex and very large industry.  It would be no surprise to hear there are gaps and overlaps in the system.  Many of these come from how the work of the EU is done.  The EU co-ordinates activities happening at member state level, such as the Lisbon agenda and Europe 2020.  Many of the actions under these are supposed to happen at member state level but the co-ordination and initiative is at European level.  How does one account for this and who audits it?  It is very fragmented.  Similarly we have arrangements whereby some member states are involved and others are not, and Schengen and the eurozone are classic examples.  Not all member states are involved, but the eurozone institutions go to the European Parliament to account for themselves.  Many MEPs are not even in the eurozone or Schengen area.  It creates a certain amount of complication.  One can say it is fine and it works, but in the past year ten or 11 Ministers from various member states have said that perhaps eurozone accountability should be to a subset of the European Parliament.  It sounds like it would be very difficult to organise, but the question is out there in the ether.<\/p><p> As I stated, much work is done through partnerships, through PPPs and with international institutions.  The problem here is that audit tends to stop at the point where the funds are paid over to the project, but the partnership continues and does its work and it may not be as accountable to the European polity as if the Commission or a member state were spending the funds directly.  There is a need, especially now with the big Juncker initiative, to ask whether, if we are to have these big partnerships, we will have ways in which parliaments can scrutinise them, and not necessarily just the European Parliament.<\/p><p> In the European Union institutional set-up there are inconsistencies and various levels of audit and parliamentary scrutiny according to the bodies.  The ECB and EIB each have different arrangements based on their particular nature.  The EIB the accounts to the European Parliament but does not have a formal obligation to do so.<\/p> <p>However, it may not in all cases consider that it has an obligation to account nationally.  Some agencies have audit arrangements that are different because they have their own cashflows and so forth.  Those inconsistencies are not wrong but their continued existence ought to be at least considered and justified. <\/p><p> A big problem for audit and accountability, as we have seen, is that there are often errors and weaknesses in front-line governance of the moneys.  If the governance is not right then obviously the information flow backwards will not be correct so there is an accountability deficit.<\/p><p>  A lot of scrutiny and audit is about following the money which is reasonable but the impact of the EU is, very often, not about money at all but regulation, legislation, co-operation and so forth.  All of those things are not easily audited or accounted for.<\/p><p>  The system has got even more complicated with the financial crisis.  We have more new bodies and structures with different arrangements, some of them outside the European Union framework altogether like the ESM.  There are new uses being made of  existing structures and new sets of rules.  The public perception of the EU systems is damaged and is in need of repair.<\/p><p> Since national parliaments, European parliamentary scrutiny, national auditors and European auditors are all in this mix then there may be a need for at least a consideration of whether there should be more collaboration between those bodies.  We need more consistent arrangements and where there are inconsistencies they ought to be justifiable.  We need better member state level scrutiny to ensure that governance is done well close to the point where the money is spent.  We need a better focus on results for the EU spend.  That is a job for the auditors to work together to reduce the level of duplication of audit work.  I mention some of that in part because the committee's work programme includes looking at the accountability of some of these EU institutions.  We have done some work on the subject and it might be of some use to the committee.  We might be able to guide the committee as to some of our sources if that is also of use.  <\/p><p> One of my colleagues, along with a team, has done a landscape review on the risk framework for the financial management of the EU budget.  He is looking at what are the big drivers of risks to the financial management.  It is not that risks are being unnecessarily entered into, it is that in every financial system there is a set of risks which ought to be addressed and considered.  Based on our audit work of the past several years, we have produced a survey of risks for financial management.  The work provides a high level overview and these four risks, which Members can see before them, are the four key aspects.  The document goes through each of the policy areas of the European Union spend and in the case of each of those policy areas it examines what are the key issues that might arise.<\/p><p> The project amounts to a financial management risk register for the EU which ought to act as an agenda for action for policy makers for the next several years.  As legislation is being prepared and as the mid-term review of the next financial framework arises, policy makers should be able to take account of this very extensive document in order to guide their work to improve the governance systems.<\/p><p> Some of the factors leading to risks, eligibility rules and other conditions for receiving EU support are often not applied correctly.  A huge issue is that public procurement rules and procedures are not applied correctly.<\/p> <p>European public procurement systems are a terrible nuisance.  They are complicated and it is sometimes difficult for bodies which are spending EU money to apply them.  On the other hand, they serve a particular purpose, namely, to ensure that the free market operates, that national discrimination does not occur, that there is no inappropriate discrimination between the large and the small, and that there is no collusion on practices.  If one stated that 25,000 bodies were engaged in applying these public procurement practices, one would reach the conclusion that the system is very complex.  The number of organisations involved is not 25,000, it is actually 250,000.  This means that literally millions of public procurement processes, which involve the use of EU money, are in train each year.  The capacity for a system as complex as this to get things wrong is, therefore, large.  However, getting it right also becomes a very important mechanism for driving the Single Market.<\/p><p> We discuss in our document to quite a degree the capacity of member state authorities to manage and spend EU moneys, and we also refer to the impact of the EU's budget on activities, cashflows and the commitments that are outstanding.  It is a 100-page document and it would take some time to go through it.  I do not plan to take the committee through it.  However, I suggest that members take the opportunity to peruse it because they might find some matters of interest to them.  The other document we provided contains a few tables and interesting facts at the end but I do not believe members need to read them for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014121600005#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Cardiff","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418740200,"counter":291,"content":"<p>The graph on slide 6 of the PowerPoint presentation refers to the error rate from 2007 onward.

Are there sufficient mechanisms in place to force a reduction in the error rate?  What is outlined is not a great result.  One of the purposes of measurement is to try to force improvements and drive the rate downward.  I previously worked in the private sector and I would have expected that, in light of the amount of monitoring taking place, we would have been able to drive down the error rate.  I do not think the result is brilliant.  Is Mr. Cardiff of the view that achieving a better result would prove too costly?  The law of diminishing returns can apply.  Are we just going to be obliged to be satisfied with a figure of 5% or does Mr. Cardiff believe that member states can do more?  Is there a need to use more carrots and sticks?

There is considerable room for improvement simply by means of a greater amount of attentiveness at member state level.  I do not wish to oversimplify matters because it is not as easy as that.  The auditors who do the work find opportunities that were missed in the context of keeping the rate down.  We say that the error is material if it reaches 2%.  As already stated, 2% is not an acceptability threshold.  Rather, it is a materiality threshold - it is big enough to be of importance and to be noted.  There is a mix of issues to be considered.  There is a possibility that member states could - in some cases, they should - improve their systems and their levels of attentiveness.<\/p> <p>Sometimes we say we need more control, but we also say we need more simplicity in the systems, because some of the errors arise from complexity.  They do not all arise from breaches of EU rules.

A combination of looking at the simplicity of the schemes, improving the governance at the national level and greater attentiveness could drive it down somewhat.

The report is not country-specific and it is general under the different headings of expenditure, but would Mr. Cardiff respond to what is said to us at all our respective advice clinics and when we meet people on the street - that Ireland is far too compliant and we are far too much the good boy of Europe, that we are the best pupil in the class, to the detriment of our people and their interests, and that we over-adhere to rules and are overly oppressed by them?  Could he respond to that?<\/p><p>  In a similar vein, Mr. Cardiff said the over-declaration of land area is the most frequent error.  I find in my clinic work that many farmers experience huge hardship in the area of maps.  My experience from clinic work - I do not know if this is replicated in other agricultural constituencies - is that the farmers produce their maps in good faith, as per their own understanding of their holdings, and because of something from the digitised maps or whatever, they are alleged to be non-compliant, to have over-declared, perhaps because of a bog bank or old land ownership structures.  It causes immense hardship for a number of individuals and we spend a great deal of time unravelling this for people in our constituency office.  I presume that if we do this, so do many agricultural planners and professional people.  I would like Mr. Cardiff's response to that.<\/p><p>  There is another issue around procurement.  I would be interested if Mr. Cardiff would elaborate on what he means by non-compliance in the area of procurement.  An issue that affects a Border constituency in a big way is that many small jobs up our way in Cavan, Monaghan and along the Border must, under strict interpretation of EU laws, go to open tender, which means they must be cross-national.  This means they must have tenders from Northern Ireland, and because of various considerations, such as wages, social welfare and other matters, it is possible for many small contractors on the northern side of the Border to do jobs much more cheaply in the Republic.  Consequently, under EU regulations and as per the rules, they get the contracts.  Is it the case that derogations are given in other states for small contracts and for a situation like ours?  Is there potential for our Government to seek derogations for contracts under a certain level from the rule of international tendering or procurement?  If there is not such a potential, am I wrong in thinking that it happens in other countries?  It has been said to me - and truthfully I do not have the detail and I would be interested in Mr. Cardiff's response - that in France, for example, and other countries, the state has negotiated a situation where public procurements up to a certain value can be domestically sourced within EU law, by virtue of a concession granted.<\/p> <p>From my practical interaction with the agricultural spend, I find that farmers go through awful hardship around the maps issue - the digitisation of maps, the lands, occasionally bog banks, old rights of way, etc. - and it costs them a great deal of angst and professional fees to sort it out.  Sometimes the fees are a high proportion of the grant in the first case.<\/p><p> My second issue is around procurement in a Border area, where people across the Border in Northern Ireland can get a small job in the Republic of Ireland.  They may have cheaper labour, there are all sorts of issues around social welfare and the black market economy, etc., which would be a breach of procurement, but a number of issues arise that might make it easy for competitors to come in and get a contract in the Republic.  Many small contractors in my Border constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, and I presume also in Donegal and Louth, are greatly hampered by the rule that dictates that procurement must be offered into Northern Ireland.  Is there potential for a derogation for a certain level of contract?  I would be interested in Mr. Cardiff's response to all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014121600010#L00200","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418740800,"counter":296,"content":"<p>To follow on, we in urban Ireland, particularly in Dublin, have an acute interest in agricultural issues, given the importance of the agricultural sector and the history of abuses within this sector.

Those of us who are familiar with urban and rural areas would always be quick to point out that the qualification guidelines for European-based or European-assisted payments to farmers or anybody else are very rigid.  They are much more rigid than they were.  It makes great copy to put out the word in some quarters that there is huge scope for abuse in a particular area.  It suffices to say that everything is now guided by satellite.  All measurements are governed by satellite.  On my way in this morning, I saw one of these mapping planes overhead.  There is a revision taking place at present.  It comes down to the last 5 ft. or 10 ft.  It is even closer than that.  They are down to the last foot.  The same grids are used for sowing corn, cereals and all this kind of stuff.  It is unbelievably minute in terms of its determination of area and space.  The sowing of corn and cereal is done with the assistance of satellites at present.  All one has to do is follow the GPS map and away one goes.<\/p><p>  The degree to which severe penalties are applied to the overlooking of guidelines, which could be accidental or deliberate, is another issue.  No really fair method of assessing why they were overlooked has been identified.  The penalties are very severe.  In some cases, a penalty of three years of non-payment or non-qualification can be applied.  My view is that this system is overly bureaucratised at present.  Simplicity has gone out the window for a long time.  With modern technology, it should not be as difficult to deal with areas as it was in the past.  The farmer does not need to be the owner of the property.  He is quite entitled to the same thing if he has the property leased.  If one sows a garden on the corner of the property one has leased, that will be spotted by the aerial sector.  The general rule is that the farmer, businessperson or whoever he is should over-estimate and err on the side of safety in order to ensure he is covered if he digs up a cabbage plot or something and takes it out of the area aid area and he will not be penalised for loss of supports over a wide area.

To what extent has the court seen such situations?  How does it examine and deal with them?  My colleagues have rightly referred to what happens in the agriculture sector.  How we can eliminate the issuing by one Department of a directive that is in violation of another Department's objectives, for want of a better description?  If the two of them are in conflict with each other, the only way this can be resolved, even if it leads to massive losses, is to get massive input from legal experts and bring all kinds of consultants on board.<\/p><p> I asked earlier for an identification of the issues that create Euroscepticism.  What are the issues that create Euroscepticism in this country?  The one that comes immediately to mind is the habitats directive.  The issue of turf cutting was a major issue in the most recent European elections.  It does not affect urban areas, but it certainly affected vast tracts of rural areas.  Aircraft were sent to monitor the activities of some guy who was cutting turf in a small area where his grandfather and his grandfather's grandfather had cut turf previously.  To my mind, it is utterly and totally ridiculous for that kind of thing to happen.  It has to be possible to find an alternative way of doing things, other than by spending money on heavy-handed activity to ensure a directive is complied with.  If the directive cannot be complied with, it should not be there in the first place.  The degree to which we contribute to the debate beforehand is limited to say the least.  We do not normally get a chance to contribute.  When I was serving as Chairman of this committee, I was told at a meeting in Brussels by a number of people that they represented millions of people all over Europe.  None of them were politicians at all.  They had no such function at all.  They were never elected by anybody anywhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014121600012#N00700","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418741400,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Who were they?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014121600013#O00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1418741400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>They were consultants, experts and scientists, etc.  All of that must be provided for.

The designation of special areas of conservation certainly caused the generation of a great deal of antipathy towards Europe, towards politics in general and towards the European institutions.<\/p><p>  I would like to make a final point in this whole area.  If we do not identify the issues that are causing antipathy towards Europe, we are walking lemming-like towards the cliffs.  In such circumstances, we will not solve our problems here or across Europe.  It is up to ourselves.  Simplification is one of the issues we must consider.  Reason is another.  I will give a classical example of a contradiction we must not forget.  In order to qualify for a particular payment in some special areas of conservation, one can get a grant for fencing from the relevant Government Department.  Under another directive, one is not allowed to create a fence in the same area.  One cannot create a fence and, at the same time, one must create a fence and one gets a grant to provide the fencing necessary to keep livestock in off the roads and the special areas.  It is utterly crazy when we go down that road.

I was asked whether the schemes are overly complicated.  We think they are.  That is what we are saying.  At other times, we point out that certain schemes are capable of being abused and therefore require extra complications here and there.  As a general principle, the European Court of Auditors regularly suggests that simplification would lead to less error.<\/p> <p> On the area of maps, our job is to indicate problems and maps are used by all the control systems, both in terms of deciding how much a person can claim but also in terms of deciding when something has been over-claimed.  Of course, while it is a problem, I do not know whether we could manage without them at any level of the control system, whether it is the European Court of Auditors or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  At least, as they improve, we will have the benefit of some additional precision, as Deputy Durkan said.<\/p><p> On the question of whether we are worse or better than anybody else, we have produced some national data this year to cover the 2007-13 period.   We work on a sample basis and small countries get sampled less, so we do not have enough information on Ireland to come to definitive conclusions.  However, while there is no evidence to say we are wonderful, nor is there anything to suggest we are a lot worse than anybody else.  We are not immune from errors, at the least.  As I said earlier, we reported 14 suspected cases of fraud to OLAF this year, not 100, 200 or 300.  Our auditors are not arriving at the farm gate, the factory gate or the sites of European spending and saying there is a lot of clear, out-and-out fraud afoot.  While some of the errors are egregious, and are out-and-out, pull-the-other-one stuff, most of the errors we find are smallish relative to the spend involved.  Of course, with small things, it is always very difficult to say whether it is deliberate or not.  Perhaps I have solved the urban-rural divide by saying there is a little truth in everything but that we should not exaggerate this.<\/p><p> On the culture in existence in agriculture, I am from Santry and I do not know.  We certainly see some small number of cases in every country across Europe that suggest people are simply not attending to their obligations, but not all by any means.  The auditors on the ground do come across the cases that other people were talking about, where people simply under-claim to avoid getting it wrong.  Of course, we never report an under-claim.<\/p><p> Are over-payments recouped by the Commission?  Yes, they are, and also by the member state.  One of the issues is that if something is caught late - for example, if an over-claim is noticed four or five years on - is one statute-barred from chasing back?  By the time it is found, investigated, reported to the Commission and brought back, it can take quite a long time.  It is clear that member states in general do not recoup anything like the amount the Commission might demand from them as a recovery but they certainly do have a practice of going back and doing that.<\/p><p> With regard to Ukraine, Moldova and so forth, we have a division of the court that looks at external actions, and it does go into those places where European money is spent.  There is an audit ongoing on Ukraine and some of my colleagues came back two weeks ago and hung up their flak jackets after a visit to Afghanistan.  Where European money is spent, one might find a Court of Auditors person there, unless it is really very hot, in which case discretion might be the better part.<\/p><p> I was asked whether member states and the Commission take sufficient interest in our findings.  We live in hope.  The world is not changing as rapidly as we would have liked, so the answer may be that things could be better.  However, we find that the Commission at least makes an effort to address our recommendations, and it is usually a fairly honest effort, even if it does not always go as far as we would have hoped.  An auditor's job is a dream one in the sense that one can make all the recommendations one likes; one does not have to be responsible for carrying them out.  It is perhaps a bit hard on the Commission sometimes because our job is to criticise, not to implement.<\/p> <p>For example, we published a report yesterday about good practice.  We went looking for good practice in countries in terms of ensuring the reasonableness of costs in rural development with a view to helping the Commission and the member states to identify what other countries do that works and to spread that message around.  In a sense, we have access rights that others do not have so that was an attempt to be positive.<\/p><p> On the question of what issues create euroscepticism in Ireland, such as the habitats directive, the lack of accountability is one issue we are trying to address.

We did one recently on the interaction of water policy in the environmental part of the Commission and the Common Agricultural Policy, and whether the two are well aligned or not.  The answer is that the situation could clearly be better.  A full list of these special reports is available.  More than occasionally, we look at how different types of EU policy are interacting with each other to find whether there are these overlaps and so forth.  It is probably inevitable in a very complex world that these issues will sometimes arise.

The consensus was that this was a licence to tolerate too much error, so it was rejected at the time.<\/p><p>  With regard to public procurement, while I am not expert in the domain, from my experience, the requirements are graduated depending on the amount of money involved.  For instance, if it is less than &euro;50,000, the obligations are a lot less than if it is more.  The business of opening up the tender procedure to a wider audience is very much dependent on the amounts involved.  The Deputy made a comment about some possible derogations for France.  I am not aware of any such derogations for any individual country, and I would be surprised if that were the case.<\/p> <p>Maybe there is a derogation in the sense that not everybody speaks French, so it is a natural constraint.  I would also say that price is only one element in public procurement.  It does not necessarily have to be the primordial element.  It does not have to be the cheapest price that prevails.

Apologies I am late, I was at another committee meeting and missed the witnesses' presentation.  I head the end of the interaction between the two colleagues concerning the agricultural side of things and I know the Department of Agriculture has received notice of a fine of &euro;180 million which they actively challenging.  They are confident they will be able to get that reduced.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Durkan has explained, there have been huge inroads made on satellite inspections.  Because of the increasing use of technology over the last years, retrospective penalties have been applied to farmers.  One might say this is somewhat unfair, but the EU has stated that this money has gone out and must be recouped.  The increased and better use of technology has enabled these penalties to be applied.  A lot of this comes across my desk as a rural Deputy and often it is a case of farmers applying for the same thing every year and not changing it rather than intending to apply for things erroneously.  They have declared the same areas of land every year without updating them, rather than going out of their way to do something incorrectly.  In the future, I imagine, the impact on agricultural payments will be reduced as the technology improves because there will be certainty about what farmers can apply for.<\/p><p>  Regarding the rural development side of things, I imagine the leader programme is a big part of that.  Is there any scrutiny of it or of its comparable programmes across the EU?  I know in some cases there are groups applying for monies.  I would imagine there have been very few problems but I have come across some issues.  For example, a group has maybe been approved for funding by the Department, and has not done anything wrong, but subsequently through audits and investigations the Department  decides they should not have been approved under the rules.  The leader company, for example, may have sanctioned funding and misinterpreted the rules in concluding that it fell under a category which was eligible for funding.

The European Union and everybody else should at least be engaged on that issue which we should not avoid because it is unpleasant to deal with.  The question of how one deals with it is much more complex and, of course, as auditors, when we are compiling special reports in particular, we look at how they will be implemented.  When somebody has received funding on condition that some environmental measure will be adhered to, we check that there is cross-compliance.  That is part of the audit process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014121600017#S01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Cardiff","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418742900,"counter":359,"content":"<p>That brings this session to a conclusion.

I know that it has been a very busy period and that the committee has had a full agenda today.  Therefore, we thank it for fitting us in.<\/p><p>  Members are aware that 2015 will be European Year for Development.  Given the committee's role in European Union affairs, we would like to explore some of the opportunities that will arise.  Since the early 1980s, the European Union has been designating thematic European years to highlight specific issues of relevance.  This designation is very important for us in that the Union is taking external action in looking at the European Year for Development initiative.<\/p><p>  The year 2015 is important in terms of the future of humanity.  During it there will be two United Nations summit meetings which will effectively define the parameters for international policy making.  In September the United Nations will agree new goals in the sustainable development framework in looking at tackling poverty, inequality and environmental destruction.  We look to the European Union affairs committee to consider how it would like to be involved in this process in terms of scrutinising policy and ensuring it is proofed and how Ireland will respond in that context.<\/p><p>  In December the climate change summit to be held in Paris will set new climate action targets.  Again, we would like to bring this to the committee's notice and ask for its input in terms of how it can be involved in that context.  <\/p><p>  All people in Ireland should be aware of the importance of these decision-making processes.  More public debate is needed on Ireland's role in building and implementing a new global consensus on how we can ensure justice, equality and prosperity for all, without destroying the planet's resources and excluding anybody from the benefits of global trade and co-operation.  The European Year for Development initiative in 2015 will present an opportunity to celebrate the many ways in which people in Ireland are already working towards a better and more sustainable future in the world. <\/p><p>  Ireland has a rich and diverse civil society and every day hundreds of thousands of people donate, volunteer, advocate and campaign for a better world.  We believe 2015 is the year in which to celebrate the power of ordinary people to make a real difference and be more involved.  It will not be a European year of conferences; rather, it will be a year of citizen action to have a better world.  We have some very exciting events planned, an outline of which was provided for the secretariat before the meeting.  On 22 January the President will launch an event on our behalf as part as his ethics initiative.  I take the opportunity to invite the Chairman and members to come and support the event.  It will be a year in which to honour and encourage people to continue to stand up for what is right and a year of active citizenship as it relates to global issues.  We will be connecting what is happening in Ireland with what is happening across the world.  We are here to explore these options with members.  My colleague, Ms Towey, will outline in greater detail what they might look like.<\/p><p>  We very much welcome the members of the committee in being involved and engaged in this activity next year and I hope they will take up the opportunity.  In particular, we would like the committee to be involved in scrutinising policy as it relates to a different era ahead us in terms of the new sustainable development framework and in terms of the impact of what we do here, as well as of what is happening across the globe.<\/p><p>  I again thank the Chairman and members for inviting us to appear before them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014121600019#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sharan Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418743500,"counter":364,"content":"<p>We realise the joint committee's role, first and foremost, is to scrutinise European legislation and policy, but we also realise the European Union's negotiating position next year at the two summits mentioned by Ms Kelly will be crucial.  The committee can help to shape the Union's position on these key issues.  The core message coming from the preparatory processes is that business as usual is not an option in a world which is effectively trying to manage extreme poverty, growing inequality, increased climate volatility and environmental degradation and bold choices must be made.  This is far from impossible, but such choices require leadership, bravery and courage to tackle some of the issues head on.  We are aware of some of the challenges following the Lima event last week, at which the international community struggled to find a consensus which would be strong enough to get us to where we needed to be in dealing with the environmental challenges and, equally, the development challenges.<\/p><p>  The committee could play a number of particular roles and we are keen to hear members' perspectives and how they believe these roles could be played next year.  We see it as a potential focal point in dealing with the issues arising from the negotiations with regard to what will happen post-2015 in dealing with climate change.  It could promote public debate on the hot topics in these two areas.  It could also provide a place for Members of the Oireachtas to receive updates on how international thinking was evolving.<\/p><p>  Another potential role is to act as a sounding board.  The committee could provide a feedback mechanism for Members of the Oireachtas on the European Union's internal decision-making.

The committee has a remit to scrutinise legislation.  The agreements to be reached in 2015 will have far-reaching consequences for the policy options open to the Government and the Oireachtas.  They need to be discussed and assessed before they are set in stone.  <\/p><p>  A further role for the committee is to act as a facilitator.  The European Year for Development initiative is expected to generate much public attention and will provide an opportunity for members to use the increased awareness of international co-operation to highlight some of its work.  Any event or hearing organised by the committee during 2015 could be considered as part of its contribution to the European Year for Development.  The annual Europe Day celebrations could form part of this contribution.  This could provide for a degree of cohesion and also a sense of urgency about the work of Ireland's development NGOs and the committee.<\/p><p>  The committee could also be an inspiration.  It has been a strong and understanding supporter of active citizenship, which is at the heart of our plans for the European Year for Development.  It could, therefore, use the year as a reason to engage with inspirational people and organisations that have broken new ground when it comes to taking real action which will have an impact on European integration and international solidarity.<\/p><p>  During the year members of D&oacute;chas will organise a large range of initiatives and events, on which we will communicate information to the committee via our website and social media.  We hope that by the end of the year it will have inspired thousands of people to believe they have more power and influence to bring to bear on the decisions being made on big global issues.  We hope to encourage people to recognise their potential as agents of change and to address the sense of powerlessness they sometimes feel when it comes to decisions made at European level.<\/p><p>  We believe 2015 will be a very important year and are convinced the people of Ireland should be given a chance to engage in some of these discussions and make their views and opinions heard.  For this reason, the European Year for Development initiative is very important for us and we hope it will be inspiring.  We look forward to working with the committee.  We particularly look forward to hearing the views of members on what the role of the committee should be.  We will be delighted to work with them to tease out some concrete initiatives in which we could engage with the committee during the 12 months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014121600020#V00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Olive Towey"},{"type":"speech","time":1418743800,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses, who have certainly put it up to us.

Climate change will go to the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade will deal with development.

It is 30 years since the famine in Ethiopia and Band Aid.  I watched a documentary recently which examined the improvements in the country, and much of it was focused on agriculture, soil erosion, using the correct type of plants and the terracing of mountain slopes and hills.  It was very interesting, and from what I saw, things have greatly improved in this area which was particularly problematic.  It comes back to the concept of teaching somebody to fish rather than just giving them food.  Is this the model D&oacute;chas uses?  I know it works with Tr&oacute;caire, Concern, Gorta, GOAL and other bodies.  Is it involved in particular areas?  Will the witnesses elaborate on the role D&oacute;chas plays?

Yesterday I returned from Tanzania.  I was there with AWEPA, the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa.  It was a real eye-opener.  We saw some of the positive work which is taking place and some of the challenges facing various aid agencies.  I congratulate Irish Aid.  Many of the projects we visited were excellent.  Through a particular programme, rice yields are six times that of neighbouring areas and this was down to Irish Aid involvement.<\/p><p>  The witnesses spoke of a Europe-wide approach to many of these problems.  The road infrastructure in that part of Africa often means one road leads to, for example, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia or Uganda, and this road has one lane in each direction.  If there is a crash, which occurred when we were there, traffic backs up.  Some areas have very good roads, but if investment was made in roads in Africa, people would be able to get their goods to market.  It is a simple example.<\/p><p>  We have examples and comparisons in Ireland about which we could speak to people in Africa.  Some of them are historical, for example, hunger, colonisation, rural inequality, rural resettlement and forced emigration.<\/p> <p>One can talk on all those issues and the positive thing is that we do not have any hidden agenda, unlike some in the region who are involved in this.  I think that went down well.  It has had a huge impact on any of those countries in which we are involved, and we have been involved in the poorest of the poor.<\/p><p> Ireland has been made co-facilitator, with Kenya, on the negotiations leading up to the September sustainable development summit.  Could the witnesses expand on what they think the priorities should be in that area?  When one sees these things being designated, big development summits planned and series of conferences and so on, the big problem is that in many cases ordinary people are left out.  What are their plans to include ordinary people in these discussions in Ireland, and more generally to include voices from the global south in the discussions?  Over 80% of people support Irish Aid, even right through the recession.  That says a great deal.  People have inherent memory and they remember the difficulties we went through ourselves.  Inequality has increased in Ireland due to austerity and other factors.  Are there any plans to link development and inequality in Europe with other regions and to look at the areas of focus of overseas aid and how some of it can end up being abused?<\/p><p> When we were in Tanzania the big issue was that funds had gone missing from the equivalent of the ESB and money ended up in some of the ministers' accounts, similar to what happened in Uganda that time.  The message from that was that where we were supporting the public accounts committee and the budget committee, they were the ones who stepped up to the plate when asked, as happened in Uganda with the auditor general's office.  They are things that are happening.  That is the positive message for development and some of the work we are doing.  I congratulate the workers we met on all those projects.  We certainly had criticisms of some of the things we saw.  We went to one sunflower milling plant where there are buildings and machinery, but it is in the middle of nowhere and there is no electricity.  How did that happen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014121600021#W00300","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418744100,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Did they have their own generators?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014121600022#X00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1418744100,"counter":372,"content":"<p>No, it is not up and running, but the farmers are there.  We went to another that had enough sunflower seed for the factory to operate for six months.  What are they to do for the other six months?  It is about looking at the broader picture.  These are just some examples.  The sixfold increase in rice yields is one thing but the miller gets four times the price  from the next middle man that the farmer got.  When one arrives with the rice still in its hulls, there is no weighing machine for the rice, so a guess is made, but lo and behold, when the miller is selling it on to the next middle man, there is a weighing scales.  These are some of the issues we must focus on.

I thank the witnesses.  Frankly, I did not know next year was the European Year for Development.  Having heard the witnesses' contributions, I am still not quite sure what is the lead agency.  I hear the witnesses presenting a number of jobs for this committee to do, so I hope the Chairman was listening, but I do not know that questions are being posed to the witnesses as representatives of the NGO sector.  Is D&oacute;chas the lead sector?  Has Europe nominated it to be the lead sector?<\/p><p>  I lived in Africa for four years, and I know Tanzania very well, but where do we start?  The witnesses gave us a great deal of material regarding environmental challenges.  The Lima conference has just concluded and we had a debate here in the witnesses' absence, unfortunately, about hen harriers, slugs, snails and bats and the conflict.  Some of us recognise how proper farming can actually enhance the environment and one can reintroduce hen harriers and sustain the peregrine falcons, among other things.<\/p> <p>There is obviously conflict with the agricultural sector, because the two speakers were arguing very strongly about the rights of the farmers and how there is too much bureaucracy and implementation of law.  It is a thematic year, but it seems to be a very vast theme.  We heard about the rice farmer and all the rest in Tanzania.  Are we talking about the pastoralists in Africa, for example the Maasai or the other pastoralists, whose livelihood has been threatened for various reasons, some political but many climactic, including desertification?  The nomadic people are becoming less and less nomadic.  Lake Tanganyika is shrinking in volume.  There are islands about to disappear.  Members may have heard the emotive speech by a woman who had her baby with her and was pregnant about how if we do not do something, her whole island will go under because of the melting ice caps.

This is important and binds the three questions together.  My colleagues have talked about the sustainable development goals that will be agreed in September next year.  This will be a new global framework, with the priorities for sustainable development, whatever that means, for the next 15 years.  If this agreement is reached in September, every member of the United Nations will have to come up with an action plan on what sustainable development means for that country.  Unlike the millennium development goals, which have been the framework for the work of aid agencies over the past 15 years, this new set of goals will be universal.  It will be for rich as well as poor countries, so there is a significant difference.  We have come to the committee because we think the committee needs to be aware of this significant shift.<\/p><p>  When Deputy Crowe asks how we link issues of inequality and development overseas with issues at home, this is the answer.  The UN  framework for sustainable development binds us all.  It is then up to each country to decide what that means in practice and what it will prioritise.  That is the key issue for us.  This is an important discussion, which is much wider than just the aid agencies that are working together in D&oacute;chas.  Deputy Kyne asked how we worked together and whether there were different approaches.  D&oacute;chas has 61 member organisations and they all have a different answer, but what binds us together is a very simple philosophy.  We say that in order for poor people in poor communities to change their fate, they must organise.  They must come together as a community, understand what their situation is and where their weaknesses are, where they are being exploited or where they are losing the fight.  That is the key thing that all our members are convinced of.  It is about community mobilisation.<\/p> <p>That is a key factor about which all our members are convinced.  It is about community mobilisation.  If the members of a community come to us with an analysis of their situation, it is about facilitating and supporting them in developing and implementing a strategy to change the situation.  That can be a technical solution at times.  It can be about a road or a mill but it can also be more in the social or political area.  It depends on the local situation and the local community.  <\/p><p> We try to celebrate many of these differences.  Deputy Crowe is right in that enormous progress is being made in developing countries, including Ethiopia.  We know that the way we work works.  We as non-governmental organisations know what we are good at and what we are not good at.  There is a division of labour between the United Nations, agencies, governments and so on, but together we have a coherent approach through the millennium development goals and for the next 15 years through the next framework that will be agreed in September.  That is why I want to emphasise the importance of the international negotiation process that is currently ongoing and, as the Deputy said, that is being chaired by Ireland.  It is a phenomenal responsibility and honour for our country.  For that reason alone, we need to look at it.<\/p><p> A question was asked about corruption.  That comes back to my answer to Deputy Kyne's question.  It is about organising people.  Technology is helping us in this regard.  If I, as an individual, am confronted by a corrupt policeman asking me to pay a bribe to use a road, there is very little I can do, although I can report it.  In countries such as India and Kenya there are apps that people have on their phones - a smartphone is not required; it can be a dumb phone - that people can use to register that they were asked for a bribe by a policemen on a certain street at a certain time.  If everybody reports this, a pattern emerges; it can be traced to an individual policeman and action can be taken.

The European Union announced Council conclusions today.  Basically, the European Union has a common position on what is to happen post-2015.  There has been a great deal of negotiation already and Ireland was part of those negotiations within the UN around what the next set of goals should look like.  As Mr. Zomer said, the difference between the last set and next set is hopefully that the next set will be universal.  Whether it is around health, education, HIV or social protection, we as a country will need to set a bar for ourselves.  It is not just about Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia; it is about Ireland, France and Italy.  The idea is that these are goals that we internalise.  It is important that the next set of goals be universal and that we take them as seriously as developing countries.<\/p><p>  The second point is that the next set of goals must recognise that some countries have come a huge distance but the levels of inequality within countries have grown enormously as well.  That goes for our own country as well as the countries we work in.  Inequality, and measures to address and redress levels of inequality, are important in the new framework.  <\/p><p>  Third, we talk about the importance of rights.  The European Union and Ireland are very committed to a rights approach and recognising the right to education and  the right to health.<\/p> <p>All of these rights are important, and that is always a bone of contention at international negotiations.<\/p><p> There is a need for these next set of goals to have strong accountability structures.  There is already a proposed set of 17 goals on the table around broad areas.  It is trying to pull together the development agenda with the environment agenda, so it is fairly big, but between now and September next year they will have to get into the nitty-gritty around targets and indicators, and those targets and indicators have to be ambitious.  They have to be clear and they must build on existing commitments.  Those are some of the broad principles that should be included in the next set of frameworks.<\/p><p> Ireland has been very strong in promoting the equality agenda and the hunger agenda in terms of food and nutrition security and in focusing on gender.  There are a number of areas where Ireland has been strong, reflecting our national commitment to those areas.  We would want to see that continued, but obviously, as a co-chair, Ireland will also have a different responsibility to facilitate a process.  We want it to be as ambitious an outcome as possible and we believe it is appropriate for the committee, and many other committees, to debate the substance of these positions as they continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014121600024#Z00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Olive Towey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418745000,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Before I call Ms Sharan Kelly, Deputy Durkan wants to make a brief contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014121600025#AA00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1418745000,"counter":394,"content":"<p>My apologies, Chairman, for being absent.

I have provided a detailed briefing note on the national ambulance service and its transformation programme.  I have also circulated a copy of the executive summary and recommendations of the national capacity review, an independent, external report commissioned by the HSE.  I will, therefore, focus on a number of the key areas highlighted in HIQA's report.<br\/>The Health Information and Quality Authority's review of pre-hospital emergency care services acknowledges that a lot of progress has been made by the national ambulance service in recent years.  The acknowledgement by HIQA of the significant role played by the ambulance service in improving patient outcomes in the areas of stroke and acute coronary care is particularly noteworthy.  The report also identifies a range of challenges for the future improvement of services under headings already identified by the HSE as requiring attention.  The 12 recommendations made by HIQA are being implemented or will be incorporated into the planned programme to improve ambulance services. <br\/>The working and governance arrangements of the national ambulance service and Dublin fire brigade are discussed in the report.  Both organisations will work collaboratively in the implementation of the recommendations set out in HIQA's report.  In advance of the outcome of the joint review of the Dublin fire brigade, early engagement will take place at corporate and operational levels and between the medical directors of each service on the establishment of a formal link in the area of medical assurance.<br\/><b><\/b>To develop a modern and improved ambulance service, the national ambulance service commenced a significant change programme in 2012 which identified the need for changed and improved work practices and investment in infrastructure, information technology and the ambulance fleet.  Ten key strategic objectives were identified as necessary to meet the growing needs and demands of the service.<\/p> <p>These are: implementing national control centre reconfiguration; undertaking a national ambulance service capacity review; implementing the response times improvement framework; engagement with patients and families; reviewing the provision of emergency ambulance services in Dublin city and county - the Dublin fire brigade review; developing and implementing the electronic patient care record; developing and implementing clinical performance measures; developing and implementing a clinical audit programme; expanding the community first responder scheme; and developing options to move to a BSc model of education for paramedics.  <\/p><p> To give effect to this programme of change, significant investment has been made in the ambulance service at a time when other parts of the health service have experienced significant budget reductions.  Some &euro;26.2 million has been invested in the national ambulance service in 2013 and 2014 in the development of the national control centre and the related information and communications technology, including computer-aided dispatch.  A further &euro;11.5 million was allocated in 2014 - as part of the fleet maintenance programme - for the purchase of 36 new emergency ambulances and two critical care ambulances, as well as 180 new defibrillators and 20 mechanical resuscitation devices.  A sum of &euro;5.4 million will be allocated in 2015 for the purpose of putting in place a range of developments, including the opening and staffing of ambulance stations at Lough Lynn, Mulranny and Tuam, the completion of the national control centre, a clinical audit and the elimination of on-call services in the west.  In 2015, &euro;7.5 million will also be allocated for the purchase of 47 brand new ambulances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Laverne McGuinness","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418751000,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I apologise for intervening, but I just want to warn everyone that we will be obliged to interrupt proceedings if votes are called on the Water Services Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600003#B00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418751000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>The recent investment programme addresses the most immediate staffing and service infrastructural deficits.  There is a recognition that future investments in services should be supported by an appropriate strategy which will ensure services delivered will be in line with best international practice and meet demand in a safe, efficient and effective manner using the most appropriate care models.  In this regard, a number of important reviews were commissioned and are under way.  They include: a national capacity review, the purpose of which is to independently determine the resource requirements and optimal deployment of the resources to meet the needs of a modern ambulance service and assist in the delivery of the target response times; a joint review of the provision of emergency ambulance services in Dublin city and county in order to determine the optimal model of ambulance provision which ensures patients receive the highest standard of emergency response and where the care provided meets all national safety and quality standards; a review of the national ambulance service's management capacity and governance, which will support the continued delivery of the key priority projects under way as part of the transformation programme; and an independent review of the national ambulance service fleet.<\/p><p>  A number of goals were achieved under the 2012-14 reform programme.  The migration to a single national control centre, coupled with a new computer system and digital radio, will bring transformational improvements in the delivery of the service.  This key project will deliver a single, state-of-the-art national emergency control centre for Ireland across two sites at Tallaght, the main or hub site, and Ballyshannon, the resilience or back-up site.  The project involves the centralisation of multiple small control centre sites from 11 sites to two.  It also requires a change in the model of working where the role of an emergency medical controller is being replaced with a new model of operation whereby there are separate call taker, dispatcher and supervisor roles.  Seven control room centres have migrated to date and there are currently four command and control centres in operation, namely, Townsend Street, Wexford, Tullamore and Ballyshannon.  The move from Townsend Street to the new state-of-the-art facility in Tallaght will take place by the end of January 2015.  In addition, the entire information system, including call answering and dispatch, is being replaced.  A computer-assisted dispatch system will be implemented fully in 2015.  The national ambulance service has also introduced a national digital radio communications system.  These key projects will significantly enhance the service's ability to dynamically deploy ambulance resources and improve response times.<\/p><p>  On ambulance response times, there was an increase of approximately 10% in all emergency calls - close to 1,000 per month - between January and December 2013.  In September 2014 the national ambulance service responded to 24,018 emergency and urgent calls, bringing the total number of emergency calls this year to 217,144.  This represents a further increase of 3.8% over the same period in 2013.  The target set for 2014 in respect of ECHO and DELTA incidents was that 80% of calls should be responded to by a patient-carrying vehicle in 18 minutes and 59 seconds or less.  National performance at September 2014 was 78.5% for ECHO calls and 69% for DELTA calls.  The corresponding performance figures for 2013 were 65.7% and 63.4%, respectively.  Members will note the improvement in the figures for 2014 over those for 2013.  This improvement has been supported by a number of factors, including investment in new technology and intermediate care vehicles which now facilitate 75% or approximately 3,000 of all inter-hospital transfers of patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Laverne McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1418751000,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting, but I wish to notify Senators that a vote is taking place in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600003#B00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418751000,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding this, the HSE acknowledges - in line with HIQA's report - that there is room for greater improvement, particularly in the area of call activation and the enhancement of community first responder schemes.  The national ambulance service is working closely with Community First Responder Ireland in expanding the 104 such schemes in operation nationally.<\/p><p>  Specifically, in the context of the HIQA target of a 75% response rate to the 7 minutes 59 seconds target for first responders, the independent national capacity review has found that this overall target for 75% of first responders is not achievable on foot of a number of factors.  The national ambulance service serves a very rural population, with 40% of incidents arising in rural locations.  In England only 12% of incidents are classified as rural in a typical ambulance service.  This will have significant implications for the ability of the national ambulance service to perform to the same standards as an English ambulance service.  In Ireland the rate of ambulance calls per head of population is 40% of that in England.  While this difference cannot be fully explained, there is some evidence to suggest access to GPs in Ireland is easier, particularly out of hours.  However, the scope of alternative care models to reduce response times may be less than in other jurisdictions.  The capacity review further indicates that, with a very significant further investment, it would be possible for the service to - at best - achieve an eight minutes performance in 64% of cases across Ireland.  This compares to a figure of 79% for a typical English service.  The level of investment required is in the order of an additional 290 full-time staff, as well as additional vehicles such as emergency ambulances, intermediate care vehicles and rapid response vehicles.<\/p><p>  Quality of care outcome measures provide a true indication of service performance.  During quarter 3 of 2014 the national ambulance service started to report on the clinical outcome measure relating to return of spontaneous circulation &ndash; the internationally recognised indicator.  The service is achieving a performance level of 39% in this regard, compared to a best international practice benchmark of 40%.  HIQA's report acknowledges the importance of clinical outcome measures and the need to combine them with response times.  <\/p><p>  Ambulance turnaround times at hospital emergency departments also continue to improve, with 67% of emergency ambulance vehicles and crews released to respond to other calls within 30 minutes or less.  This compares to a figure of 63% in September.  Some 94% of calls had crews and vehicles clear and available within 60 minutes.  The figure in this regard for September was 93%.<\/p><p>  The national ambulance service operates its fleet in line with the requirements of CEN 1798\/1789, Road Traffic Act, Department of the Environment, vehicle manufacture, etc.  The fleet consists of 262 emergency ambulances, of which approximately 150 are required for daily deployment.  This leaves 112 vehicles to serve as back-up.  During 2014 the national ambulance service completed the fleet programme upgrade of 36 new emergency ambulances and an additional two critical care transport vehicles, as well as the purchase of 180 new defibrillators and 20 mechanical resuscitation devices, at a total cost of &euro;11.5 million.  A further 47 emergency ambulances will be procured during 2015 at a cost of &euro;7.5 million.  In addition, an extra 25 intermediate care vehicles were purchased in 2013.  These transfer approximately 3,000 patients between hospitals each month.  Since the end of June 2014, the national ambulance service has engaged a mechanical engineering firm to review the fleet and the maintenance systems in place.  A full report in this regard will be available at the end of the month.<\/p><p>  HIQA&rsquo;s report is the subject of careful consideration by the national ambulance service.  The report has identified areas of the ambulance services that are working well.  These include: the successful implementation of protocols in conjunction with hospitals for stroke and acute coronary syndromes leading to better patient outcomes; the move from 11 to one national control centre over two sites is well under way and will lead to improved performance in call handling; the jointly commissioned review by the HSE and Dublin City Council, due to be completed in quarter one in 2015, will inform the process for enhanced governance and ambulance service delivery arrangements across Dublin city and county; the introduction of intermediate care vehicles; the appointment of a medical director who strategically oversees the delivery of pre-hospital clinical care; and the expansion of the clinical competency of pre-hospital care practitioners with the introduction of advanced paramedics and additional training and upskilling.<\/p> <p> While many of the recommendations in the HIQA report are being implemented as part of the planned programme of work, the HSE acknowledges there are areas where additional focus is required, particularly management support, the relationship between the HSE and Dublin fire brigade, DFB, response times, clinical audit and developing new models of care.  HIQA&rsquo;s meeting with this committee on 2 December focused on a number of issues in the area of workforce and leadership.  More specifically, page 39 of the report states that a number of staff reported that they did not have a formal job description or the requisite technical skills for the particular posts that they occupied.  The director of the national ambulance service, NAS, meets regularly with his senior team and at the most recent meeting on 5 December 2014, the team members took the opportunity to confirm that they have the requisite skills to carry out their roles effectively.<\/p><p> There have been six internal management changes over the past 12 to 18 months and these involved, staff moving from the role of operations resource manager to operations performance manager.  All posts were filled following a competitive process with a competency based interview.  All posts have a specific job description.  Workforce planning and management development and a review of all job descriptions will be progressed during 2015 as part of the implementation of the recommendations from the management review which is due to be finalised in early 2015.<\/p><p> Both the NAS and DFB have statutory powers for the provision of emergency ambulance services in the Dublin city and county areas.  While work was completed to develop and put in place a service level arrangement, a legal challenge by the European Court of Justice in 2007 has meant that this is not possible.  Since 2012 the HSE has developed and put in place a memorandum of understanding with the DFB.  HIQA recommended the development of an improved working relationship between the NAS and DFB.  The HSE and Dublin City Council jointly commissioned a review of all aspects of the ambulance service operated by the DFB in the Dublin area.  This represented a very significant turning point in developing a more positive relationship between the two organisations and all efforts will continue to be maximised in developing further improvements in the working arrangements.<\/p><p> While work is under way to develop the clinical audit function within the NAS, it is acknowledged that more work and investment is required.  Additional funding has, however, been provided for 2015 to advance clinical audit.  The NAS recognises that other models of care delivery can be utilised and some of these are in place in other jurisdictions.  The NAS commenced a pilot treat and discharge programme in April 2014.  Currently, all patients are routinely transported to an acute hospital emergency department in accordance with bypass and other protocols.  Public acceptance of alternative models will require a carefully constructed consultation and education programme.<\/p><p> In 2015 the NAS will develop a multi-year strategy which will be informed by the HIQA review and other reviews commissioned by the HSE and will take account of the new hospital group structures.  I acknowledge the contribution the ambulance staff make every day in providing often lifesaving care to the public.  They constitute a very committed, dedicated and compassionate workforce and deserve our support.

In her opening statement, Ms McGuinness referred to a programme of change, stating, &ldquo;In order to develop a modern and improved ambulance service the NAS commenced a significant change programme in 2012&rdquo;.<\/p> <p>She then went on to outline the ten key strategic objectives of that programme.  One of them was to undertake a national ambulance service capacity review and another was to implement the response times improvement framework.  When one looks at the situation in relation to each of these - I refer, in particular, to the national capacity review - Ms McGuinness stated that these reviews are already under way.  This is the end of 2014.  These were signalled as objectives back in 2012.  In fact, an indication was that the NAS had commenced a significant change programme back then.  It is two years plus since then and it would not give me confidence.  What Ms McGuinness said is that the national capacity review is to independently determine the resource requirements.  At what point is that review?  It seems like an inordinate delay.<\/p><p> Number four of the four updates in relation to these is an independent review of the NAS fleet.  We already know from the information provided to this committee that 20% of the fleet is more than eight years old, with more than 500,000 km on the clock, and of a standard that could let people down in circumstances where emergencies present.  How long will the independent review of the fleet and the independent review of the resource requirement, in its broader sense, take?  These are urgent requirements not only in relation to ambulances and personnel but to how effectively the network of ambulance centres across the country are placed.  Ms McGuinness actually indicated three of them in the course of her address.  How many ambulance centres are there currently?  Are they all in service on a 24-7 basis?  Does Ms McGuinness have the figures for each of the HSE areas?  If she does not have them to hand, maybe she could provide them.  If she has them, I would welcome that, in particular in relation to the north east, where there is a belief and anecdotal evidence that there are serious delays.  I have already recounted here personal experience of that, including in this year.  <\/p><p> Lightfoot highlighted in its summary of recommendations that the national ambulance service should undertake further investigation into why emergency calls per head are so low in Ireland by comparison to England.  It is something to which Ms McGuinness referred also.  She said that this difference cannot be fully explained.  There is a serious differential here of 40% in terms of the difference in ambulance calls per head of the population.  It would suggest to me that Irish people are reluctant to call an ambulance when perhaps that would be what they should do.  Is it consequential on previous experience and a lack of confidence?  These are important and serious questions and it is not enough to park the differential.  It would appear that calls for ambulance support and service in the neighbouring island are significantly greater.<\/p><p> Ms McGuinness talked about the Dublin fire brigade and made the reference to the NAS and the DFB having statutory powers for the provision of emergency ambulance services and that work was completed to develop and put in place a service level arrangement but she did not reflect was what actually said to this committee a short time ago.  The notation by HIQA was that the Dublin fire brigade - I mean no disrespect to the representatives of the NAS here today - had a more acutely refined response time and performance.  It drew a clear distinction between the NAS and the Dublin fire brigade.  Are there lessons for the NAS to learn from the Dublin fire brigade?  These are not my words.  I am asking the question certainly, but the evidence that is at the backdrop to the question is presented by a body entrusted to carry out these assessments and give of its expert and professional opinion.  I am not drawing a distinction between the two.  In fact, I have no experience at all of the Dublin fire brigade service and only have an excellent experience of the personnel working in the NAS.  However, what I do not have is an excellent experience in terms of call out time.  <\/p><p> Ms McGuinness may be aware that I have personal experience.  My family never had occasion to call an ambulance but in the past 12 months, we have had three occasions.  Two of them were cardiac and the other was a collapsed state of an elderly member of my family.   The first cardiac resulted in the death of the victim while the second was myself and I was more fortunate.   Each of the three addresses where the events took place are half a mile from an ambulance station in our town.  Two other stations are located close to us.  The ambulances all came from 45 miles away.  I instance it only because I was present at all three events.  I say it as no criticism of the personnel who presented in all cases and to whom I take my cap off.  However, it has to ring alarm bells.  <\/p><p> I do not believe for one moment that in the three incidents, each of the other three stations were completely out of service or already in service, whatever was the case.  I am really anxious to know what is the status of the station in Monaghan at Rooskey and the situation at Castleblayney and at Cavan General Hospital.  Why was it that on each of those three occasions, ambulances to present in Monaghan town had to come from Virginia in the south east of the neighbouring county of Cavan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600004#C00400","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418751900,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms McGuinness, Mr. Dunne and Dr. O'Donnell.  We all welcome the fact this HIQA report has finally been published and we have an opportunity to debate it.   In many ways, it makes for sobering reading.  This issue has been debated in the D&aacute;il and has been raised by numerous Deputies on many occasions in terms of the concerns they have in regard to response times and resources for the national ambulance service and the need for us to ensure there is confidence among the general public that there will be a timely response in the event of an accident and the ambulance service being called into action.<\/p><p>  The report highlights many deficiencies in the national ambulance service.  I do not think we can pretend they are not there.  If one goes through the report in detail, it quantifies them.   In some areas, the review identifies challenges in relation to workforce and leadership, the model of care and fleet and fleet deployment.<\/p><p>  I put down numerous parliamentary questions in regard to the age of the fleet and the mileage of same.  I think that has been dealt with in the context of the HIQA report.  Certainly, there are major concerns about the age of the fleet and the reliability of same and the servicing of it.  Incidents have been reported to us and they have been published nationally in regard to some of the fleet just not being up to standard in terms of safety, both for the personnel operating it and the transferring of patients.<\/p> <p>As I said, some incidents have been highlighted very publically.  I am quite sure there have been others, as identified in the HIQA report.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the national ambulance service and its relationship with the Dublin fire brigade.  It defies logic that we have a situation where they do not seem to be talking to each other and that proper structures do not seem to be in place so that they can complement and assist each other in a meaningful way.  That has been highlighted in the report.  Are there difficulties, in the context of the national ambulance service, the HSE or whoever, in dealing with that?  <\/p><p> A delegation from the Dublin fire brigade came before the committee.  It seemed to have a fairly efficient system in terms of call out times and responses to emergencies.  We do not seem to view the national ambulance service and the Dublin fire brigade as complementing each other and using their resources efficiently and effectively in a compatible way.  Perhaps the witnesses could refer to that.  <\/p><p> Ambulance services have been debated during Private Members' business in the D&aacute;il on numerous occasions.  The report states the national ambulance service serves a very rural population, with 40% of incidents arising in rural locations.  In England, for example, 12% of incidents are classified as rural in a typical ambulance service.  It goes on to state that this will have significant implications for the ability of the national ambulance service to perform to the same standards as the English ambulance service.  <\/p><p> That leads to a number of questions.  In terms of response times to echo and delta call outs, we are not meeting the HIQA targets.  We do not need a report to identify that problem because it has been highlighted regularly and raised consistently.  We are not meeting those times, and we need to ask why we are not meeting the targets in a manner we would consider appropriate.  <\/p><p> The resources and personnel of the national ambulance service are being reduced in some areas, in particular in the west and Roscommon, where there seems to be a view among the public, which is supported by HIQA, that there is a deficiency in resources.  In rural areas across the country there is major concern that the national ambulance service does not have the necessary capacity.  This is no reflection on the personnel who have highlighted on numerous occasions the enormous pressures under which they work.  They have to travel large distances to and from emergencies to take patients to hospitals.<\/p><p> Do we now have to accept, as identified in the HIQA report, that we need extra resources?  There is no point in pretending otherwise.  Mr. Dunne previously stated to the committee that it is one of the finest ambulance services in the world, and I have no doubt it is, in the context of the resources with which it is provided.  It is a miracle it is providing its current level of service, and that is a reflection of the professionalism and competence of the people working on the front line.  They have to be resourced and assisted, and need extra personnel and vehicles.  <\/p><p> Call-out targets are assessed on the basis of a patient-carrying vehicle being the first responder.  Are we beginning to massage the figures with regard to call-outs?  Very often the first responder is considered the first response.  However, as the committee previously discussed, the targets should be based on a vehicle that can transport a patient, rather than on first responders.  I ask for some extra clarity on that.<\/p><p> Another key area identified as tying up scarce resources are lines of ambulances outside emergency departments in hospitals throughout the country.  Recently, Beaumont Hospital had some 40 patients on trolleys, and had to cancel elective surgeries and send out a message that it did not want people to attend the emergency department.  The national ambulance service took patients elsewhere.  One of the bizarre things happening is that what are already scarce resources, namely, highly trained personnel, are waiting outside emergency departments.  In this day and age there should be some mechanisms to ensure patients can transfer more seamlessly into emergency departments and beyond.  <\/p><p> I do not expect the national ambulance service to resolve this issue, but the HSE has an obligation to address what is a glaringly obvious problem, namely the transfer of a patient from an emergency situation to an emergency department, through the acute hospital setting and, eventually, out the other side.  The idea that we have had numerous instances of ambulances being tied up for long periods of time is very concerning.  <\/p><p> How many minutes do I have?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600005#E00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418752500,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I have given all members eight minutes and spokespersons ten minutes.

What will the response to that be, in terms of the national ambulance service?  Will it oversee the process by which the issues highlighted in the HIQA report are addressed?  Will the HSE do it or will HIQA have some role in the continuous monitoring of the issue raised in the reports?  The national ambulance service has enough to do in terms of trying to deliver a service.  Overseeing the recommendations and observations in the HIQA report would put additional pressure on it.<\/p><p>  Some ambulance services and emergency departments in hospitals have closed in rural areas.  That has a knock-on effect on the pressures being placed on the national ambulance service in delivering emergency care.  Do we have joined-up thinking in terms of the primary care setting, which is critically important and means that patients do not have to travel to and present themselves at emergency departments?  Do we have a strategic plan for the closure of emergency departments in some rural hospitals, in terms of putting resources in place rather than waiting for the ambulance service to be bolstered?  In doing that, we need to make sure we have a proper, fit-for-purpose ambulance service to pick up the pieces from such closures. <\/p><p>  I refer, for example, to Roscommon County Hospital where the emergency department was closed.  There has been a similar downgrading of services in Mallow, County Cork.  The personnel in the national ambulance service have to travel significant distances to transfer patients on a regular basis under an emergency setting, and often under light.  <\/p><p>  The HIQA report clearly identifies that as an issue, particular in rural areas.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600006#F00500","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1418752500,"counter":423,"content":"<p>Senator Colm Burke has three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600006#F00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1418752500,"counter":424,"content":"<p>The Chairman will be lenient.  I thank Ms Laverne for the presentation.  I compliment the ambulance service for the service it provides throughout the country.  <\/p><p>  Over the past two weeks I have made the time and effort to meet members of the ambulance service who are working on the front line.  A few of the issues raised concern me.  One is the number of people employed as supervisors.  There are days when a number of supervisors are on call and others when no supervisor is on call in some centres.  <\/p><p>  A second issue is that in every area there are advanced paramedics who have gone through the training process.  Some days quite a number of them are on call, whereas on other days no advanced paramedic is on call.  <\/p><p>  A third issue relates to Cork, Kerry and Limerick.  I understand 15 people are working in call centres who have not been redeployed.<\/p> <p>Could I get clarification on the total number working in call centres throughout the country who have not yet been redeployed and when is it intended to deal with this matter?   <\/p><p> The next issue I wish to raise is in regard to skills and has been found in that respect in the HIQA report.   I would like to get clarification from the human resources department with regard to people working in the area of human resources.  It would be good to clarify all the training and skills people working in that area have because a skill in this area is a particular skill in itself.  This was one of the issues identified in the HIQA report.  We have not got full clarification as to where this skills deficiency is arising.  It is an issue that has been raised with me.  <\/p><p> The next issue I wish to raise is in regard to meeting with senior management.  The report indicates there was a meeting on 5 December 2014.  Could we get clarification on the senior management involved?  Are we talking about grades 7 and 8 or grade 6?  One of the complaints I received is that there is a lack of and serious deficiency in communication at national level down to people working at grade 6.   One of the matters highlighted to me is that all the issues identified in the HIQA report were ones that had been raised at meetings within the ambulance service during the past two or three years.  I am open to correction on this but I understand there is a move whereby the centre will be located in Tallaght.  Will the Dublin fire brigade ambulance service also operate from that centre or will it operate from a separate centre?  That may have been clarified already but I would like clarification on it.<\/p><p> A major issue that has been raised with me is how staff rotas are devised and who is on call.  As one person put it to me, it is like running a Garda station where all the garda&iacute; are on duty but no sergeant, superintendent or inspector is on call.  That worries me.  This issue has been raised by people who are working in the ambulance service.  It is a concern that has been raised by people I met who have first-hand knowledge of it and not by those with second-hand or third-hand knowledge of it.<\/p><p> I wish to raise the matter of the training programme.  Major cutbacks have occurred in all the health services during the past number of years.  One of the issues raised with me related to training.  It is one of the areas that seems to have suffered.  Is it proposed to ring-fence a certain budget for training and upskilling people who require such back-up support?  Has that been examined for 2015?  What numbers are involved?  I understand there are 1,600 people in the ambulance service and of them 300 have been upskilled to the scale of an advanced paramedic but that up to 60% of those in the service should be upskilled up to the scale.  What programme is in place for doing that and what is the timescale for trying to achieve that target?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600006#F00700","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418753100,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for those questions and I allowed him five minutes to make his contribution.

That control centre will be based in Tallaght.  It is ready and will be opened in 2015 and there will be a resilience site in Ballyshannon.  When the centre is open it would be useful if the members of the committee were to visit it.  It is a state-of-the-art facility and it will change the  model of operation.  When the computer system is in place, it will be possible to monitor where every ambulance is in the country and to deploy from the centre the most appropriate and nearest ambulance to where it is required.  The centre has all the equipment that a modern service would require.  That invitation is extended to the committee to visit the centre when it is opened.<\/p><p>  The other ten strategic priorities were identified during the course of 2013 and the Deputy mentioned one in particular relating to the capacity review.  Very few companies have the skills set to carry out a capacity review. One had not been carried out in the ambulance service previously.  Given our rural geographics, the purpose of the review was to examine where best our ambulance stations should be placed.  The stations has been in place for a significant number of years and given the changes in demographics and movement in members of the population, the review was to assess if any changes needed to be made.  <\/p><p>  We have put in place a number of intermediate care vehicles.  In 2012 we had 11 intermediate care vehicles, which are the vehicles used in hospital transfers and now we have 56.  We needed to identify how many of those vehicles were needed.  We did not have the expertise in our service to address that.  We also needed to identify how many additional ambulances would be needed.  The response time targets had been set down by HIQA.  A preplanned capacity review had not been carried out to determine the number of ambulances that would be needed to meet those targets and the number of paramedics and advanced paramedics that would be needed to provide that level of response.  That was why we carried out the capacity review.  <\/p><p>  That review will be completed by the end of December this year and we will have it before Christmas.  I have provided executive summary of it to the committee.  The Lightfoot summary is the executive summary of the capacity review.  It specifically deals with the 7 minutes and 59 seconds first-response time and signals that the 75% response rate target is not achievable and that to achieve a 64% response time target would require very significant investment in terms of 290 wholetime equivalents, extra ambulances, extra intermediate care vehicles.   The executive summary provided by Lightfoot divides the country and indicates that some countries are more rural based than others and that there are minor urban areas.  That will result in a variation in response times, even with the investment of most significant of resources.  When the capacity review is finalised we expect we will able to identify the blackspots.  We have already identified there are significant blackspots in the west, in Mulranny, Tuam and Loughglynn.  We are staffing those and they will be opened in 2015 and on a 24 hour, seven days a week basis to address the needs and concerns there but there may be other areas there that also need to be addressed.  That was the purpose of the capacity review.  That will be published and will be available to the committee.<\/p><p>  A number of concerns were raised about the fleet and the Deputy correctly stated it is an ageing fleet.  We got extra money in 2014 and put in place 36 new ambulances.  Obviously, we would like to have much more money to replace them every year if that was possible but it is not possible within the financial constraints prevailing.  We also put in place two critical care vehicles.  It is great that in 2015 we have money again for 47 new ambulances.  These will be totally new ambulances.  This will be mean every ambulance will have be from 2007 or be younger or older whichever way one wants to cause that.  Every ambulance will be capable of being remounted and having its engine replaced, which was not possible with the older service.  All our ambulances are maintained.  There is a full maintenance register and protocol in place and it is very strictly monitored.  No ambulance is in operation with over 500,000 miles on the clock.  When engines are replaced, it is not possible to turn back the clock or the mileage shown on the odometer.  One would not know if there were 500,000, 600,000 miles or only 120,000 miles on the engine.  We have introduced a change whereby a sticker is put inside - which is a simple solution - indicating that the engine has been replaced at whatever number of kilometres were on the engine.  <\/p><p>  The independent review by the firm we commissioned was an extra level of surety to assess what else we need to do with regard to the maintenance of the fleet and to have an independent assessment in terms of our fleet requirement.  That will be available also at the end of December.  These reviews take time because a great deal of data have to be gone through to analyse what is required.  <\/p><p>  We have 100 stations.  Mr. Dunne will give details in regard to Dublin North East in particular, which is what the Deputy requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Laverne McGuinness"},{"type":"speech","time":1418753100,"counter":428,"content":"<p>The north east rather than Dublin North East was mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600007#G00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418753100,"counter":429,"content":"<p>Apologies, the north east.  The response to emergency calls is slower in Ireland compared to the UK.  The capacity review shows that the rate of call out of our ambulance service is 40% that of the UK.<\/p> <p>We are looking through that and Dr. Cathal O'Donnell will speak about it in more detail.  It signifies that we have wide access to our GP services, including out-of-hours access.  Our GP services are accessible on a 24-hour basis.  It is very unlikely that a person would go to a GP and not be seen.  The situation in the UK is not the same.  At the moment we transport 100% of our patients to hospital and HIQA has said that we need to look at alternative models of care.  However, given that only 40% of people are actually ringing the ambulance service in the first instance, we have less of an opportunity to divert patients elsewhere.  We are looking at \"treat and discharge\" and \"hear and treat\" as part of alternative models of care.  We need to do that in collaboration with GPs.  Dr. O'Donnell will elaborate on that further.<\/p><p> There is an ongoing working relationship between the Dublin fire brigade and the national ambulance service.  In the briefing document I outlined some of the legal constraints regarding service level arrangements which the European Court of Justice ruled on.  We could not enter into a formal service level arrangement but we do have a memorandum of understanding in place under which we transfer funding.  It is not the optimum working arrangement that two service providers are providing different models of care across Dublin city.  The Dublin fire brigade does not use a separate call taker and dispatcher, which is the model we have moved towards.  <\/p><p> We are working towards enhancing our working relationship.  We have met Dublin fire brigade again and there are ongoing meetings between the Chief Fire Officer and the director of the national ambulance service and at the highest levels of the organisation, the Director General and the City Manager have agreed a joint implementation plan in response to HIQA.  However, there are areas that need to be streamlined in the interests of patients and that is why we commissioned the capacity review for Dublin city and county.  That review will be publicly available in February 2015.

We had expected that there would be a difference but we were slightly surprised at its magnitude.  In the UK, and in England in particular, in terms of emergency and unscheduled care over the last ten years, there were issues with out-of-hours access to GPs and they put in place a number of different initiatives to address that problem, including urgent care centres, walk-in centres, minor injury units and NHS Direct, which was a telephone advice service which did not work out very well.  That service has now been reinvented as the 111 service.  All of that meant confusion for the average member of the public who had a medical problem.  People did not know what was the correct pathway for them so they reverted to what they were comfortable with which was either ringing 999 or attending a hospital accident and emergency department.  That goes a long way towards explaining the difference.  Members of the public in the UK tend to dial 999 more for issues now than they would have done in the past because the correct pathway for them was unclear.<\/p><p>  The second issue is that in rural Ireland in particular, people tend to ring their GP even when they should not do so but should call an ambulance, perhaps because they have a good relationship with him or her.  GPs are very good at recognising that and will often divert such patients and the GP co-ops would often transfer such calls to us.  I think that explains the difference in the context of the 40% finding, which is in stark contrast to the situation in the UK.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600008#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cathal O'Donnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418753700,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I will now ask Mr. Dunne to respond to the question about Rooskey and Monaghan and Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's concerns in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600008#H00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Laverne McGuinness"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418753700,"counter":435,"content":"<p>In the north east area comprising Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, there are ten ambulance stations located in Navan, Dunshaughlin, Ardee, Drogheda, Dundalk, Castleblayney, Monaghan town, Virginia, Cavan town and Trim.  With the exception of Trim in County Meath, all of the stations are 24 hour stations, staffed around the clock.  The station at Trim works on a 12-hour, five-day week basis.  It is what we call an emergency dispatch point and calls are responded to by a rapid response vehicle crewed by an advance paramedic in the area to give immediate help to patients in that area.<\/p><p>  One must take into account that under the control room centralisation programme which is ongoing, we have developed call taker and dispatcher roles.  We used to have a singular point of contact, known as an emergency medical controller who did both jobs.  We have split that job into two specific roles and both are licensed under the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, to carry out their role and function within the control centre.  When one dials 999 or 112 now, one speaks to a dedicated call taker in any of the national control centres who is trained, licensed and registered under the PHECC.  The call is then moved automatically to a dispatcher who is also licensed and trained under the PHECC and he or she deals solely with dispatching vehicles.  The operating procedure is that in any case the closest emergency ambulance is dispatched.  While these two sections of the control room work in isolation somewhat, they also work together because they have full view of everything that is going on in the area at any given time.  They are also supported now by call taker supervisors, dispatch supervisors and the control manager on a 24\/7 basis.  If there are any issues ongoing, they are immediately escalated to that level within the control centre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600008#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Dunne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418753700,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Deputy Kelleher asked a number of questions too.  I have dealt with his questions on the fleet and the relationship with the Dublin fire brigade and will now deal with his questions on response times.  I referred to the capacity review which will address some of the concerns around response times.  We are improving our response times for both ECHO and DELTA calls.  The times given relate to the patient-carrying vehicle getting to the scene.  In other words, the 17 minutes, 59 seconds response time relates to ambulances arriving on scene.  That has improved from 63.4% to 69% with regard to DELTA calls and from 65.7% to 78.5% for ECHO calls but we still have some way to go.  Some additional improvements can be made in call activation within our resources but additional resources will be required to bring about further improvements.<\/p><p>  The issue of delays at emergency departments is very significant and one on which we are focusing.  It is not something that can be dealt with solely by the ambulance service itself.  We are working with the acute hospital services in order to improve turnaround times at emergency departments.  In January 2014 we introduced what we call an \"escalation framework\" in the emergency departments whereby if ambulances are blocked up for a period of time, that escalates right up through to the highest level in the organisations and telephone calls are made and we say, \"This is unacceptable; we are nearing a point where ambulances will have to be locked\".  That has significantly improved the situation for us although it is still not where we would like it to be.  At this point, 94% of ambulances are released in less than an hour and 67% are released within 30 minutes or less.  We have a pilot programme in place in Cork University Hospital whereby the minute an ambulance arrives at the back of the emergency department staff in the department see it on their screens and know they must be on their toes and carry out the clinical transfer as quickly as possible.  There is more work to be done in this area but it is being done collaboratively between the hospitals and the ambulance service.  This must be seen in the context of the fact that our emergency departments have been particularly busy this year.  There were an extra 6,000 admissions in the year to October.  They are busy indoors in the hospitals and then the ambulance service has also experienced an increase in calls of 1,000 per month.  There is congestion at both ends in that regard.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher asked who will be monitoring or overseeing the implementation plan.  The plan will be developed jointly between Dublin fire brigade and the national ambulance service.  It will take account of the various reviews which are coming on stream, namely the capacity review, management review and the review of the Dublin fire brigade service.<\/p> <p>It will be overseen nationally by the HSE, Health Service Executive, while the Department of Health will have a significant role in it, as well as HIQA, the Health Information and Quality Authority, requiring regular updates.<\/p><p> Regarding the closure of accident and emergency departments and the ambulance service, significant ambulance resources were put into Roscommon to ensure a safety net.

Tallaght will then be the main hub for five eighths of the country while Ballyshannon will deal with the remaining three eighths.  The reason for the selection of this model is based on international best practice.  We found it is better to have a live robust model for resilience all the time.  For example, the UK has one control centre for an area.  The problem we found with that is that in the event of a breakdown in services, it can take several minutes to get a resilience centre up.  Accordingly, we have two centres which will be fully staffed.<\/p><p>  The state-of-the-art building has been specifically designed for the job it must do.  Much time went in to ensure it does what it is supposed to do.  It can operate for four days on its own electricity generation.  The building has a command and control centre, the national ambulance training college and NAS administration.  It is classed as a level three data centre with the amount of data connectivity it has and the resilience built around it in the case of any breakdown.

Some of the questions I was to ask have already been answered so I will hone in on two points, the first of which pertains to Mr. Dunne in particular.  One of the most worrying points made to us a couple of weeks ago arising from the HIQA report was on the fact that there were people in senior positions appointed without due process during recruitment.  Senior personnel were appointed who did not have the qualifications or experience required, and there were senior personnel who claimed to HIQA that they did not have the skills necessary to carry out their duties in their current roles.  Mr. Dunne stated he had a meeting with his senior managers and they all said they were happy out and that there is no need for concern.  Is that the box ticked with regard to the concern raised with HIQA?  Alternatively, as raised by Senator Burke, are we to delve down and have individual conversations?  Are we to consider specifically the people who were appointed but who did not go through the proper recruitment process and those whom HIQA can state do not have the required skill set or qualifications for their positions?  Could Mr. Dunne expand on that?<\/p><p>  I am curious about why it is proposed to carry out clinical audits only next year although there has been a clinical director in the Ambulance Service apparently for two years.  I do not wish to be smart in making this point as I totally agree that focusing on the numbers is probably not the right way to go.  They are very stark and, as Ms McGuinness stated, we cannot meet the demand based on the resources we have.  However, we need to focus on the outcomes.  If we have a clinical director, why are we not already focusing on clinical outcomes?  With respect, given that we are only starting to focus on outcomes, what has the director been doing over the months in which he or she has been working in ambulance services?  Perhaps there is considerable backroom work to be done.  Perhaps the delegates will explain this to us.<\/p><p>  With regard to the turnaround times in hospitals, it is nice to see there is an improvement.  Perhaps the delegation will tease this out.  The improvement about which I have been told is an interim measure involving something called an ICO unit that has been introduced in hospitals.  Perhaps the delegation will explain exactly what an ICO is.  For how long do patients actually stay in an ICO holding?  Are patients still considered to be in the care of the Ambulance Service or are they passed over to hospitals such that they are accounted for in counts of the numbers on trolleys?  What kinds of patients are not put into an ICO unit?  What statistics are there on the waiting periods, types of patients and turnover in the ICOs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600010#L01400","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1418754900,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for attending.

Most of my questions have been asked.  I just want to focus on one or two issues.  We constantly hear on the ground about the lack of trained personnel and resources.  We are sometimes told ambulances are actually parked up because they do not have personnel to operate them.  Two weeks ago, I heard two reports about ambulances that had been parked up.  In the first case, an ambulance had to travel a greater distance than usual, taking over an hour to get to its destination.  In the second case, and ambulance had to go from Kilkenny to Youghal, which is quite a long distance.  It took over an hour and a half to get its destination.  When it got there, drugs had to be administered but there were no personnel on board to do so.  Consequently, another ambulance had to come from Dungarvan.  There are many question marks associated with the availability of trained personnel and resources.  These are just two cases that happen to have been brought to my attention two weeks ago.  Both occurred in the same week.<\/p> <p> The other point I wanted to focus on was our meeting here on 2 December.  That report categorically stated that some senior and other staff did not have the required skills or technical knowledge to do the job.  That was on 2 December and Ms McGuinness states here that she met with her senior team on 5 December, when the team members took the opportunity to confirm that they had the requisite skills to carry out their roles effectively.  How many people were actually at that meeting and how many people said that?  Three days earlier, the opposite is quite clearly stated.  Did Ms McGuinness meet five or ten people?  Are there still people out there who are not trained?  How is the HSE going to overcome that?<\/p><p> On the capacity review, it states here that the level of investment required is in the order of an additional 290 full-time staff as well as additional vehicles, emergency ambulances, intermediate care vehicles and rapid response vehicles.

I think the national ambulance service is doing a phenomenal job considering it has one hand tied behind its back when it comes to resources.  There are three times as many ambulances in Northern Ireland as in the Republic, and we are trying to compete on a level playing field, which is impossible.  In her initial contribution, Ms McGuinness said response times are improving and this is correct, but the latest available figures for the west show that 45% of life-threatening incidents are responded to within a 19-minute period.  Those figures are 12 months old.  For the last six months I have been looking for current figures and the only thing I have got in that time is a link to the HSE website.  It would be nice if we could have the current figures.<\/p><p>  We have three ambulance black spots in the west of Ireland.  They were identified by the Western Health Board back in 2001 and at long last today we have a commitment to operate on a 24\/7 basis.  In the HSE service plan there is &euro;700,000 set aside to operate these three stations.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, told us in the D&aacute;il that it would take &euro;1.8 million to provide a 24\/7 operation in the three stations.  Is the money being made available now to provide that without the removal of resources from the surrounding stations?  Why has it taken so long to resource this?  We have had the Western Health Board report and an independent review in 2005 of the ambulance services in the west and nothing was done about it.  There was a whistleblower's report given to the HSE last year and to the Minister this year listing 216 incidents and near misses in a six-month period in County Roscommon, and yet we have to wait until HIQA publishes a report before anything can happen.<\/p><p>  My final question concerns the capacity review.  It seems the HSE is throwing in the towel as far as rural Ireland is concerned.  The witnesses are comparing the situation here with that in England, which in my view is a whitewash.  Looking at Scotland, 74.7% of responses there were within the eight-minute target in 2012-13 and we are saying we cannot achieve that here.  In Northern Ireland their target for responses within eight minutes is 72.5% and not less than 65% in any area.  Ms McGuinness is saying that at best, with the resources put in, we can only do it 64% of the time.  It might be worthwhile looking to see what they are doing in Northern Ireland and in Scotland rather than England.  <\/p><p>  These delays are lives lost and that is the reality of it.  It is also important to point out that the HSE is still not publishing its figures for first responses within eight minutes.  We do not even know what is happening on the ground at the moment as we do not have those figures.  When are we actually going to start seeing some real response times regarding first responders landing at the scene of the incident and carrying out the type of work we know our ambulance service can do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600011#M00600","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1418755500,"counter":474,"content":"<p>We have got response times from an Oireachtas Library and Research Service paper given to members of the committee today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600011#M00700","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1418755500,"counter":475,"content":"<p>They are for vehicles rather than first responders.

I very much welcome the fantastic work the ambulance services is doing and the lives it is undoubtedly saving.  When there are occasional concerns, I think we are entitled to get answers to those questions and not to be obfuscated or information to be stopped.  My request concerned four incidents in County Louth.  All I got was the date and a line about a service provider having an issue with another service provider.  There is a lack of transparency on the rare occasions when we need to have clarity.  Because people do unfortunately pass away - and it is nobody's fault and the ambulance service is certainly doing its extreme best - I still have to deal with complaints and I do not have answers as to what exactly happened.

Over the last 12 to 18 months there were six senior positions which all went through a competitive process with a very specific job description.  There were two staff members at a senior level working within the ambulance service who were reassigned to alternative roles which they had the skill sets to carry out.

Consequently, we specifically asked in respect of senior management because approximately six posts were replaced in the past 12 to 18 months, all of which went through a competitive process.  There was a specific job description for these posts and Mr. Martin Dunne again met his senior team on an individual basis to ascertain whether any of the team members had particular skill deficits that they thought needed to be addressed.  I also asked HIQA whether it could identify this but because of confidentiality issues, it could not do so.  Notwithstanding this, we are certainly not leaving it lie at that.  As the joint committee is aware, a management capacity review has been commissioned to examine what is the appropriate organisational structure for the management of ambulance services and all job descriptions will also be reviewed in that light.  We are certainly not taking this issue lightly and are giving it significant consideration.<\/p><p>  As for the issue of clinical audit, while the medical director of the national ambulance service, Dr. Cathal O'Donnell, will speak about it, we are measuring clinical outcomes.

It is a standard form with two copies, one of which goes with the patient in the hospital and becomes part of the ongoing clinical record, while the carbon copy stays with the ambulance service.  The form has 640 individual data fields on it and on an average call, 129 are filled in.  We handle 700 999 calls every 24 hours spread over 100 locations and if one multiplies it out, we are generating approximately 33 million individual pieces of data each year.

It comprises using a tablet - perhaps similar to the one the Deputy has in front of her - with drop-down menus and data collected.  This means that one can pull out the data electronically instantaneously and that patient information can arrive at the hospital even before the patient.  For the past two or three years I have been pushing very hard to get this through the Estimates process, but, unfortunately, it has not yet happened.  This year, for the first time, we received some revenue money towards it and we are exploring how we might implement it.  Because I recognised a year ago that this would not happen any time soon, starting in the new year we will put in place an interim solution, whereby we will scan the paper-based records and use what is called optical character recognition technology to pull information from them.

Separately last year, in conjunction with the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, we commissioned an academic piece of work to identify a set of clinical outcome indicators that would be suitable for pre-hospital care in this country.  That process is now complete and we have a menu or suite of more than 100 clinical outcome indicators that have been identified through an academic process as being suitable for use by us or any other ambulance service in Ireland.

Based on the information available, we must set a response time - a stretched target of what is achievable - for categories of minor urban and rural areas and towns and put in place a stretched trajectory for continuing to improve over a specific period.

The HSE recognises that the service is not as good as it should be in respect of community first responders, of which only 105 are in place.  We met representatives of Community First Responders Ireland with a view to widening the scope of first responders.

The purpose of the meeting is to receive a response from the witnesses to the programme on RTE on 8 December entitled \"Inside Bungalow 3\".  The programme included very serious allegations of abuse and mistreatment of residents in a specific care setting.  Accordingly, the committee at its meeting last Thursday asked as a first step that we would have this meeting tonight.  We will focus on some of the broader issues regarding congregated settings, residential care settings and the treatment of people with intellectual disability.  The HIQA report on Redwood has also been published and tonight's meeting is an opportune one.

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Pat Healy, national director for social care; Dr. Philip Crowley, national director for quality improvement, and Ms. Marion Meany, head of operations and service improvements for disabilities within the social care division.<br\/>&Aacute;ras Attracta, which is located on a 13 acre site in Swinford, County Mayo, is a residential respite and day service for adults with an intellectual disability.  It currently provides 100 residential places, 95 for residents and five respite places.  &Aacute;ras Attracta was the subject of a HIQA investigation and report in February 2014.  This followed on from information received by HIQA, including information on the death of a resident at the centre.  On foot of the report, HIQA made 59 recommendations.  All of the recommendations have been implemented, including a significant programme of training and development for staff.  There have been 423 hours of training to date in 2014, including over 100 hours in bungalow 3, which was at the centre of the &quot;Prime Time&quot; report.  Training in relevant topics, including amongst many others adult protection, crisis prevention and intervention management, care planning and trust in care, has been implemented in the facility by the HSE.  The facility received positive reports from the regulator on subsequent unannounced visits in May 2014, who clearly stated that:<blockquote>[I]nspectors found the provider and person in charge with the support of staff had significantly improved practice in relation to these areas and the specific issues identified on the last inspection had been addressed.  The inspectors also found that in response to a required action from the previous inspection, the provider had put in place an effective management system and this had resulted in a significant improvement in the provision of quality and safe care for residents.<\/blockquote>It is therefore a matter of the most serious concern to the HSE that the totally unacceptable behaviour and attitudes towards residents, as seen in the RTE footage, continued in bungalow 3 until the allegations were uncovered and made known to the HSE.<br\/>The HSE became aware of the situation in bungalow 3 on receipt of a formal letter of complaint from a student on work experience placement at the centre.  The student worked in the facility for ten weeks from September to November, including three weeks in bungalow 3.  The HSE immediately acted on the written complaint.  Subsequently, it emerged that the student was an undercover reporter for &quot;Prime Time&quot; and the producers in RTE have told the HSE that it took a number of weeks and the placement of a fixed camera before any unacceptable behaviour became evident.  This highlights the challenges in detecting such unacceptable practices, attitudes and behaviours.  Once the HSE became aware of the serious allegations, it initiated an immediate three-level set of actions as follows.  At the first level, the most immediate priority has been to guarantee that a safe and caring environment exists for the residents of bungalow 3.  A number of immediate actions have already been taken at &Aacute;ras Attracta.  Personnel against whom allegations were made have, without prejudice, been put off duty.  A total of 13 staff have been put off duty.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and HIQA were notified and Mr. Christy Lynch, chief executive officer of KARE has been appointed as independent chairman to conduct a full and thorough investigation into the matter.<\/p> <p>A total of 13 staff have been put off duty.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and HIQA were notified.  Mr. Christy Lynch, CEO of KARE has been appointed as independent chairman to conduct a full and thorough investigation into the matter.  Practice co-ordinators have been assigned to bungalow three to supervise practice and implementation of care plans and to provide assurance to management.  External expert advice from Scotland, originally engaged following the first HIQA inspection, has now been re-engaged to support the service at &Aacute;ras Attracta, responding to the needs of the residents at bungalow three.<\/p><p> At the second level, a full assurance review has also been commissioned of all of the units in the &Aacute;ras Attracta facility under the independent chairmanship of Dr. Kevin McCoy, assisted by three independent experts within the field.  This group will review the programme of work already implemented on foot of the reports from HIQA and HSE audits to establish their effectiveness, identify the gaps that arose and make recommendations for further improvements for each unit at &Aacute;ras Attracta.<\/p><p> In addition, the output from the review team will help to inform a system-wide programme of improvement and assurance for all residential centres, including a mechanism for input from service users and their families and staff at all levels throughout the sector and academia will be involved.<\/p><p> At the third level, the HSE has initiated a system-wide programme of measures to assure that the quality and safety of services delivered by 90 providers in the 908 designated residential centres for people with disabilities is in line with the requirements of the regulations and standards as inspected by HIQA.  In this regard, a six-step programme will be implemented and monitored by a national implementation task force for disability residential services, led by Pat Healy.<\/p><p> The national implementation task force will drive the implementation of the programme and development of long-term sustainable and evidence-based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings.  <\/p><p> Implementation of safeguarding vulnerable persons at risk of abuse - national policy and procedures - is the policy which is for all HSE and HSE-funded services and it builds on and incorporates existing policies in HSE disability and elder abuse services and in a range of other disability service providers.  It will provide a consistent approach to safeguard and protect people with disabilities and older people from abuse and neglect.  The policy defines the types of abuse and who is at risk of experiencing such abuse.  It gives direction in the area of recognising abuse and how complaints can be made as well as the procedures to be followed to investigate any claims of abuse.  A dedicated office for the implementation of the policy has been established, building on previous work undertaken in the area of elder abuse.<\/p><p> In terms of advocacy, the HSE will work in partnership with key internal and external stakeholders, families and service users to develop and implement a volunteer advocacy programme, similar to the model being developed for older persons and drawing on experience of other models of advocacy currently in use by disability groups.  The HSE will support the development of service user-family councils that will concern themselves with the welfare of all residents and will seek to protect residents' rights and to enable them to participate in matters that affect their daily lives.  These councils will be independently chaired and will empower service users and their families and will focus on quality development based on service user needs.<\/p><p> In terms of evaluation and practice improvement, this will involve undertaking an evaluation on the transfer of standards of care into practice in services provided by the 90 service providers which deliver residential services in designated residential centres regulated by HIQA.  In collaboration with service users, staff,  locally and nationally, will devise a quality improvement plan to support the sustainability of good practice throughout disability services around the country.  The team has extensive knowledge and competencies in the area of intellectual disability and provision has been made to expand the team in 2015.<\/p><p> The recommendations of the McCoy review in respect of &Aacute;ras Attracta and the broader system wide programme of improvement and assurance will be implemented.  A national summit held today, which both I and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, addressed, had participation not only from the HSE and the Department of Health but also from HIQA, the National Disability Authority, national advocacy services, the CEOs and senior management from the 90 providers, voluntary sector representatives and advocacy groups.  The output from the summit will inform the work of the national implementation task force which held it&rsquo;s first meeting this afternoon, following the summit.  The system-wide reform programme will be included in the operational plan for the social care division in 2015 and further summits to review progress are scheduled March and June of 2015.  The membership of the national implementation task force, the investigation team, chaired by Mr. Christy Lynch, and the assurance review team, chaired by Dr. Kevin McCoy, are available for the information of members.  <\/p><p> Steps are also being taken for the appointment of confidential recipient for staff in HSE and HSE-funded services for vulnerable persons.  I am pleased to announce that Leigh Gath has agreed to take up this important role.  The role, of which the finer details have yet to be finalised, involves acting as a confidential recipient for whistleblowers, including  staff and clients and their relatives and friends, in relation to safeguarding concerns and issues of alleged abuse, negligence or other mistreatment.  Leigh Gath has been an objective critic of the HSE on disability matters over the past years.  Both staff and clients can be reassured that she will be an important champion for people who may be concerned for various reasons when they make complaints.  The terms of reference for the role are currently being agreed.<\/p><p> As director general of the HSE, I wish to put on record again that what was viewed on the RTE \"Prime Time\" programme falls well below the standards that we expect in the health services and displayed an absence of dignity, respect and human kindness for the most vulnerable citizens for whom we care.  Such standards should not and will not be tolerated in the health service or the HSE.  At the centre of many of these examples of poor practice is the individual responsibility of staff members.  I urge all members of staff of the HSE, without fear or favour, to blow the whistle on any instance of misconduct, disrespect or abuse towards residents, clients, patients or any service user should they ever witness it.  On behalf of the HSE, I again wish to apologise unreservedly to the residents concerned, to their families and to society more generally for the distress experienced at any time in relation to poor standards of care provided to them in bungalow three.  This concludes my opening statement and together with my colleagues, we will endeavour to answer all questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600016#R00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418758800,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien for his contribution.   The \"Prime Time\" programme was very disturbing for people who watched it.  It goes without saying that it clearly indicated appalling treatment of very vulnerable people and everybody would condemn such activities.  We must ask what can we do to ensure it does not happen again.  Clearly, it is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate but as legislators and policy-makers, we have an obligation to hold people to account - that includes people in the HSE and others - in terms of ensuring we come forward with solutions to address concerns.  The concerns are that this could be happening elsewhere.  I do not think any of us can rule that out.<\/p><p>  What actions is the HSE taking in the short term in regard to residential units in which physically and intellectually disabled people are being cared for in a congregated setting?  The HIQA report and recommendations and the McCoy report and recommendations will have to be implemented. <\/p><p>This is just an observation-criticism but HIQA has reported many times and published many recommendations in key areas of health and the HSE has not always covered itself in glory in responding to, and implementing, those recommendations.  I have instanced the whole area of maternity services.  Very often resourcing is the issue but sometimes the recommendations made by HIQA are not always implemented in the manner it would have envisaged or in the manner we, and sometimes the HSE, would have liked because of lack of resources.  However, in this case, we cannot leave anything to chance because the people being cared for deserve our full protection.<\/p><p>  In this case, the student was an undercover person who worked in &Aacute;ras Attracta between September and November.<\/p> <p> There was a report on a death in &Aacute;ras Attracta made previously to HIQA where HIQA carried out an investigation.  The key question is, were there other reports brought to the HSE's attention.  One must be asked why \"Prime Time\" picked &Aacute;ras Attracta, specifically bungalow 3.  Were there reports of abuse, ill treatment, lack of oversight, basic lack of humanity shown to other persons?  Were such reports ever brought to the attention of the HSE by anybody working in &Aacute;ras Attracta or by those resident in &Aacute;ras Attracta or their family members because it is hard to believe that somebody would merely arrive with a camera and start working in an undercover manner without having some knowledge?  I wonder had the HSE any similar knowledge in that context.<\/p><p> There are 90 providers and over 900 residential units.  As I asked in my opening statement, what measures can the HSE put in place?  Clearly, HIQA carries out inspections.  It is now legally charged with that responsibility.  However, often the inspections are box-ticking exercises - I do not mean that in any condescending way - in that they involve a template looking at physical aspects such as the square footage, the number of staff per patient and fire exits.  Is there a need for us to broaden the remit of HIQA or is HIQA even capable of ensuring that patients, the advocates of patients and family members are also spoken to so that in the context of visiting these residential units, not only are the obvious physical environment and surroundings inspected but there would be discussions with staff and, as importantly, residents?<\/p><p> Mr. O'Brien spoke about a confidential recipient line and Ms Leigh Gath being appointed, and I welcome that.  He stated the terms of reference must be drafted and the basic infrastructure around the confidential recipient must be put in place, but that must be done quickly.  All staff in these residential care units should be informed that not only will the confidential recipient be in an office, but that there will be a strong promotional aspect throughout all of these residential centres, that all families members and residents will be informed of same in a meaningful and forthright manner that this confidential recipient is there to help and protect, and that the confidential recipient will be given adequate resources.<\/p><p> On the broader issue, while HIQA is statutorily charged with overseeing and inspecting these centres, the HSE is responsible ultimately for what happens in such centres, not only the ones for which the HSE provides directly but also those that it funds.  Has the HSE adequate resources?  Has the HSE the capability and expertise to investigate itself when complaints are made?  That is the key issue.  We have seen it in other areas, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where we had to go to the Garda Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  One always has concerns about an organisation investigating itself.  While there is HIQA and other outside bodies which are statutorily charged, there is a strong obligation on the HSE to ensure that it has within its ranks staff who, if such breaches should happen again, are not afraid to act or hold persons to account.<\/p><p> While we are talking about &Aacute;ras Attracta only, there is concern for those who are cared for in the home environment.  I published a Bill on the matter and other Members published Bills in the past.  We must accept that while the vast majority of those who care for the vulnerable, be they the elderly or persons with physical or intellectual disabilities, do so for all the right reasons.  If this kind of abuse can happen in a congregated setting where professionals are the carers I would be amazed if there were not forms of abuse carried out in the home setting and I wonder is it time for us to put an inspectorate in place for those funded to care for persons in the home setting, for instance, through the carer's allowance, to inspect that environment as well.  For example, in my constituency I have come across one or two cases where I was concerned about the individual who was being cared for by persons in receipt of carer's allowance.  There is no inspection pathway available other than that of a public health nurse who one could contact to ask to call.  I wonder, in the broader context, bearing in mind that a large amount of people are cared for in the home environment, whether we should put in place quickly a statutory inspectorate to address that genuine concern.  Senator Colm Burke spoke last week about publishing a Bill.  I published one in 2012.  It is time we act on this as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600017#S00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418759400,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I apologise for the absence of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who is due to speak in the D&aacute;il on a Private Members' motion.

Nobody who watched the programme the other night did not draw parallels between what we saw carried out in &Aacute;ras Attracta and what we saw in the child care setting.  The similarity is that those in receipt of the service are non-verbal, exposed to danger and vulnerable.  We as a society must do much better than we are doing for those vulnerable groups.<\/p><p>  What concerned me most is when we saw the person who was a management position go in and physically sit on a woman who has brittle bones, and that the staff stood by and thought this was fun.<\/p> <p>The woman's name was Ivy and she was humiliated further by being asked to apologise to staff and people thought that was acceptable.<\/p><p> What concerns me is that all the HIQA reports in the world are not going to root out that kind of behaviour.  We need a focus on the kind of people and relationships they have with the people they are looking after.  We have to turn this whole thing on its head in terms of how we are operating services.  First, the camera was there for however many weeks, but the only time I saw the manager - granted in the excerpts I saw - come into the building was when he came in to sit on that woman.  Who was in there looking to see what quality of service was being provided?  We saw some very tender moments.  One saw a care staff member putting some lipstick on a person and brushing her hair.

In fairness, HIQA also carries out inspections without giving notice at a large number of nursing homes and it is important to ensure that information is publicised.  In regard to this facility, I do not understand something about the lack of checks and balances.  For instance, some of the information we got from the \"Prime Time\" report indicates that if there were a medical review of patients, the average GP would have been able to identify a patient in a more distressed state if it was something that happened suddenly.  If it was not suddenly happening and had not occurred over a short period of time, that means it was going on for a long period of time.  Where was the failure here?  In every system in the health care sector, there are checks and balances and we do not always need HIQA to identify issues.  What else do we need to put in place outside HIQA and the appointment of a confidential recipient?  The patients themselves will not be able to get the number of the confidential recipient.  From a medical and nursing care perspective what else do we need to do in terms of checks and balances to ensure we do not have a repeat of this or, if it is happening in other facilities, to ensure we can identify it at an early stage and deal with it?

As Deputy Billy Kelleher indicated, it is true the HSE has a somewhat patchy record in terms of the implementation of HIQA reports.  However, that is not the case in respect of &Aacute;ras Attracta.  All of the recommendations were being implemented, yet there is clear evidence from the video shot - over 200 hours of filming was undertaken - of what happened in bungalow 3.  The central question that arises relates to the additional steps we need to take, but I do not think it is an issue of HIQA being in some way defective.  Regulation can only take us so far.  Cultural change is required in the context of some of the other actions we need to take.  There is a realisation that, regardless of whether it is in a community or non-congregated setting, in a place such as bungalow 3 or a private home, once the doors are closed, we cannot see what the particular subset of people behind them are doing.<\/p> <p>This is what RTE, in its efforts, has demonstrated to us and is one of the reasons we are focusing very strongly on empowering whistleblowing in the health service and making it easier for people who have concerns.  We saw in the film that some people did not appear to be taking part directly in any of the abusive practices, but did not appear to be doing anything to stop them.  We want to empower these individuals to blow the whistle more easily.<br\/>We also intend, as I have mentioned elsewhere, to undertake undercover investigations using the same techniques as RTE.  We have also published a European prior information notice, which is part of the procurement process, to seek the specialist advice and services we would require for the use of CCTV in vulnerable care settings on an overt basis, that is in an open and transparent manner, but also, where there may be a <i>prima facie<\/i>case for doing so subject to us being able to make this legal, decent and honourable, also using on occasion covert filming in various settings.  It is apparent that the measures one would have expected to have an appropriate outcome did not have the desired outcome in this instance.  There is no basis upon which we can assume this is an isolated incident.  We need to provide assurance throughout the sector, and this was essentially the focus of today's summit with all of the providers, regulators and other groups.<br\/>Mr. Healy will address some of the specifics with regard to what we are doing at present, and Dr. Crowley was asked a specific question which he will answer.  There is a realisation that the measures we put in place which we believed would be sufficient are not, and therefore we must do more and do things in different ways.  I do not say this in any sense to be critical of the role of the regulator in this instance.  Regulators can only do so much.  HIQA has been discharging its responsibilities in line with its legislation and procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600020#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418760900,"counter":574,"content":"<p>We are implementing a six-step programme of system-wide reform.  The opening statement of the director general outlined three courses of action we will take.  These are with regard to the unit in question; &Aacute;ras Attracta, with regard to the McCoy review and its potential to translate elsewhere; and a specific six-step programme.  Key elements of this include the national policy for safeguarding vulnerable persons at risk of abuse.  To answer Deputy Kelleher's question, while our particular focus and that of the task force we have established is specifically on residential care, the policy applies to all services.  The definition of what is intended is in respect of individuals in receipt of a care service, whether in their own homes, in the community or as residents of a centre.  This is the approach which has been in place with regard to the elderly and we have expanded it to all social care.<\/p><p>  With regard to the initiatives we are taking, expanding on the implementation of the policy to safeguard teens in each of the new community health care organisations, each team will have four or five members of staff who will lead awareness, development and education, which some members have discussed and which is very important.  This will mean there will be awareness in wider society as well as among staff and those working in the system.<\/p><p>  Other important aspects are the audit, or evaluation quality improvement programme.  Today three people qualified in auditing and who have expertise in this area are in &Aacute;ras Attracta working with the teams there, particularly in unit 3, to develop programmes and examining how practice can be improved.  The intention is to expand this throughout the system in 2015 and we will prioritise its implementation.  The intention is these members of staff will visit the 90 providers during 2015.  Some of these visits will be unannounced.  The programme will be implemented, and all of the policies will be checked with regard to vulnerable adults.  Our service arrangements with voluntary sector providers will form part of this.  Most importantly, these staff members will examine and assess practice. They will support its implementation but challenge where it is not being implemented.  Any deficiencies in this regard will be identified so the services can continually improve.  Separate to this, the regulator will discharge its responsibility.<\/p><p>  An important aspect discussed in great detail at the national summit today is the development of a national volunteer advocacy programme.  We have examined how the existing arrangements which have been developed in services for older people can be expanded to the disability sector.  This will involve the development of residential councils in each residential centre whereby parents, family members or interested members of the community will be trained as volunteers.  They will have a role, and will be able to visit, support, engage and identify areas where they feel there may be deficiencies.  We will work with the sector to examine how this can be tailored to the disability sector.<\/p><p>  The McCoy review has two key components.  Much of the focus has been on the investigation and disciplinary issues, but the work of the McCoy review is probably more fundamental with regard to the learning which can transfer throughout the system and make a difference.  We have put in place many programmes and training.  We have also made many changes.  However this did not have the desired impact with regard to unit 3.  We want to learn from the McCoy review what exactly happened and where the gaps occurred, and address this specifically in &Aacute;ras Attracta in the first instance so each of the nine units there will have a specific plan.  We also want to translate the learning from this throughout the system.  Since this issue arose we have had significant interest from academics and staff, and Dr. McCoy has agreed to facilitate this so the learning can be incorporated and it will form part of the report.  We have also agreed with him that we will not wait for the full report to be concluded but will have another summit in March at which any initial learning will be encompassed.  Another summit will be held in June and any additional learning at this stage will also be encompassed.  We will learn as we go and will publish the final report when it is concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600021#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1418760900,"counter":575,"content":"<p>To go back to Deputy Conway's point on members of management being accomplices or party to reprehensible behaviour, many parents who have made contact with me and, I am sure, other committee members, are seeking accountability and action.

It was a very useful meeting and they will take on board much of the feedback which has been received.  There was 300 people at the summit so we will take that on board and a further meeting of the task force has been established for early January.

There was a very strong commitment today from within the room regarding the leadership of the sector.  There is recognition that while more may and will be done in 2015, there is a real necessity to be vigilant today.  All of the providers and all those working in the service are committed to ensuring that this issue receives very serious attention immediately.  People will be reviewing the position in each of their locations, including issues around encouraging staff feedback, whistleblowing, and listening to service users and their families in a way that perhaps has not happened.  A question was asked about complaints that may have been made and they have been asked to check those and review them to make sure that where families, individuals or staff have been making complaints, they will be looked at.   Together with the initiative on the confidential recipient and the national policy and so on, there are now a number of other mechanisms by which complaints, perspectives and views of inappropriate activity or abuse can be brought to notice.

Dietetic advice was brought into the centre and other allied health staff were brought in to try to ensure that care became more individualised.

We walked the grounds and were in bungalow 3 and, in a respectful way, given her particular concerns around men, we met with Ms Ivy McGinty, Ms Mary Garvin and Ms Mary Maloney.  They are non-verbal but they are not non-communicative.  They are in my opinion very gentle souls and I would not say that we witnessed anything that could be called challenging behaviour by any manner or means.  We also met with other residents in other parts of the facility and with the staff who are currently providing care.  It was appropriate that we should visit but if anything, it made it all the more difficult to see the way those individuals had been treated because there was absolute disrespect for their basic humanity and for their rights as citizens of this country.<\/p><p>  On this issue of the confidential recipient, which has been mentioned a couple of times, discussions with Ms Leigh Gath about taking that role were only concluded in the past 24 hours.  We wanted to be able to identify both the process and name of the individual for the purposes of engaging in a discussion with participants in the summit today about aspects they felt were important in the context of that role.  We had that discussion.  She will be provided with office facilities and all that is required and will be based in Limerick.  We will bring in staff to work with her who have had no prior engagement with the health service and who have relevant skills.  Under the terms of the 2004 Act, she will be in receipt of a formal legal delegation from me giving her authority throughout the health service under the powers that are vested in me as - effectively - chief executive officer of the HSE.  She will have access to legal counsel.<\/p><p>  Ms Gath will be in a position to decide herself what she will do with each complaint.  The majority, I expect, will be referred for action by the social care division and then she will be in a position to monitor the action that occurs.  Where she thinks appropriate, she may refer to HIQA, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or, dependent on the elements of the complaint - whether it has been partially dealt with before or whatever - she may seek to say that the complaint qualifies for consideration by the Ombudsman.  The specific type of whistleblowing we are asking to be directed to her is on issues of abuse, neglect, mistreatment or failures in the safeguarding of vulnerable persons.<\/p> <p>We are going to leave open the definition of \"vulnerable persons\".  We do not want to create a context in which every possible complaint about every aspect of the health service lands on her desk because that would just make it more complicated for us to ensure the serious ones, in which we are most interested and in which whistleblowing is of key importance, would be dealt with; therefore, we will be directing people to the existing mechanisms for complaining about things generally.  It is a large, complex service and there are many things about which people have legitimate complaints.<\/p><p> The confidential recipient will be assuming duties on Monday and arrangements will have been completed by then.  We will communicate broadly about the establishment of the post of confidential recipient, how to connect with her and draw complaints to her attention.  The key emphasis will be on the word \"confidential\".  This is intended to remove the barrier, of which we are all aware, which sometimes prevents people from stepping forward, namely, the fear of identification, recrimination and retaliation.  She will be able to ensure confidentiality.

It is in the regulatory and inspection space and carries out reviews and makes recommendations.  It is not seeking to occupy the position of confidential recipient.  Essentially, we are seeking to provide an additional channel for people to do the right thing if they feel they can do so.  At one level, we can talk about bringing in undercover investigators.  There are 12,000 staff working in the social care sector.  I want the vast majority of them to be our undercover investigators, empowered without fear of a comeback and report anything they believe requires further investigation.  We could then use the techniques about which I spoke, whether it be placing other staff or using surveillance techniques in accordance with the law and carrying out the appropriate investigations, in order that we could do two things.  One is to create a very simple realisation: there can no longer be an assumption that once the door is closed, it is safe to do things people know they should not be doing and that there is a very real prospect of being caught, which will have a deterrence effect.  The notion that other staff have been more empowered to challenge, even if they must do so through a confidential informant, will change behaviour.  These are interim measures; we are really seeking to change culture, but we know that this takes time.  The culture appears to be part of the legacy of the way we used to do certain things in having institutions with high walls and so on.  It will not be easy or quick to eradicate these thought processes from the minds of some; therefore, we will have to do some things that typically one would not want to do in order to provide additional surety.

The programme broadcast last week was, to say the least, absolutely shocking, but rather than focusing on individual issues within &Aacute;ras Attracta, I concur with the comments made by Ms Lorraine Dempsey when interviewed for that programme: that the buck on this issue and any and all other patient safety issues stops at the top of the HSE.  The six-step programme Mr. O'Brien has just announced is welcome, notwithstanding the fact that we have a patients' charter which was so wonderfully lauded last year in terms of its objectives and all of the improvements it was going to bring.  Not to be trite, however, I do not see any difference at the end of 2014 arising from these objectives which were issued at the beginning of the year.<\/p><p>  I wish to ask some specific questions about the quality and patient safety division.  How many individuals, specifically in St. Stephen's House, not just involved in social care across the country, are responsible for ensuring quality and patient safety?  What exactly, arising from the patients' charter, has the quality and patient safety division done this year, notwithstanding what Dr. Crowley has said about responding to particular instances involving nutrition or other issues in &Aacute;ras Attracta or other venues?  <\/p><p>  I want to ask about patient safety advocates, not just in the 90 facilities with which the HSE has met.  Are there registered, known, named patient safety advocates in each of these 90 facilities?  Are there patient safety advocates in each of the acute hospitals?  In any service offered on behalf of the State to citizens are there patient safety advocates who are known to patients?  Is there a patient safety charter process in all of these facilities which known to patients in order that they know that if they have an issue or a complaint, they know where they should go, what they should do and how they should make their complaint?<\/p><p>  I want to ask specifically about the first three items in the patient safety charter.  The first is a \"commitment to supporting the development of an open and transparent culture with defined accountability for quality and safety\".  Obviously, that is not working, as people are not whistleblowing; they are leaving.  It is great that a confidential recipient is being announced today and I wish her well, although we have a history with confidential recipients who have not worked in other areas.  What are we going to do in all of the other services which could be in exactly the same position with regard to whistleblowing?  Is there a concern that the confidential recipient is going to work under the umbrella of the organisation on which she is to report?  Would there not have been merit in making the confidential recipient independent?  Strengthening the HIQA legislation and allowing the person concerned to work for it might have given more strength and perhaps more credence to the position.<\/p><p>  The second part of the patient safety charter is that there will be \"clear governance and accountability for quality and safety at all levels of the Health Service and Divisions\".  We have seriously failed on that level in every single aspect.  Notwithstanding what happened in &Aacute;ras Attracta and Redwood this week, we know what happened in Galway last year and Portlaoise again this year.  There are too many instances that highlight the fact that, as a national organisation, we do not have a real patient-led service.  With respect, I was one of the people who often defended the service plan last year, particularly when we talked about the provision of money and patient-led services, because it was said so many times, even in the prologue to the plan, that the service was totally patient-centred.  It is very clear that it is not.<\/p><p>  One of the commitments in the patients' charter is that we are going to \"support quality improvements throughout the health service [and] improve outcomes\" by interacting with patients to find out what their experiences are of the services being offered.  When was the last time a patient experience survey was actually conducted in any section of HSE?  What did we do to inform and change the processes of the system arising from the recommendations made?  <\/p><p>  I also need to ask - Dr. Crowley will know from where I am coming - about the two independent organisations which had their funding removed.  They were the only ones which were engaging independently with patients on behalf of the two private organisations and the HSE.  Why was it seen fit to stop that funding?  If there was an issue with money, why did we not start to conduct patient surveys on behalf of the HSE, although I do not agree with this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600023#Y00400","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1418762100,"counter":589,"content":"<p>I offer my deepest sympathy to the victims and their families.

If they are working for the HSE, they are in fear that they will lose their jobs, if they are resident in the institution or if a member of their family is in the institution, they are fearful that the resident will be kicked out of the institution and in some cases, when a complaint was made, the resident has been put on notice to leave. <\/p><p>  It has been stated that the HSE will pay more attention to complaints and will have designated officers who will accept complaints, but at present the HSE is the body accountable to take complaints.  I may have misunderstood but I understood Mr. Healy to say that we will have to check if the complaints have been looked at.  I see no sense of urgency and commitment or a sense that the HSE is demanding change from what has been said today.<\/p><p>  Are the officials aware of other investigations into HSE facilities?  I have a further point, and I thank the Chairman for giving me leeway.  Will there be another meeting about &Aacute;ras Attracta and related issues so that we get answers to these questions?  Complaints have been made about physical, sexual, psychological and financial abuse - all cases of appalling abuse - and that nothing has changed.  Let me stress that I do not know the different institutions, but they all have been inspected by HIQA.  It goes back to the case at Leas Cross.  There has been no real change.  I am very concerned and I would like the HSE to address those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600024#Z00700","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1418762700,"counter":596,"content":"<p>For the information of Deputy O'Dowd, this is the first of a series of meetings we are to hold as a committee on the issue of congregated setting, home care setting for people with intellectual disabilities.<\/p><p>  I have allocated four minutes to each speaker who is not a party spokesperson.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600024#Z00800","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1418762700,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I concur with Deputy Regina Doherty.

What exactly has been done for them since this report came out?<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Dowd raised the issue of those who make complaints or whistleblowers who will contact the confidential recipient.  The designation of a confidential recipient is welcome but from my study of the reports that HIQA has done on institutions all over the country, one can see that it has had to report on major non-compliance when it has made a second visit.<\/p><p>  In the course of the \"Prime Time\" programme, we heard a reference that \"she's gone\" about the person who appeared to have made complaints about what was going on in &Aacute;ras Attracta and that nothing was done about the complaints.

I seek an answer this evening as to whether the HSE can state categorically that each person in any of its services, be it provided directly or privately funded, has a person-centred plan in place that is meaningful, monitored, reviewed and actually is carried out.  Can the witnesses confirm for the joint committee this evening that everybody in the HSE's services, both funded and provided, has a full and comfortable life?  I am sorry but I have no doubt but that it will not ring true.  Can the witnesses confirm that those who cannot communicate are supported in decision-making and have their needs met?  There must be fundamental reform of how the services are designed and delivered.  One should consider the money that will go into all of these measures, as I reiterate my welcome for the confidential recipient.  I absolutely do not like the job she must do or the amount of work that will be in front of her.  However, the supports must be put in place in all the other places nationwide given the existing levels of care.  I have a question regarding the 13 people who currently have stepped down from their work.  Were they all qualified nurses or what was the breakdown in this regard?  Were they permanent staff?  Were there any agency staff involved and if so, what specific measures can be taken with agency staff?  While I have many more questions, perhaps I can come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600024#Z00900","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418763300,"counter":599,"content":"<p>To my eyes, the \"Prime Time\" programme unveiled a desperately cruel and unsafe culture.

Culture is a very difficult word and is an invisible thing in companies and in health services.  While I acknowledge Mr. O'Brien has mentioned culture to members this evening, how does he motivate and train his staff to be patient, caring, loving, careful, safe, compassionate and sensitive along with paying incredible attention to detail in respect of their incredibly vulnerable clients?

Does Mr. O'Brien ask the direct provision providers or the private nursing providers to conduct culture surveys?

Christmas is coming and while members will be leaving Leinster House on Friday, they will be leaving a highly vulnerable situation and have a crisis on their hands.  I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, agreed quietly with me the other night but ethical issues and the rights of patients must be considered in this regard.  For the present, are cameras needed in all these homes?  Will it be necessary to keep a watchful eye because audits do not do it for me?  As for the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, I have a client who is a 17-year-old child and whose parents wrote to the authority for fear of the child's safety.  However, as all members are aware, HIQA cannot deal with individual complaints and one should put HIQA aside because audits mean nothing to me.  Audits are box-ticking and anyone can open a door and be charming and perfect.

While these have been embedded in other health systems - such as the one in our nearest neighbour across the channel that has been in place for more than a decade at this point - this is the first one we have completed.  It is a baseline study, the results of which we do not yet have as it still is being analysed.  The overall level of participation was modest as compared with more established surveys but it is not out of line with where they started and consequently, it is a beginning.  As the Senator correctly identifies, there are fundamental issues of culture.  The organisation - I refer to the HSE - does not have a homogenous culture.<\/p> <p>The manner of its creation did not facilitate this at the time nor since.  We are also very conscious that there can be some pockets where culture is an issue, which appears to have been a factor in this instance.  The process in which we are engaged is about wider service delivery in the community that the HSE directs, as well as by by bodies that we fund.  One of the key themes was how we should begin the process of establishing a common culture - the right common culture - which would be focused very much, as one of the advocate representatives put it, on emphasising the service provided.<\/p><p> In regard to the specific actions taken, I ask Mr. Healy to speak about them.

All residential centres were written to in the week commencing 1 December when we became aware of this specific issue to remind them of their responsibilities to address it in a significant way.  It is important to say that, prior to the emergence of this issue, arising from HIQA's report and so on, a learning summit was held during the year for all providers, in addition to the learning that had been identified in the original HIQA report and all that had flowed from it which had been communicated across the system.  We had taken action in translating what had been learned.  Particularly on the concerns people had, I may not have communicated the point well.  The point I was making was that, in addition to the very specific actions we were taking, there were specific programmes we were going to implement.  We have started to implement the valuation and audit-type programme in &Aacute;ras Attracta, with three practice co-ordinators already working on the ground.  The intention is to roll it out in 2015.  This is not a policy or something we are planning to implement; rather, these are specific programmes we will be implementing and which will be included in the operational plan for 2015.  <\/p><p>  In the context of assuring standards and practices in residential centres today, focusing particularly on the units with our most vulnerable residents, the point was made clearly by Senator Mary Moran - \"we are going home for Christmas\" - that there was a necessity for all providers to ensure the matter was addressed urgently.  I may not have got that point across.  As Deputy Fergus O'Dowd said, it was made clear that, while it would be important that significant changes be planned for 2015 and to have new programmes implemented, the matter needed to be addressed urgently.  All providers have committed to doing this.  It will obviously be followed up in writing and communicated again before Christmas.  Again, the matter was discussed at some length by the national task force following the summit.  It was not in the context of complaints; rather, it was to restate the point that complaints needed to be dealt with seriously.  In the context of the summit, we received feedback from advocates, voluntary representatives and so on that it was an issue which required attention.  That is the reason it was emphasised during the course of the summit.  <\/p><p>  I hope that clarifies the point about the HSE taking all complaints made seriously.  Our intention is to make sure all providers follow this up.

We have also worked with a group of people who have either personally or whose families have experienced harm as a result of their experiences of health care provision in Ireland.  We have tried to support the Patient Safety Champions Network which is independent of us.

If there are gaps, I will certainly forward information afterwards.<\/p><p>  We have discussed the culture on a number of occasions in the light of the deep-seated cultural problems exposed.  Work we have been doing has been focused on the issue of open disclosure.  When we investigate the harm caused when things go wrong - we have felt this for some time - the health care system can sometimes compound it by how it responds to families or individuals by either being secretive or not apologising.  We have run more than 100 workshops with front-line staff to promote the new policy of open disclosure which was launched by the Minister.  We have also conducted a patient safety culture survey, initially in the acute hospitals division, which we will seek to make available across the service.  We need to take stock of what we have learned from it and how effective it is as a tool.  I note the tool recommended by the Senator.  <\/p><p>  Issues around governance were raised.  We have been working hard on our delivery system to develop models of governance that will ensure that the delivery system will have at the heart of decision making consideration of the impact of any decision on the quality of care for service users and patients.  We have new quality patient safety committees at all levels of all organisations and are promoting the message that they analyse all available data on safety and quality of care and use them to ensure the leaderships of all organisations properly focus on the issue above all else.  <\/p><p>  We also have an audit function whereby we have a group of people who check to see if we are doing what we said we would do.  We assess and evaluate the implementation of recommendations to which we have committed and all of the audit findings are to be found on our website.  We have worked on the issue of leadership which is central to having an improved and more person-citizen focused culture, one entirely focused on quality of care.  We have developed guidance for the entire system promoted on new forms of leadership.  In many cases we want the leadership shown across the system to be standardised in order that the leadership of the health care system is engaged fully with front-line staff, patients and service users and listens and responds to them.<\/p> <p>In terms of measuring patient experience, we have developed a new survey tool which we are promoting throughout the health care system for post-discharge surveys of patients.  We have also been working with the health care system to develop patient and family groups so that we properly listen to people, perhaps in a more qualitative way, which sometimes can be richer.  We are also examining options to see if we can find cost effective methods to develop more real-time feedback from patients and service users so that we respond in a very agile fashion.<\/p><p> We also have formed partnerships with some of the training bodies and others to try to build capacity around quality improvement.  We do not believe that simply telling people to change things or promulgating guidance on something in the hurly-burly of front-line care will always get everybody to change the practice in the way that we would like it to so do.  We are utilising proven methodologies of quality improvement, training people in it and training our clinical leaders and others in this methodology to try to embed within our system a commitment to not just go into work every day to do our job but to go in every day to do our job and to improve that job.<\/p><p> We have also worked with the Royal College of Surgeons to develop a number of national audits to ensure we examine critical areas of practice such as ICU care, trauma management and the management of hip fractures, to name but three, and others are in development, to nationally examine the issues and to explore and ensure that we know if there are variations in practice.  What we seek to promote in all of this work is standardisation of practice.  Variation is the enemy of quality and we seek to eradicate it.  The approach is based on the adoption of practice that is not best evidence based.  To carry out that programme of work we have 40 people working in the quality and patient safety division.  Importantly, with an overall staff of 90,000 to 100,000 people we do not pretend that the team will work in isolation.  We will not be able to assume all of those responsibilities without forming partnerships with other bodies, and most particularly working with the line divisions who all have been developing consistently a capacity for quality improvement and safety management in the period since they have been formed.<\/p><p> Members will see from the service plan this year and last year a very clear commitment that quality and patient safety cannot just be the responsibility of a team or a number of individuals, that we are really committing as an organisation that the entire organisation needs to focus on this because we are mindful of the challenge that has been laid down to us.  We are acutely aware of the times that we fail patients and we work extremely hard to try to minimise that risk into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600026#BB00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Philip Crowley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418764500,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I will return to the specific questions raised by Deputy O'Dowd on the referral of complaints from HIQA.

The last seven years have seen a number of people elevated into managerial positions for which they did not receive training or support in order to fill gaps as people left on the various exit programmes.  That is fact 1.<\/p><p>  Fact 2 is that there are many thousands fewer people operating in the health service than there were before.  People may feel over-stretched and they may not have the skills necessary to respond to issues as they arise.  We have been addressing that in the last while by supported training, management development and in bringing eminent speakers to speak to a cross-section of the leadership of the health service about this very issue of culture &ndash; culture being defined very simply as what we do around here.  We have a rebuilding job to do.  We are fortunate that with the beginnings of the economic recovery, some of the particular challenges the health sector has had to face because of the necessary reduction in staff numbers and in resources means that we no longer have to ask our manager to focus disproportionately on one part of the balance score card, that being the financial process, which has been the lens through which the health service has been judged for far too long.<\/p><p>  Deputy Regina Doherty correctly referenced &ndash; I am very conscious of the support that she gave at the time &ndash; the emphasis that has been placed in this year&rsquo;s service plan and in previous service plans on communicating internally to our organisation that the balance must switch decisively towards a greater and balanced focus on other things.  Clearly, we have much more work to do.  I say these things not in any sense to excuse anything, because that is not the business I am in, but to tell the committee honestly as I started out, the business of changing a culture is a long-term process.  I think we all know that.  The whistleblowing element of it, and the ability of people to respond in a constructive as opposed to a defensive way to complaints is something that takes time.  I hope the emphasis on whistleblowing is a relatively short-term measure.  I hope that we can get to a position where there is less and less requirement to have recourse to whistleblowing and more and more confidence in using the normal process of complaint and improvement.  That is where I was going with those comments and observations.<\/p> <p>Nobody who runs any large, complex system, be it a health system or any other, with services in more than 3,000 locations and deploying more than 140,000 staff directly and indirectly through agencies would ever, with any degree of credibility, come into any forum and say he could give complete assurance that everybody is doing what they should do when they should do it and in the way they should do it.  I am not going to do that.  It is easy for me to say doing so would be complete rubbish.  That is why we are going through the processes to put in place a series of measures designed to take shorter, medium and longer-term steps that can bring us to a place of much greater assurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600027#CC01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418765100,"counter":637,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Brien mentioned that there are thousands fewer staff in the HSE.

We all welcome the HIQA inspections but, from talking to service providers, we realise there is a financial cost to meeting HIQA standards.  In many cases, the service provider has not been resourced.  I know of one organisation that has spent close to &euro;700,000 trying to comply with HIQA standards, regulations and requests.  Is any cognisance taken of this when providing resources to organisations to meet the HIQA standard?  If not, how do organisations attain the standard?<\/p><p>  My next point is in the context of Mr. O'Brien's remarks on the 13 staff who have been put off duty and replaced - perhaps they have not all been replaced - and in the context of the moratorium, particularly in the area of disability and intellectual disability.  I appreciate that Mr. O'Brien is going to give me a standard answer on there being a blunt instrument.  We are talking in this case about people who are the most vulnerable and who require the services of the State.  An organisation with staff going on both maternity and sick leave could have up to 30 members of staff absent in a calendar year without replacing any.<\/p><p>  With regard to congregated settings and the strategy for community inclusion, I refer to recommendations 1 and 3.  As the delegation knows, I have a particular interest in disability.  I am a member of the COPE Foundation.

The report was adopted and published in 2011.  An indicative timeline of seven years, between 2012 and 2019, was established in which to implement the recommendations.  As stated in the Oireachtas recently in regard to the report, the downturn in the economy had a bearing on the capital resource required.  At the time in question, one of the indications from the review was that if one were to reconfigure or transform and release the resource tied up in institutional care, it would go a very long way, if not all the way, towards meeting the needs of people in a different way from within the revenue resource.  However, there is, significantly, a capital resource required to release and fully implement the programme.  That is related to the point the Chairman made.  HIQA is now regulating.  In this context, we are seeing a requirement for that to be funded.  In comments this morning, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, mentioned she was engaged with colleagues in considering this matter.  The challenge has featured in the current year and we hope to address it in 2015.<\/p><p>  Even in the Chairman's area, the south, more than 200 projects are under way currently in which specific person-centred, community-based models of service are being implemented.<\/p> <p>It is not the case that nothing is happening.

On budget day things changed a little in that we are now moving into an environment which we are calling the funded workforce plan.  There is less of a preoccupation with numbers and more of a preoccupation with value in that sense.  The moratorium, as we knew it, does not exist.  We can employ such and so many staff in the categories that we need to do so up to the level of staff that we can afford.  This is not particularly relevant to &Aacute;ras Attracta, but we have previously had an excessive dependence upon agency personnel at greater cost in order to sustain services while remaining within an overall cap.  We are no longer in that environment.<\/p><p>  In terms of the staffing requirement at &Aacute;ras Attracta right now, some of that is being met through the good offices of some of the funded service provider agencies that we fund who have effectively loaned to us and rallied around to provide us with their qualified and appropriately regulated and registered staff while at the same time we have been recruiting additional staff.  The latest figure is that we have successfully recruited nine additional staff.  I am not sure if all those staff have been deployed but all the required slots are filled currently by different means.  We have not allowed other considerations to get in the way of that.<\/p><p>  On the Chairman's direct question on the impact of regulation, this particular sector has only been regulated for a little more than a year.  It is not yet a mature regulatory process.  It will mature and get stronger and better.  In the context of the private sector, not the private health sector but the private commercial sector generally, there is a process around a regulatory impact assessment.  That process does not apply in the same way in the public sector.  For example, as appropriate regulation is introduced in order to improve services, particularly environmental and quality of service issues, it has a cost and that is not always taken into account.  We have not hitherto been in a position to provide sufficient capital or revenue funding to some of the service providers to enable them to rapidly meet the emerging standards.  This has been a feature in the care of the elderly in community nursing units, where there are a number of nursing units for which we do not have the capital funds to enable them to qualify and be registered.  We need more capital funding if that is to be achieved.  Similar issues apply in regard to the implementation of what is colloquially called the Christy report from 2011 around congregated settings and the registration requirements of the some of the existing facilities, even the ones in the community where there is work required to bring them up to full scratch.  There is a challenge in that area, of which the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is very much aware on which she is working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2014121600029#EE00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1418765700,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I got a phone call from a citizen today whose mother was in one of these care homes.
