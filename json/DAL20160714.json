Volumes of research show that children who receive intervention as early as possible benefit enormously from it.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Wheelchair Association administers a personal assistant scheme using a person-centred approach.  It has pioneered the way the service is meant to be delivered.  It connects with each individual and has a direct input into his or her needs and assessments.<\/p>  <p>  There is no need for me to outline the considerable benefits that have accrued for children with intellectual, sensory or physical disabilities because of their having personal assistants.  Unfortunately, however, there are many children who are not receiving this vital support.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste and every other Deputy has had to fight for services, such as personal assistants, for children with special needs in preschools, national schools and secondary schools.<\/p>  <p>  The maximum number of hours allowed through the Irish Wheelchair Association is four to six hours.  This is absolutely inadequate.  The programme for Government refers at length to commitments to improving the lives of people with disabilities, and it goes through all that should be done to help them.  The HSE&rsquo;s plan for 2016 alone contains a target of 1.3 million hours.  This compares with 1.4 million actual hours in 2015.  Therefore, before we start at all, there has been a reduction in the service by 100,000 personal assistant hours, despite the constant growth in the number of children who need personal assistants.  It is grossly hypocritical to include a commitment in the programme for Government to having better supports and access for those with disabilities, particularly children, if the number of hours referred to in the 2016 plan is lower than the number granted in 2015.  The Government has given various commitments in this regard.  I challenge it to consider very seriously the provision of personal assistants, particularly through the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I have encountered many cases throughout my constituency of families seeking supports, as has every other Deputy.<\/p><p>It is hypocritical to claim the Government is seeking to improve the lives of people with disabilities through better access to supports and increased independence when the number of personal assistance hours has been cut this year.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that these cuts will be reversed and the allocation of personal assistance hours will be dramatically increased in 2017?  <\/p> <p> Children starting preschool education and primary school are being allocated four or six hours of personal assistance.  If this figure were increased to eight or nine hours, it would give them a major boost as they face the challenges of the future.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to acknowledge that services have been cut this year, confirm that they will be reversed and recognise that the Irish Wheelchair Association must be shown greater flexibility in providing additional hours to children who require them at preschool and primary level. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400003#A00200","speaker":"1283","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468494300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The Deputy raises a very important topic.  I agree with him that early intervention services are critical, particularly for children with special needs who require either intellectual or physical supports.  The programme for Government commits to supporting children in these circumstances.  For the first time, children with a disability who are attending preschool education will receive supports under the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme.  This major new initiative to ensure children have access to services will mean, for example, that special needs assistants will be made available in preschool settings.  The Government recently agreed to provide an additional 860 special needs assistants.  This will be of considerable help to the children the Deputy describes both in preschool and primary education.<\/p>  <p>  An additional &euro;500 million has been allocated to the health service, including &euro;31 million secured by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to support and improve disability services.  This funding will be used to deal precisely with the group of children the Deputy describes, as well as adults who are in need of support, particularly those making the transition from school to day care centres.  This money will ensure services are available to this group.  The Government is, therefore, committed to early intervention and providing supports for the children the Deputy describes.  Under the previous Government, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, also announced extra funding for speech and occupational therapy.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy indicated that the Irish Wheelchair Association has some concerns regarding personal assistants.  I will convey the points he raises to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and ask him to respond directly to the Deputy.  The general context is one of increased funding for health services, with a special focus on extra funding for disability services, and increases in early years supports for children with special needs, whether intellectual or physical.  The Government is committed to this in the programme for Government.  I will ask the Minister to respond to the Deputy directly on the personal assistance scheme.  I expect that supports will be made available to children who need this kind of support given the commitments made in the programme for Government and the focus and priority the Government has given to increasing funding for the health sector. <\/p>  <p>  As I stated earlier in the week, demand for health services is increasing and attendances are higher.  Thankfully, the needs of many of the children in question are being identified at earlier in life.  We must provide supports to children with special needs at an earlier time in life.  For this reason, I welcome what the Government is doing in ensuring that children with disabilities have access to supports in preschool and primary education.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400004#B00200","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1468494300,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The parents of children with physical or intellectual disabilities must continuously fight the system for services for their children.

They are vulnerable citizens.  It is totally inappropriate and unjustifiable that these citizens have been left in this manner.  They are citizens who have rights, like all of us.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste will remember the scandal last year surrounding the investigation into &Aacute;ras Attracta.  Unfortunately, that scandal was quickly followed by too many more scandals.  For example, a HIQA report into St. Patrick's Centre campus in Kilkenny found that it was understaffed, poorly maintained, unclean and lacked an adequate fire safety plan.  That is a basic necessity in any care centre, but it was not in place.  In recent years a number of HIQA reports have highlighted major non-compliance in residential centres for adults and children with intellectual disabilities.  The centres have failed on multiple grounds in respect of non-compliance of regulations.  Last April, the HIQA chief executive Phelim Quinn told a conference hosted by Inclusion Ireland that the standard of care in some residential centres was disturbing and appalling.  Last summer HIQA gave notice to 20 disability services that their registrations would be refused or cancelled if they did not make necessary improvements within 28 days.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE revealed in June last year that more than 20 staff were being investigated for abusing residents with severe intellectual disabilities throughout the State - and this is a small state.  This year the problem has continued.  For example, the centre at St. Mary's in Drumcar run by St. John of God's was closed because inspectors from HIQA found significant and ongoing levels of non-compliance and were not assured that the services being provided were safe.  In recent weeks we have seen the additional scandal of St. John of God's withdrawing funding from St. Augustine's in Dublin while 14 of its senior managers received secret top-ups to the tune of &euro;2 million.  That is disgraceful and cannot continue.<\/p>  <p>  There is a crisis in the provision of care for citizens with intellectual disabilities.

There was a collective sigh of relief nationwide when the Minister said after the meeting in Athlone that waste charges would be frozen for 12 months, that people's waste charges would not increase and that he would take action if waste companies did not comply.  One of the companies in question, Greyhound, is now giving two fingers to the Minister by requiring people to opt out of the pay-by-weight system.  In other words, if people do not contact the company, they automatically go under the pay-by-weight system, which means an increase in their charges.  Greyhound is also insisting that its customers have to take out new 12-month contracts from 1 August and have to pay by that date.<\/p>  <p>  I will give an example.  I was recently contacted by an old age pensioner from my constituency who receives &euro;198.60 per week.  In December of last year, she renewed her yearly contract with Greyhound for the 12-month period from 1 January to 31 December 2016.  The annual charge was &euro;59.99, with additional pay-per-lift payments to be made.  This woman received a letter from Greyhound asking her to contact it and informing her that the mandatory pay-by-weight system was gone.  When she contacted the company, she was told she would have to pay &euro;140 per year, with this payment to be received by 1 August next.  This is going to be the case even though her current contract has not yet expired.  She will have to make a full payment by 1 August, or alternatively pay in two instalments of &euro;70 each.  Another person in the same situation contacted me by e-mail and asked me to call for Government intervention regarding the so-called price freeze that has been brought in.  She said that after she phoned Greyhound to ensure her service charge, which was prepaid until December 2016, and her charge per lift would not change, she was contacted to say that there would be changes in those charges.

I believe these vulture funds are about to pull off the largest avoidance of tax on Irish profits in the history of the State.  The scale is likely to be in the tens of billions of euro in missed taxes.  These are taxes being avoided by Irish companies on Irish domestic profits earned off the backs of distressed Irish families.  Irish charities are being used to play a key part in this tax avoidance.  Mars Capital is owned by a registered charity, the Matheson Foundation.  The stated mission of the charity is to help Irish children to fulfil their potential.  It contributes to causes such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, Barnardos and Temple Street Children's University Hospital.  The charity does not mention its ownership of Mars Capital.  One reporter I spoke to believes that the charity might own more than 200 companies.  At a time when public faith in the charity sector has been rocked yet again, a children's charity is being used to help a vulture fund avoid paying taxes to the Irish State on its Irish profits.<\/p>  <p>  It is very effective.  In spite of annual revenues in year one of over &euro;14 million Mars Capital paid total corporation tax to the Irish State of &euro;250.  Companies such as Mars Capital are known as section 110 companies.  Section 110 was introduced in 1997 to allow the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, win global securitisation deals.  These involve global companies structuring global assets in Ireland.  Their profits were not earned here, so section 110 helps these companies avoid paying taxes here on those profits.  The vulture funds are now using section 110 companies to avoid paying taxes in Ireland on Irish profits.  Section 110 companies were not created to re-route Irish domestic profits to offshore locations.  However, my understanding is that almost all of the vulture funds whose profits are generated in Ireland have section 110 status.<\/p>  <p>  How big is the scale of the tax avoidance by these vulture funds?  Irish companies typically pay approximately 30% tax on their profits, between corporation tax and dividends tax.  Vulture funds typically target minimum returns on their Irish investments of 15% to 20% per year over seven to ten years.  That means a &euro;100 million investment by a vulture fund should generate &euro;100 million in taxes for the Irish State.<\/p><p>To be clear, the level of taxes being missed by the Irish State is likely to be well over half of the total value of all of the distressed loan books sold by NAMA, IBRC and private banks.<\/p> <p> Will the Government direct Revenue to cancel section 110 status for all vulture funds in Ireland?  Will it provide Revenue with the extra resources to execute this quickly and to reclaim back taxes?  Will it direct the Charities Regulator to pull charity status where that status is being used to help avoid Irish tax on Irish profits?  Will it direct NAMA to not sell assets to vulture funds if these funds are structured to avoid Irish taxes on Irish profits?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400008#F00500","speaker":"1230","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468495800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 sets out the taxation regime for securitisation and other structured finance transactions.  Under the Taxes Consolidation Act, a qualifying section 110 company is chargeable to tax at 25% but has its profits computed by reference to the rules available to trading companies.  As a result, the companies are generally structured in such a way that they are effectively tax-neutral.  A company must notify the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in advance of its intention to fall within the scope of section 110.  The companies are required to pay their taxes and file their tax returns in the same way as all other companies and are subject to the same monitoring by the Revenue Commissioners, an important point to note.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are currently examining recent media coverage concerning the use of certain physical vehicles for property investments - indeed, Deputy Donnelly has raised this issue before, as has Deputy Pearse Doherty.

I went to the trouble of looking at the Daft first quarter average rents for the country.  The average rent in County Galway is &euro;618 per month and in Kerry is &euro;623 per month.  Both counties have similar populations and very similar demands regarding tourism activity, etc.  Why did the Minister apply such a meagre increase to Kerry when he applied a 25% increase to County Galway?

Tonight 6,000 people will sleep in emergency accommodation and 2,000 of those are children.  Many of those families will spend up to two years in emergency accommodation.  There are more than 130,000 households on local authority housing waiting lists and increasingly, the average waiting time in large urban areas is ten years.  The total increase in local authority and approved housing body stock last year was 2,000 units, yet the D&aacute;il Committee on Housing and Homeless recommended that we needed an increase of 10,000 units annually.  That committee also recommended greater use of strategic development zones for the delivery of social housing.<\/p><p>One of the decisions made by the previous Government under the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, which has made the crisis worse, was the reduction in the Part V requirement from 20% to 10% of private housing for social use.  The former Minister made a case at the time that the 20% requirement was prohibiting private developers from submitting planning applications and that reducing it to 10% would result in a significant increase.  However, that has not happened and we have seen a reduction in the past 12 months.  <\/p><p>The Bill I am introducing seeks to restore and increase the Part V requirement to at least 25% in private developments and to 30% in strategic development zones such as the one in my constituency in Clonburris on the former Irish Glass Bottle Company site in Ringsend.  This would be good for developers.  It would give them a guaranteed income stream through pre-agreed sales that they could use to assist in getting development finance.  It would be good for the families who would get off the housing and homeless list and into social housing and it would also be good for social housing policy because it would increase the level of income mix, which is what Government policy requires.  On that basis, I commend the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400014#M00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1468497600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400014#M00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1468497600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400014#M00500","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1468497600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1468497600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400014#M00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1468497600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400014#M00700","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1468497600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Au Pair Placement Bill 2016: Second Stage (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1468497600,"counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400014#M00850"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1468497600,"counter":127,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by  Deputy Anne Rabbitte on Wednesday, 13 July 2016:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1468497600,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1468497600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I must now deal with a postponed division relating to the Au Pair Placement Bill 2016 on Wednesday, 13 July 2016.

Other concerns raised related to tackling the scourge of drugs, including the illicit sale of prescription drugs, as well as early intervention programmes for children, educational disadvantage, job creation and apprenticeships in the area, improving the physical environment, social housing provision, and community development including family, youth and recreation activity. \u00a0The Taoiseach intends to establish a broader task force to address socioeconomic and community development issues in the north inner city.  The outcome of those meetings helped inform the preparatory work on the proposed task force and we are determined to make progress on this in the near future.  Of course, there are lessons for other areas as well in terms of dealing with similar issues.<\/p><p>Five weeks ago I secured the agreement of the Government to a package of measures to increase the pressure on organised criminals.  The package includes the establishment of a special crime task force by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which will have an ongoing and relentless focus on persons involved in gangland activities.  The Government is committed to funding whatever measures are needed for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to best tackle the critical and unprecedented challenges it faces and has recently approved additional funding of some &euro;55 million for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>There is already a wide range of strong legislation in place to deal with gangland activities.  Deputies will be familiar with the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 which brought forward provisions to respond to the reality of intimidation by criminal gangs; the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 which provided for covert surveillance; the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which addressed the use of weapons; the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 which was brought forward to enhance international co-operation; and the very important Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  We now need new legislation focused, in particular, on the criminal proceeds held by gang members locally.  Last week the House approved the reduction from &euro;6,500 to &euro;1,000 of the prescribed sum under section 38, under which cash suspected of being the proceeds of crime may be seized by garda&iacute; or Revenue officers.  The Bill which has been developed following consultation with the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Bureau Officer will help to improve the legislative powers we have available and garda&iacute; on the front line.  The Government approved the drafting of the Bill as a matter of urgency and I thank Members across the House and in the Seanad for their support for it.  <br\/><br\/>The Bill has been quickly but carefully crafted to provide additional powers for the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, to target the proceeds of crime.  The CAB has no power under the Proceeds of Crime Act to seize and detain the proceeds of crime without making an application to court.  When we met members of the CAB and the Garda, they made this point and said they needed something stronger to deal with the issue.  Section 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 allows for the CAB to make an <i>ex parte<\/i>application to the High Court for an interim order which can prohibit any person from disposing of or dealing with any property if the court is satisfied it constitutes the proceeds of crime.  To seek such an order, the CAB must have marshalled all of the relevant evidence and be in position to establish that the property derives from criminal conduct.  Given the level of scrutiny applied by the court to such an application, particularly as it is an <i>ex parte<\/i>application where only the applicant is heard by the court, this is a challenging task for the CAB.  The new power will allow CAB officers to move quickly to seize property and they will have 21 days to prepare their court application.  The Bill will also allow for the mid-level proceeds held by gang members to be targeted by reducing the threshold which applies under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000.<br\/><br\/>The Bill is being brought forward as an urgent measure in order that these changes will be available to the CAB without delay.  While Deputies may have other proposals for reform, I ask that such proposals not delay the rapid passage of the Bill but be considered as part of the wider review of the proceeds of crime legislation which can deliver further reforms in the medium term.<br\/><br\/>The Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 operates as a piece of civil law.  The applications made under it to the High Court rely on the civil standard of proof, that is, the balance of probabilities.  As the lawyers say, it operates <i>in rem<\/i>, not <i>in personam<\/i>, to target property, not persons.  No finding is made on the guilt of a person, as happens in a criminal trial.  Instead, a finding is made on whether property is the proceeds of crime.  Provision is made for the belief of a Garda chief superintendent to be admitted as evidence.  The Act allows for an interlocutory order to be made, where the court is satisfied, on the evidence from the CAB, that property is the proceeds of crime and, to an extent, shifts the onus to the respondent to disprove the case.  The Act contains no criminal offences and no penal sanctions.<br\/><br\/>Early on in its operation, the civil status of the Act was considered in litigation.  In Murphy <i>v<\/i>. G. M. and Gilligan <i>v<\/i>. CAB the then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Keane, noted that the legislation was &quot;unquestionably draconian&quot; and then addressed the key point of whether proceedings under the Act were civil or criminal in nature.  Following an extensive review of the case law on the factors which differentiated criminal and civil actions, he found that the appellants had failed to establish that the Act amounted to criminal proceedings.  It is possible to maintain the special provisions of the Act because they amount to civil proceedings.  Any addition to the Act, therefore, must not tip the balance of the Act in order that they become criminal proceedings.  It is for that reason that I emphasise the care which has been taken to ensure the Bill is not only constitutionally sound but also sustainable in the special civil context of the Proceeds of Crime Act.  The Attorney General has not only reviewed its provisions herself but has also had external senior counsel consider it twice, first when the scheme was being developed and then when the final draft was being prepared.  The Chief Bureau Officer and the bureau legal officer were also consulted on a number of occasions by my officials.  I thank them for the urgent work they have done on the Bill.  We consulted them to ensure their knowledge, experience and expertise would be brought to bear.<br\/><br\/>This is the other key reason I ask that more extensive proposals for change be considered as part of the wider review of proceeds of crime legislation which can deliver further reforms in the medium term.  I would like all such proposals to undergo the same rigorous checking by my officials and the Attorney General's office and for the CAB to be consulted on them.  The Proceeds of Crime Act has served us well for 20 years and been tested time and again in the courts.  We want to be sure changes to what is carefully honed legislation do not blunt or break it in any way.<br\/><br\/>Let me turn to the provisions of the Bill.  The first sections deal with various definitions.  Section 3 inserts new sections which provide for the administrative seizure and detention of property.<br\/><br\/>The new section 1A allows for the fact that, if a bureau officer is in a public or any other place, he or she is permitted to seize any property he or she has reasonable grounds for suspecting is the proceeds of crime.  It is intended to provide for the seizure of the suspected proceeds of crime, both where the property is discovered opportunistically as part of general CAB operations and as part of a focused operation targeting particular suspected proceeds.  The bureau officer must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the property, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, constitutes the proceeds of crime and is of a total value of not less than &euro;5,000.  Once these criteria are met, the bureau officer may seize and detain the property for up to 24 hours.  This represents a serious interference with the property rights and potentially other rights of individuals, hence the need to limit the period in which it can have effect.  Any further detention beyond 24 hours must meet the additional criteria set out in subsection (2) which allows the Chief Bureau Officer to authorise the further detention of the property for up to 21 days if the criteria outlined in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) are cumulatively met.  The key purpose of the entire section is evident in paragraph (c) which is to allow the CAB time to prepare an interim or interlocutory application to the High Court.  Subsection (3) requires the Chief Bureau Officer to give written notice to all affected persons unless he or she is satisfied that it is not reasonably possible to attain their whereabouts.  The notice has to include the reasons for the authorisation and inform the person of the right to make an application under section 1B.  Subsection (5) allows details, the disclosure of which might prejudice the investigation, to be withheld.<br\/><br\/>The new section 1B outlines the protections for affected persons by allowing them to apply to the courts to vary or revoke an authorisation.  The new section 1C provides for an application for compensation for losses incurred by the owner of a property if the CAB fails to apply for or obtain an interim order from the court.  The Bill then outlines the relevant provisions which reduce the value of the property involved from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000.<br\/><br\/>The Bill received the strong support of the Seanad.  That support is a sign of the unity of purpose we share in seeking to defeat crime and support the communities affected by it.  It is an echo of the message sent from these Houses 20 years ago.  The Criminal Assets Bureau carries that message in a practical way to those involved in organised crime by taking their illgotten property from them.  I hope that today we can further equip the CAB for the new challenges it faces every day.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400018#U01300","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468500300,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I welcome the legislation which has been brought to the House by the Minister.  It was supported by Fianna F&aacute;il in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and we will also support it in this House.  It is important to echo and emphasise what the Minister stated in her remarks about the importance of the Oireachtas sending out a strong united message to individuals involved in crime.  This message will be sent out if we can get agreement on this legislation, get it passed, signed and brought into force before the recess.<\/p>  <p>  Legislation in many instances is a response to actual events that have happened.  This is why it is always important to be able to look at legislation with the knowledge of the historical events that gave rise to it.  Somebody who looks at the 1996 Acts on the Criminal Assets Bureau and on the proceeds of crime will not know what gave rise to their introduction.  As we know, the Acts were introduced because of the terrible murder of journalist, Veronica Guerin.  They were a united and effective response by the Oireachtas 20 years ago to what was a serious threat to people in our community as a result of organised drug trafficking and gangland crime.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, this legislation has been introduced by the Minister as a response to actual events that have happened.  The events to which the House seeks to respond in legislation are the terrible murders that have taken place in the city and beyond a result of an unacceptable gangland feud that has targeted individuals in those gangs but has also brought terror to very vulnerable communities in the city and beyond.  It is extremely important that we, as an Oireachtas, send a united message in response to this.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation brought forward by the Minister is effective in proposing one of the solutions to deal with the problems that have arisen as a result of gangland crime.  We need to challenge these criminal activities in a multifaceted and varied way.  The response we need is not just limited to amending the proceeds of crime legislation.  We also need a response in terms of changing how the Garda polices, more effective Garda policing and greater resources.<\/p>  <p>  We also need education in respect of the issues driving these gangland feuds.  The bedrock on which gangland crime is built is the drugs trade.  We need to educate and remind young people and parents of the dangers of getting involved in taking drugs.  Nothing good comes from individuals getting involved in and taking drugs.  Sometimes we send out ambiguous messages to young people.  We need to send out a strong message.  We have strong messages about how it is unacceptable and dangerous for children and adults to use drugs which are legalised, such as alcohol and tobacco.  We also need to have an education programme for young people about illegal drugs and the danger of using them.  At present we do not have an education programme in this respect, which is something the House needs to consider.<\/p>  <p>  Other responses to gangland crime must include changes to our criminal law to make it more effective.  It is obvious, although it is regrettable, that our criminal law in certain instances finds it difficult to deal with gangland crime, where individuals who appear before our courts to give evidence against individuals involved in gangland crime face the threat of being killed or seriously injured.  Our criminal law is able to deal with this but we must recognise there are threats to the effectiveness of our criminal law as a result of the extraordinary violence being used by certain individuals to protect their wealth and themselves.  This is why the legislation introduced 20 years ago was so effective.  It is not, as the Minister said, criminal law.  It is, however, a change to the civil law.  It provides that the proceeds of crime may be seized.  What is proposed, we believe, is an effective and appropriate extension of the legislation which has been in existence for 20 years but which needs to be used more by the Criminal Assets Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  When I was appointed as the Fianna F&aacute;il Front Bench spokesperson on justice, the first visit Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and I paid was to the communities in north inner city which, at the time, were extremely fearful of the ongoing gangland crime.  The people there said to us, and I know they probably said the same to the Minister and the Taoiseach when they visited subsequently, and to other Deputies from the constituency who met local groups, that what they really wanted to see was a mini-CAB.  They explained this term as wanting to be able to have in their communities an effective deterrent whereby individuals who are able to go around showing the proceeds and wealth of crime could have their assets seized by an administrative or judicial decision, provided it could be established that what they had was, in fact, the proceeds of crime.  I am pleased to say the proposal contained in the legislation and in legislation which I drafted and sent to the Minister, and I commend her for considering it, provides for this mini-CAB because it reduces the minimum threshold at which proceeds can be seized from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000.  This will have an impact in the areas where there are proceeds of crime and gives an opportunity for them to be seized, provided it can reasonably and accurately be established they are the proceeds of crime.<\/p>  <p>  One of the substantive and most interesting sections of the Bill put forward by the Minister is the change whereby if the law is passed we will have a new power of seizure and detention of property.  The purpose of this is that a bureau officer who encounters an individual and notices immediately the individual is in possession of property he or she believes is the proceeds of criminal activity and which exceeds &euro;5,000 can be seized and held for a period of 24 hours.  It is extremely important in the legislation we introduce to have measures and provisions in place to ensure these powerful and draconian statutory provisions are not abused.  For this reason, the power is only given to a bureau officer to seize the property for 24 hours.  After this, it can be held for a further of 21 days provided the chief bureau officer is satisfied there are reasonable grounds for suspecting it is the proceeds of criminal activity.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the safety mechanism that an application can be made to the court, which is the place where the rights of individuals are vindicated.  I hope it will not occur but it is possible that individuals will have property wrongfully seized under the legislation.  The protection and safety net is there because an application can be made to the court, which can make an order reversing what is provided for.  It can also make an order paying compensation if it is shown to be the case the property was not the proceeds of crime and had been wrongfully confiscated.<\/p>  <p>  This is a very powerful tool and something that would be very useful for the Garda and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  It is important the Criminal Assets Bureau is sufficiently resourced so the legislation is fully used to its potential.  There is no point in the Oireachtas passing legislation which is then not used as effectively or fully as it can be.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned in her speech that she wants to have a unified response from the Oireachtas and I hope and believe she will get it.  However, she indicated there may be other proposals for reform in respect of proceeds of crime legislation and I welcome this.  I note the Department has been conducting a review of proceeds of crime.  This review needs to be expedited.  It also needs to be expanded to hear opinions from others.  A number of other proposals could be introduced in respect of legislation.  We do not propose to table them by amendment now but they could be introduced to make the proceeds of crime legislation more effective.  For instance, the Minister knows that at present a disposal order requires CAB to hold onto property for a period of seven years.  I believe CAB would prefer if this were reduced to a lesser period.  I know there are constitutional and legal concerns about reducing it too much below seven years but it is an issue we need to consider.  I and, I am sure, Deputy O'Brien would be happy to engage with the Minister on this.<\/p>  <p>  Another matter worth considering is that in Australia, which has similar legislation, the money seized is put into a confiscated assets account.<\/p><p>The money that goes into the confiscated assets account is then used exclusively in communities which have been affected by drug use and criminal activity so that the people in those communities can see that money is being put back into the community and that the money is a consequence of, and derives from, the proceeds of crime which have been seized.  I know that there is a hesitancy or reluctance on the part of the all too powerful Department of Finance and other associated Departments to allow separate funds that go into the Exchequer to go into separate funds.  However, we need to consider doing so in respect of this legislation because it would be to the benefit of those communities if the proceeds of crime seized could be used exclusively in order to educate children in those communities about drugs and build better projects and provide better services in those communities.  All these factors are important in ensuring that the threat of drugs to our communities is properly and adequately dealt with.  As I said, however, we will support this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400020#W00100","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468500900,"counter":161,"content":"<p>We will also support the quick passage of this legislation through the House.  On Committee Stage in the Seanad, we tabled an amendment, which I will come back to in a minute, but it was ruled out of order.  We have said previously that we will always support legislation which we feel is progressive and will deal with the issue of organised crime.  For this reason, we supported the changes that the Minister brought forward the week before last, I think, regarding section 38 and were happy to do so.  As a party, we will also support the changes being brought forward under the amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Act, even though I personally have some concerns about that legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to raise the issue of the proceeds seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau because it is a bugbear of mine.  I have always said that there is a need to show communities that the proceeds of crime are being pumped back into organisations in these communities where people have been the victims of these organised criminals who have devastated their communities.  Currently, that is not the case; it goes into the central Exchequer and then may trickle back into communities through various Departments that fund local projects.  For the sake of transparency, however, we should consider the possibility that those proceeds be allowed to be put directly back into communities, so that one can track what has been seized and what is being pumped back into local communities through funding.  That was the aim of the amendment we tabled in the Seanad last week which I know was ruled out of order.  I probably will not table an amendment on Committee Stage because it will be ruled out of order again and I do not want to waste anyone's time, considering that this legislation needs to be passed as quickly as possible.  I know it is scheduled to come back before the House next Tuesday for a resumption of Second Stage but, with any luck, we may even finish Second Stage today, which would allow Committee Stage to be taken next week.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the wider reforms that the Minister mentioned in her speech, we need to look at that element of the proceeds of crime which are confiscated.  Over the past ten years or so, the proceeds have amounted to around &euro;14 million.  A sum of &euro;14 million would go a long way to funding some of the front-line community and voluntary organisations which in recent years, because of the economic collapse, have had their funding drastically reduced.  If there is an opportunity to try to show them solidarity in their daily fight in their local communities, we should consider that very seriously.<\/p>  <p>  On the Bill itself, I know there were concerns about the lowering of the threshold.  It is proposed to move the threshold from the ability of the court to seize assets to the ability of bureau officers to seize them once they are not below the limit of &euro;5,000.  They do not even need to see those assets during a search warrant.  They can seize them if they see them on public display.  There is a balance here between property rights and the constitutionality of the provision.  I am glad that the Minister outlined in her speech that not only has the Attorney General considered this but that she has also got senior counsel to consider it.  Senior counsel are satisfied, so we are happy with that analysis.  That balancing act is needed so that a case is not transferred from civil to criminal.  It is important to say that anyone who has his or her assets seized under this legislation is not necessarily guilty of a criminal offence.  Only the courts can decide whether somebody is guilty of a criminal offence.  There are also safeguards put in, as Deputy O'Callaghan has said, in subsections 1B and 1C of section 3.  Subsection 1B allows somebody to make an application to the court to revoke an order which has been made previously after the 21 days.  Subsection 1C also allows that individual to receive compensation if an interlocutory order has not been made or has failed when the application has been made to the court, which is also an important provision.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, I hope we do not see any case in which a person has goods seized and then, eventually, when it gets to a court order within that 21-day period, the court decides that the assets were not the proceeds of crime.  However, there is always that possibility, so it is important to have those safeguards in the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It is proposed to lower the threshold to &euro;5,000, which is pretty low.  I can see the rationale and the reasoning behind it.  I am sure every Deputy in this Chamber represents, as I do, a constituency in which there is huge deprivation in some areas.  One of the most frustrating things for law-abiding citizens in those communities is to see the local drug dealer or organised criminal driving around in flashy cars and dripping with gold jewellery.  For young people growing up and seeing that, sometimes it can be an incentive for them to get involved in criminality because they see these individuals in their gold chains and driving around in their flashy cars and they aspire to have that type of wealth.  Unfortunately, when one is dealing with communities ravaged by deprivation, and there are not many economic opportunities for young people, some individuals will go down that path of criminality.  Anything that helps prevent that is to be welcomed.  I think this legislation will help to prevent it because now, if a local person is engaged in criminal activity and is driving around in his flashy car, he needs to be put on notice that flashy car will be confiscated from him at the side of the road and will be taken from him for 24 hours, with the possibility that it will be taken for 21 days and a further possibility that it will be confiscated for good.  Therefore, the days of local criminals being able to flash their wealth around the place, I hope, will be addressed by this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The only other area I want to touch on very briefly is that of racial profiling.  We do not have racial profiling legislation in this State.  I am not saying that this will happen but we have to safeguard against it happening.  There have been cases where members of the Roma community and the Traveller community have been racially profiled in the past.  I do not want to see a situation where somebody, just because he or she is from a minority community or the Traveller community, is targeted because of his or her ethnicity.  I hope that does not happen, and I think it is very unlikely to happen, but we need to safeguard against it in case it does happen.  We cannot have a situation where somebody is targeted because he or she may drive around in a nice car or might have a nice trailer and is from a particular ethnic background.  I do not know whether the Minister can address that in an amendment or whether it is the case that we have to implement the legislation in a commonsense fashion.  I hope that the latter would be the case.<\/p><p>I do not want anybody to be racially profiled under the legislation.  It is being proposed for a very particular reason, namely, to target people involved in criminality and who are decimating local communities.  For this reason, we support it.<\/p> <p> I have not yet made up my mind about the amendment on Committee Stage.  I do not see the value in proposing it, given that it will be ruled out of order.  In 2003, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, of the Minister's party, brought forward a Bill to allow the proceeds from CAB to be redirected to local drugs task forces.  We need to have this conversation as part of the wider reform.  If we are asking communities to co-operate with us and to see the value of legislation, which we know will help them, there must be a clear line of sight.  There must be a transparent connection between the confiscation of assets from the local drug dealer or organised criminal and the money being put back into the community to help educate people and prevent them from going down the wrong path.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400021#X00200","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468501500,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  With one or two caveats, my party and I strongly support the Bill and will vote for it.  We agree with the proposal to reduce the threshold value of property subject to removal from &euro;13,000 to &euro;5,000.  We also agree with the new short-term administrative power of seizure and detention at CAB officer level envisaged.  We have all had discussions with local communities on the matter and the strongest demand or requirement from the community groups we met was that there be a \"mini CAB\" to address the frustration and almost provocation of seeing people, as Deputy Jonathan O'Brien said, parading around with no visible means but dripping with material goods.<\/p>  <p>  The Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 was the initiative of the rainbow Government, of which I was privileged to be a member.  It was probably brought about, more than anything, in response to the brutal murder of Veronica Guerin.  The Act and its sister Act, the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, brought in by former Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, has been heavily litigated in the courts and has survived robust challenges during the intervening 20 years.  The system of civil restraint and forfeiture of assets which we introduced back then has been adopted in other jurisdictions, as the T&aacute;naiste said.  It has proven to be a genuinely effective weapon in our response, which we always must be thinking of improving, to the threat of organised crime.<\/p>  <p>  The vital aspect of CAB is that a conviction for an offence is not a precondition for a confiscation order.  This was the new departure which was embarked upon 20 years ago.  CAB uses purely civil procedure.  A former legal officer of CAB put it well when he said its fundamental purpose is \"disruption and discouragement\", rather than enforcement in a criminal law way.  The current proposal to reduce the threshold value of property is a direct response to the calls which many of us have heard to address the new phenomenon that is so evident in some communities across the country and I welcome it.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill comes to us from the Seanad.  My colleague in the Seanad had sought to make amendments there, as the T&aacute;naiste knows.  As other Deputies have touched on, one amendment proposed was the dedication of the proceeds of crime seized by CAB to investment in areas of social or economic deprivation.  If I were still speaking from the Government benches, I would be strongly briefed by my former Department officials to oppose such a motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400022#Y00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1468501500,"counter":164,"content":"<p>The Deputy would probably agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400022#Y00300","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1468501500,"counter":165,"content":"<p>It is the Merrion Street way.  The notion of hypothecated taxes, as they call them, is anathema to them.  When I was Minister for the Environment 20 years ago I wanted to ring-fence a particular income source for local government.  I had to do a side deal with former Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn and bring it directly to the Cabinet without going through consultation, given that bureaucracy would have killed it off.  I am sure things have improved immeasurably since then.  I understand it, having been in a Department for the past five years.  One cannot have a situation in which taxes are ring-fenced.  While the plastic bag tax worked and is used for environmental purposes, it is a small sum of money.  If we had ring-fenced taxes all over the shop, we would not be able to do joined-up government.<\/p>  <p>  However, in this instance, there is a very coherent and cogent reason to allow it to happen.  I would return to the colleagues in both Departments housed in Merrion Street and tell them there is a consensus view in the House.  When the most vulnerable communities see criminals being stripped of their ill-gotten gains, if there were a direct benefit to them from it in education funds, better social provision, better play facilities or whatever, it would be a double merit.<\/p>  <p>  It may be true that areas with severe social and economic deprivation generate more crime, at least the sort of crime that attracts most public attention.  We do not always draw attention to the white-collar crime that exists in some suburbs, which we do not notice as readily.  It is also true that people living in the most deprived areas are also the people most likely to be the victims of crime.  Drug crime, alcohol abuse, public order offences and anti-social behaviour make life misery for many citizens living in all our areas, but particularly the areas that are least well-equipped to respond effectively to such offences.  I have said here before there is insufficient appreciation at political or senior Garda level of the corrosive effect on communities besieged by anti-social behaviour.  The last time I was an Opposition spokesperson on justice I tried to focus on it.  In many ways, anti-social behaviour impacts more on people's quality of life than any other criminal activity.  Our most marginalised communities have particularly suffered in their quality of life due to lawlessness, vandalism and anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Confronted with the true scale of the problems which face communities, the temptation is to blame others or reach for a quick fix solution.  However, it is not just an issue of bail, sentencing or the need for ever more criminal laws.  Practitioners tell us we have enough law; the way to reduce crime is by enforcement of law and looking beyond the law for the other supports the communities need.  We need to tackle the phenomenon of criminal, anti-social and anti-community activity directly and on the ground.  Dedicating resources to it from CAB resources would be a good start.<\/p>  <p>  What we are experiencing is, to a large extent, a consequence of decades of underinvestment in or neglect of some of our areas.  As I have done previously, I confess my own part in this.  During the past five years, we did not do enough for vulnerable areas.  While we need a legislative response - this is what the Bill is - we need more, and that is why I raised the issue of the north inner city task force with the T&aacute;naiste on the Order of Business this morning.  I hope it is up and running before the end of the D&aacute;il term.<\/p>  <p>  At least equally importantly, we need a policing response that is drawn up in co-operation and agreement with the communities whose neighbourhoods so badly need effective policing.  The relationship between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and some local communities is not good, as the T&aacute;naiste will acknowledge.<\/p><p>In some areas it is deteriorating.  We need to rebuild confidence in the relationship between police and community.  We need to establish community structures, with a degree of control over Garda policy at community level.  In short, we need to reconnect policing with communities.  That is simple to say and challenging to do.  We have - we all have met them - excellent members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, both at junior and more senior level, who understand what needs to be done in that regard.<\/p> <p> An important aspect of the policing response is to ensure that the policing service is modernised in terms of technology, operation and management.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware of my views on these matters.  Are the Garda Inspectorate reports being implemented?  I hope they are.  Is there still a commitment to act on the myriad of recommendations that we discussed over recent months?<\/p> <p> Will we, to take the most relevant example, see the establishment of a Garda serious and organised crime unit to tackle criminal networks?  We need to see it happening.  The Garda Inspectorate describes this as providing an agile multi-disciplined investigation team to follow the criminal, not just the crime type.  They complained in an earlier report that there was very little clarity about what some of the national units do and do not investigate.  They said that there was too much duplication and not enough clarity.  They say that there were opportunities to amalgamate functions and units to create clearer protocols about what crimes each unit is tasked to investigate and they say that the formation of a serious and organised crime unit would allow several current units to come together, reduce overlap and provide more resilience for the long-term investigations required in some instances.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste, in her reply, can tell us if this repeated recommendation has been accepted and when will we see this unit established.<\/p> <p> We are all agreed we need a socioeconomic response.  We talked about that in this House.  There is much anger, frustration and annoyance at community level and not only in the north inner city.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien would instance parts of his own constituency and we all could different parts of the country.  Alongside that anger, there is a willingness to be involved in resolution.  People have enormous energy.  They want their communities, their streets, their parks and their cities and towns to function and to underpin rather than diminish the quality of life of their own people.<\/p> <p> This enormous resource must be included in both framing and delivering solutions, such as those underway in the north inner city.  That is why I place so much emphasis on the task force that I pursued, initially with the Taoiseach and, up to today, with the T&aacute;naiste, and it is against that backdrop that I invite the T&aacute;naiste to reconsider and go back and fight, as I know the T&aacute;naiste can do effectively, with the Minister for Finance and whoever else the notion of ring-fencing the proceeds of crime to be demonstrably used to tackle deprivation.  Crime has heaped further affliction on already blighted areas.  It would be a visible sign of good intent and a practical commitment if the accumulated proceeds of crime could be used to physically reinvest in communities.<\/p> <p> My colleague, Senator Bacik, proposed in the other House another amendment to this Bill on our party's behalf.  It is slightly convoluted since it sought to reference a change in the law which is well signalled but which has not yet been made.  It is trying to be prescient.  At present, soliciting in a public place, either by a client or by a prostitute, is unlawful but the act of buying or selling sex is not unlawful.  The published proposal that I understand the Government is proceeding with is that in future, the purchase of sex will be unlawful but the sale of sex will not, but criminalising the purchase of sexual services has one peculiar consequence that, perhaps, has not been thought about.  The purchase money will become the proceeds of crime, the crime committed by the purchaser under this new offence because we will make it an offence to purchase sexual favours.  It will be caught because the proceeds of crime is defined under the legislation that we are amending today as meaning any property obtained or received by or as a result of or in connection with the commission of an offence.  The payment for sexual services will be received by the prostitute as a result of an offence committed by the client.<\/p> <p> It seems that this new reality has produced a somewhat schizophrenic response on behalf of the authorities.  There is an agreement across the House that many prostitutes are victims of exploitation and criminalising these women is wrong.  The alternative approach, of criminalising the clients while ensuring that women selling sexual services are not criminalised, has largely been met with approval.  If we have a situation where the money received by prostitutes is now a criminal asset, it can be seized and, while I do not have time to elaborate on it, there have been cases where that has been used in an exploitative way by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We need to rethink the matter because, as somebody put it to me, we might be taking women out of the prison cell but putting them into the poor house.  That might not be the best response.<\/p> <p> I am conscious that my time has expired.  We will have a chance on Committee Stage to develop these matters in more detail.  I welcome this Bill and look forward to its speedy enactment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400022#Y00400","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468502100,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and I understand the situation which it seeks to address.  It amends a well-established Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act which, as has been mentioned, has been in operation for perhaps 20 years.  I also understand the imperative of a speedy passage through this House and I will give my full support to it, as my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, outlined.<\/p>  <p>  However, I want to reflect the fact that the sanctions proposed are all of a pre-trial nature and, indeed, as has been said, are civil rather than criminal in nature.  We must not lose focus on the imperative of the criminal justice system being sufficiently resourced and the Garda having the investigative powers and the resources to do the job it needs to do and go through the full rigours of the criminal justice system in the pursuit of crime.  While the measures in the Bill are necessary and imperative, they are not a substitute for full detection, investigation and going to trial, as is required.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to consider that those subject to or targeted by this legislation have not been found guilty of any crime.  The presumption of innocence is, of course, a fundamental principle of the criminal justice system.  While I recognise and support the imperative of the Bill, I welcome the Minister's comments at the outset that there will be a wider review in due course of the Proceeds of Crime Acts.  That is wise.  This is not the time to do it but, as that arises, there are checks and balances that could be introduced to augment, support and enhance what has being proposed to date.  I will touch on some of those briefly.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of that broader review, I have a couple of observations, queries and suggestions to the Minister and to the Department that they may take on board.  The composition of the Criminal Assets Bureau is part civilian and part garda&iacute;.  There are a number of officers drawn from different arms of Revenue, Social Protection and the Garda.  It is not apparent, at any rate it is not clear to me, what is the relationship say, with GSOC or the Policing Authority, and whether there may be some lines of communication or lines of reporting provided for in that context.  It may be something that can be returned to, not at this stage and not in this Bill, but when that wider consideration takes place in due course.<\/p>  <p>  Along the same lines, while we understand the imperative of it, there are other pieces of legislation of a similar nature which would have checks and balances in place in the form of review.  Of course, such provisions have not been without controversy.<\/p><p>I allude, for example, to the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, which contains measures that provide for a review to be conducted at certain stages of the operation of the legislation with respect to how it is performing.  A five-year review is built into the Defamation Act.  Every five years, the Minister initiates a review of the operation of the legislation to consider if its implementation is successful, if changes are required and if simple checks and balances are in place.  I understand the European Convention on Human Rights Act has a similar provision.  I believe a report on its operation is laid before the House on an annual basis.  It would be useful to have a similar measure in this case to ensure good governance and best practice, not for now but for down the line.<\/p> <p> Those are some suggestions in terms of the wider context of the legislation, which I support.  This issue has ravaged communities and nothing frustrates people more than seeing people blatantly flouting the law and benefiting from it openly within their communities.  That is a problem which must be tackled.  It was tackled successfully by CAB, which has had many successes in the past 20 years.  With those few caveats, I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House, hopefully before the recess.  It is welcome and necessary legislation and on a future date, we might return to the points I made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400023#Z00200","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468502700,"counter":169,"content":"<p>As no other Deputies are offering, I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, to respond.

All Members of the House can look to our work here today and say we are doing our part as legislators.  We are providing the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, with the legislative powers it needs to tackle organised criminals.<\/p>  <p>  For its part, the Government is committed to providing the resources to tackle crime wherever and however it occurs.  We are investing in vehicles, technology and new legislation but, most importantly, in people.  In addition to the &euro;5 million previously announced in February, a further &euro;50 million is to be provided in 2016, &euro;15 million of which is to come from projected savings in the justice and equality sector, with the balance coming from the Exchequer.  This funding is being made available to maintain the necessary policing response to the current situation on an ongoing basis.  This will allow for concentrated policing targeting of gang-related crime, in particular; continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor; and continued support for measures against terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  A new Garda special crime task force is being established under the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  It will augment the response to organised crime at a local level through concentrated policing and through a multi-agency approach to targeting the proceeds of crime.  The Garda Commissioner will have oversight of the task force and its operations.  The task force will be sustained for as long as is necessary and it will adapt to the prevailing organised crime situation at local level.  It is expected to be operational by the end of the year, with approximately 50 people contributing to its work.  There will be a core of dedicated officers working under the auspices of the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau as well as staff from the Criminal Assets Bureau and divisional asset profilers.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the House that the Minister is committed to making sure the necessary resources are made available to the Criminal Assets Bureau from within the available public finances.  Budget levels for the bureau have been maintained over recent years.  The resources made available to the bureau are kept under ongoing review by both the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the establishment of the special crime task force, some additional resource requirements have been identified by the bureau and progress is being made in addressing this.  As I said, the matter will be kept under review by both the bureau and the Department.<\/p>  <p>  A dedicated armed support unit, ASU, for the Dublin area is in the process of being set up and trained.  Pending full establishment of the new unit, arrangements have been put in place so that armed support is being provided on an overtime basis.<\/p>  <p>  Underpinning all of these measures is the Government&rsquo;s intention to increase Garda numbers to 15,000.  While in the short term substantial funds are being made available for overtime, measures are being considered to accelerate the planned Garda recruitment programme, along with the recruitment of further civilian and specialist staff.<\/p>  <p>  I listened with interest to the suggestions Deputies had for other amendments which could be made to the Proceeds of Crime Acts.  In the Minister&rsquo;s opening remarks, she explained the need for the measures contained in this Bill to be enacted without delay to give the Criminal Assets Bureau the power to seize property quickly and to target the assets of lower level gang members.  She also noted the delicate balance of the Proceeds of Crime Act as non-penal legislation.  While the proposals for further amendments put forward today cannot be readily taken on board in the timeframe with which we all wish to see this Bill enacted, they can be considered as part of the wider review of the legislation in the medium term, as Deputy Lawless alluded to earlier.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill will empower the CAB to move quickly to seize property and detain it for three weeks.  It will give it the time it needs to prepare an application to the court.  The proceeds of crime of moderate value, which were previously out of reach, will now be captured by the Proceeds of Crime Act.  This Bill forms part of a wider Government response to the recent acute problems of organised crime.  The response is comprehensive and will be sustained.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin mentioned the area of sexual services.  There is a concern that proposal could have negative implications for persons who offer sexual services and offer an opportunity for those who would exploit the law and exploit those who are vulnerable.  For instance, the exemption of the purchase of sexual services from criminal conduct for the purpose of proceeds of crime could lead to sex workers being pressurised into holding moneys as legitimate fronts for pimps, traffickers and other organised criminals.  It might also make it more difficult for the CAB to pursue proceeds of crime held by pimps or traffickers.  These are matters that need to be considered further.<\/p>  <p>  The response in this Bill is comprehensive and will be sustained.  It includes law enforcement measures, investing in policing, new legislative powers and the deployment of specialist units but it also addresses the socioeconomic issues and investment in services to support resilient local communities.  This response is being further developed in partnership with those local communities and everyone, including the Oireachtas, the Government, local representatives and local communities, has a part to play in defeating crime and tackling the factors that allow crime to develop.  We will achieve more by working together in this way than we could ever achieve alone.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400024#AA00300","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1468502700,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1468502700,"counter":172,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400024#AA00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1468502700,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.

Europe has set a target of having a baseline of 30 Mbps connection speed across member states by 2020.  It is now clear we will not meet that target as the indication is the national broadband plan will not be rolled out fully until 2022.  Does the Minister believe, in light of this, that it might be better to jump ahead to what the European Commission has indicated is the premier benchmark, which is 100 Mbps connection speed by 2020?  Rather than going for the baseline, could we be a bit ambitious as we will miss the base deadline anyway?  I put to the Minister that he consider in his discussions with the three potential bidders that the 2020 target should be the premium benchmark, as established by the Commission, of 100 Mbps.

We announced last week that we would include another 170,000 homes and premises in this.  We were given a commitment by the commercial operators which, in fairness, have put a significant amount of money - approximately &euro;2 billion over the past four years - into rolling out the network.  Nevertheless, it was clear that most of the approximately 170,000 premises identified by us as in the blue area might have had fibre passing the head of the road but the homes would not be able to get 30 Mpbs broadband.  For example, it could be that the exchange is within 1 km as the crow flies but the copper wire could go in a circuitous route.  That means the premises would not get those speeds.  These are mainly areas within the vicinity of towns and we do not see an additional cost being involved as the build-out will already be taking place.<\/p>  <p>  We could have a significant amount of the rural areas covered in time for the EU objective for 2020.  I will not commit to a threshold of 2020 until the contractor or contractors are appointed but from what we are told, many of them seem to be determined to get this rolled out far quicker than we envisage.  I do not want to promise people they will get broadband by a specific date but it is not achieved.  Deputy Dooley and everybody else knows that we, in rural Ireland, are sick and tired of being promised dates for high-speed broadband only for it not to happen.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of whether the 30 Mbps threshold should be increased to 100 Mbps, we picked 30 Mbps as the minimum required.  We have indicated that a higher threshold is required for businesses, which are scattered right across rural Ireland.  The solutions put forward by the three preferred bidders are likely to involve much higher speeds than the minimum threshold.  It is important that the public understands that currently, there are operators promising up to 100 Mbps but, in reality, the speeds available are dramatically lower.  We are saying that 99.95% of the time, people will get a minimum of 30 Mbps.  That is a significant threshold and on top of that, businesses will require a much higher threshold.  In reality, speeds will be significantly higher.  There is a mechanism in the way the contract is structured to review this threshold every three to five years if the requirements exist for higher speeds.  That will come about over the 25-year contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400025#BB00400","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1468503300,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister's amenable approach to my request but the facts remain that the legal document will request a minimum of 30 Mbps.  I accept that contractors are capable of delivering higher speeds but does it not make sense to request what is ultimately required rather than making it something that is nice to have or an option that will probably be taken?  The truth is that all they will deliver is the minimum speed with the capacity to scale in time.  My concern - I am sure it is shared by the Minister because of his understanding of rural Ireland, which nobody could question - is that we must ensure the people in the rural area covered by this scheme have exactly the same capacity to remain in step with people in the more densely populated areas, where there is greater competition and higher speeds can be delivered much more cheaply.  If we are putting in resources now, let us force the companies to deliver the higher speed.  Even if the Minister indicated the minimum would be 30 Mbps at the beginning before setting a target by which they had to reach 100 Mbps, I would find some solace in it.  We must push the contractors and there is only one opportunity to do that, which is before they sign up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400025#BB00500","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1468503300,"counter":192,"content":"<p>The European Commission target of delivering 30 Mbps by 2020 is non-binding.

The programme for Government\u00a0contains a specific commitment to\u00a0facilitate the development of solar energy projects.  The\u00a0White Paper on energy policy published in\u00a0December 2015 also includes a commitment to introduce a new renewable electricity support scheme designed to encourage the development of Ireland's abundant, diverse and indigenous renewable energy resources, including solar photovoltaic\u00a0technology.<\/p>  <p>  It is widely recognised that solar photovoltaic, PV, technology has become\u00a0more cost effective for electricity generation over the past few years not only compared to other renewables such as\u00a0wind energy but also compared with conventional forms of generation.  With these significant\u00a0changes in the cost of the technology, the deployment of solar PV\u00a0technology in Ireland has only recently become a potential cost-effective option to increase energy security, contribute to our renewable energy targets and support economic growth and jobs.  It is also recognised, however, that while the cost competitiveness of solar PV\u00a0technology has improved, it would still require a subsidy in order to be developed on a commercial basis.<\/p>  <p>  The REFIT, Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff, electricity support schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for renewable energy exported to the grid.  These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources, including small scale hydro, biomass and wind.  Small scale renewable micro-generation is eligible to apply for support under the REFIT schemes.  My Department is currently undertaking in-depth economic analysis\u00a0to inform the\u00a0cost of a new renewable electricity support scheme.  While no decision has yet been taken on the precise renewable technologies to be supported, and the appropriate level of tariffs are still under consideration, the cost and technical viability of a range of renewable technologies, including solar PV technology, is being assessed.<\/p>  <p>  Designing and implementing a new scheme is a complex task and it is expected that the broad details of the new scheme will be available early next year.  Before these details are announced, my\u00a0Department will run a second public consultation, which will give all interested parties an opportunity to input into\u00a0the design of the new scheme.\u00a0 Ultimately, the introduction of any new scheme will be subject to Government approval and state aid clearance by the European Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400026#CC00500","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1468503900,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Under the public service obligation, PSO, the current projection is that nearly 3,000 MW of renewable energy will receive &euro;335 million in support in 2016-2017 while only 250 MW of fossil fuel will receive &euro;140 million.  The fossil fuel industry benefitted from &euro;386 million in subsidies in 2015.  That includes the PSO and the fuel allowance scheme.  We support the fuel allowance scheme but we need to transfer that and move it on to renewables.  When one considers these figures, it is &euro;11,000 per megawatt for renewable power and &euro;56,000 per megawatt for fossil fuel which is five times as much per megawatt.  There is no support or subsidy in the State currently, of which I am aware, for solar energy.  Wind, biomass, anaerobic digestion, hydro and biogas all receive feed tariffs but solar does not.  Solar is the only established renewable technology to not benefit.  It is a technology that is most suited to community and local participation with small ownership by local individual farmers or co-operatives.  As a result, the solar energy industry is practically non-existent.  Compare the situation to that which exists in Germany where 1.5 million German people generate solar energy from their own properties.  I ask the Minister to take this consideration on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400026#CC00600","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1468503900,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I understand the point being made by Deputy Stanley.  As he is aware, a large part of the fossil fuel PSO is close to my heart, namely, peat fired energy generation in our three midland power stations.  In fairness, I believe it is only because a predecessor of mine, Mary O'Rourke, happened to be in this job, we would not have those three peat fired power stations in the State.  The intention is to convert those stations over to biomass and I am working quite closely with Coillte, Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB in that regard and we hope to make progress.  Bord na M&oacute;na has already given the commitment to be out of electricity generation with peat as a feed stock by the end of the next decade.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is the PSO and at the last Question Time, Deputy Stanley's colleagues, as well as Members on the opposition benches, gave me a lot of grief over the cost of the PSO to consumers.  In regard to the last analysis done in 2015 by KPMG on the cost of solar PV in Ireland, while the costs of solar have come down significantly, it is now costing in nearly &euro;150 per megawatt.  Wind costs &euro;69.72 per megawatt for a large wind farm while it costs &euro;72.16 for a small wind farm.  Hydro costs &euro;88 per megawatt.  Under REFIT 3 biomass combustion costs &euro;89 per megawatt and small biomass, in a combined heat and power system, costs &euro;147 per megawatt.  That is probably more congenial to communities getting involved in energy generation.<\/p>  <p>  The problem has been that solar was far too expensive to produce up to now.  However, the costs are coming down and I had a meeting last month with some manufacturers in China which are driving down the costs even further.  Solar will definitely be part of the new scheme but exactly how that will be structured will have to be weighed up against meeting the targets which must be achieved and in finding a balance so that consumers are not paying an excessive PSO.<\/p><p>That is a fine line which must be drawn and I am being rightly criticised that there is no support for the solar energy industry because the Commission for Energy Regulation is increasing the price of the PSO to consumers.  In this regard I see exactly where Deputy Stanley is coming from.  The challenge is about trying to strike the right balance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400026#CC00700","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1468504500,"counter":201,"content":"<p>One minute remains for a supplementary.

With the significant\u00a0changes in the cost of the technology, the deployment of solar photo voltaic in Ireland has only recently become a potential cost-effective option to increase energy security, contribute to our renewable energy targets and support economic growth and jobs.  It is also recognised, however, that while the cost competitiveness of solar photo voltaic has improved, it would still require a subsidy in order to be developed on a commercial basis.  In depth economic analysis is under way to inform the costing of a new renewable electricity support scheme.  While no decision has been taken on the precise renewable technologies to be supported,\u00a0the cost and technical viability of a range of renewable technologies is being assessed, including solar photo voltaic.<\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">  Designing and implementing a new scheme is a complex task and it is expected that the broad details of the new scheme will be available early next year.  Before these details are announced, the Department will run a second public consultation, which will give all interested parties an opportunity to have an input into\u00a0the design of the new scheme. \u00a0Ultimately, the introduction of any new scheme will be subject to Government approval and state aid clearance by the European Commission.  While there are no specific targets in relation to any individual renewable energy technology, any renewable energy technology that is built and connected before 2020 can contribute towards Ireland's 2020 renewable energy target.  This may include solar photo voltaic.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400029#FF00700","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1468505700,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I am interested in the citizens' dividend the Minister mentioned.

There is also a concept of offset whereby they can contribute back to the grid where they produce excess energy.  This has been very successfully achieved in Germany and Portugal in recent months.  They actually achieved negative pricing at one stage.  The utility companies might not be too happy about that but it works very much for the consumer.  I was informed by a constituent recently that the microgeneration scheme run by the ESB had been withdrawn.  This individual had a number of panels on his roof and was benefitting from participation in this very beneficial scheme.

We do not have a large number of microgeneration projects currently.  No more than the discussion we had at the select committee earlier on today, this is something we are looking at actively and it is something we are going to look at next Wednesday when we discuss the Energy Bill again.  Access to the grid is only one aspect of this.  Another aspect is the stability of the grid when one has a large number of generators on it.  There is also the cost aspect and the requirement for smart metering of the income to be generated.

It is about bringing the community together to talk about what the options are, how they can be involved and the give and take in regard to these projects.  It should not be a matter of one-way traffic.  That is important.  The difficulty with solar photo voltaic up to now has been the KPMG study which showed that the subsidy it required was roughly &euro;150 per megawatt.  Large-scale wind is currently subsidised at approximately &euro;70 per megawatt while I am told at European level that offshore wind is subsidised at approximately &euro;100 per megawatt.

Currently, there is no universal service obligation, USO, in respect of high-speed broadband provision.  The USO in place relates solely to voice telephony and functional Internet access to a level of 28.8 kbps and is provided for under the EU regulatory framework governing telecoms.  The introduction of a USO would give a legal right to individuals to request a broadband connection from a provider at a minimum speed that would have to be defined.  The USO provisions in respect of voice telephony have ensured voice services are available nationwide.  Where high-speed broadband networks are available, a USO could provide a useful tool to ensure all premises within a network area would have a connection.<\/p>  <p>  While the current EU regulatory framework only provides for a basic broadband USO, the review of the regulatory framework which is due to commence later this year\u00a0will give member states an opportunity to include a high-speed broadband USO as part of any new framework.  I have already raised this issue with my ministerial colleagues at the Council of Ministers.  The national broadband plan, NBP, intervention will effectively act as a USO by ensuring every home, school and business in the intervention area is capable of having an affordable high-speed broadband connection for the entire period of the contract.<\/p>  <p>  The question of a USO in rural areas may arise when the 25-year contract expires but not until then.  This could provide a useful regulatory vehicle so as to ensure affordable services continue to be provided for all consumers in the area.  Effective regulation such as the introduction of a USO can deal with many of the concerns that may arise in the coming years and on the expiry of any contract awarded by the State.  My officials and I are also discussing with ComReg the possibility of introducing a broadband USO as a future-proofing measure so as to ensure no premises will be left without a service in areas not covered by the NBP intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400030#GG00100","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1468506300,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response and indicating that he will provide for a USO.

These policies deal with the established practice of controlling pike in waters which are designated as primary wild brown trout fisheries and where the principal predator, pike, is managed to optimise wild brown trout stocks for anglers.<\/p>  <p>  Following the appointment of an internal IFI policy review group later this month, the review process will commence with a scoping consultation which will be open to all parties.  As part of the policy development process, fish stock management methodologies, including gill netting and electrofishing, will be carefully reviewed.  IFI will have regard to scientific advice and best practice internationally.  It is working to ensure the completion of this process in as consultative a way as possible which will ensure all interested parties can have an input into policy formulation.  It hopes to receive the agreed views of angler stakeholder groups, domestic and tourist anglers, tourism providers and the general public.<\/p>  <p>  No decision has been taken on the cessation or otherwise of pike management operations in designated trout waters for 2017.

At the same time, I know that there has been great unease among pike anglers about this matter.  It is welcome that there is a review under way.  I am not clear on what the Minister of State said about the actual consultation process and about how open and accessible it will be to all stakeholders.  Perhaps he might clarify the matter for me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400031#HH01400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1468506900,"counter":275,"content":"<p>The national policy for the management of trout, pike and bass was launched in 2014.  The various policies seek to provide for the best conservation and management of bass, pike and trout in Ireland and will help to ensure the sustainability of stocks.

It will consider the views expressed in the public consultation process, relevant signs and historical data for inland fisheries.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy, coming from the west, will acknowledge there is particular concern about pike in the managed lakes in counties Galway and Mayo and such areas.

There is also value to pike anglers.  They have given me extraordinary figures which indicate a reduction in the number of visitors from 43,000 to 7,200 in the last year.  There are issues arising and the anglers are looking for a process in which they will be heard and will be able to make submissions.  The Minister is confirming that this will happen, but it concerns me that the deadline is next year.  I would have thought this process could have been completed in a much shorter timeframe.  The arrangement has not yet been set up and it will run until next year, until July, which seems to be a very long period in which to deal with this matter, given the implications for tourism and revenue generation in local areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071400031#HH01600","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1468506900,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I will obtain a more accurate update in the coming weeks as the matter evolves.
