Much of the banks stabilisation process will have come full circle with the ending of the guarantee which was announced this week and the recent decision on the liquidation of IBRC and the sale of Irish Life.  Next week's meeting with the Accounting Officer of the Department of Finance will give the committee an opportunity to examine these latest developments and bank stabilisation.

Salaries and pensions accounted for more than three quarters of current expenditure, with approximately 95,000 whole-time equivalent staff in the sector.  Capital services expenditure amounted to almost &euro;590 million.  The school transport service is funded from Vote 26 and payments amounted to &euro;171 million in 2011.  A sum of &euro;152 million was paid to Bus &Eacute;ireann which, under a long-standing arrangement, manages the provision of most school transport, using a combination of services contracted in from private bus operators and vehicles in its own fleet.  The remaining &euro;19 million was spent on direct school transport grants and school bus escort payments.<\/p><p>  Chapter 6 deals with the Exchequer's overall financial commitments arising from public private partnerships, PPPs.  Members will recall that various aspects of this chapter have been considered by the committee in previous meetings.  Total expenditure to the end of 2011 on five education PPP projects was &euro;255 million and the outstanding commitment with regard to those projects was just under &euro;1 billion.  The five projects comprise three groups or bundles of schools, the National Maritime College and the Cork School of Music, both of which are part of the Cork Institute of Technology.  The chapter recommends publication of the value for money appraisals carried out before PPPs are contracted for to assist in improving public understanding of the factors influencing the achievement of value in public investment projects.  The chapter also recommends, in the context of roads projects, that post-implementation evaluations of projects should be carried out so that lessons learned can be applied in development of later projects.  This applies equally to other types of PPP projects, including those in the education sector.  Ideally, projects to be evaluated should have been in operation for a sufficient period to allow them to have bedded down.  As some of the education projects have been operational for a number of years at this stage, post-implementation evaluations would now be timely.  I am not aware that any have been completed to date.<\/p><p>  Four other education PPP projects are currently being developed and are at various stages of progress.  These involve a further three bundles of schools dispersed across the State and the Dublin Institute of Technology campus in Grangegorman, designed to bring together the various schools and colleges of the institute on a single site.  In 2011 the Department cancelled three bundles of third level education PPP projects that had been in planning for a number of years.  The National Development Finance Agency had procured and provided technical, legal, financial, insurance and other services for those projects at a cost of almost &euro;4.4 million, excluding VAT.  The Department provided capital funding of &euro;5.7 million to the colleges to prepare clean, serviced sites for the PPP companies.  Some of the colleges incurred additional costs from their own resources.  For example, the Institute of Technology, Tallaght incurred substantial additional PPP project related costs from accumulated reserves.  The extent to which these sunk costs have potential future value has not been determined.<\/p><p>  Chapter 18 deals with salary overpayments to teachers.  As part of the 2011 budget, the Government applied a 10% reduction in the pay rates for new entrants to the public service on or after 1 January 2011.  In addition, all new appointees to teaching and many retired teachers returning to teach were to commence at the first point of the relevant pay scales.  The terms of the budget decision also applied to non-teaching staff employed in schools.  It took the Department over seven months from budget day to prepare and issue a circular containing the revised pay scales and a further two months to implement the required changes to its payroll systems.  When the report was being completed, the Department estimated that it had overpaid approximately &euro;1.18 million to some 4,700 new entrants in 2011.  I understand the Department has since revised up this estimate and now calculates that the overpayment amount was &euro;1.745 million, paid to just under 5,000 employees.  By September 2012, one year after implementation of the pay rate changes, the Department had not yet contacted the overpaid individuals or put in place repayment arrangements.  The Department expected the repayment arrangements for the post-primary and non-teaching staff to be completed shortly and to commence with the primary sector in November 2012.  I understand that, to date, around 29% of the estimated amount overpaid has been recovered.  The Accounting Officer will be able to provide further information about payment recovery and whether recovery of the full amount overpaid is expected to be achieved.<\/p><p>  The scale of the challenge in managing large public sector payroll systems was brought out clearly during the series of committee meetings last October and November that examined allowances in public sector bodies.  I fully accept that time is required to implement budget and other changes in public sector pay.  Nevertheless, I concluded that it would have been more efficient had the Department regarded all staff added to the payroll in 2011 as new entrants and applied the pay reductions earlier.  Subsequently, pay rates could have been adjusted for eligible employees as evidence was supplied of relevant previous employment in the public service.  This is likely to have been a more efficient approach because employees would have had a financial incentive to provide relevant information promptly.  The operational lessons from this case may be of value in the context of the currently proposed pay reductions, the implementation of which presents a very significant challenge to all public sector payroll managers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800004#C01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1362046200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mc Carthy and call on Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800004#C01200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362046200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to make this statement concerning the examination of the 2011 appropriation accounts for Vote 26.  As requested, I have forwarded some advance briefing to the committee and will keep my opening statement short.  The briefing note provided outlines the structure of the Vote for my Department and gives details regarding the main components of expenditure, together with information regarding expenditure on the Vote in 2011 and provisional outturn for 2012.  While the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2011 contains three chapters relating to the education Vote, I understand that only two of those chapters are scheduled for discussion today, namely, chapter 6 relating to financial commitments under public private partnership and chapter 18 relating to salary overpayments to teachers.<\/p><p>  On the issue of PPPs, the challenging fiscal environment has meant that some very difficult choices over the last number of years have had to be made with regard to education expenditure.  In our case, the current emerging demographic challenges for the school sector have also been highly influential in informing those choices.  This is the context in which the decision not to proceed with a number of third level education PPP projects was made.  The challenges I have outlined have made it inevitable that such capital resources as are available to the Department must be prioritised for the delivery of school places.  This is the conclusion to which the Government came in November 2011 in deciding on the capital envelope to be made to the Department for 2012 to 2016.  Effectively, the education capital budget included provision for the extensive demographic growth and was only able to commit to seeing through capital commitments in other areas.  This is the context for the decision with respect to third level PPP projects.<\/p> <p>We would have preferred to be in the position to advance with these projects but the Government&rsquo;s overall capital allocation was being reduced and we had no other option.  While much of the investment that was made in those projects has been retained through infrastructural works, including road networks and services which will facilitate future development, we do recognise that there are significant consultancy costs which were undertaken and which are not of future value.  In November 2011, we announced that the Grangegorman PPP project was being delayed, but arising from further investment being available under the Government&rsquo;s stimulus programme announced in July, that it is now proceeding.  In addition, the schools PPP projects are continuing apace.<\/p><p> On the salary overpayments, in budget 2011 provision was made that a 10% reduction would apply to the pay of new appointees to the public service and that all new appointees to entry grades would start at the first point of the relevant pay scale with effect from the 1 January 2011.  This arrangement also applied to retired staff returning to work in a substitute or temporary capacity.  Due to both the complexity of our payrolls and the pay arrangements for teachers generally it took some months for the Department to determine the terms and conditions relevant to new teacher appointees and to make the necessary changes to our payroll systems for the changes to take effect.<\/p><p> Implementation of the revised arrangements required the development of sophisticated and comprehensive IT programmes to deal with the complexity of the various working patterns and categories of teachers, particularly part-time and substitute teachers, throughout the sector.  This requires adequate lead-in time to allow for clarification of the issues involved, the preparation of specifications for the development of IT programmes and the full testing of these programmes without impacting on the normal payroll runs or the integrity and accuracy of the payroll systems generally which cater for 95,300 payees being paid on a fortnightly basis.  The absence of this adequate lead-in time will inevitably lead to some element of overpayments being incurred depending on the complexity of the change to be implemented.<\/p><p> The difficulties faced by the Department in implementing the new arrangements provided in budget 2011 resulted in overpayments to a number of teachers.  The total value of the overpayments that arose has now been calculated at &euro;1.745 million which represents 0.038% of the total 2013 payroll budget.  A total of &euro;508,482 has been recovered up to and including 14 February 2013, leaving a balance of &euro;1.236 million outstanding.  The overpayments continue to be recovered on an ongoing basis by fortnightly deductions from the pay and pensions of the individuals concerned.  It remains the policy of the Department that all overpayments will be recovered in full in the shortest possible timeframe.

We have the biggest payroll in the State.  We have approximately 95,000 people paid on the payroll - post-primary teachers in secondary, community and comprehensive schools, primary teachers, non-teaching staff in those schools, retired teachers and non-teaching staff.  We have more than 2.4 million transactions per annum.<\/p><p>  One of the particular complexities of the nature of our payroll system is that we deal with payments to part-time and substitute teachers.  That means that in any two week period we have 10,000 teachers coming off and on to the payroll.  We have a wide range of finishers and starters in any two week period, which is relatively unique in the context of the public sector.  The payroll service relates to all of those schools.  We are not technically the employer but we operate a payroll service.<\/p><p>  We have an online claim system which deals with all of the substitute claims, which is a particularly complex element.  There are not only a single set of pay arrangements in place.  Different arrangements are in place for teachers depending on whether they are casually employed, non-casually employed or permanently employed.  Each category has different rates of pay and also each of them works up service towards incremental credit in a different way.  We have a complicated system in that sense.  With the changes being introduced in the budget from December 2010, starting in 2011, rather than the payroll itself, we had to look first at the issues surrounding whether someone was a new starter.  There were various complexities in that regard.  We had to consult in detail with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and we had to issue a circular to the sector so that the change could be explained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800005#D00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1362046800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>It is correct that the circular was only issued several months after the original decision to reduce pay at that level was agreed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800005#D00800","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362046800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>The circular was issued in June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800005#D00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1362046800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Yes, several months later.

These words also could be attributed to Kieran Mulvey of the Labour Relations Commission, LRC.  It is a hugely complex set of arrangements to be considered by trade union members.  If the Department experienced difficulties regarding what was, generally speaking, quite a small adjustment, and if the Croke Park extension agreement is adopted and agreed by the trade unions, can one have confidence that the Department will be able to deal with the complexities that inevitably will arise in respect of staff members who will experience a step back in terms of increments or those who will now have 15 month increment periods, as well as all the different propositions under the second Croke Park agreement?

We have been obliged to deal with the universal social charge and the pensions related deduction.  While we have been able to deal with these successfully, they have added to the burden regarding payroll.  A lot of external elements, if one likes, are being imposed on us - I do not mean this in an awkward sense - which we are required to implement arising from central changes.  We are working through a number of other changes at present such as the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 and the enactment of section 30 in respect of the need for teachers to be registered.  We also are working through the taxation of illness benefits and a number of other areas.  We also were able to deal with the changes from February 2012 with an easier change to the system because of the nature of the payment.  The major difficulty in 2011 had been that we were obliged to recategorise staff with new entrants and so on.

If the arrangements regarding supervision and substitution come through as contained in the LRC proposal, some elements of complexity in our payroll system will decrease.  Furthermore, if the elements in the agreement on substitution in schools come through, there will be a reduced number of claims for external substitution.

However, I would like to pick up on SUSI first.  I spent a morning in the organisation's offices with the staff on Mespil Road and witnessed their work.  I received many representations about the system as well.  Once they recognised the scale of the difficulty, a quality effort went in to overcoming it.  I acknowledge that people such as Mr. John Conroy recognise the scale of the challenge and they are committed to overcoming it.<\/p><p>  However, even in recent years, a number of efforts have been made to centralise the processing of applications for State schemes and each time the same difficulty has been encountered.  Medical card applications were centralised in offices in a number of locations throughout the State, including one near me in Ballymun, and there were huge delays in dealing with applications for quite a period until the system bedded down.  The same happened with carer's allowance applications in the aftermath of the medical cards issue and then this happened.  While I accept Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s point that, within the educational sphere, this represents a big effort to centralise things, things happened to which we have to respond.  Within the government sphere, this keeps on happening.  Was an analysis conducted of what happened when medical card applications were centralised?  Did people ask what could be learned from that?  Was this perspective taken across government or was the SUSI process examined in isolation without considering what had happened elsewhere over the previous 18 months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800008#G01200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362048600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>We did not advance with the centralisation agenda alone.

The difficulty and the challenge came because of the scale of the operation when everything came together, and that highlighted that it is hard to pilot the scale of everything coming together.<\/p><p>  However, we have had successful examples within the Department.  The other major topic we have discussed so far is the payroll system.  We put in place centralised arrangements for the payment of online claims following detailed consultation with the sector and without major difficulty or delays.  We have some good experience of working through the provision of centralised services as opposed to services in individual schools, as would have been the case at the time.  There are a number of benefits to centralising services.  The costs can be reduced and we can also have more consistent application of arrangements.<\/p><p>  Within the Department, we are seeking to develop a shared service expertise and we are working closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in that regard.  The Government, as a whole, is looking at increasingly putting in place shared services.

This arose particularly because of the requirement to provide a seat for every child with a place on a bus, which was an appropriate decision taken on safety grounds arising from the Kentstown crash.  Other factors also impacted to increase costs.  The Department has been endeavouring to reduce expenditure on school transport over the past five years, and we have put in place arrangements to bring about reductions in expenditure.  A value-for-money review on school transport was carried out, which fundamentally examined all aspects the scheme.  Arising from this the Government made a number of decisions to change some very inefficient rules of the school transport scheme, in particular the closed school rule for primary schools which in limited cases resulted in people being entitled to school transport to a school which was not their nearest school.  The catchment boundary rule meant we required boundary commissions to change a boundary between post-primary areas.  These rules have been changed so that transport for new starters is to their nearest school.  We have also pushed for efficiencies in expenditure on tendering for services.  We have pushed Bus &Eacute;ireann on costs and this has reduced expenditure on school transport.<\/p><p>  As part of the review we considered whether we should have school transport, and if so who should organise and provide it.  We worked through the various issues in the value for money report, which has been published.  We considered a number of possibilities on how to go forward and found we should have a central management body to organise the service, and that this body should be Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We also found that we should continue the existing arrangement we have with Bus &Eacute;ireann, which would outsource a high proportion of service delivery while provide a certain limited amount of service itself.  This was consistent with the policy approach which had led to increased outsourcing by Bus &Eacute;ireann of the provision of vehicles and transport generally over a period of time.<\/p><p>  Of the funding we provide directly to Bus &Eacute;ireann at present, approximately 65% is used to pay private contractors to provide services.  This is an increase from almost 50% ten years ago and outsourcing by Bus &Eacute;ireann has generally increased.  The key service Bus &Eacute;ireann provides for us is its national transport management expertise throughout the regions, with regard to route mapping and tendering for services.  This is the key relationship we have with Bus &Eacute;ireann and it underpins the arrangement we have.<\/p><p>  We pay Bus &Eacute;ireann on the basis of service delivery and the arrangement does not allow for profit to be taken by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is useful to consider what is meant by a layman's understanding of the word \"profit\".  In a private company, \"profit\" means something the shareholders can take out and use themselves as a return on their capital or something which can be re-invested.  This does not happen in a public company, where there is also the risk of cross-subsidisation of other activities.  We fund Bus &Eacute;ireann on a cost recovery basis and it has assured us it does not subsidise its other services from the money we pay it for school transport and nor does it take out money.  It has assured us it does not make a profit in any of the understood meanings of the word.  The belief that a profit may be made by Bus &Eacute;ireann may arise from the arrangement we have with it, whereby we pay it a management and administration charge which was traditionally 13% but which has been reduced in recent years and which is not directly assigned for direct costs in its published accounts.  When we engage with Bus &Eacute;ireann on what this 13% - which has been reduced  - is spent on, we are told it is spent on a range of items, including direct costs, indirect support and regional costs and property associated costs.  The is also the issue of the portion of contributions to other areas, such as capital investment in IT or general capital investment for garage equipment, which relates to the school transport service.  Deputy Donohoe raised this issue in the context of the court case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800010#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1362049800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Not particularly.

Given this level of penetration I am struck by the assurances Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; offers, which I take in good faith, that no transfer of funds to other parts of the operation is happening.  I seek to understand how this is verified.  I am aware of the court case, but the particular issue I want to understand is how can we verify this and assure ourselves it is the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800010#J00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362049800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>My understanding of the court case is that this was not a primary issue, so I do not think it has an immediate bearing on the court case.  The judgment delivered was that the operation of the scheme does not establish the existence of a contract and the judge was satisfied on the evidence that there was no contract within the meaning of the directive or regulations, and that the provisions of the remedies directive and remedies regulations do not apply.  The court's finding was that it was not directly related to profit.  We do not conduct a parallel accounting service in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It has its own accounting service which engages external auditors to sign off on the accounts.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has assured us it does not use the school transport allocation to subsidise other aspects of its business or take money from the allocation.  This has been signed off by Bus &Eacute;ireann and the external accountants.  The key issue is that over the past five years we have been pressing Bus &Eacute;ireann on reducing costs across the board.  As we have reduced spend the company has talked us through many of the efficiency measures it has undertaken and we have been working it through with them.  These efficiency measures have been across the board in the provision of all of its services.  We work very closely with Bus &Eacute;ireann and encourage it to reduce what we must pay it to operate services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1362049800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I am sure some of my colleagues will return to this point.

Arrangements are in place for the Minister to decide on the patronage of new primary and post-primary schools.  Our new schools establishment group invites applications from people in areas where new schools are to be located.  Decisions are made based on criteria.  Arising from these decisions, a variety of new patronage arrangements are emerging.  For example, Educate Together is involved in three emerging models at second level.  Under one model, Educate Together is to be the direct patron - the sole patron, as it were - of a school that will open in west Dublin in September 2014.  It is to be joint patron with County Louth Vocational Education Committee, VEC, of a new second level community school that is due to open in September 2014.  It  has a partnership in the patronage role of County Dublin VEC in the designated community college model of a school that is opening in Clonburris in Lucan, also in September 2014.  Educate Together is moving into that sector.<\/p><p>  Changes in the patronage of existing primary schools have been the subject of great debate.  We held a forum on patronage and so on.  Arising out of that process, we are in discussions with the Edmund Rice Schools Trust, ERST, concerning a school in Basin Lane, Dublin 8.  We have requested the Catholic Church authorities to consider divesting schools in five areas in which we have completed surveys.  We have completed 38 surveys, but we are still working through the findings.  We are likely to publish the findings within the next four to six weeks.<\/p><p>  We have not had a formal process to consider changes in patronage at post-primary level.  This is partly because the policy agenda is so busy.  Another reason is that the key driver of changes to primary schools was the number of people who were limited to English-medium or denominational education and desired to have multidenominational or Irish medium provision.  An exact parallel is not found in post-primary provision, as choices other than straight denominational options are in place, for example, in the VEC, community and comprehensive sectors.<\/p><p>  There have been patronage changes at post-primary level.  It is an issue that we are actively examining.  It is linked with a contentious issue, that of rationalisation and amalgamations.  We are finalising work on a value for money review of small primary schools, in which context the rationalisation issue arises.  We are considering an analysis to consider post-primary infrastructure and the potential for rationalisation, which may have implications for patronage.

Were there surplus funds in the scheme over many years or were there inefficiencies therein which caused money to be wasted?  As I understand the saving was made not because of the company's intervention but because the Department insisted on cost reductions.  The margin in transport is so small transport operators chase down costs every day.  When one considers that Bus &Eacute;ireann off-loaded two-thirds of this scheme to private operators and adds to this the reservations PwC had about its accounts in the first instance, one wonders if would not have been better off putting the scheme out to tender.  The only real way of finding out whether one is getting value for money or if a scheme is efficient or not is by going to tender.

We have been changing the rules arising from the value for money report, from which savings have been achieved.  As a result of the increase in student charges there has been a reduction in the number of students whose parents wish to avail of the saving.  There are a number of different factors arising which impacted.  This is not only a matter of our requiring Bus &Eacute;ireann to make savings.  We are working with it to ensure that the cost to the State in terms of school transport is as little as possible.  Given that two-thirds of the funding is already tendered for by Bus &Eacute;ireann to private contractors, it is not a case of an arrangement being in place with Bus &Eacute;ireann which would result in a great saving on the &euro;152 million.  Two thirds of that expenditure is already tendered for by Bus &Eacute;ireann to private contractors, ranging from drivers of taxis to bus companies with a number of routes.  As such, there is not a &euro;152 million potential tender.  <\/p><p>  We looked at these issues in detail in the VFM.  The Government bought into the approach that we would stick going forward for the mean time with Bus &Eacute;ireann as the central organiser and maximise, having regard to the need for Bus &Eacute;ireann to have some reserved fleet operations, the amount of outsourcing that Bus &Eacute;ireann undertook.  If we were to consider going to tender - we are not actively considering doing so now - we would most likely opt for two different approaches, namely, a management company which would tender and another form of tendering for the provision of school transport.  We see them as different functions.  All students apply to Bus &Eacute;ireann for school transport.  It has to examine all applications and make its decisions based on critical mass and the provision of services.  We are not obliged to go to tender on this.  We have consulted legally on the matter in terms of its being part of the court case and on the EU issues involved.  We are not obliged, given we have an arrangement in place, to go to tender.

We had a second national series of e-learning seminars that were envisaged and costed but they did not proceed.  We had lower than expected rental costs from the schools broadband programme due to the rolling out of new services under the second phase of contracts.  That is not the programme with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources but rather one for which we are tendering.  There was a &euro;1.1 million saving resulting from anticipated expenditure under the schools broadband capital programme.

There were reasons they had cash surpluses and those were worked through.  Arising from that and from some of the suggestions made in this forum, a budget decision was made, informed by the considerations in this forum, that we would make a one-off saving by having a cash balance, a delay in grant allocations in a particular year, to take account of the fact that VECs, on the one hand, and institutes of technology and universities, on the other, had some cash balances.  As much as 40% of funding for third level institutions does not come from the State and a cash balance can arise for various reasons.  We have changed some of our policies regarding tranche funding, payment of the free fees grant and so on.  Notwithstanding that, we also felt that there was a one-off saving which we are implementing this year having regard to the individual arrangements in place within each third level institution.  Universities may have slightly higher cash balances than the institutes of technologies.  We are working on that, and we have something similar, but not exactly the same, in place with the VECs.<\/p><p>  With regard to the specific question on the National Council for Special Education, there were unplanned staff changes and unpaid staff absences, including retirement, career breaks, unpaid maternity leave and sick leave, social welfare reimbursements and shorter working arrangements.

We have also been buying out some older prefabs.  Schools can be quite resistant to the buying out of older prefabs because we only buy ones we deem to be in good condition.  Schools feel that if we buy out a prefab, it means the school will not have a permanent solution for a while.  With the demographic increase, a lot of additional accommodation is being granted.

If we had additional funding available, it certainly is a way that money can be allocated effectively to help schools.<\/p><p>  It is part of the challenge we are facing with the demographic bulge, which is really challenging.  We have had to radically change how we do our business on the planning and building side to cope with it.  Going back to 2008, we initiated the RAPID school programme.  We were close to the edge in terms of having enough places for children in 2008.  Our five-year plan is very much focused on the demographic needs.  At second level there will be increases every year through to 2025 and 2026.  At primary school we only know going back five years but there is no sign of the birth rate decreasing.

It is hard to disagree with the statement that we need some investment, and some investment would be very helpful.  We have prioritised, within our investment, the replacement of prefabs.  That is how we would see that as being the best investment of the available funding.  We must be realistic about the capital budget available to us.  The Government has prioritised the delivery of school places and we are fortunate that is the case.  We do not have significant other funding available to us at the moment.<\/p><p>  That is one of the reasons we are maximising the use of public private partnerships with schools.  The choice of schools for public private partnerships often relates to their need for refurbishment.  The model is most effective and efficient when the school will be as full as possible when first opened.  With new schools being started off, such as a new post-primary school, for example, the public private partnership process involves a group of schools going through the process together.  If there are planning difficulties with one, the group of schools can be delayed, which can then have a knock-on effect on new schools being established.  We must be very careful about that.  In any of bundle of public private partnership projects, we tend not to bundle five new schools that need to open in 2017.  Instead, we consider where there might be one or two new schools but we might have a number of schools where there are amalgamations or replacement schools, and in this way there is a varying need of different types of schools.  We must be realistic that money is very tight on the capital side and we are doing our best to prioritise within that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800015#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1362052800,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Does Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; see a situation where there will be some sort of minor works scheme at some time in the future or is it the case that the Department is so stretched that it feels it is not be possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800015#O01000","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362052800,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Everything is always kept under review but the funding within the five year plan to 2016 is really tight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800015#O01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1362052800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I welcome the Secretary General and his colleagues.

The letters they received stated that moneys would be deducted from their salaries within two weeks.  The individuals in question have been in contact with the Department for the past two years questioning the rate they were being paid.  They were informed they were being paid the correct rate and have letters to that effect.  Many of them are part-time and under financial pressure.  This is a little like a person informing his bank manager that he is being paid the wrong rate of interest and being told it is the correct interest rate, only to have the rate increased 18 months later, with a view to securing a large sum that the customer does not have.  How did this situation arise?  Will Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; give a commitment to cease collecting arrears until there has been some interaction with the young teachers in question?

While there might be an internal review or internal appeal process, an appeals board was established on 8 September 2011.  It is chaired by Ms Maureen Waldron and is comprised of Mr. P&aacute;draic McNamara, Dr. Marie Clarke, Ms Rebecca Murphy, Ms Eithne Frost, Dr. Brenna Clarke and Professor Kevin Ryan.  This is the appeals board established to deal with appeals from all third level grant awarding authorities, with Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, being the main one.  Obviously, it deals with appeals in respect of applications to SUSI.  While I wish to go through the appeals process, this information was given to me in response to a parliamentary question two days ago, that is, on 26 February 2013.<\/p><p>  Much more importantly, on 7 February 2013, having asked the Minister for Education and Skills to provide the number of appeals to the student grant appeal board for the academic year, I received a reply stating the total number of appeals received and considered by 7 February was 89.  The numbers of decisions upheld and overturned were 54 and ten, respectively, while 23 had been referred back to the grant awarding authority and two had been referred back to the student for further information.  These figures pertain to the number of appeals that had been considered and 157 had been received in total.  It appears to me as though there is an internal system within SUSI which has dealt with 5,275 appeals to which the Secretary General referred a minute ago.  However, up to 7 February, the appeals board to which the Secretary General referred had received 157 applications, of which only 127 related to SUSI.

I refer to the 1,861 cases in which the appeals were not upheld.  Most people, when I raise the issue of this independent appeals board, the membership of which I have just read out, are not even aware of its existence.  It is not referred to in the system.  The fact that only approximately 100 appeals have gone to that independent appeals board shows there is a complete lack of awareness among the student population.  I am not just stating it shows it but am making this point categorically.  Journalists who deal with this area and even representatives of the Union of Students in Ireland were not aware of this separate independent appeals board chaired by Maureen Waldron.  As I noted, there are seven people on the board.  In his reply to my parliamentary question two days ago, the Minister stated \"The Appeals Board is fully independent in the performance of its functions\".  However, I also asked who carried out the administrative support for the appeals board and the last sentence in the Minister's reply was \"Administrative support to the Appeals Board is provided by my Department\".  Presumably the independent appeals board can only make decisions on the information provided to it but the only people providing information to it are departmental officials.  How can one claim this is an independent appeals board in the interests of students if the only information going to it comprises files from the Department's officials?  I do not accept its independence if the files being prepared for it are coming from within the Department.  That is not independence.<\/p><p>  I will go further.  Why has the Department constructed such a system this year in which applicants who came into the system since last May or whenever they began to apply last summer have no right whatsoever to go to the Ombudsman if they are unhappy with the operation of SUSI?  The Ombudsman's office has confirmed to me directly that she has no role or entitlement to consider this issue.  She will have an entitlement to deal with maladministration, unfair appeals or processing of applications for next year, that is, for those applications that will pertain to the academic year 2012-13.  The Secretary General should explain the reason the Department constructed this system for year one to exclude the right of students to go to the Ombudsman which is there for practically every other public body?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800022#V02500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362057000,"counter":468,"content":"<p>On the first issue, the Deputy obviously is correct.

The statutory appeals board is established under the Student Support Act and as for awareness of it, I will have to check the extent to which people who are refused an appeal within SUSI are formally informed this second process is in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800022#V02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1362057000,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Is it not now a bit late, three quarters of the way through the academic year, for the Secretary General to inquire whether students are informed of such a right or of the existence of an independent appeals board?  We are almost at the end of the process.  The Secretary General indicated that most of them have been dealt with and I accept that 55,000 out of 69,000 have been completed.  Moreover, some of them may have been merely speculative applications in which people sent in the forms.  As the Secretary General noted, thousands have not pursued their application when asked for further information and their completion may never come to pass.  As for talking about the awareness of this independent appeals board, it is proved by Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s observation that having nearly reached the end of the year, 2,000 people have been refused but only approximately 100 appeals have been lodged.<\/p><p>  On the operation of the aforementioned independent appeals board, it is funded by the Department of Education and Skills and I do not object to that.  The Minister confirmed that in the period between its establishment in October 2011 and November 2012, the board members were paid &euro;15,450 in allowances and &euro;6,591 in travel and subsistence at a total cost for the board of &euro;22,000, which I accept is a modest figure.  However, the Department is paying for that board, its departmental staff are providing its administrative support, students do not really know about it and the Secretary General is now going to inquire whether they are even informed about it.  The Department already has cut off their right to go to the Ombudsman by the manner in which it established SUSI at the outset.  They can go to the Ombudsman next year, in year two, if they are still around and have not been obliged to withdraw from school.<\/p><p>  However, the reply to the parliamentary question I tabled on 7 February 2013, only two weeks ago, indicated that at that stage, 62 appeals had been received and dealt with by the board, only four of which were overturned.  Out of the 2,000 people who were refused by the SUSI internal appeals system, very few knew about the existence of this board but only four people have had their decisions overturned by that independent board.  It appears to be simply rubber-stamping what is coming into it.<\/p> <p>Then it stated that a further 37 cases would be dealt with in the meeting on 13 February and a further 28 would be due for consideration on 12 March.<\/p><p> In the height of all of this, the board is meeting only once a month to consider appeals and students are dropping out of college because they are not getting their grants.  I have before me the timetable of the meetings of the board.  Students who do not make it in for the February meeting are told they must wait for a month.  Then it transpires only four out of 62 have been successful in this board.  In this case, it seems totally staked against the student.  Some 2,000 have been refused.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; does not even know whether the students are made aware of the appeals board.  Very few go to the board.  Of those who do, only four were successful up to February.  Now we find the Department had also cut off a citizen's right to go to the Ombudsman.  Whoever set up this system specifically excluded that.

Does a teacher who goes on maternity leave get maternity benefit or is there a recoupment from the Department of Social Protection?  Such teachers would be entitled to maternity benefit but if the Department continues to pay their salaries, does it get a recoupment from the Department of Social Protection?

I believe Deputy Dowds touched upon the costs and benefits of prefabs as opposed to permanent builds in schools.  In his opening statement Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; explained the capital resource challenges that exist within the Department.  I will use the specific example of Kilmacthomas national school in Waterford and will get into the national policy after that.  The school needs an extension and the Department insisted that it get quotes for the cost of buying two replacement prefabs.  Based on the preferred tender just received, buying the two prefabs and connecting them to the school's heating system would cost &euro;160,000, which is approximately 80% of the cost of a new build - the capital cost estimate for two permanent build classrooms is &euro;200,000.<\/p><p>  As Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; will be aware the prefabs have a book life of approximately ten years even though many of us have been in prefabs that are 20 or 25 years old and still in use.  I thought the Department had changed its policy direction on the issue.  It might be preferable to give the school the &euro;160,000 and let it raise additional money locally.  In the case of Kilmacthomas, the architect involved has said that the provision of two prefabs does not represent value for money in the medium or long term and recommends that the school seek to have the proposed prefabs funding reallocated towards a two-year permanent classroom extension and then try to raise the money locally.<\/p><p>  I will ask about the national policy and how it has evolved in recent years.  Kilmacthomas is a clear example of the cost-benefit question.  I want Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to respond specifically to the example I have raised and consider the option of building permanent classrooms in Kilmacthomas as opposed to providing new prefabs and all the financial issues that surround that school specifically.<\/p><p>  On the national issue, my information is that at the height of the boom the previous Government had a policy of renting prefabs in schools as we all know.  I believe 715 new rental contracts were agreed in 2007 alone.  The average rental cost of a standard 80 sq. m prefab classroom in 2008-09 was &euro;15,000 to &euro;16,000 per annum.  That was reduced by April 2012 to &euro;15,000.  The expenditure on rental accommodation, including prefabs, has gone from &euro;39 million in 2009 to &euro;29 million in 2012, a reduction of approximately &euro;10 million.  As of April 2012, some 580 schools were renting temporary accommodation.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to reduce the reliance on rented prefabs in schools.  Only 35 new primary school contracts were entered into in 2011 so we have seen the progression, but the example of Kilmacthomas begs the question of how much progression there has been in the case of a school that does not want to face the prospect of having prefabs for another 15 or 20 years.<\/p> <p>The difference between permanent build and renting is not great.  That is the basis of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013022800025#Y02200","speaker":"1091","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362059400,"counter":561,"content":"<p>In simple terms, what Deputy Deasy has outlined is inconsistent with the approach.

We are trying to reduce the number of prefabs in a number of ways.

The trend of going for prefabs has reduced significantly and schools are opting in the main for permanent build.  We have implemented to a certain extent a scheme to buy out some of the older prefabs which were in good condition.  We have spent &euro;35 million on a replacement-prefab scheme.  While we would like to do more, we have clearly established a trend wherein the numbers of prefabs being rented and total spend are being reduced.  That is not to say there are not occasions on which short-term renting is necessary.

I will start at the beginning.  Ireland held a referendum on whether to join the EU in 1972.  I remember it was the first time I had a vote and I voted &quot;No&quot;.  The world has changed, the facts have changed and I have changed.  The EU of farms and fish we joined grew into an amazing experiment and bit off more than its leaders could chew.  Now they are out of their depth and desperately trying to manage a creation they do not understand and an electorate that understands less.<\/p><p>  The economic crisis removed any semblance of anybody being in charge.  They say the Germans are excellent at creating a real situation to test a hypothesis.  To an extent, this is the laboratory we have been living in for the past five years.<\/p><p>  People remember where they were when JFK was shot.  Although I do not, I do recall the moment when Chancellor Merkel announced everyone would look after their own banks.  It meant solidarity, as a core principle of the EU, was at an end.  All those Structural Funds were fine but now we were all set adrift with our own little share of the euro in our fists.  The Germans bailed out their banks and we bailed out ours but we should not think for a moment that Germany has bought our line that we have been hard done by or that the construction of the euro was to blame.  They have not.  Let us reflect on the realities.  They said &quot;No&quot; to retrospective money for the &euro;32 billion we put in our banks, &quot;No&quot; to lengthening of maturities of bailout loans to the 45 years Greece has got, and &quot;No&quot; to OMT or cheap credit lines from the ESM without conditions.<\/p><p>  As the eurozone ship shudders, rudderless on the stormy sea, battered by markets and investors with their agendas, the only person with a vision for Europe and capable of implementing it is Angela Merkel.  She has had eight years to think about it and it has been forged in the heat of her battles with her parliament, her party, the opposition and her constitutional court.  This lady has a habit of doing what she says she will do and she says she will have treaty change after the German elections in September, after the European Parliament elections next May and in the run-up to David Cameron's promised referendum in 2015.  Her aim is to save Europe from Germany and Germany from Europe.  She knows, as do many of her parliamentarians, that it is not very democratic to have the Bundestag's budget committee deciding every cent that goes to another sovereign eurozone country.  Her constitutional court has told her that Ireland having roughly two MEPs for every one for Germany in the European Parliament means it is not a democratic body.  She does not want Germany to be the paymaster, or have to make up more rules as she goes along to keep us at bay.  There will not be full recapitalisation of banks by the ESM, perhaps for 20 years.  There will be a phasing in, but not the break between sovereign and banks courtesy of EU taxpayers' money that many dreamt of.  Bank deposit and resolution funds are in danger of being pushed off into the horizons of time.  Germany believes that if the EU is not responsible, then the EU should not be liable.  For the EU to be liable in the future requires deeper integration, with political and economic union in a federal EU, styled on Germany, the country that was never centralised but, like Europe, is made up of independent states and which will still retain much of that independence.<\/p><p>  Ireland will be an increasingly small voice in the new Europe.  The Irish have long known that if we are not strong, we must be clever.  Up to now that cleverness has been concentrated on big business and big money.  Like mercenaries, we hope to take part of the spoils.  We are not universally admired for this.  We are castigated for allowing companies use our tax system to evade tax while we look for cheap loans from the EU.  They wonder why we refuse to adopt the financial transactions tax, FTT, which would extend our tax on share dealings to derivatives.  They do not buy the job loss argument.<\/p><p>  Now with our economic miracle a thing of the past, our recklessness a given and our scrambling back up the credit rating ladder a wonder, we need to look at how we will exercise power in an EU that is hands-on with our budget.  We will be forced to change our business taxation system.  Members can read the OECD reports and other reports building the pressure as the IMF shies away from bailing out Cyprus and its money-laundering banks.<\/p><p>  As Ireland knows from its UN experience, power can come from having a principled stance on issues.  With the fabric of democracy in Europe now becoming an acute issue as a result of the crisis of political economy, as Italy has just illustrated, President Michael D. Higgins said in his recent speech at the Sorbonne that we must turn to critical thought if we are to be free to put our ethical stamp on society, place our economies within a frame of ethical culture and build an inclusive Europe.  He pointed out that Europe is facing a social, cultural and political crisis.  Politics risks losing its legitimacy among citizens if it diverts responsibility to unaccountable technocracy or the mysterious unaccountable marketplace.  In case members think our brilliant politician-academic is dreaming, here is another politician, Abraham Lincoln, in the midst of the war to end slavery: <blockquote>The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion.  As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew.  We must disenthral ourselves, and then we shall save our country.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Cahill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362060000,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I will look at five trends that seem to be most relevant to the future of Europe.  These are the rise of Germany, the marginalisation of Britain, the widening of the north-south gap, the widening of the EU legitimacy gap and the euro crisis.  The German question has been at the centre of European politics since Germany was reunified in the 1870s.  It went away for a long time in the post-Second World War period and it has now returned.  Germany has the largest economy in Europe and, although it has its problems, it is arguably the most fundamentally sound of the big G7 industrialised economies.  With the enlargement of the EU, its geographic centrality is more important than ever.  As the decades passed, the period of time when Germany did not conduct a normal foreign policy seems to have passed.  That is most noticeable in terms of the decline of the Franco-German relationship, which had given France a leveraged position in Europe.  The breakdown of the Franco-German relationship, particularly since the change of Government in Paris last year, is indicative of that very big change.  Many people are concerned that the rise of a dominant power will upset the balance of power in Europe.  It seems a bigger risk is not an over-assertive Germany but an under-assertive Germany and an unwillingness to provide the leadership its economic and political clout gives it.  A vacuum, in any situation, can cause or poses risks and dangers.<\/p><p>  Anyone who saw the Harris poll last week can see that it looks like the momentum in British public opinion towards moving away from Europe is irresistible.  There are deep historical reasons for the scepticism of the British public.  All opinion polls over a long time show levels of euroscepticism among the public are among the highest, if not the highest, recorded.<\/p> <p>Excluding a eurosceptic media, as someone who lived in Britain for ten years and as someone who has lived in five other European countries, the level of antipathy towards European integration in Britain is much higher and deeper.  The Murdoch press does not explain that.  It is something that goes much deeper historically.<\/p><p> Many people are of the view that it would be good to have a referendum debate.  The few pro-Europeans who are left feel it would be a good idea to have a referendum because it would allow pro-European forces to come out and have the debate and deal with the euroscepticism and misinformation that comes from that side.  I am not convinced by that argument.  The Conservative Party has almost no pro-Europeans left in it, the Labour Party does not really care about Europe anymore, the trade unions are less relevant and have never been particularly pro-European, the City is ambiguous, particularly in the context of banking union, and business is divided, with many small business people believing that whatever gains there are from trade integration are outweighed by the additional cost of red tape from Brussels.  It is not clear to me that elite opinion is in favour and the debate might turn out to push public opinion further down the eurosceptic route.<\/p><p> Mario Monti once said people in Europe have been too polite to each other.  That certainly strikes a chord with me, having lived in Brussels for a period.  People were afraid of being accused of labelling other people according to national stereotypes.  That often led to an unwillingness to be as frank with each other as might have been necessary.  That has changed.  The manner in which Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy smirked about Berlusconi when asked about him at a press conference seemed to be a clear indication that sort of politeness was finished and people were speaking more aggressively to each other. <\/p><p> The crisis has thrown up a huge number of problems, such as the difference in political capacity between the north and the south, particularly Greece, but also Italy to an extent.  There is a difference in policy priorities, vested interests are taken on differently and market liberalisation and economic performance are viewed differently.  One of the things that has not come out into the public domain from the economics profession is the concern that long-term economic growth in the developed world is grinding to a halt.  Rates of economic growth <i>per capita<\/i>in the last 50 years have slowed in most developed economies, to a halt in many cases, such as Portugal and Italy.  This opens a division between the north and south of Europe that is both political and economic, which adds further strains.<\/p><p> The legitimacy gap is also widening.  The Eurobarometer report asked people in different countries the extent to which they believe the EU is a good thing.  Comparing results in 2007 and 2012 for those who say it is good and those who say it is negative, in Ireland and Spain the net change has been -32 points, while in Portugal and Italy it has been -28 points, and in Greece -25 points, with an EU average in 2012 of only 31% of people believing the EU was a good thing.  Many observers point to the fact that national political systems have also registered declines in satisfaction among respondents in opinion polls and while that is true to an extent, voters have a chance to vote out their governments but no chance to vote out the European Commission or the ECB, so there is a major difference between the two.<\/p><p> The ECB is the only institution where there is a genuine democratic deficit.  Its independence goes so far that it is unaccountable.  It is nominally accountable to the European Parliament but the European Parliament cannot do anything in real terms, unlike Westminster and the Bank of England, for example, or Congress and the Federal Reserve.  The only way anything can change for the ECB is for an intergovernmental treaty to change its structures.  Given the difficulty of achieving that, it is not a realistic stick with which to hold the ECB accountable and that poses a risk in the long-term for the legitimacy of the Union.<\/p><p> The euro crisis has emphatically not gone away.  The ECB's outright monetary transactions programme that was announced six months ago has dealt with a serious problem of liquidity but it has not dealt with solvency issues.  We see nominal GDP in three of the southern European countries falling and debt levels rising so the debt dynamics are looking dangerous.  Italy's public debt is now likely to be around 130% of GDP when the general view is that above 90% affects economic performance and above 120% is dangerous.  It is now at 130% and rising, posing a real risk to the country's solvency.<\/p><p> Has enough been done to deal with that?  There has been some progress on banking union but no progress on fiscal union and no likelihood of any progress, so it is a matter of time before the crisis blows up again and we are back to square one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362060600,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear today.  As things change at European level, so must things change at the level of national parliaments.  We have had a plethora of changes as a result of the economic crisis we have gone through, with measures such as the six pack, the two pack, the fiscal rules, the European semester, budget co-ordination measures, and so on.  All of those necessitate a reform of governance of Irish EU affairs and in domestic Irish affairs, which are increasingly intertwined.  Countries that successfully adapt a new economic management system are more likely to prosper.  At the very least, they are more likely to be off the radar for investors worried about economic mismanagement.<\/p><p>  Being off the problem radar alone, however, should in no way be confused with success.  During the last decade, we spent most of the time as a blip on its counterpart, the success radar, hitting all EU targets used to measure economic performance in the single currency area in particular.  There was outrage here and abroad when the European Commission reprimanded us in a most gentle way for breaching the broad economic policy guidelines about ten years ago.  We could do no wrong it seemed, right up until the point where we blew up in the most spectacular fashion.  This was because we became victims of what might be called \"stealth failure\", something that sneaks up because we are not looking out for it and not prepared to deal with its consequences if it breaches our defences.  It is like the Germans with mad cow disease.  If there is no testing for a problem, it will not be found in the first place.<\/p><p>  The move to the single currency was a truly massive change but we responded with a minimal change to our institutional set-up to deal with it.  We are now scrambling at national and European level to catch up.  We also must undertake a lot of national changes.  We should not just implement the European changes.  We should be prepared to go well beyond the level of change required at European level.  We should be more proactive in adapting our institutions and governance, guided by strategies that are both offensive and defensive in their approach to dealing with the evolution of the European Union and our place in it.  I suggest as a philosophical starting point that Europe is something we make ourselves, not something that is done to us.  It is also far more important that we make changes in our governance here for our own sake, not just to be seen as the good boys in Europe.  We cannot afford another catastrophe like the one we have just experienced.<\/p><p>  When I talk about an offensive European policy, I do not mean going around offending people but of having a point of view and advancing it coherently over the long run.  We can do this already on narrow sectoral policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, or national economic priorities such as corporation tax.  Do we have a view to advance, however, on other issues, such as pan-continental macroeconomic policy, world trade policy, modernisation of the European Union itself or other international institutions?<\/p><p>  When I talk about defensive European policy, I mean being able to guard against the worst excesses of European policy and against our own internal failures, such as failures to implement or non-implementation - looking out for the stealth failures I mentioned.<\/p> <p>What I am referring to is best summed up in Dr. Eddie Molloy's phrase \"implementation deficit disorder\", which has caused many difficulties down the decades in the management of the State.  Defensive strategies are also required to guard against the negative perceptions of European Union membership.  The idea that Ireland is being bossed around and forced to do things is corrosive of support for the European Union.  Defensive strategies can help ensure that perception is minimised by ensuring we are not in a situation in which we can be bossed around in the first place.  However, in cases in which one is being bossed and booted around by other countries, one needs to be able to switch into an offensive strategy and go on the offence against it or even think about getting out altogether.<\/p><p> In terms of legislation, it is relatively easy to appear part of a winning coalition in the Council and in the Parliament but if one ends up through one's own stealth failure becoming a ward of the system then one has no one to blame but one's self.  We need to be hard-nosed in Ireland, particularly in our political and parliamentary system, and most especially about money in all its manifestations, protecting the wealth of the nation from all enemies, internal as well as external.<\/p><p> There are a number of strategies that might offer a quick fix in the short term and other medium and longer-term suggestions that might be useful to consider.  We should consider using MEPs to greater effect.  It is good to see a Member and a former Member of the European Parliament at the committee.  They are a great resource to have.  We have a small parliamentary and political set-up here.  Having elected Members in the European Parliament is a resource on which we should draw in a more integrated way.  They have the expertise and day-to-day knowledge of what is happening in the European Parliament.  It is good to gain visibility on issues earlier.  We also have the Lisbon treaty amendment, under which legislation is supposed to be sent to national parliaments as a first measure.  There is the potential to draw national parliaments much more closely into the European process.  We need to use those opportunities to get a better handle on what is happening and deal with it though the twin prisms of offensive and defensive strategies.  Another ally of the Parliament should be the Fiscal Council in helping to deepen one's understanding of and engagement with fiscal policy.  It could be seen as a useful harm reduction mechanism in its most simple form, but most usefully, if it is employed correctly, it can help in the process of hardening up the State when it comes to dealing with financial problems.  The idea is to protect the money and the citizens who own that money.<\/p><p> Perhaps a more medium-term suggestion is to make better use of the science and technology options assessment panel, STOA, in the European Parliament.  We are becoming increasingly aware of the need to have legislation dealing with fairly complex issues and it is useful to have a sounding board to test out technical issues and aspects.  It is quite expensive to build up that expertise, whereas it already exists in the European Parliament.  There may be some ways for Ireland to try to subcontract or piggyback on what the STOA group is doing that could be useful for parliamentarians in Ireland.  Ultimately, given the changes that have occurred and are continuing to occur and the level of complexity that is now evident, we must change the electoral system in order to give Deputies and Senators sufficient time to deal with the issues in a much deeper way.  Members do not have time to do what they need to do and the big impediment is the electoral system.  Until we change that we will be engaged in an uphill struggle to get on top of the issues that present themselves.<\/p><p> In summary, I believe offensive and defensive national strategies are needed for dealing with the development of the European Union and our ability to act tactically in support of strategic objectives.  One must be constantly vigilant against stealth failures.

Today, Ms Emer Costello, MEP, came to the Seanad, and Ms Phil Prendergast, MEP, Mr. Gay Mitchell, MEP, and Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, have all made presentations to the Seanad on what they are doing in Europe.  I agree with Mr. Whelan that we need to reform how we conduct business.  I have a major issue with regard to directives and regulations coming through without any real scrutiny.  This was brought home to me recently at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children during our discussion about a directive on medical devices.  It was about to get the rubber stamp from the committee when I asked if anybody had consulted the medical device companies.  It turned out there had been no consultation at national level with these companies, so the committee agreed to write a letter to the medical devices organisation to find out its attitude.  From my recollection of working at European level on directives and regulations, I know we have more than 90 permanent representatives who work in Brussels watching regulations and directives, but there is no feedback to local level in Ireland.  All of our permanent representatives have good expertise but there is no local input.  I agree there is a need for reform, but I am not sure whether this is what Mr. Whelan had in mind in his call for reform.<\/p><p>  I have a very strong view on the effective use of the Seanad.  This week only one Bill was discussed in the Seanad, while there is a significant body of regulations and directives coming from Europe.  I have made a proposal that we set aside two days per month to deal with EU regulation.  I know that among Members there is no great level of agreement on that suggestion.  Will Mr. Whelan comment on how he thinks the D&aacute;il and Seanad could work more effectively in dealing with EU directives and regulations?<\/p><p>  The second issue I wish to raise is the delay in implementing directives when they are passed.  Let me give the example of the cross-border health care directive, which was passed on 9 March 2011, following which we had 30 months in which to implement it.  Now, in 2013, we have only six months remaining in which to implement it.  Why do we always wait until the last minute to implement a directive and then find we are not prepared when we do try to implement it?<\/p> <p> The third issue is the lack of regulation that existed when we set up the monetary union.  There was also a degree of trust at European level with regard to how Ireland did its business.  The best example I can give is that of a German building company that came to Ireland on a &euro;10 million contract.  When &euro;1 million of work was done without anything being signed, I was asked in a private capacity to come in and sort out the mess.  I sorted out the mess by getting the &euro;1 million collected and getting all the contract documentation signed.  When I asked those involved why they had acted in this manner, they said they were told when they came to Ireland on the &euro;10 million contract that they should take everyone at their word.  That is an example of the degree of trust at European level towards Ireland.  There is an attitude that there was a lack of regulation, of supervision and of checks and balances in Ireland with regard to how we did our business.  Those things were also lacking at European level.  The European attitude was that everyone in Ireland should be taken at his or her word.  We are now paying the price for all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800005#D00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362061800,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their thoughtful presentation.  Our ongoing dialogue with people in their profession will help us in our work.  We often lose sight of the insight they can bring as we get tied up in the politics of these issues.  Are we expecting too much from Europe in the absence of deeper political integration?  I do not know whether that is necessarily a question the witnesses can answer directly.  I think the vision that existed at the start of the Union has been lost to some extent.  As this crisis has developed, individual member states have started to look to a more national platform.  I do not think the current architecture makes it possible for Europe to serve the limited role it has.  During this crisis, it has not been clear who is in charge.  When Germany and France have got together for their various meetings and presentations, it has undermined the Commission in a real way.  While the role of President Van Rompuy is defined, it is not really a leadership role or that of a pioneer who drives ahead.  In the absence of deeper political integration, perhaps we should consider what Mr. Whelan said about whether we need to examine our own system.  I hope he will expand a little on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800006#E00200","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362061800,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cahill, Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Whelan for their presentations.  Like Senator Burke, I have served as a Member of the Oireachtas and in Europe and have seen how things are done differently.  I would say the European model is extremely efficient.  In Europe, we do not have an Opposition that wants to screech down every proposal made by the Government.  We have a sort of consensus in terms of how we work in each group.  Our group is the second biggest group in the Parliament.  The group that Fine Gael belongs to is the biggest group.  We operate on the basis of proposals, amendments, consensus, agreement and legislation.  There is terrific oversight.<\/p><p>  I recently had an opportunity to address the Seanad as an MEP.  Every MEP has committees in Europe that are their main committees.  My main committees are the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee and the Internal Market and Consumer Affairs Committee, of which I am the only Irish member.  When I addressed the Seanad, I got some feedback on the committees I am on.  It would make terrific sense for upcoming legislation to be brought to the Seanad for additional oversight.  This use of the Seanad would enhance its reputation.  It would be good for the Seanad to have an opportunity to be addressed by somebody working in another parliament on an issue of relevance to Ireland.  Equally, it would be good to give those who will be affected by European legislation an opportunity to address this House or another house.  We need a process of joined-up thinking whereby the outcomes have a determination and there is agreement through the different parliamentary groups.  We work on something similar on a smaller scale in the European Parliament system, which works well.<\/p><p>  I would like to comment on how the UK is behaving.  My view, which is based on what I have been told, is that UK MEPs do not work on the committees or do the job of MEPs.  They are masters at exploiting any opportunity to take the microphone in the hemicycle during the plenary week, on which all of our work is focused.  They make their political statements and avail of the opportunity to get wide coverage.  The grunt work is done in the background by other MEPs.  There is always a subliminal level on which people perceive things.  One can be a sceptical person and have validity for being a sceptic, or one can be a person who works to contribute in a real way to what goes on in the Parliament.  To put it differently, one can do the grunt work or one can focus on the opportunity for media exposure or even media exploitation.  We need to have a balanced view of this.  I think England is very important to us and I think we have a very good relationship, but that is just me.<\/p><p>  We will vote on the multi-annual financial framework next month.  Forty years on, Ireland is still a net recipient of the budget.  I think we will contribute &euro;10 billion and receive &euro;12 billion.  The renegotiation of the Common Agricultural Policy is hugely important, of course.  I absolutely agree with Mr. Whelan's point that MEPs are under-used as a resource.  I welcome the opportunity that has been presented to us by the decision to hold these meetings on Thursdays once more.  Our week in Europe is heavily focused on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  It makes sense, from an MEP's perspective, for the committee to meet on Thursdays.  I appreciate that Friday sittings do not suit everybody.  I know we are in straitened times.  Perhaps the decision to allow MEPs to address the Seanad will start something that leads to our having an important and useful role in the Oireachtas.  That should be evaluated and we should know what the outcome is.  I am delighted to have been here today to hear the delegates' presentations.  I thank the committee for giving me an opportunity to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil Prendergast, MEP"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362061800,"counter":626,"content":"<p>It is interesting that the Chairman mentioned debts.  Two or three days ago, I received a document of 18 or 20 pages from the largest trade union federation in Germany.  I thought it was interesting that it was called \"A Marshall Plan for Europe\".  The people of Germany may or may not remember that loan, but that is beside the point.  We think things work on the basis of \"I am good to you, so therefore you owe me one\".  They do not think like that.  They think very much along the lines of \"Right is right and wrong is wrong\".  They think that a person who incurred a silly debt should pay it - that a person who does something wrong should suffer - and that is it.  They are quite unsentimental about this and do not offer any apologies for it.  Why would they?<\/p><p>  It was interesting to hear Senator Burke speaking about the way certain things are treated.  They think we are all grown up and they expect us to behave as though we are all grown up.  We sometimes think we are grown up and we sometimes think we are not.  We have to get our act together.  It is all very nice to be the little pet in the class - to think the crumbs are just fine - but that is no longer where it is at.  The EU has outgrown its incarnation as a lovely thing that encouraged us all to dance in the meadows under the summer sun.  It has got serious now.  It is a big animal.  What we do affects it and what it does affects us.  We are all \"us\".  We need to stop thinking about it as we used to.  It is here, it is now and it is our reality.  In the future, we will look back on this as our history.<\/p><p>  Senator Burke spoke about legislation.  It was well signalled in the run-up to the Lisbon treaty that it would all be very fine for member states to get their wish and have everything referred to them, as long as they had an idea of the amount of work that would be involved and the number of people who would be required to do it.<\/p> <p>I remember reading a figure estimating the number of additional staff the Oireachtas would need to deal with European legislation and it is clear that these additional staff have not been provided.  They find it very difficult to do much of this work in Brussels, not to speak of national parliaments.  One must secure additional resources before proceeding with this suggestion.  Mr. Whelan spoke of changing systems.  Without more resources, the Oireachtas would end up making amendments to legislation on the basis of information provided by lobby groups.  <\/p><p> We do not expect too much.  On the contrary, we do not expect enough of ourselves.  We are used to being the cute hoor in the pack and that position does not wash as it is not culturally interchangeable.  When tourists take a bus and a fellow on the bus makes jokes, they do not understand his accent much of the time, which is lucky.  This may seem grand but it is not grand in the real world where 50% of the country's young people are unemployed and the unemployment figure is being kept at an artificial level through a greater number of retirements and emigration by young people.  Someone needs to get serious about this issue.  Other countries are as serious about their economies as we are about our economy. <\/p><p> On the question of whether no one is in charge, that is simply not the case.  The markets have been in charge for some time.  Nobody was prepared for this because everybody cheated when the euro was being created.  We heard about the independence of the European Central Bank.  That was what the Germans, who were giving up the Deutsche mark, wanted at the time and that was what they got.  It was left open and, as the market system developed, it has hijacked our systems.  This is what we are looking at today and it is the reason I am saying we do not have power.  The only thing we can have is some sort of moral power, but we do not have any reason to claim that.  We must find and build on such a moral power. <\/p><p> The European Parliament works well.  Members should watch the changes that take place in future because there will be a treaty change which will give rise to a new European Union.  It will not be the experimental model we have had thus far but one that is fixed.  We must be heavily involved in drawing it up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800006#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Cahill","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362062400,"counter":628,"content":"<p>On the question as to what could be done to convince British eurosceptics, the short answer is \"Nothing\".  As to whether we expect too much, this is one of the things that has been very surprising over the course of the crisis.  Despite being in an integrated Europe for half a century, the incapacity of people to put themselves in the position of others has been striking.  The Germans blame the Greeks and vice versa.  This willingness to blame others and downplay one's own culpability has been a marked feature of the crisis.  To give an example from the Irish case, the dogs in the street know the banking crisis has cost the State &euro;65 billion.  How many times has anybody asked how much of this sum was imposed by European institutions?  This is a crucial question in terms of how much we would be entitled to recover.  If one believes a large part of this cost was imposed on us, one should put a number on it.  From everything I understand about the chronology of events leading to Ireland's assuming these debts, the vast majority of this was done as a result of decisions taken in this country by a democratically elected Government on the basis of what it considered to be the interests of Irish citizens.  We are not asking that question, however, and there is a general view that others in Europe imposed this debt on us, which is simply not the case.<\/p><p>  On the issue of national parliaments having a role in legislation, let me strike a slightly contrarian note.  I agree with Phil Prendergast, MEP, that the European Parliament is a reasonably good parliament.  It is well designed and functions well, and its committee system in particular is very impressive.  Given that there are 27 member states, if it came to a point at which every national parliament had a role in the legislation that the principle of subsidiarity dictates should be enacted by the European Parliament, this would significantly increase complexity in the system.  With what problem are we dealing?  Senator Colm Burke raised this issue in respect of medical devices.  How much EU-level legislation has turned out to be damaging for this country?  I do not believe it has been a significant amount, which suggests that the way the European Parliament works and the system whereby permanent representations in Brussels maintain oversight of the legislative process have worked well in protecting national interests.  What would be the effect of giving national parliaments a greater role?  Given that we do not have a major problem, bringing national parliaments into the legislative process to any significant extent would increase complexity in the system and slow down the law-making process at European level.  This could create more problems than it solves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362062400,"counter":629,"content":"<p>With regard to the question of institutional change, I will first address the points raised by Deputy Dooley about who is in charge of the European Union and the growing tendency of people to look to national leaderships and setups.  This trend was inevitable because the system has designed it in that way - it is the default position.  The treaties, which were agreed and in some member states approved in referendums established the primacy of national governments in all matters.  This means that when the system comes under stress, people will look to their national leaders, given that national leaders have assigned to themselves the key role in driving the European Union.  The leaders are the members of the European Council and the national systems that back them up.  Until that system changes, we will be stuck with it.  Given that constraint or reality, we need to do what is best for us within that system.  That is the reason I spoke of having a defensive outlook, hardening up the State and getting tougher across every aspect of dealing with the State.<\/p><p>  Senator Colm Burke's suggestion regarding the role of the Seanad in dealing with European affairs appears to be a good use of the resource that the Seanad represents.  In Britain, the House of Lords committee dealing with European Union affairs does excellent work and is one of the best resources available for those who want to find out about developments in the European Union.  One can read many of its reports to find out about the EU.  I presume upper houses in other parliaments are also doing good work in this area.<\/p><p>  It is good that Members of the European Parliament are addressing the Seanad.  There is significant scope for the Upper House to develop as a type of European Union clearing house.  This would not necessarily add additional complexity to the system, as Mr. O'Brien pointed out, if it acted as an early warning radar - I am obsessed with radars - picking up issues quickly before they became problems.  While most of the legislation is not a problem, occasionally something may slip through.  The Oireachtas must try to feed into its offensive system to try to get things done when this occurs.  The faster and more efficiently we do this, the better.  I recall, however, that it is Fine Gael policy and possibly Government policy to abolish the Seanad as part of its institutional reform programme.  The only element of the reform of which I am aware is the proposal to abolish the Seanad.  <\/p><p>  This leads us to the issue of electoral change, which is a vast area.  Members will be familiar with the background and history of the issue.  The use of single transferable votes in multi-member constituencies is a perverse system.  It is nuts, and it wastes too much time.  However, when one suggests abolishing it one is immediately accused of seeking to abolish proportional representation.  That is not the case.  As members are aware, the system in place here is a very strange and curious version of proportional representation, one that is used only in national elections in Ireland, Malta and the Australian Senate.<\/p> <p>Members are all painfully aware that it wastes too much time.  Members of the Oireachtas spend far too much time campaigning for elections and not enough time in the House dealing with the kinds of issue they were elected to deal with.  I was going to say it is a luxury we cannot afford, but it is not a luxury.  Members suffer under this so-called luxury.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800007#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Whelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362063000,"counter":631,"content":"<p>Bring it on, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800008#G00200","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362063000,"counter":632,"content":"<p>The committee understands what I am driving at.

For many decades, there has been discussion about a variation on the German system in which the House is split into two halves as a possible way of getting at least a cadre of people who would have a bit more time away from the constituencies, but that is something Members can sort out among themselves fairly quickly and easily.  I appeal to them to do it quickly because it is the key problem and will become a catalyst for addressing a whole lot of other structural changes that need to be done in this State but will only be done if the political system has the time to devote to them.  That is one aspect of the structural change that should be driven by the crisis we are in now.

The largest democracy in the world, India, used electronic voting and the country is still afloat and growing.  Here, we threw out our electronic voting machines.  As a candidate involved in the longest count in the country, I know that even our counting process is out of date.  That aside, if we believed the polls, Fianna F&aacute;il would be back in power at the next election, which begs the question whether political reform or institutional reform is more important for us.  I found the three contributions fascinating and challenging.  We are in the process of serious discussion on the future of Europe, but we have seen the result of the Italian election, in which a comedian won 40% or so of the vote.  Someone said Irish political comedians were already elected here to Parliament, and we gave a lead to the Italians.  This is extremely worrying.  <\/p><p>  Ms Cahill referred to the discussion on fisheries and agriculture 40 years ago and said she was a eurosceptic in those days.  I am not quite sure how to take her contribution, and whether it was deliberately provocative and challenging or she believes she has been vindicated and we should have stayed out of Europe 40 years ago.  However, we are where we are and as parliamentarians we must address what is a very complex issue.<\/p><p>  On the question of Britain, its proposed in-or-out referendum is not cast in stone in the sense that there are so many other conditions that must apply.  First, they must win an overall majority and not have a part that is more pro-Europe.  It is also interesting that, as I understand it, almost all chambers of commerce and commercial and industrial sectors in Britain are opposed to a referendum.  The role of economics in the debate will be very important.  We know England has its eurosceptics and perhaps Ms Cahill is a eurosceptic, but I am not too depressed about what might happen in England.<\/p><p>  Ms Cahill says we are where we are and she voted &quot;No&quot;.  Some people say 1916 was wrong and 1922 was a failure and that the European Union will prove to be a failure if we carry along the logic of the historical path Ireland has taken.  In ten years or 20 years' time we may see some people's prophecies vindicated in the history books.  She mentioned that we were in a laboratory situation last February, and I think she was referring to the fiscal aspect of things.  We were supposed to be talking about democratic accountability and the relationship between Europe, the Parliament and the people.<\/p><p>  I am a parliamentarian who is brand new to this committee and to the issues being raised, apart from what I read in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> and occasionally the <i>Irish Examiner.<\/i>  In a sense, the Irish people, because of our constitutional obligation to present them with referendums on a repetitive basis, may be more in tune with the situation.  Perhaps it is similar to the abortion issue - we now know about more parts of women's bodies than we dreamt existed as kids.  However, because of the debate on abortion, we are all clear on the issue.  Perhaps Irish people, because of the importance of the referendums and treaties they must confront, have gone beyond our counterparts in Great Britain.<\/p><p>  I have a question for Ms Cahill that I hope will help crystallise my thinking.  I am on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, which deals with trade issues and engages in debate about the BRIC countries.  Is it possible that the result of the competitiveness of capitalism is that the axis of power is shifting away from Europe to China and Asia and that the demographics of this European Union are inferior in comparison?  Europe's is an aging population.  Could it be that the world is changing to a greater extent because of capital concentrations in other regions and that this will give rise to serious competitive issues for us down the line?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800008#G00400","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1362063000,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and commend him on inviting our guests.

I compliment each of our guests on their generally constructive approach to reporting over the years and on their comments, which, unlike those of many other commentators, do not adopt the approach of misery, deprivation and destruction.<\/p><p>  Ms Cahill mentioned the word \"vision\" several times.  Vision is hugely important.  As we have discussed on many occasions, the vision for Europe must be reaffirmed.  However, we are not doing that either individually or collectively.  She mentioned she did not remember when JFK was shot, but I do, and I also remember ration books and the stand-off at Dien Bien Phu.  At that time, there were pressing issues that helped concentrate the minds of the people, politicians and the voting public in a way they have not been concentrated since.  That is the reason the founding fathers of Europe looked at the map before them and from the ashes that lay around them found the need to do something.  I remember when I was a young Member I visited the European institutions and met people such as Pierre Pflimlin, Simone Veil, Egon Klepsch and many others who were totally committed to the vision of keeping Europe together and worked for a Europe that would bring the people together under one umbrella.<\/p><p>  Over the years, things have changed and various national parliaments have decided to be selective in how they support the European concept.  We, because we were a neutral country, stood aloof in the area of defence and security, for example.  There were compelling reasons for that.  However, people ask questions when one does something like that.  They ask whether we want the support of the security, but not the responsibility.  That question arose, but our view was accepted and we managed to get by.  An interesting reference can be made to Abraham Lincoln and Michael D. Higgins, both of whom come to the same conclusion.<\/p> <p>Interestingly enough, though, the American Civil War was not about abolishing slavery.  It was a war to stop the union from breaking up and to halt various economic tendencies that were emerging at that time.  The war was going against Abraham Lincoln.  He was being beaten, and he played the trump card of the abolition of slavery.  It was a great move, a political move that worked.  It reintroduced a vision and gave people something to fight for and something to die for.  It was an appalling war, with massive bloodshed and loss of life, similar to the Second World War in Europe.  That vision is what prompted the founding fathers of the European Union, in my opinion.  <\/p><p> Let us examine the concept of each member state having its own commissioner, with which I never agreed.  It individualised the extent to which the commissioners would operate in the future and it also reflected the thinking in the parliaments of the member states.  I felt, in the context of the original vision, that it would be more appropriate to presume that each commissioner, wherever he or she was from, would be recognised as a commissioner representing all of the people of Europe, but that vision was set to one side.  It was set to one side not because the commissioners did anything wrong but because people thought there was a better way.<\/p><p> We need a reaffirmation of the vision.  I also believe that the European Union, in fiscal, monetary and economic terms, is doomed until such time as the single currency is adopted by all.  It will not work until that happens.  I do not accept the notion that the euro was responsible for our problems.  If there was a multiplicity of currencies in the United States in the last ten years, would that country have worked?  It certainly would not have worked.  What always happens in such situations is that the currencies on the fringe take advantage of the main currency and plan their economies accordingly.  It does not work.  My mother was in the United States in the 1920s and the 1930s, which was a very thought-provoking time.  The events that have taken place in recent years in Europe are very similar to what happened then in the US.  <\/p><p> On the issue of electoral reform and democracy, when things go wrong, we invariably find someone to blame.  After the roaring twenties came the hungry thirties in Europe and every politician looked around for somebody or something to blame.  On the back of that, electoral reform was introduced, and what a reform that was. One of the first reforms that took place was in Germany, where the electoral system was manicured to accommodate the needs of the people at the time, notwithstanding the fact that there were very compelling economic reasons for deciding to do something different.  It was a disaster, as we now know, and I await convincing that it was anything other than a disaster.<\/p><p> I do not think we spend too much time on electioneering.  We need to be in contact with our public.  Ironically, all of these systems have been in operation in other European countries for the last 25 or 30 years.  There are non-political experts serving as ministers in the governments of several member states, yet still the problems exist.  We need to reaffirm our vision.  The member state parliamentarians must take ownership of the European project.  We had a strong delegation from the European affairs committee of the Swedish Parliament here last week.  They have a veto over the decisions of their ministers at European Council meetings.  When asked whom they represent when they instruct their ministers to take decisions at the European Council, they all looked at each other.  I would have liked to think that they instruct their ministers to take decisions in the interests of the European Union as a whole, but I am not convinced.  Each member state must decide to take ownership of the European project.  We need to understand our German, Italian and French colleagues and they need to understand us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800008#G00500","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362063600,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and apologise for my late arrival, which meant I missed Ms Cahill's  contribution.

As a Government Deputy I hear that a lot, and at times no amount of explaining can convince people.

The water directive, for example, was issued in 1975 but was only enacted here in 2012.  There are many regulations in place that have not been implemented yet and when matters come to a head, people feel the regulations are unfair.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Brien made some very sobering comments about the eurozone crisis coming back to haunt us, and I ask for the views of Mr. Whelan and Ms Cahill on that point.  Mr. O'Brien also made reference to the UK's membership of the EU and spoke about small businesses in Britain complaining about the issue of red tape.  Have surveys been conducted in this regard?  Businesses will always cite red tape as an issue.  Is the issue red tape at a European level or is it British red tape?  Has the issue been delved into deeply?  People will often blame the EU without being able to specify the exact problem.  Mr. O'Brien also mentioned that the City of London would be, at best, ambiguous regarding any future proposals on EU membership.  The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, both commented on the possibility of Britains challenging the recent EU agreement to slash bankers' bonuses.  Mr. Johnson called it a \"deluded\" measure and Mr. Cameron called for flexible arrangements because the deal as it stood could be a \"hammer blow\" to the City of London.  There is a general perception in Europe that we need to do something about bankers' bonuses, but the City of London is also hugely important.  How will that play out in terms of a referendum?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800009#H00200","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1362063600,"counter":637,"content":"<p>We have limited time remaining.

How it affects the politics of the country depends on how we, and particularly politicians, react to the aftermath of the crisis and our approach to dealing with that aftermath.  We could have a situation in which the country becomes rapidly eurosceptic, with the perception that Europe is something that is done to people, not something they invent as part of their daily lives.  If that gains traction here, we will see a growing negative attitude towards the European Union.  On the other hand, we could treat the crisis as an opportunity and a chance to get things done here and change the way we deal with the European Union and with our own internal issues.   We could try to look for a benign outcome whereby people come to see the crisis as a useful turning point, albeit an expensive and painful one, out of which came something useful and beneficial to the country in terms of governance and the way things are run, not just at national political level but at all levels of society here, including in private businesses.<\/p> <p>Undoubtedly, there will be a residue from this eurozone crisis and it will continue to exist for many decades, in the same way that the 1930s economic crisis has left a long-lasting residue, one that exists to this day in terms of policies and policymaking in society.<\/p><p> Deputy Durkan made a point about the crisis affecting all states and that it was not only us and our electoral system that might have been a problem.  That is true, it affected all states.  What has become known as the euro crisis has, to a greater or lesser extent, affected the 17 countries that use the euro.  The recession that followed from the credit crisis of 2007 has affected virtually every country in the western world.  However, I challenge the committee members to look around and find me another country that has had a bank bust which cost 40% of GDP.  They will not find one because such a country does not exist anywhere outside of Ireland.  That was a problem that was allowed to blow up here because credit growth was running at 30% a year in an economy growing at 8%.  That was a red light flashing that should have been picked up within our system but it was not, and that is our problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800009#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Whelan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362064200,"counter":640,"content":"<p>It should have been picked up at ECB level as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800010#J00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362064200,"counter":641,"content":"<p>Yes, but we have our own bank, financial regulator, finance committee and financial journalists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Whelan"},{"type":"speech","time":1362064200,"counter":642,"content":"<p>We had representation at ECB level as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800010#J00400","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362064200,"counter":643,"content":"<p>Yes, we did, but in the first instance we had and we still have control over our own economic affairs and the behaviour of our own banks and we must take responsibility for our own affairs.

Democratic accountability was referred to.  This is something politicians invented to try to explain to themselves what the hell was going wrong because they did not understand.  I suspect they did not understand representative democracy either.  How far down the line does one go?  The Taoiseach is not directly elected by the people but he is still considered to be democratically elected.  He is elected by the people we elect but it is much the same in Europe.  The Commission is highly politicised and one cannot do anything about that.  Whether there are six or 26 members, it is highly politicised and unless one invents a whole new system, which is not going to happen, that is the way the cookie crumbles.  That is why we need some other form of leverage.  We will never have the leverage of a big country.  If one wants to have such leverage one should go to live in Germany and then one would have it.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to vision.  I am pleased the committee picked up on that because no one ever picks up on it, but I believe it is food and drink to Irish people.  For some reason, perhaps because there is only 14% of women representing us, this gets lost.  People think it is some type of sissy thing that we cannot afford but that is so stupid.  It is what we are, it is our identity.  We cannot go back to the vision for Europe after the war.  These are different times and no one remembers it.  In the winter one cannot recall what the sun feels like and in peacetime one cannot remember what war feels like.<\/p><p>  This has to do with identity as well.  We have lost our identity, partly because politicians have forgotten what they are and who they are.  They need to make up their minds.  Are they here to service the princes of capitalism or the citizens?  There is no point in telling me that a rising tide lifts all ships.  That is rubbish and we know that it does not.  Politicians need to make up their minds about that.  They have made up their mind in London.  Britain has decided to serve the square mile around the city of London and no one else seems to be paid any attention.  That is the position.<\/p><p>  Is the EU crisis deepening?  Yes, of course.  It will not get any better.  Poverty levels are going up no matter which way one looks at them.  One need only look across the board to see how one country compares to another to see that it makes no sense.  If one is in a downward spiral then one is in a downward spiral and what is bad now will get worse.  However, this is understood by Angela Merkel, for example, who realises that the only way out of this is to get in deeper.  This means deeper integration, deeper economic integration and above all deeper political integration.  We cannot resolve our economic difficulties within the eurozone without deeper political integration.  For the Germans and many other northerners it is about trusting and understanding us.  Senator Burke referred to the fact that they take us at our word.  They do not any more but they did once.  It is about us developing a new persona.<\/p><p>  I am unsure what it was about but I remember something happening at the UN when I was a child.  The committee members may remember it as well.  An Irish person stood up at the UN and the whole world went mad and thought we were wonderful.  Guess what?  We thought we were wonderful.  We found an identity by being the honest broker and by not being afraid to be the party on the margins taking an ethical stand and insisting on it.  This is where we must go back to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800010#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Cahill"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362064200,"counter":647,"content":"<p>Deputy Byrne remarked that there are many uncertainties with regard to the United Kingdom issue and I agree with that fully.

If that occurs then almost certainly a referendum will go ahead.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to hard survey data on businesses and what they believe but none come to mind.  Necessarily I can only discuss this impressionistically but let us consider an organisation such as the UK Institute of Directors.  It tends to be more eurosceptic than the CBI, which is more akin to IBEC here.  There are many individual business people who fund the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP, and who are vociferous in the view that Europe is the source of red tape.<\/p><p>  One way of measuring that red tape is to look around Europe.  We all have the same Single Market legislation but if we examine indices of competitiveness or economic freedom, there is considerable variety.  If some countries are more competitive than others with the same legislation, then surely that legislation is not so terrible that it erodes competitiveness.  Much has to do with how EU level legislation is put into force domestically and the domestic regulation and frameworks that have nothing to do with Europe.  The notion that Europe causes a vast amount of anti-competitiveness does not stack up because some of the most competitive countries in the world are in Europe.<\/p><p>  The issue of referendums was raised and in particular the question of whether we are better informed than the average citizen because we have had so many referendums.  There is a biannual poll, the Eurobaromter, which asks people throughout Europe how much they know about Europe.  We do not come out of it any better than others and this suggests that despite all the referendums, we generate more heat than light in referendums on EU matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800010#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1362064200,"counter":648,"content":"<p>During the referendum on the fiscal treaty last time around, people were being attacked even though they voted for the fiscal treaty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013022800010#J01000","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362064200,"counter":649,"content":"<p>It was 11 pages long but how many people read it?

This significant level of investment will address critical infrastructure deficits, aid economic growth and job creation and provide much-needed social infrastructure.  Being conscious of the significant contribution capital savings have made to fiscal consolidation in recent years, I was determined that the capital allocation for 2013 would be maintained and would not be subject to further cuts when framing this year's budget.  The overall capital budget for 2013 is &euro;3.4 billion and is focussed on the sectors prioritised in the 2011 capital review, namely, health, education and jobs.<\/p><p>  In July 2012, I announced a new Government stimulus initiative amounting to a package of &euro;2.25 billion aimed at leveraging funding to support a new public private partnership programme of projects in key areas of infrastructure.  Work on the initiative is being advanced by officials of my Department along with colleagues in the Department of Finance, the National Development Finance Agency and the relevant line Departments.<\/p><p>  The ministerial order before the committee is a technical instrument.  Its purpose is to allow the D&aacute;il to formally approve the expenditure by Departments and agencies in the current financial year of capital moneys carried over from last year.  The capital carryover facility forms an integral part of the five-year rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in 2004.  The multi-annual system is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management by Departments and agencies of capital programmes and projects.  It recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning and profiling of capital expenditure and acknowledges that, for a myriad of reasons, capital projects may be subject to delays.  The carryover facility allows for unspent moneys which would have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned, under the annual system of allocating capital, to be made available for spending on programme priorities in the subsequent year.  We are all familiar with cases where people have capital to spend and rather than surrender it the moneys were spent on things that were not priorities so it is important that normal planning would apply. <\/p><p>  The introduction of the multi-annual capital investment system has been a major positive factor in the roll-out of the capital programme.  It will ensure that resources that would otherwise have been surrendered to the Exchequer are now available for spending in Departments in the following years.  The multi-annual capital system has also given greater medium term financial security to Departments and implementing agencies.  This in turn has facilitated better medium term planning of programmes and projects.  It has also helped to eliminate the potential for wasteful spending on non-essential works in order to ensure that full capital allocations were used up.  <\/p><p>  I am sure that we are all familiar with the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866.  The legislation generally requires the surrender of unspent Exchequer moneys to the Central Fund at the end of each financial year.  Section 91 of the Finance Act 2004 gives legal effect to capital carryover and allows the carryover of unspent voted Exchequer capital to the following year of up to 10% of capital by Vote, by deferring the surrender requirement, subject to certain conditions.  Among those conditions are that the amounts of capital carried over by Vote be specified in the annual Appropriation Act of the year from which the carryover is proposed. The actual decision in principle on the amounts of carryover by Vote are therefore determined in the Appropriation Act.  The D&aacute;il again has the opportunity to endorse the amounts in its decision on the revised Estimates volume which shows the capital carry over amounts separately in the relevant Votes.<\/p><p>  The carryover amounts provided for in the Appropriation Act are required to be confirmed in an order to be made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform by 31 March of the following year, after approval of the order by the D&aacute;il, to allow expenditure to take place.  The order sets out the amounts by subhead consistent with the amount by Vote specified in the Appropriation Act.  Capital carryover in a Vote does not have to be spent on the same subhead or programme where the saving occurred.  It may be spent on a different programme depending on progress and priorities.<\/p><p>  The committee will be aware that the old annual Estimates process is being replaced with a modern, multi-annual framework.  The new framework will allow for full transparency about the allocations available to each Department over the coming three-year period.  It will open the way for structural, medium-term planning and prioritisation within each area across all programmes with full public input and parliamentary oversight.  It will also make it easier to assess exactly what Departments have achieved, and what they aim to achieve, with the public funds that are granted to them by the D&aacute;il.  It is important that the money is used and that we see an outcome for the money. <\/p> <p>It is not enough to know how much Departments are spending the money; we want to see the outcomes.  The Government is determined that every area of the public service should be accountable for performance and results.  This will apply to Ministers and their Departments, as well as to all offices and agencies.  The 2013 draft order sets out the subheads or programmes under which Departments and agencies propose to spend in 2013 the capital carryover amounts specified by Vote in the Appropriation Act 2012.  The total amount proposed in the draft order for 2013 is &euro;107.237 million, which amounts to 2.8% of the 2012 forecast outturn.<\/p><p> The total 2013 gross Exchequer capital provision allocated in budget 2013 amounts to &euro;3.435 billion.  The capital carryover of &euro;107.237 million will bring the total Exchequer capital available for spending in 2013 to &euro;3.542 billion.  The main priority areas for spending of the capital carryover of &euro;107.237 million are as follows.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is allocated &euro;43 million in total, with &euro;9 million for the Leader rural development programme to meet demand from local Leader action groups; &euro;12 million to support the continued implementation of the mortgage to rent scheme and to provide support for the voluntary and co-operative housing sector; &euro;10 million for local authority housing provision; &euro;10 million for landfill remediation to meet outstanding deliverables following an ECJ judgment; and &euro;2 million to enhance investment in fire and emergency services.<\/p><p> Some &euro;6 million will be spent by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on afforestation premia as well as funding new forest planting.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will allocate &euro;11 million to Enterprise Ireland for the innovation fund Ireland and grants to client companies; &euro;7 million through the IDA for research and development grants to industry and &euro;7 million for the science and technology development programme to fund a larger, internationally visible SFI research centres programme with major industry partners.<\/p><p> Some &euro;10.4 million will be spent by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to provide continued funding for a better energy programme pending the introduction of the pay as you save model.  The Department of Education and Skills is allocating &euro;10 million for the delivery of large scale projects in the primary and post-primary building programme.  A further &euro;9 million will be used for the St. Patrick's teacher training college building project and for building projects already under way in UCD.<\/p><p> Some &euro;1.2 million will be allocated by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to meet commitments under the EU habitats directive on the preservation of active raised bog habitats.  Some &euro;1.05 million will be allocated by the Department of Social Protection for work on office accommodation for the Integrated Employment and Income Support Service, Intreo, and public service card initiatives.  A total of &euro;1.587 million will be spent by the Department of Defence, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on buildings, the State pathology lab and the upgrading of ICT equipment for the Passport Office.<\/p><p> Departments and agencies have delegated responsibility to manage their capital programmes and projects within the terms of the delegated capital sanction as set down my Department.  The availability of these capital carryover amounts in 2013 will assist them within this framework in tackling economic and social infrastructural priorities in their areas.  I commend the order to the sub-committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013022800002#A00300","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362045600,"counter":664,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

Of those, which Departments required a Supplementary Estimate in December?  We had Supplementary Estimates across a range of Departments amounting to over &euro;1 billion.  It was the highest level of requirement for Supplementary Estimates to meet current expenditure last year since the foundation of the State.  That is one year after the Department came into operation and I would have expected expenditure to be closely matched.<\/p><p>  I can understand how it happens in the Department of Health and HSE.  We hear the debate in the HSE that some money allocated for capital ended up being used for current spending.  Did that happen in any of the Departments that required Supplementary Estimates?  How much of the money included in the Estimate for capital expenditure last year is not being carried forward because it was used as current expenditure?<\/p><p>  The Oireachtas approved the Estimates for 2012 when they were announced by the Minister in December 2011 and funding was provided in the capital investment programme to cover a large number of projects.  The reason we have a carryover is because projects do not proceed due to planning, an overestimation or tenders not being in place.  Perhaps the planning process had not been completed.  What are the five or ten largest projects that did not proceed in 2012?  The Minister has provided us with a breakdown of Departments and subheads but I would like to know the breakdown by project.  The schools building programme amounts to a large part of this.  The schools building programme contained an estimate for the year and if the officials in the Department of Education and Skills building unit are competent, which they are, they had an idea of the projects on which the funding was to be used.  Some did not go ahead for a variety of reasons.  What projects did not proceed in 2012 for which the Oireachtas had provided money?  Some are multi-million projects, with staged payments spanning a number of years.  It may be that the project proceeded but the work was not completed but I am sure some projects did not get off the ground when it was expected.  Perhaps the Minister can provide information on the project that did not proceed.<\/p><p>  There is nothing in the document about why the money was unspent.  There is no argument about how the money will be spent in 2013.  What mechanism does the Minister have in place to ensure the capital budget in 2013 will be spent in 2013 so that we are not back here next year in the same position?<\/p><p>  Can the Minister explain the amount surrendered to the Exchequer in these Departments because it could not be carried over?  On page 12, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government carried some &euro;43 million into 2013, of which &euro;34 million was for water services and &euro;9 million for Leader projects.  The next column shows &euro;56,693,000 in remaining savings that was not used to meet capital savings shortfalls in headings under A3 and A9.  I understand these moneys were surrendered to the Exchequer.  Can we have a summary of how much was surrendered and could not be carried forward because it did not meet the guidelines in legislation?  The money we carry forward can be used this year but the money surrendered, which bolstered the deficit for the end of last year, is a bigger shame.  I am not talking about people spending money willy-nilly in the last two months of the year.  I can understand ongoing projects having planning issues.  When Departments come to the Minister with an estimated requirement for capital expenditure, the Minister must ask himself, before finalising Estimates for the current year, what discussions he will have with the line Minister of the Department.<\/p> <p> The Minister said &euro;99 million was unspent last year in the capital budget.  Of that, &euro;43 million could be carried forward to 2013 under the rules but &euro;56 million was surrendered to the Department of Finance because the recipient Department could not spend it.  Are some Departments coming in with higher Estimates to cover themselves and looking for money that they will have to surrender back to the Exchequer at the end of the year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013022800003#B00400","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362046200,"counter":668,"content":"<p>Much of the drilling down should be done at departmental level because the Department controls that.

PRSI goes directly to the Department of Social Protection.  If it is not PRSI, it is general tax and goes into the Exchequer, which leaves a short-fall into the funding stream for social protection.

Leader money is a major issue, particularly where it has moved slowly.  On that side, applications going into local development companies have declined because of the requirement for matching funding from the promoter of the business.  The lack of any such funding, which also relates to the banks not releasing credit, is now slowing down the Leader programme.  As a result some of the Leader funding that was meant for job creation is being reallocated by Leader groups for community and recreational facilities.  Every playground being built in the State is being substantially funded by the Leader programme.  The programme probably intended to spend a percentage of the budget on that area, which is unrelated to economic development, but the amount has been increased because business applications are falling away.  Will the proposal to transfer Leader companies into local authorities have even more of an impact?  Staff are worried the Leader companies will go in under the ring-fenced heading but when they move in three or four years' time, they will be subsumed.  People are afraid that ultimately the money will form part of the local authority budget and Leader programme funding will end up being used to fill potholes.  The Minister might say that will not happen but that is what people fear.<\/p><p>  Going back to Irish Water and water sewerage, must local authorities make a contribution to the cost through development levies?  The local authorities had to make an economic case, saying how many people would be served by a new facility and the cost per household.  Sometimes financing from development levies was necessary.  I can understand the local authority that has a kitty of development levy money will not want to spend it and then see it taken away by Irish Water.  There must be some recompense and I know agreements are being made between Irish Water and the local authorities.  The new water supply and reservoir in County Laois was built entirely with development levy money and serves thousands of people.  Those development levies were collected locally and are now being effectively sequestered by Irish Water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013022800004#C01100","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1362046200,"counter":678,"content":"<p>The water is still local.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22013022800004#C01200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1362046200,"counter":679,"content":"<p>Irish Water will not be up and running for a couple of years.

I raised the issue on Irish Water for the very reason on which the Deputy has expounded.  We must adopt a view on it.

Another issue arises in respect of third level campuses.  Capital expenditure in third level campuses is not confined to lecture theatres, laboratories and so forth.  It should include facilities such as running tracks.  UCD, for instance, had to move its running track from the Belfield side of the N11, which is part of the campus, onto the Clonskeagh end where the nexus of sports facilities is located.  It was not possible to resurface the old track, as required for health and safety reasons, and it had to be relocated to the other side of the campus.  This cost remained outside the most recent sports grants.  This facility should be regarded as a priority on a campus of 24,000 students.  A certain level of sports facilities must be available if a campus is to attract postgraduate research and so forth and an athletics track is a sine qua non in this respect.

In my role as UNESCO chair for children, youth and civic engagement and as director of the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre at NUI Galway, I was invited to participate in the task force which met up until to June of last year in advance of the compilation of the report on the design of the new child and family support agency.  I thought the best way I could use my presentation would be by making some comments in respect of that matter and the new agency and by highlighting some issues which I believe will emerge as we move forward.<\/p><p>  The fact that a referendum on the rights of children was passed is incredibly important.  That was a crucial victory and the margin relating to it has nothing to do with the fact that we now have what we had sought for the past 20 years or more.  In legislative terms, it took from the enactment of the Children Act 1908 until 1991 before legislation relating to children was even introduced.  The fact that we have recognition of children in our Constitution is incredibly important.<\/p><p>  I wholeheartedly welcome the establishment of the child and family support agency because this development, should it come to pass, means that at long last we will have one agency with all the key players in children's lives involved.  Despite the fact that we are living in a period of austerity, I am a realist and I am of the view that the overwhelming evidence from research - including the work done by Professor James Heckman, a Nobel laureate, who is sometimes based in UCD - is that if one wants to solve the issues and concerns relating to child poverty, neglect and abuse, one must spend at least 20% of one's budget on prevention and early intervention.  The evidence to which I refer is to a factor of 29 in early years.  In other words, for every &euro;1 spent in early years is up to a factor of 29 if one invests in prevention.  If one considers the cost to the State of legal expenses alone in the cases of some children who have been through the system and if one contemplates what one could do with that money in the context of prevention or early intervention, the results are quite astounding.  I am referring here to millions of euro as opposed to low-cost interventions.<\/p><p>  I wish to make two or three comments in respect of the new agency.  First, I have some concerns about which I am very happy to go public.  One of those concerns is that not all the professional disciplines which should be under the system may necessarily be coming under it quickly enough or at all.<\/p> <p>I have concerns, for example, that there may be some reticence in regard to the provision of child psychology services.  There are also some concerns about child and adolescent mental health services and in regard to public health nursing.  This could be a very serious matter.  To put it bluntly, it is important that all the services come under the one agency as this affects children's lives.  Next month will be the 20th anniversary of the Kilkenny incest report.  Two or three of the key recommendations contained in that report were also recommendations contained in the Madonna House report, the Kelly Fitzgerald report, the Roscommon incest report and the report into child deaths and one of those recommendations was that agencies must work together in one organisation.  This is crucial.<\/p><p> A second recommendation is that the voice of children must be heard, listened to and acted on.  That is crucial also, and that is why the children's rights referendum was so needed in this country.  My overall point is that I have some concerns that the agency may not bring in all those that it should bring in.  <\/p><p> The third point I want to make is that yesterday the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre, together with the Prevention and Early Intervention Network, in collaboration with the Children's Rights Alliance, hosted a fairly major symposium on the development of the agency.  There is strong concern that cutbacks on the ground are affecting services and affecting children negatively and this may be getting smothered over, either intentionally or unintentionally, by the development of the agency.  The importance of providing services to children is key.  This is not only in regard to issues related to the ongoing problem of not having an outside 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. social work service, I am talking about the whole array of child and family support agencies and services that could be brought on board.  I must highlight the fact that children are suffering as we speak because of cutbacks.  It is not any more complex than that.<\/p><p> My colleagues, Mr. Fergus Finlay and Mr. Sean Campbell, will probably elaborate on this, but our research centre, based on the highest possible standard of a randomised control trial, proved two services are effective but neither of them are being made scalable or supported.  I am talking about the Wizard of Words programme in Barnardos and the Big Brother Big Sister mentoring programme in For&oacute;ige.  They are proven programmes, involving a low cost of less than &euro;1,000 per child, that constitute amazingly effective prevention and early intervention services that need to be supported.  As I pointed out earlier, if we invest now we will get the benefit later.  <\/p><p> We have just come through the horror of hearing in the proceedings of the D&aacute;il the details of what the women in Magdalen laundries suffered.  We must ask ourselves the question: in 20 or 30 years time, what will be the equivalent issue?  I would hate to think it would be the fact that we did not act on the evidence of what works in children's lives and that we did not take the necessary steps now, despite the austerity in the country.  I am not being unrealistic about the challenges that face the members as legislators but what kind of a civic society do we want for our children?  There is enough evidence on the street to show that we must act now, not only in emergency cases, but also in terms of prevention.

I am the project manager of a family resource centre in Ballymote in south Sligo and I am currently the chair of the Family Resource Centre National Forum which is made up of 106 family resource centres throughout the country.  My colleague, Packie Kelly, is a project manager in Mullaghmatt in County Monaghan and he also will give a short address.<\/p><p>  The National Forum of Family Resource Centres represents 106 projects which are based in towns and villages throughout the country.  The first family resource centre was established in 1994 and the programme has significantly expanded since the report of the Commission of the Family in 1998.  Since May 2003, the Family Support Agency has managed our programme which includes monitoring, financial support and policy work.  Family resource centres promote a community-based, needs-led, whole-of-family approach.  The family resource centres assist in the delivery of a community-based approach.  We regard family support and child welfare as two sides of the same coin.  We have a strong model of social entrepreneurship.  Our work is outsourced by the Family Support Agency on behalf of the State and in turn quality community based services are offered at value for money.  This was particularly highlighted at the Family Support Agency conference last autumn.  We have a highly adaptable approach to service delivery; outputs change with community needs.  For instance, at the start of the recession family resource centres were heavily involved in supporting jobseekers and there has now been a shift to supporting people who are long-term unemployed through helping them become more involved in their community through initiatives such as the men's sheds.  Prior to 2011 we had people coming in to support our programmes and now these people are coming in and we are supporting them.<\/p><p>  Work with the community is very much individually based and the approach is not to stigmatise or label people who come in to access services.  The range of services offered in the centres is such that when a person comes in the door the service he or she seeks is not identified.  Our centres could have a parent and toddler group, a counselling service, addiction services or an art group.  When a person enters a centre, it is not identified that he or she is in the centre because of a particular issue and there is anonymity in that respect.  <\/p><p>  I will refer to some highlights from the family resource centres work up to 2011.  Some 305 new community groups and initiatives were formed with the direct assistance of the family resource centres.  Some 17,800 people completed education courses.  Those courses were held in the centres because many of those people had a fear of returning to school and the classroom scenario.  It was much more successful for them to come into the centres for those courses.  Some 11,600 completed training courses.  Some 157,000 people got advice and information and some 65,000 people were referred on to other agencies.  More than 17,00 professional counselling sessions were delivered.   I will now hand over to my colleague, Mr. Packie Kelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Dineen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362044400,"counter":756,"content":"<p>The family resources centres and the national forum has been working for the last while on the transition from the current Family Support Agency to the new child and family support agency.  As Professor Dolan said, we welcome the new agency.  We believe it is a good move and provides for all the key players to work together.  As part of that plan, we instigated our own initiative to provide training for all our co-ordinators and managers in the 106 family support agencies to ensure that they are all linked in terms of understanding the way forward and how we will all work together.  We are currently building relationships with a range of new partners and with some current partners with whom we have always engaged.  We have been examining the uniformity of the systems, particularly for referrals.  We have also been looking at three-year work plans to reflect the work and focus of the new agency.  Family  resource centres envisage their role to be that of supporting families when they are in crisis but also, crucially, when they are not in a crisis.  The audience for the services of family resource centres are families who have found themselves in the social welfare system for whatever reason but also families who are on the verge of being in the system, and that relates to the aspect of early intervention and prevention.  The job of family resource centres is to support families in the system but also those moving out of the system.<\/p><p>  The key issue for us in the move to the new agency is to maintain a focus on family support.  One of our concerns, which is held by a number of others, is that the new child and family support agency could be seen as just a child protection agency, which clearly it is not.  The Minister and people such as Gordon Jeyes also hold that view.   We have a responsibility, as have all the players and the members as legislators, to make sure that does not happen.    <\/p><p>  We seek to ensure that the legislation that will come before the members in the near future will be focused on family support.  We would like some of the elements of the Family Support Agency Act transferred into the new legislation, but we will speak to the members on that in the near future. <\/p><p>  We look forward to working with the new agency.<\/p> <p>We see it as a major challenge.  It is an important piece in ensuring that families that find themselves in difficulties or that have problems have a wide range of support and all the key players are at the table.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800004#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Packie Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362045000,"counter":758,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dineen and Mr. Kelly.

When one sees the sign \"Under New Management\" over the door of an establishment, it is a promise of change and improvement.  It is the reason people put up the sign.  It is almost sending out a marketing message that, \"We are here to make a difference\".  In that sense and in that context, the development of the new agency is extremely welcome.  It is long overdue.<\/p><p>  It is timely and important from two perspectives.  The first is that the existing system has failed.  It was badly designed in the first place.  It is a regrettable fact that in the first five years of the life of the HSE the subject of children never once appeared on the agenda of the board of the HSE.  That was because the HSE was set up to deal with a myriad of things, and found itself from the first moment engulfed in a series of crises and lived its life in many ways by trying to manage those crises.  In the middle of all that it forgot, essentially, particularly at board and senior management level, that it had statutory responsibility to protect vulnerable children.  Taking the responsibility away from the HSE and giving it to a dedicated agency is important and positive, but we should not forget that it was necessary because of failure, and in some senses accelerated because of scandal.<\/p><p>  The change is timely and important for a different and perhaps more pressing reason.  In my working life I have never been more scared of the number of children at risk in Ireland.  They are not at risk in the ways that are most obvious but the latest official figures show that 107,000 children are living in consistent poverty in Ireland.  Consistent poverty is well and clearly defined.  Those children are living with a much greater risk of hunger, cold, not having the kind of clothes they need and a range of other deprivation indicators that affect them.  They are living in families that are under increasing stress.<\/p><p>  More than at any time in my working life there are stresses and strains associated with poverty, family breakdown and community breakdown that are at play and that are leading to a rapidly escalating increase in the lower levels of child concern.  I say lower levels because the thresholds are far too high.  Far too many children are at risk of neglect in Ireland.  A smaller number are at risk of abuse but an extraordinarily large number are at risk of neglect.  Those children are much more likely to drop out of the education system early.  They are much more likely to be involved in anti-social behaviour when young.  They are much more likely to drift into crime as they grow, and they are much more likely to be part of the prison population in ten or 15 years&rsquo; time.  They are the children we are failing now.  They are the children the new agency has been established to find and work with.  The agency can only do it if it is supported by a community and voluntary sector and bodies such as the family resource centres that are heavily engaged in family support.<\/p><p>  We have a culture and tradition in Ireland of being willing to spend whatever it takes to pick up the pieces after damage has been done.  Professor Dolan has made the point that if one invests a euro in preventing damage, one gets a &euro;29 pay-off over time.  We have got to vest the new agency with the authority and resources to begin to prevent damage.  The way to do that is to intervene early, to support families, to be assertive when it is necessary, to be directive when it is necessary, but to have a set of practices and a culture which are absolutely dedicated to ensuring that we nip problems in the bud.  In some ways it is as simple as that.  The agency is not going to be as well equipped to do that as it should be.  It starts off with a budget that was protected on day one in the sense that all of the resources that used to be in the HSE have been transferred across in financial terms.<\/p><p>  The agency does not have the right resources or enough resources in personnel terms.  Professor Dolan made the point about public health nursing.  Anyone who knows the work of the public health nursing profession would regard it as the best early warning system in the State.  A public health nurse is supposed, by law, to visit every newborn child in Ireland five times in the first two years of life.  The profession is better equipped than almost any other to know what is going on in families but they are not going into the agency.  That is daft.  It is crazy and it needs to be addressed by the system as quickly as possible.  The agency needs authority.  That authority must be in the law we have not seen yet.  It needs to be set up on a firm financial footing.<\/p><p>  It is worth the committee&rsquo;s while noting that the first decision the agency has had to communicate to everyone it funds is a 5% cut in funding with effect from 1 July.  It has done its best, as far as I can tell, to protect resources but one is still talking about a 5% cut.  Barnardos is part of the community and voluntary sector which has experienced cuts ranging from 15% to 30% over the past two and a half years.  The agency is depending on a community and voluntary sector which, if it has not been decimated, is under intense pressure.  It is depending on parliamentarians to pass effective legislation which gives it real authority, and it is depending on real reform in culture, practice and in awareness of the fact that we are not reaching all of the children that need to be reached.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Finlay"},{"type":"speech","time":1362045000,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Finlay.

I thank them for inviting me to this morning&rsquo;s meeting to say something about our interaction with the new agency.<\/p><p>  I will give a short background to For&oacute;ige for those who are not familiar with us.  We celebrated 60 years in existence in Ireland last year.  We work with more than 60,000 young people on an annual basis.  Of the 60,000, approximately 40,000 are engaged in universal services &ndash; For&oacute;ige clubs, youth clubs, youth caf&eacute;s and youth projects around the country.  Approximately 20,000 of the young people we work with on an annual basis come from more difficult backgrounds where we deal with a range of issues.  We have a variety of ways in which we work with those young people, for example, Garda youth diversion programmes that are funded through the Department of Justice and Equality.  We also run a number of specialist youth services in areas that are regarded as under-serviced or disadvantaged.  We operate approximately 24 programmes and projects currently funded through the HSE which will come under the new agency.  Those programmes include neighbourhood youth projects, family support programmes and specialised youth caf&eacute;s, all of which have an early intervention and prevention angle.<\/p><p>  In the services that are funded through the HSE we work with approximately 5,000 young people and 1,700 families are referred to us on an annual basis.  In some parts of the country we have a very strong working relationship with the HSE.  I refer in particular to the west and the north west.  In other parts of the country our relationship is non-existent or patchy at best.  Even though For&oacute;ige is a strong provider of services to young people we do not have a relationship with the funding agency and we are looking to the new agency to make sure that we are available to add value to its work.<\/p> <p> I wish to highlight a number of points.  Along with Mr. Fergus Finlay, Professor Pat Dolan and everybody here we welcome the formation of this agency, which is long overdue.  It needs to be set up quickly, and resourced properly.  <\/p><p> We must focus on early intervention and prevention.  We must take a leap of faith and put money into preventing the issues becoming problems.  We are very good at being reactionary and putting money into dealing with the consequences of systems that have failed.  We must take a leap of faith in terms of funding early intervention and prevention.  <\/p><p> Like my colleagues, I have concerns about ensuring that the focus is on the young person first and foremost, and not on systems.  The focus should be on seeing the potential of the young person, and not just the problem.  To do that we need not only the agency but partnerships with existing services, both universal and targeted.  <\/p><p> The community and voluntary sector is reeling from cuts.  The youth sector has suffered cuts in its funding of over 30% in the past four years yet that sector, in terms of this new agency, will be part of the front line.  It will need to support young people and children, yet it is being decimated.  It is as if one part of the system is not looking at what the other part is doing, and assuming it will be in place.  Currently, it is very vulnerable and it needs support.<\/p><p> Professor Dolan mentioned proven programmes.  We are fortunate, because of philanthropic funding in recent years, to have a menu of proven, world-class programmes that we know work.  Barnardos have some and For&oacute;ige have others, yet these front-line programmes will not be available.  <\/p><p> I will give the committee one example.  We brought the Big Brother Big Sister programme to Ireland in 2000 because it was a world-class programme proven in the United States and in Canada.  It was regarded as one of the best interventions.  The World Bank said it was one of 18 programmes worldwide that showed it had an impact on young people and children.  We have scaled up the programme in the past decade because of investment from philanthropic organisations including Atlantic Philanthropies and the One Foundation.  We have proven the impact of the programme in Ireland through rigorous evaluation - a randomised controlled trial - yet that programme, which young people value and say it is one of the best interventions they have, may not exist next year because there is no one to fund it once the philanthropic funding stops.  It is a huge risk for the system and for the new agency if it will not have the partnership supports on the ground to make it work properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800005#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Campbell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362045600,"counter":763,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Mary Flaherty, chief executive of CARI.

I thank the committee for the invitation.<\/p><p>  CARI is slightly different in that we are the minnow here among the big boys.  We are a small, specialist agency that provides therapy for child victims of sexual abuse.  We are small, but we would never need to be a very big agency because if we were to have our dream of being able to provide an adequate service throughout the country, it would not require many millions of euro.  That might become clearer as I make my remarks.<\/p><p>  CARI, along with most of the others, has been informed of the evolution of the agency as part of the community and voluntary forum since the appointment of Gordon Jeyes as the child care supremo for the Health Service Executive, HSE, and laterally as the director designate of the new agency.  We commend Mr. Jeyes for that inclusive report.  It is extraordinary what a difference being part of the loop makes, even if we are being communicated bad news.  <\/p><p>  That is informal and effective engagement with the non-governmental organisation, NGO, sector whom he told us at our meeting last week provides 20% of the services of the new agency.  That is a significant fact.  In a time of change it has been effective in communicating developments, retaining trust and reducing stress and distrust, if not eliminating it.  I am aware that the process of extracting the portfolio budget of the new agency under the HSE has been and continues to be challenging.  Standardising and co-ordinating the child care services into an effective child protection system is also a very difficult task and will take time.  We are being kept informed of developments by the forum.<\/p><p>  The sector has also been included in mails to key managers on new structures, management arrangements, and it has been invited to apply for new management posts as they arise.  It is a case of so far, so good.  I will leave that work in the capable hands of Mr. Jeyes who, by and large, retains the confidence of the sector, although there is increasing impatience at the slow pace of development and the delivery of change and decisions.  I will leave processing the legislation to the members and will use my time here as briefly as I can to ask them to consider services for victims of child sexual abuse as a model for some of the specialist agencies now being funded by the new agency.<\/p><p>  As others mentioned, this has been an historic time.  I congratulate everybody in the Oireachtas for their work in finally bringing forward an amendment to the Constitution on the rights of the child.  The Houses have discussed the Magdalen laundries in recent years.  We have had the Cloyne and the Murphy reports about which we have appeared before this committee.  However, with the consequent and appropriate focus on the failures of the past, I have been frustrated in my role with the difficulty in getting any attention for today's victims of sexual abuse.  The last Ferns committee to report was the one about the services for child victims but I ask members to keep an eye on what is happening about the Ferns 4 (Children) working group, which was tasked with examining the services for victims.  It reported recently and has an implementation plan.<\/p><p>  In 2010, the last year for which I have seen formal HSE figures, approximately 3,000 new allegations about child sexual abuse were received by the HSE.  If its representatives are here later today or tomorrow morning they may be in a position to give the members the 2011 and 2012 figures.  In 2008 the figure was 2,300.  We can presume from that, therefore, that between 2,500 to 3,000 new cases are reported to the HSE every year.  I would like the committee to examine what is happening to these children and, out of a sense of rightness, to ensure that we are responding to them in a way that will not lead to future tribunals.  Also, while we are a specialist intervention agency after abuse has occurred, there is a comparison with the early intervention process in that if children get the service immediately after their abuse and do not have to wait until adulthood, the consequences for them and for society are huge in terms of mental health issues, criminal outcomes and a great deal of pain and suffering because it can be hugely costly to them individually, and to their families and to society.  Responding when an allegation is made is important.<\/p><p>  In terms of what is happening throughout the country about the 3,000 new allegations made, the Fiona Doyles of our time, about whom members have debated recently - I commend another book to them, <i>Did You Hear Me Crying<\/i>, by Cassie Moore, which is recently published - they are people who are being raped on a daily basis.<\/p> <p>Statistics tell us there are hundreds more in their situation today.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has developed specialist services that deal effectively with initial interviews and again, there are differences around the country.  There is an assessment process everywhere, albeit of varying levels of quality.  However, if a child is believed and we confirm, that is, if we face him or her and agree he or she has been abused, in many parts of the country that many members represent, there is absolutely nothing for him or her.  In a few areas around Dublin there is a cluster of services, between ourselves and the two children's hospitals, as well as in Limerick where we have a service.  A review done by Mott MacDonald found perhaps 12 to 14 specialists around the country who provided therapy.  One should contrast this with adult services, where there is a State-funded adult counselling service available in all parts of the country.  Moreover, they are relatively well funded and there is a network of voluntary rape crisis centres, as well as One in Four and other NGOs, which offer a choice.  In other words, one might have no service available to one at the age of 17 but on becoming 18, one has a choice of adult services.  This makes no sense and unfortunately, because of the funding situation, the approach appears to be to spread the thin resources available around the country.  At present we have waiting lists in our two centres of between one year and 14 months.  Think of telling a child he or she has been abused - this would be a minority or perhaps half of the aforementioned 3,000 - and then offering him or her nothing because the child and adolescent mental health services do not treat them as appropriate for their services because they do not have a mental illness.  Here and there around the country, there are <i>ad hoc<\/i>services in the form of voluntary organisations that might offer them some sort of family support.  Again, it probably is not appropriate to their real needs, which are the equivalent to those of adults for a specialist service.  In the context of these specialist services, as one watches and focuses on the macro problems of the agency and as others have talked about individual programmes, I would like this joint committee to retain an eye on the services for the victims of today.  Moreover, until members are satisfied that a network of services is in place nationwide that is at least as good as it can be, the joint committee should not let go of this issue either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Flaherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362046200,"counter":766,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Flaherty and all the witnesses for their excellent presentations.

It is important that families be supported at an early stage to ensure that vulnerable families do not end up in the care system.  When one hears of &euro;1 yielding a payoff of &euro;29, it is a compelling argument to ensure that adequate resources are put in place at the earliest stages.<\/p><p>  On the subject of proven programmes, someone referred to the Big Brother Big Sister programme, which obviously has tangible benefits and rewards.  At a time of scarce resources, are there overlaps between the agencies?  Do a number of agencies provide similar programmes where it might be better to streamline them in the future?  The witnesses might respond on this point.  As for family resource centres and their work, I used to be on the board of the local family resource centre in my own community and am familiar with its good work.  As Mr. Packie Kelly noted, no one is stigmatised on going in the door because the centres provide such a myriad of services that no one knows the purpose of one's visit and for all that anyone else knows, one could be going in to have a letter photocopied, which is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>  However, to revert to the establishment of the child and family support agency, members must ask Gordon Jeyes two questions when he appears before the joint committee after the witnesses.  The first pertains to the allocation of resources to ensure they are properly allocated, particularly to earlier intervention and prevention methods.  Second, from the witnesses' remarks today, it appears as though the child and adolescent mental health service will not come under the remit of the new agency and members must try to ascertain the rationale and reasoning behind what to me constitutes a regressive step.  Historical reports will show that children who have mental health issues end up in the care system.  It would be very important and makes sense to have this critical service held under the remit of the new agency.  This is the reason I make the point that when the agency is being established, it is important to get it right from day one.  As for the role of public health nurses, I did not realise that legally, they are obliged to visit a newborn baby five times in the first two years.  They really are the people who can detect the early warning signs if a problem exists in a particular household.  As Oireachtas Members and personally, as spokesperson for my party, when members meet Gordon Jeyes in the next segment of this meeting, it will be their first opportunity to engage with him on the establishment of this agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800007#F00500","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1362046200,"counter":770,"content":"<p>The Deputy is wrong on that point.

However, I thank them, as this has been very useful.  I have selected points in respect of each contribution.  I thank Professor Pat Dolan for his contribution and the critical point he made regarding early intervention and prevention and the percentage of the budget that should be ascribed to that role and function.  When he spoke of reticence regarding the child psychology and child and adolescent mental health services coming on board under the new agency, he has not used too strong a word to describe the position.  He should elaborate a little because this issue is very important.  To be frank, members are being lobbied and a continual strong case is being made not to so do.  Members are only as good as all the information they have and I ask Professor Dolan to help them to answer this question by elaborating on that point.  I also thank Ms Claire Dineen and Mr. Packie Kelly.  I agree absolutely with Ms Dineen that family support and child welfare are two sides of the same coin.  My next question is directed to both Ms Dineen and Mr. Kelly.  Do they believe the Family Resource Centres National Forum has had an adequate opportunity - or any opportunity - to put its case to the Minister, to Gordon Jeyes and those who have been tasked with the preparation of the facilitating legislation, which is yet to be presented and which everyone expected well before 1 March, which falls tomorrow?<\/p> <p> Do Ms Dineen and Mr. Kelly expect the legislation will confirm a continuation of the ethos and culture of family resource centres across the board?  Do they expect that it will confirm continued representation for the national forum on the board of the new child and family support agency?  I have asked the Minister this question repeatedly but I have not received the clarity I need, although she may not be in a position to offer it at this point.  Can Ms Dineen and Mr. Kelly offer any further elaboration on the legislation and where they expect it to land?  What would they like the legislation to say?  Should we seriously consider pressing amendments on Committee Stage of the Bill?<\/p><p> The position of public health nurses is a bit like the position of child psychologists in the child and adolescent mental health services.  They are not coming under the aegis of the new agency.  I appreciate the wider remit, role and responsibility of public health nurses, which are not only focused on families and children.  How can Mr. Finlay help us to present the case properly and in a balanced way?  As regards the roles of public health nurses coming under the aegis of the new agency, is it beyond our collective reach that they would have dual accountability?  Perhaps Mr. Finlay could elaborate on that.<\/p><p> I wish to acknowledge the important and imaginative programmes that For&oacute;ige has sponsored over the years.  I am deeply concerned to hear of Mr. Campbell's expectation of the demise of the Big Brother Big Sister programme.  Only this week I have had an inquiry in that regard.  We should highlight this matter as it is only through public awareness that people will step forward.  We know the situation with Atlantic Philanthropies, so others might note the importance and value of such programmes.  It would be tragic if that programme, in particular, were lost.  I appeal to the media to highlight it.  Let us put out the request to see if anybody will step up to the plate in this regard.<\/p><p> As regards Ms Flaherty's contribution, the figure of 2,500 to 3,000 cases of child sexual abuse annually is a hugely worrying statistic.  We do not know the full extent.  Despite the best efforts of Mr. Gordon Jeyes and everyone else concerned, our current systems are clearly not fit for purpose to meet the cohort of cases that are presented.<\/p><p> If the full situation was to be realised, what would Ms Flaherty say we should be pressing for - apart from the statistics - to avoid a repetition of all we have witnessed in recent years regarding the expos&eacute; of past failures?  Could Ms Flaherty offer particular advice on what we should be pressing for today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800007#F01200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362046800,"counter":778,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  In the lead-up to today's meeting, I had contact with several organisations and practitioners who would also like to have a voice on this important issue.  The witnesses, however, have given us a good cross-section and representative sample of some of the key components that need to be part of the new agency.  I have made my views on the agency known in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> today.  I want therefore to press on into some more direct questions.  I tuned into the symposium yesterday and I listened a lot.  It made me think of an exercise we do with the girl guides, getting one to draw a picture while another describes it.  There is a lot of talk about the agency's principles and values but I am still not quite clear on its composition and who will be in it.  Everybody is agreed on the principles' values and we have great support for the agency.<\/p><p>  Does Professor Dolan know what is the status of the task force report that was published last July?  Will all the recommendations be taken up?  Can we take it that the report is the framework for the new agency or is it an input into the new agency?  Professor Dolan also mentioned some concerns.  He spoke about how the transfer of professionals will happen.  Can he advise us on other concerns that he or others might have?  We need to know if there are issues we need to look for so that we can give political support where required.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Fergus Finlay used the term &quot;under new management&quot;, which evokes all those senses.  I was pleased to hear from Ms Mary Flaherty about her involvement in the evolution of the new agency.  I would like to probe that a bit more.  How much has she been involved in the shaping of the new agency, thus bringing her expertise to the table in designing it?<\/p><p>  When I was tuning into the symposium yesterday, a public health nurse asked a question from the floor.  I do not remember whether it was Mr. Gordon Jeyes or the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who responded.  However, the response referred to phase one and phase two.  It is hoped that within phase two, public health nurses will be part of the design.  That is the first time I have heard the terms &quot;phase one&quot; and &quot;phase two&quot;.  Can Ms Flaherty enlighten me or should I follow up that question with Mr. Jeyes?<\/p><p>  Mr. Campbell referred to prevention and early intervention, and in this context we all too often think of toddlers and babies, but it goes right throughout a young person's life.  That is an important message for all of us to take on.  <\/p><p>  I may have got it wrong but did Ms Flaherty say that 20% of the new agency's services will be provided by NGOs?

We would be delighted to have her back here at any time in the future.<\/p><p>  I have two brief questions, the first of which was raised by Mr. Finlay.  The issue of consistent poverty cannot be ignored.  There is a perception that consistent poverty is in disadvantaged communities.  Sadly, however, I am seeing it every day in my own constituency with middle class families who cannot put bread and butter on the table.  Much of the time it is because of a lack of knowledge and information on where to turn and who to turn to.  It is not just a matter of investing in such services, it is also about communicating more effectively what supports and services are available.  People do not know where to turn. <\/p><p>  When one probes issues with families, one can identify where problems are arising.  This comes back to the other point I have regarding public health nurses.  If public health nurses are brought into the child and family support agency their role will be abolished.<\/p> <p>Rather than using the public health nurse, the system is creating a nurse for child health and community health that would deal with anyone over the age of 18 and older people.  One loses the advantage that a public health nurse has because the reality is neglect and abuse is not defined by age.  Often abuse in a house can be across the age range.  Some structure needs to be found to deal with this.  The public health nurses need to be brought in at the beginning of this whole process.  What type of a structure do the delegations believe needs to be put in place?  Everyone agrees public health nurses have a valuable role to play.  If that job is split between dealing with children under the age of 18 and those over 18, I believe some of the impact and usefulness of their role will be lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800008#G01200","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362047400,"counter":790,"content":"<p>With regard to Deputy O Caol&aacute;in's question, children unfortunately do not live in compartments or 15 places.  They, hopefully, live in one home, one community and go to one school.  I am not being facetious in saying this.  If we really want to stop the mistakes we have made, we have to truly have child-centred services.  Putting it bluntly, one cannot have professional turf wars or siloed professionals.  We know from all the reports that one of the key failings was a lack of sharing of information among professionals and acting on it.  It is horrific how bad that was.  One of the reasons I am passionate about being involved in the agency is to prevent this happening again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Pat Dolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1362047400,"counter":791,"content":"<p>Has this turf-war mentality ceased?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800009#H00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362047400,"counter":792,"content":"<p>No.  With the agency coming on board, a different kind of real culture for child services should exist where they are put first.  There is much rhetoric about this but in reality it is what affects children's lives.  As Deputy Naughten highlighted, what affects a child who does not have a breakfast in the morning?  Whether one is a former worker in the field, like me who is now an academic and who I hope lives in the real world, a psychologist, a child psychiatrist, a teacher, social worker or youth worker, there is an absolute requirement that one plays one's part with other people in the interests of the child.  Unless the agency has all the professionals together, it simply will not happen.  It will just be moving deckchairs around for the sake of it.  There is no point in being ambivalent about this.  It must happen.<\/p><p>  For example, in child and adolescent psychiatry there is an issue about the gap between 16 and 18 and who has medical responsibility, which can go as far as medical defence unions.  The bottom line, however, is that children do not live in unions or professional spheres.  The only way the proposed agency will work is on the basis of people working under the agency as one team with full accountability and transparency.  I know the professionals have their concerns but the objective and the gain is far larger through this agency.  The same mistakes made here were made in other countries, such as in the baby Peter Connelly case in the UK.<\/p><p>  My role on the task force was to pull together the framework and design for the new agency.  That was finished swiftly in July on the promise we would have legislation swiftly as well.  One slight concern I have is that we are in limbo, which is not a good state of affairs.

However, a concern I expressed in the task force is that one of the problems is tomorrow never comes.  We need tomorrow today.<\/p><p>  It is now 20 years since the Kilkenny incest report which was published by the then Minister for Health, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  I recall that momentous day because it was the actual implementation of the Children Act.  The very things that were spoken about then are the same things we are talking about now.  God be good to the late Judge Hubert Wine and the late Judge John Garavan who spoke about the same issues.  We are repeating conversations here.  We need to stop this.  The only way forward is through one agency, resourced properly and with an adequate amount of funding prevention and early intervention.  If we invest in the spring, we will harvest in the autumn.

The development of this new agency is a challenge for us all.  It is clear the system has failed families.  We have a chance to put this right and there is a huge enthusiasm to do so.  One of the key pieces is early intervention.  The 106 family resource centres that have been operating for years are littered with stories of supporting families which have not entered the child protection system.  We cannot estimate a figure for the savings to the State that bringing them into the system would entail.<\/p><p>  It is important that there is a large range of stakeholders involved in the agency.  There are other players, particularly in the primary care system, that should be here today.  We hope that wisdom will prevail and they will be included shortly.<\/p><p>  We are concerned that the agency could develop and focus just on child protection.  Many claim this will not be the case.

My understanding is phase one means \"now\" and phase two means \"not now\".  It would be far more helpful if we had a more specific meaning for phase two.<\/p><p>  Several members raised the issue of public health nurses.  I take the point entirely.  The public health nurse is an invaluable community resource.<\/p> <p>Perhaps I should say that I am not here to represent community nurses and public health nurses, but we in Barnardos, and many of those present, work closely with them.<\/p><p> In larger urban centres there are a great many public health nurses who are, if I could use a meaningless term, more \"child specific\" in their work.  In less populated areas they carry a wider brief and they are as important to the elderly person living at home and to the disabled adult as they are to the child.  That would represent a structural and cultural issue that would require to be managed.<\/p><p> There is a fundamental aspect which is about the sharing of information.  Professor Dolan made the point about inter-agency joined-up thinking which has been on the agenda for 20 years.  Community nurses have an enormous volume of information about what is happening in the lives of children, younger people and elderly people, but they tend to carry it - I do not mean this disrespectfully - in the boots of their cars or keep it under their stairs at home or in the office.  It is not centralised.  It is not sought.  It is not codified in a way that makes it useful.  There is one small experiment going on somewhere in the country where such data is computerised.  We would solve many problems if we merely addressed that issue, the real, meaningful codifying and sharing of information in a highly structured way.<\/p><p> The final point I wanted to make relates to Deputy Naughten's point about poverty.  The Deputy is correct.  The new poverty phenomenon that we all are seeing is deep, sharp and painful.  I suspect that if the committee had a representative of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul here, he or she would tell the committee, as a member of the society said to me recently, that the society has many who were active and strong volunteers a couple of years ago who now need its help.  We all have experienced the phenomenon - it happens in the workplace that is Barnardos as well as everywhere else - of double-income families now having a single bread-winner or no bread-winner.  However, there is a difference - I do not want to overstate it - between the child whose family has suffered a loss of income and the child who is born and reared in a dysfunctional family situation in a disadvantaged community.  Both children have mountains to climb.  One of them has to climb Mount Everest in order to make it.  We cannot lose sight of that either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800009#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergus Finlay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362048000,"counter":798,"content":"<p>Has the pendulum swung more, given what you have just said, towards child protection as opposed to family child support, which is something that perhaps we need to be more tuned into?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800010#J00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362048000,"counter":799,"content":"<p>The pressure that is on the new agency is to keep the children most at risk safe.

If one is a young person in Dublin, there is a spend on you in terms of youth services of approximately &euro;300.  If one lives in Cavan, the spend is &euro;1.

I will refer to some of the specifics.  On phase one and phase two, there is much work to be done in phase one.  Those of us who work day-to-day around the country with cases such as abuse cases will be aware that in different parts of the country there are completely different procedures.  One need only re-examine the statistics in any year from the HSE where \"the review of adequacy\" is the phrase it uses.  One should look at the number of reports of abuse of all kinds and the attrition, through the point of being confirmed or unconfirmed, in one area versus another.  One should look at whether it would be strange that one part of the country should have figures that are completely aligned.  There is a real job of work there with the existing employed social workers - the staff who are clearly within the remit of the agency where there would be no argument.<\/p><p>  I accept there are complex issues, for example, around public health nurses.  I mentioned Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS.  CAMHS, if it refuses to provide sexual abuse services in the context in which I work, does not treat them as a mental health issue and unless one is suicidal or is self-harming, one has a mental health issue to be resolved.  Once that is resolved, one may still have issues around one's sexual abuse that one has not worked through, and in some parts of the country, a therapist or a psychologist might continue with him or her.  In many parts of the country, it is excluded.  There is a great deal of standardisation to be done.  Even in the case of child deaths, if, for example, one brings in the child and adolescent mental health specialists, often it is the mental health specialist working with parents who are the ones who need to be alert to child death dangers.  Those areas will be difficult and I do not envy the job of negotiating all of these matters.<\/p><p>  In the short term, there is a great deal of work which has already begun in standardising the cohort of staff working clearly within the agency's remit, and ensuring that in every part of the country this is a warning sign that we act on and move in this way.<\/p> <p> In regard to what I would regard as a good outcome, the beginning of a plan has been developed.  CARI has been involved in its evolution but my concern about the plan for child sexual abuse services, therapeutic or otherwise, is that an attempt is being made to develop them on an expenditure-neutral basis.  I think this will be impossible to achieve in the context of a service that is in its infancy.  If one takes the model for the adult counselling agency, which celebrated its tenth anniversary last year, I am concerned about the suggestion that we can roll out a service that would be in any way adequate to the needs of children.  They will not be equivalent because the number of adults is limited and children have a specific timeframe.  The numbers will not be huge but we should, at a minimum, be able to offer a specialist therapy service to children at least as good as the one we say they need when they turn 18 if they have been victims of abuse.  Why is a similar service not to be provided while they are under 18?  Children should be able to access a specialised therapy service to cope with abuse.  While abuse may occur at any age from two to 18 years, early therapeutic intervention would avoid the need for extensive mental health services and further trauma and abuse in later years, both within the family and over the generations.  I invite the committee to keep an eye on that issue.  In regard to other preventative work, Ferns five is trying to develop services for abusers because that is also a preventative measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800010#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Flaherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362048600,"counter":806,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Flaherty for her presentation.

I believe members have a copy of my statement and, therefore, I will go through that quickly to allow maximum opportunity for what I hope will be a wide-ranging set of questions.<\/p><p>  With regard to the background, a range of critical reports led to a programme of reform and a particular commitment to separation.  The important issues were a lack of clear accountability, too great a degree of inconsistency across the country and poor performance management, data poverty and poor quality assurance arrangements.  The first step in addressing these issues was the appointment of a national director for children and family services in January 2011, namely myself.  A few months later, the programme for Government set out fundamental changes in the delivery of child and family services and determined that there should be a separate agency dedicated solely to the welfare and support of children and their families as well as the establishment of a Department with representation of children at Cabinet level<\/p><p>  I began by looking at all the recommendations from all the reports and found that many of the responses that had been established by various working groups had occurred somewhat in isolation.  There were at least 58 of these groups and goodness knows how many recommendations.  The first task was to produce a coherent and rationalised programme of reform along clear themes, which are outlined in appendix 1.  More material is available on the reform programme for any member who is particularly interested in it.  It is important to consider everything in the context of the programme for Government, whose overarching themes were to ensure cohesive reform not only in children services, but across the health sector.  It is important that services are accessible and delivered and managed at the most local practical level.  They should be customer or patient-centred rather than determined by professional boundaries to create a culture that is responsive, outward-looking and inclusive.  The emphasis is on accountability and transparency.<\/p><p>  My acronym for the year was very much ACT - accountability where the well intentioned integrated approach within the HSE had led to great complexity and too many people reporting in with too little professional management beyond a certain level.  It is now the case that principal social workers are only three steps away in a direct line from the national system and it is also only three steps from front-line staff to area managers.  We have a general programme to improve the consistency of the advice and support provided around the country.  We have published a book on child protection and that will be followed shortly by one on advice for foster parents, an alternative care handbook.  Appendix 2 contains a diagram, which describes a service delivery framework in order that we can have a system that ensures each referral or contact made with us gets a response which is efficient, effective and proportionate to the family's needs while building on the family's strengths.  We also have made great strides with regard to transparency.  We regularly publish the independent reviews of serious cases and child deaths.  They are available for open scrutiny, as is the way in which we drive these forward for learning at local level.  Every aspect of the reform programme is regularly discussed, not least with an open-membership voluntary and community sector forum and I also have an advisory group of young people who have been through the care system.  They are there to keep me real, as they tell me \"You may say that, Gordon, but that is not what is happening\".  I meet them at least four times a year and they meet ten times a year.<\/p><p>  There is a tendency, because I was appointed to lead a social work programme for two years for me to be particularly identified with that.  That was a job I was asked to do and I gave it my best endeavour.  That is a work in progress.  There have been significant strides but much done, more to do.  That is a separate issue from the job I am now tasked with, which is about establishing an agency.  It is about moving beyond repairing best practice.  There is a superb opportunity to redesign and re-imagine and, therefore, we need to take that forward.  The devil is in the detail and the big picture.  Detailed work is going on in difficult circumstances relating to due diligence, 4,000 transfer letters, a memorandum of understanding in order the health services do not walk away from children, new ways of working and new relationships, joint planning and partnerships.<\/p><p>  The nuts and bolts of the agency are taking shape.  Families do not live in silos or within boundaries.  The intention behind the reform for clearer accountability and transparency makes sense but we must then come together, particularly in disability, mental health and children's services within the framework of primary care networks.  We need new fund-holding mechanisms, which are about funding the family or the client rather than the professional services.  The new partnerships will be complemented by the legislation shortly to be laid before the Oireachtas to create the agency.<\/p><p>  It is important that the agency be staffed by people clear in their values, consistent in their behaviours according to these values and accountable for how they behave.  We must acknowledge but not be constrained by the difficult financial circumstances, recruitment issues caused by ceilings imposed by the troika, from which no service is immune, and issues about keeping the reforms in step in order that the crucial relationship between children's services and health and education remain fully aligned to maximise the impact of the change.<\/p><p>  The way in which these themes will be pulled together requires a search for fixed points about subsidiarity and delivery according to need as opposed to \"the profession knows best\" approach.  If we do that, I am confident we can have a system which supports the nurturing of children in Ireland who are confident, well motivated, fully rounded and literate and numerate to a level comparable with their peers in the rest of the world.<\/p> <p> An important issue for Ireland is children who are resilient, who understand their part as citizens of a democracy, and who can seize opportunities regardless of their background but have the skills and attitude to embrace change throughout their life.  It is about the new opportunities and new ways of working and having an agency that will intervene at the earliest possible moment, will be multidisciplinary and will build on the strengths of the family support agency.  Without the consent of the community I cannot be as effective as I would wish.  It should build on the duties of the educational welfare service to ensure school attendance, and ensure good links with the home to encourage school completion and furthermore to look at projects for alternative education because too many children in Ireland are not receiving an education or when they have a break in their education it takes too long for them to become re-enrolled.  We need to look at that jointly with the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p> We are uniquely placed to look at the child and family circumstances from a range of perspectives - one child and one plan, but many perspectives and a multidisciplinary approach.  This is an agency dedicated to the service of Irish society, aspiring to high standards, particularly for the most vulnerable whom, in the past, we may have let down - an agency for all Ireland's children.<\/p><p> The final appendix, which I did not mention has been widely circulated.  It is a draft statement of our central purpose, our vision and our change themes.  It outlines values and behaviours that are essential to underpin this activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800013#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362049800,"counter":813,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jeyes and congratulate him on his impending appointment as chief executive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800014#O00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1362049800,"counter":814,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue today.

We tend to look back at historical reports.  This week <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i> reported that &euro;25.4 million was spent on legal fees for child care.  These are all relevant issues.  I raise them today because I believe the new agency represents a new opportunity.  These are current issues and not ones from a bygone era.<\/p><p>  What difference will the establishment of the child and family support agency make?  Professor Pat Dolan, who appeared before the committee earlier this morning, said he had been working on this since September 2011.  What is the delay in putting the agency on a statutory footing?  Does Mr. Jeyes feel vulnerable in the absence of legislation?  Will the budget deficit of &euro;50 million be carried forward to the new agency?  Will it be possible to maintain front-line services with a reduction of &euro;5 million?<\/p><p>  Representatives of family resource centres appeared before the committee earlier this morning and expressed concern that they will not get the recognition they need.  In terms of protecting early intervention, will the new agency ensure that adequate resources are put in place for early intervention?  A recurrent theme of each of the five groups presenting this morning was the importance of investing early.  Someone mentioned that if we sow in spring, we will reap the harvest in autumn.  Making the investment at an early stage will save having to spend large amounts of money at a later stage.  The family resource centres have a track record in doing that and I ask Mr. Jeyes to comment on that.<\/p><p>  On governance structures, in his presentation, Mr. Jeyes alluded to clear accountability.  Have the governance structures been decided yet?  The original announcement made last July indicated a similar structure to the HSE.  Will there be political accountability with the new governance structure?  What will be the composition of the 4,000 staff?  Are all HR issues resolved?  It is critical to avoid an excessively bureaucratic system and we need to have adequate staff in the right place, which is in the front-line services.  I again refer back to the report I mentioned earlier that indicated 454 children in the care system are without a social worker.  Is Mr. Jeyes confident that there will be an holistic approach and that professionals will share their information across the board?  Will the child and adolescent mental health service be in or out?  Historical reports identified positive consequences of an holistic approach, particularly in the area of mental health.  A large number of children who experience mental health issues end up in the juvenile justice and care systems.<\/p><p>  Earlier it was mentioned that there was talk of phase one and phase two of the new child and family support agency and I ask Mr. Jeyes to enlighten us on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800014#O00700","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1362049800,"counter":819,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr Jeyes and Ms Byrne.  Is Mr. Jeyes concerned over the delay in the presentation of the facilitating legislation to establish the child and family support agency?  We had an expectation this would have been in place before the end of last year and it would have been operational since January.  Tomorrow is 1 March and the first quarter is nearly complete.  I expect we are all equally anxious to see the new agency <i>in situ<\/i> because only when the new structures are functioning will we be able to properly evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency.  We look forward to that.<\/p><p>  Representatives of the groups who appeared before the committee earlier and others, who are in continual contact with committee members, have raised the issue of child psychologists and the child and adolescent mental health services.  They also raised the issue of public health nurses.  As a rural Deputy I recognise that the role of the public health nurse is not specific or particular only to children and the family relationship with the child; it is much wider than would be a neat fit for the new agency.  However, the view expressed - one that I share - was that it is essential that the child psychologists and the child and adolescent mental health services would form an integral part of the new agency structure.  What is proposed is disaggregation from the existing HSE position to the new agency.  Should these respective professionals be within the new agency's remit, which would seem to be their natural home?  I also ask Mr. Jeyes to comment on the position of the public health nurses.<\/p> <p>There are 106 of these across the State.  Their position was again very well articulated here earlier this morning.  I am familiar with the detail of their concerns.  Perhaps Mr. Jeyes is no more privy to the legislation than we are but would he expect their ethos and culture to be confirmed within the new agency?  Would he like to comment on the anticipated structure of the board of the new agency?  The family resource centres currently have representation on the Family Support Agency board.  Will that continue under the new circumstances?  What is the position regarding the local area pathway groups?  How soon does Mr. Jeyes expect to see the roll-out of these and progress in respect of their respective remits?  <\/p><p> We are advised that between 2,500 to 3,000 cases of child sexual abuse are reported annually.  Could Mr. Jeyes confirm the figure?  I emphasise that these are reported cases because I do not believe it is indicative of the reality.  Unfortunately, many cases are not reported.  We hope that will change.  Are the current system and support services fit for purpose?  We tend to look historically at the situation.  We have had report after report which is informing much of the change to which we are all a party and supportive of.  Would Mr Jeyes give us his view as to the current services and support structures?  Are they fit for purpose in respect of that quite significant number of cases presenting?  One would hope that the full extent of it would present in time when people realise how important it is to come forward.<\/p><p> Resourcing is key.  I thought it very pertinent for one of our earlier witnesses to make the point that all we hope to see achieved cannot be achieved on a revenue-neutral or cost-neutral basis.  We have spoken here before about all that we wish to see regarding greater service provision with regard to social workers.  With the advent of the new agency, surely we are going to have to match our intent with improved resourcing to realise the results we all wish to see achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800014#O00800","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362050400,"counter":821,"content":"<p>I thank Gordon Jeyes and all of his team.

My difficulty lies in understanding its component parts and composition because I have no difficulty in agreeing to the principles and values behind it.  If we look at past reports, they often talk about changes in culture and practice.  In the absence of legislation, what is the status of the agency regarding contracts?  Could Mr. Jeyes clarify whether the staff are being transferred or whether they will be new employees of the agency?<\/p><p>  Deputy Troy mentioned phase one or phase two.

Deputy Robert Troy also asked me what difference the agency would make.  With clearer lines of accountability and greater knowledge of what we are doing and what is going on, we can establish a national system that is locally delivered.  There must be greater consistency in the support provided to children in every part of the country and there must be better local decision-making.  I want somebody who asks for advice about being a foster parent or adoptive parent to obtain the same advice, irrespective of the team he or she goes to.  Some services, including adoption services, I intend to run on a national basis and others I intend to operate locally with fewer than five decision-making steps required to get control of a budget.  We must build strong local partnerships within the boundaries of local government.  This is crucial, as all reports show, including the independent review of child deaths.  As much as I need to raise the performance of social workers, this is about education, drug and alcohol abuse, the health services and social workers failing to access those services for their clients.<\/p><p>  I was asked if I felt vulnerable.  My experience in Ireland has been that it was in the job description for me to feel that way.  If I do not feel vulnerable, I am not paying attention.  We are not quite in limbo, as was suggested.  There is only one legal and governance structure for us which is as part of the HSE.  Child and family services will continue to be part of the HSE and accountable to the board until the Oireachtas determines otherwise.  While the transition may be taking longer than any of us would wish, we are not in limbo.  The legal status is clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800016#S00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes"},{"type":"speech","time":1362051000,"counter":832,"content":"<p>Why is it taking longer than many people would have thought?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800016#S00800","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362051000,"counter":833,"content":"<p>There was a later question which I will answer now.  I can understand the anxiety the delay has caused.  Regarding Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question, I am as impatient as anybody else.  While I want the transition to take place quickly and to be able to reassure family resource centres and the voluntary sector, I also want to get it right.  I want to ensure that if I am to be held accountable, I know how much I am spending, when I am spending it and what I am spending it on.  I want to ensure I have good reports to provide proper accountability to Ministers and the people's representatives.  There are issues primarily around disaggregation.  The services have never been broken into their component parts.  We must have efficient reporting systems in place to provide for appropriate financial control before we can run the system.  That is the primary issue.<\/p><p>  To return to Deputy Robert Troy's questions, there was no budget reduction in 2012.  The budget we have in 2013 is the same as the budget we had for 2012.  That is a clear difference from the very significant reductions faced in the rest of the health service.  It shows that the Government prioritises children's services.  The issue was that there was still some over-expenditure.  As with every other service, we have used our clear lines of accountability and capacity for budgetary flexibility.  We must live within our means and provide value for money for taxpayers.<\/p><p>  I take every opportunity to reassure family resource centres.  While I am not going to tell them there will be no changes, any changes will be about ensuring that each family resource centre is as good as the best one.  Centres should build on the considerable strengths of the best examples and from a menu of activity that is proven to work.  Centres should be taking the agenda forward in a way that meets the needs of the community.  I have no intention of establishing child protection centres.  It is about the engagement and consent of the community and the strengths that are needed there.  We cannot do this alone and without the excellent work of family resource centres, our chances of success would be severely diminished.<\/p><p>  Deputy Robert Troy also raised the question of early intervention.  It is an interesting term as it can have so many different meanings.  Sometimes it means a request not to spend on my projects but on others.  We should certainly have systems in place which enable us to intervene at the earliest possible time that makes sense and is not intrusive.  That can come through the way society as a whole works.  The best early intervention to protect a child at school is to ensure he or she is not excluded and attends in the first place.  The best schools are inclusive schools.  The best health services are responsive health services such as the nursery I visited in north Dublin.  There, the speech and language therapist and public health nurses take their checks to the nursery.  That should be standard practice.  We should not say \"two strikes\" and if you do not turn up, you are out and will not get an appointment.  Early intervention encompasses engaged communities which are respectful of the contribution children make.  How often in our debates on children are we fearful for our own children and frightened of everybody else's?  We need responsible citizens.  Of course, we also need, within our budget, to have projects which support that activity.<\/p> <p> We commission in excess of &euro;100 million, which is almost 20% of the budget, from the voluntary and community sector.  These are our partners who can reach communities in a way the social work brand cannot.  I can only speak about the management structure, which I have attempted to streamline and strengthen accountability.  The board will not be similar to the HSE but governance matters are more for the Government than for me, and they will become clear when the legislation comes before the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p> Staffing discussions continue with IMPACT in a very constructive way.  During the years of financial difficulty a great number of <i>ad hoc<\/i>arrangements have been put in place so the notion that all HR issues will be resolved immediately is fanciful.  Discussions with IMPACT have been very constructive and respectful, and I fully expect a very good framework agreement to be reached shortly, which will take us into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800016#S00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362051600,"counter":835,"content":"<p>We had a discussion earlier about turf wars in the transfer.

Nobody has been transferred yet but we have alerted 4,000 staff that they are liable for this transfer.  The numbers in dispute at that point were in single figures.  I will come to the issue of psychologists separately.<\/p><p>  We want an holistic approach.  The view of the child at school, in the family, in the community, with his or her peer group and in social work are all different and all make up the full picture.  I come from an education as well as a social work background and we need to work together to maximise the impact we will make.  We will take an holistic approach.<\/p><p>  An important issue was raised with regard to information sharing.  Uncertainty remains in Ireland about information sharing and we need further examination of it.  I am often told that data protection is no obstacle but then I find that it is and issues still arise.  I have never known children to be at risk because information about them has been shared.  I have known children to be at risk because information has not been shared.  Sometimes the way legislation is phrased means one can share information if one knows a child is at risk of significant harm, but unless one has all of the information, one may not know the child is at risk of significant harm.  There has been talk of legislation yet to come on a duty to share information as opposed to holding it back, and this needs further encouragement.  We are too precious about this and it should be considered.<\/p><p>  Child and adolescent mental health services are being reformed, and reform of adolescent health services is badly needed.  Some adolescents have been very poorly treated as 16 and 17 year olds do not fall within the domain of child services but adult services do not want to treat them because they are children.  It was a case of heads, they lost, and tails, the other side won.  I support the task force recommendation that community child and adolescent mental health services should be within the agency.  The timing was not right with regard to other reforms.  There will be a review and a final decision will be reached.<\/p><p>  I am surprised by the various references to phase one and phase two.  Perhaps with so many announcements one can get confused.  Leaving the task force aside, which did not refer to phases, when the Minister announced her response she referred to two phases.  She stated she would start by dealing with the many people doing several jobs at once.  She also stated stability was required to get it started and listed the essential components for the first phase.  The issues for phase two are child and adolescent mental health services, speech and language therapy, public health nurses and detention schools.  This has been the Government's position since responding to the task force.  It has also always been stated that there will be a phase two; it is just that the response to the task force recommendations is not specific.  I share Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's concern at the delay and I am sympathetic about the uncertainty it causes but I want to get it right.<\/p><p>  With regard to a turf war because psychologists are so popular and nobody should leave home without one, we all want psychologists and I support the task force recommendation.  The relevant Ministers have a group studying the impact of the most effective deployment which is nearing fruition.  I cannot say too much.  It is important to emphasise that as we look at a health service with clear and separate components to increase accountability and transparency, we do not think this is the end because we will need systems to ensure we work across these components.  The components should be part of acute primary care along with the other carer groups.  Mental health services, public health services and ourselves will not be islands and some of us will have services which will reach into other roles.  As chief executive designate of the new agency I want to be a provider to mental health services, care groups and others as well as a receiver from them.  If any of the component parts are only receivers it will be weaker and therefore I welcome hosting community psychology within the child service.  As we create the warp and weave, let us focus on families and customers and not on professional boundaries.<\/p><p>  With regard to public health nursing, the person who first mentioned the two phases was the questioner, who obviously knew there would be two phases.  It is important that we stay aligned with the rest of the health service.  The detail of the health reform is important as is ensuring we strengthen incrementally so we have stability and the capacity of the newly-formed leadership team is not stretched too far.<\/p><p>  I visit as many family resource centres as I can and community consent is absolutely crucial.  I would like to see initiatives which build on their strengths and I am particularly keen on the contribution children make to the community in sports and the arts because these activities bring out a community.  We always think of children as a blight in our community because they are only ever in the newspapers as perpetrators or victims, as opposed to us celebrating the Christmas show or their performance in sports.  It is about systems of entitlement and building up their capacity in the arts.  Good work is done in the theatre in Ballymun and elsewhere throughout the country.<\/p><p>  The role of children in families and supporting the life of families in communities are crucial.  We will take this into family area pathways.  As of yesterday every area manager will identify a lead manager.  We will ensure an audit of all services which contribute and we will have detailed discussions with every provider to the &euro;100 million in the voluntary and community sector.  I have stated there will be no reduction in the first six months of this year while the review is being done.  I then want to make it more fit for purpose so we fit in with the research work conducted by NUI, Galway which states that what matters is what works.  The activities we will fund will enable a community response, which will then mean engagement of social work is less necessary because we will be building on the strengths of family.  I expect local area pathways to be operating in the second half of the year, but it will be gradual as we build on strengths and bring more people to the table.<\/p><p>  I am struck by the sheer range of voluntary and community activity in Ireland.  Much has flowered from the ground up and there could be some harvesting, but for the maximum impact the sector must do it for itself.  Perhaps some areas have too many separate initiatives to have the best impact.<\/p> <p>There is a need to finalise the complementary work in child sex abuse cases, but I must revert with the exact figure, as I do not want to read into the record a figure in respect of which my memory might not be serving me correctly.  We need assessment centres in which children's needs are met, for example, acute health care, and where social workers and organisations such as CARI have a presence.  The Garda can also be involved for evidence-based purposes so that as few interviews as possible need be conducted.<\/p><p> As is appropriate, the sexual abuse treatment units remain with the health service.  It is an area that needs boundaries.  I expect further announcements in this regard.  I share people's impatience, as we should be doing more.  There is an inconsistency across the country.  I hope that we will shortly roll out the sort of model that I have described, one in which a service is available 24\/7.  Clearly, resource limitations cause some difficulties.<\/p><p> The component parts of the agency are, in the first instance, the services to ensure that children at risk of significant harm are protected; services for alternative care, both trained and registered foster carers and relative carers who are supported by the State; and high-end alternative care arrangements, for example, residential care right up to and including high support and special care.  In excess of &euro;100 million in the voluntary and community sector is associated with the family support prevention and partnership work that we do with our colleagues.  I retain my lead HSE role for services in response to domestic sexual and gender-based violence.  The agency presents an opportunity in that regard to reconsider matters.  It is not always about refuges and escape.  It is about dealing with the 80% of partners who have suffered violence and are in the community.  We can get better community and family-based solutions.<\/p><p> We are not operating in the absence of legislation.  We are a part of the HSE.  We are more an agency within an agency with our own accountability than last year.  However, the only legal and governance route for the children and family services agency is to the board.  We will build these services with the 106 family resource centres across the country and the education welfare services.<\/p><p> I welcome the question on social work reform.  I do not wish to be misunderstood here but the reform has taken up a great deal of activity.  We have tried to put in place a coherent programme, but it is a work in progress and is nowhere near finished.  I would happily supply more details of our prioritisation list and the activity that is under way.  I do not want people to believe that the agency is merely a continuation or another aspect of social work reform.  That reform will continue within the agency, but the agency is far greater than that.  I am aware of the challenge of being a social work add-on.  We must not let that happen.  I come from a community background.  We must do this work in a more holistic way, as questioners have mentioned.<\/p><p> The last point raised was on accountability.  The accountability of four steps has been in place since May.  I am pleased with the progress made by the 17 area managers in a brief time.  Previously, those colleagues did not have responsibility for human resources and finance.  They are stepping up to the plate following some detailed management training.  That makes the liaison with the likes of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na all the more reliable.  I meet the 17 area managers on a monthly basis.  Overall, it is a significant step forward.  The efforts to create an integrated service approach had become a little cluttered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800017#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362052200,"counter":838,"content":"<p>I call Deputies Doherty, Healy and Byrne in that order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800018#U00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1362052200,"counter":839,"content":"<p>Many of the questions that I was going to ask have been addressed by Mr. Jeyes's responses to previous questions.

I hope that Mr. Jeyes will not misconstrue our frustration that it is not all happening quickly or our low level of positivity towards what he is doing.  Last year, the task force related to different actions and the Minister set out phases one and two.  Clearly there are technical or legislative factors involved, but is there an end date in sight by which Mr. Jeyes would like to see the complete picture up and running?  It will be a transient body, in that it will change all of the time.  By when will all of the boxes be ticked and all of the relevant agencies be within the remit of the agency?<\/p><p>  We have been told that 20% of the overall budget is being spent on early intervention.  Given the large return factor on every &euro;1 spent, has Mr. Jeyes plans within the short to medium term to increase that percentage?<\/p><p>  Ms Flaherty stated that the NGO sector provided 20% of the new agency's services.  Is this work being financed through their existing grant structure or is it coming out of the &euro;550 million budget?  If the latter, how much will be contributed?<\/p><p>  My next point is on a departmental issue, about which Mr. Jeyes might not be able to comment.  According to the gentleman from For&oacute;ige this morning, the Department sees the significant benefits and merits in the programme but will not tell anyone, as it would then be required to provide it to everyone.  This would be the stupidest approach possible.  If the Department recognises that it might not have the money to roll the programme out, it should find the money.

I support the agency's establishment, there is widespread support for it and goodwill towards Mr. Jeyes and the entire concept.  However, it is a significant undertaking.  Although it cannot be compared with the change from the health boards to the HSE, that kind of change comes to mind.  I am not satisfied that the change to the HSE was done in an appropriate way or that what we have now is what we had hoped we would get.  Can Mr. Jeyes give an undertaking that the idea behind the agency will work in practice?  What is the timescale for the agency's implementation?  Many have mentioned the delays about which we are all frustrated.<\/p><p>  My next two issues have been raised by others, but I need to raise them again.  I have raised them with the Minister by way of parliamentary question, but I am not sure what the replies meant.  Having listened to Mr. Jeyes, I am not sure what he means either.  Perhaps he will clarify the matters for me.<\/p><p>  First, I wish to address the culture and ethos of family resource centres.  My constituency of Tipperary South has the Millennium, Spafield and Three Drives family resource centres, which do good work.  These centres need confirmation that their ethos and culture will be taken on board as part of the new agency.<\/p> <p>I have previously put to the Minister the question of whether the centres will have a representative on the board, the response to which was not very clear.

It was mentioned by the delegates that they cannot deal with this issue on their own.  I do not believe anybody would want them to do so.  We will support them as much as we can.  I would like to make an observation about family resource centres in terms of their diversity.  Some deal only with particular sections of the community.  In other words, they do not open their doors to the wider community.  The downfall of some resource centres is that they home in on areas experiencing particular difficulties rather than meeting the needs of the wider community.  It is a problem.  How does the agency propose to address this problem?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800019#V00200","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362052800,"counter":843,"content":"<p>I hope it does not take me 20 years.  I am doing my best.  I appreciate the committee's impatience.  In my second interview, which led to my recruitment to Ireland, I quipped that I wanted to bring some evidence-based impatience.  I want to drive that forward.  This relates to the question of the early starting point, once the other criteria are in place, in particular the financial reporting systems.  Important points were made about the need to see the complete picture and to have an end date for conclusion of the discussions, which the agency cannot have on its own because this is about the values and relationships it has with the remainder of the health service.  We need to know our template and the template for integration of the component parts of the health service.  There needs to be further consultation around the best working relationships in the interests of children, families, communities and the groups involved.<\/p><p>  On Ms Flaherty's reference earlier to the 20% grant, I am pleased if she is referring it to contracted work because that is how I see it.  We are both speaking of the same figure.  I am well aware of Mr. Finlay's success with the Big Brother Big Sister programme.  There are many well-funded programmes in other jurisdictions, including urban aid in the UK in the area of technical and vocational education, in which millions have been invested.  However, mainstreaming them is an issue.  It is an issue Ireland will have to face in a few years, having had significant and important contributions from philanthropy.  It is not for me to say from where finance should come.  It is, however, for me to ensure that the money I spend on behalf of the taxpayer is spent on initiatives which have an evidence base.  We will be looking to do this within finite resources.  I recently met For&oacute;ige to discuss its budget, the range of contracts it has with us and the ways we can reduce non-productive costs, thus ensuring we get value for money throughout the system.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Healy's question, I am never satisfied in terms of driving forward the resources that I have and ensuring we are getting the best from every member of staff.  I am deeply conscious that the notion of having a single health service in a country the size of Ireland, which is comparable to Scotland, seemed sensible.  If I was not paying attention and learning the lessons of why, in a period of only a few years, it did not work I would not be doing my job.  I am trying to avoid some of the issues that led to the later defensiveness of that organisation and how it was perceived by the public.  Certain issues within the organisation were centrally controlled while in other aspects of it there was no consistent or strategic management.  As a public servant in Ireland, I must be conscious of the constraints.  Ireland is not in charge of its own destiny and as such there are constraints on the finances of and recruitment within the agency.<\/p><p>  On the Deputy's question of whether in my view with all of the constraints we can do a better job, the answer is yes.  I believe we can do a significantly better job with shorter lines of accountability.  I am not always comfortable with the word &quot;empowerment&quot; because I am not sure I know how to empower people.  I am not sure anybody empowered V&aacute;clav Havel or Nelson Mandela.  I do, however, know that poor managers can disempower people and that this has happened.  I can encourage people, set boundaries and responsibilities and seek to provide the best possible service.  Through the production of annual standards and quality reports, I am confident of a process of continued improvement.<\/p><p>  I can only repeat my reassurance about family resource centres respecting their culture and ethos while setting a challenging environment within the terms they apply to themselves.  I am happy to reiterate that confirmation, as I have at their conference and as I do when I visit them.  I want them to work effectively to avoid overlap and duplication and to ensure we have more formula-based approaches, in terms of resources, countrywide.  Currently, psychologists are employed by the HSE and work with many groups, including children.  There is no question of their remaining within the HSE.  The <i>status quo<\/i> is not an option.  My understanding is that the HSE will change.  My preferred position, as the relationships between the component parts are examined, would be that psychologists would be hosted within the child and family support agency.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Catherine Byrne's question, there is a need to develop a whole range of issues in terms of how children can be safe within their families and communities and to ensure the agency intervenes proportionately, building on family strengths and only when necessary.  We will work with family resource centres and other community groups in terms of good models of intervention from which families have previously been happy to take advice.  We do not want a social work referral approach, with people getting a telling off.  We need to keep children safe from harm.  We need to move on in Ireland from the &quot;refer-on&quot; culture whereby one person refers on a child to another person.<\/p> <p>We need to get to a confident stage where it is not a case of what I am going to do about it but what we are going to do about it.<\/p><p> I recognise that in getting to that point I still have work to do to ensure we have the credibility that the hard-working staff for whom I am responsible deserve.  Whether real or perceived, there has been a credibility gap, and with the diversity of resources through family resource centres, the National Educational Welfare Board programmes for school completion, home school links and attendance, I am sure we can free ourselves to reimagine and bring out new ways of working, as we believe in subsidiarity and local delivery, although to national standards and consistency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800019#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362053400,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I have a brief further question.

Will the witness comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800020#W00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362053400,"counter":847,"content":"<p>There are eight young people abroad.  One went to Nebraska during my time, against the advice of the HSE.  We did not feel it would work and it did not.  The seven placed in England all have a mental health provenance.  I have had discussions on working more clearly with expanding mental health provision in this country.  It is not just our bit that is in need of expansion.  Special care relates to circumstances in which a young person is deprived of liberties and it should only be taken in extreme circumstances.<\/p><p>  The average waiting time to get a place is very low - it is a number of days - despite cases flaring up.  I take the Deputy's point about the two going elsewhere.  It is important that we would only wish to deprive a young person of their liberty when it is absolutely necessary.  The number of special care places and the specialisms associated with them will be enhanced.  For example, there is a very good high-support unit in Crann&oacute;g Nua that will have a special care facility, with planning permission agreed last week.<\/p><p>  I must be very careful in my leadership of this because I do not want to create a position where the idea is that we will fill it if it is built.  We need to keep the idea pretty tight.  There is a difficulty where hard-pressed communities, families or social workers need respite from trying to work in a community and family scenario with a young person.  We need to consider the number of times we examine cases where the issue is something else, such as drugs and associated criminal behaviour.  I would support, in due course, parallel tracks of special care and detention schools blending so that they could merge.  I would like to be in charge of both.  Ireland has, for all of those under 18, one system dealing with the needs of the young people and their deeds, rather than separate systems.  There are plans and I would be happy to provide detail on those if required.<\/p><p>  Legal costs are spiralling out of control.  Legal services are run as part of the corporate HSE.  There was a response, met with some success, that regarded previous management difficulties.  It was an error to centralise budgets, as we all like spending somebody else's money.  Within the HSE, legal service users authorise work but the budget is held centrally.  Once we have sorted the clarity of the budget - and not before - I will have legal services within the children's agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800020#W00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gordon Jeyes"},{"type":"speech","time":1362053400,"counter":848,"content":"<p>Is that contentious?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013022800020#W00500","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1362053400,"counter":849,"content":"<p>Not at all.
