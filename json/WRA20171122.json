This includes international oversight under ICAO's Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme and under the European Aviation Safety Agency's standardisation audits.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Section 32 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 provides for an examination and report to the Minister for Transport on the performance of the IAA with regard to its safety regulation functions and air navigation service.  The findings of the most recent Section 32 examination by the expert consultancy firm Helios, as set out in its Final Report of 2015, are in line with the positive views of both ICAO and EASA.  To reiterate, the IAA is subject to three separate, detailed performance audit review processes - one under domestic law by the Minister, one under European law by EASA, and one under international agreement by the UN's ICAO. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Helios Report raised by the Deputy, the Report notes that: the IAA's \"level of compliance with European and ICAO safety regulations and standards and recommended practices is very high, evidenced by EASA standardisation audits and other audits over a sustained period where the IAA has consistently performed well.  The IAA is well resourced with a level of industry experience and technical expertise that is amongst the best in Europe\".<\/p>  <p>  As with any good and robust audit process, the Helios Section 32 Report made recommendations for further improvement.  The whole purpose of the audit regimes described above is to verify current perfomance against current requirements and also to push organisations to engage in continuous improvement.  The IAA has established an implementation plan to address these areas for further improvement and is reporting periodically to my Department on progress. <\/p>  <p>  In the period up to 2007, three examinations were carried out under Section 32.  In 2009, the then Minister for Transport, Mr Noel Dempsey set out in a D&aacute;il reply of 3 November 2009 the reasons for his decision not to carry out an examination under the Section 32 provision at that juncture.  This was due to a number of factors, including plans at the time to restructure the IAA.<\/p>  <p>  Within my remit, I will consider any request from the association referred to by the Deputy to meet and discuss matters of concern to it, including relating to the outcome of the Section 32 examination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200080#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Aviation Regulation","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200080#WRA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[49341\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200080#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the progress made regarding his promised review of the issuing of permits for carrying weapons and munitions on civilian aircraft.","asker":"1259","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>The internal review of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973 is currently underway.

Monaghan County Council and Louth County Council, with the support of TII, will, therefore, commence the establishment of a project team and the procurement of Technical Advisors to bring the scheme from inception to the preparation of CPO\/EIS documentation and Business Case.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, TII has conveyed approval to Monaghan County Council to re-activate the proposed N2 Clontibret to the Border road improvement scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The progression of the schemes concerned to construction stage will be subject to the satisfactory conclusion of the planning and approval processes and the availability of funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200080#WRA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Aviation Regulation","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200080#WRA03700"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[49339\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200080#WRA03800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 180 of 18 October 2017, if he is satisfied with the regulatory oversight and enforcement duties carried out by the IAA in regard to its oversight of proactive crew fatigue mitigation through adequate manpower planning in the context of safety management systems, in view of the recent revelations in regard to insufficient pilots at an airline (details supplied) to crew a schedule which was published approximately six months beforehand.","asker":"1259","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>The Irish Aviation Authority is responsible for the safety oversight of the Irish civil aviation industry, and it ensures that all air carriers comply fully with all safety regulations to the highest international safety standards, including Flight Time Limitation (FTL) rules.

Both countries have adopted a whole of Government approach to communications with the citizen placed at the centre. <\/p>  <p>  Their communication systems aim to simplify how government information  is communicated to the public so that it is delivered in a coherent and accessible manner.  The SCU will continue to consult with international counterparts to seek to adhere to international best practice.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to set up the SCU was informed by a need to streamline how Government communicates with its citizens.  As an initial step, my Department conducted some research on existing communications activities, including the range of campaigns, brands and channels of communication used by different agencies, which have built up over many years, under successive governments.  This research is ongoing and will be used by civil service management to help frame the work plan of the new unit. <\/p>  <p>  The initial results of that research will be published shortly.  The former Merrionstreet (GIS) function is integrated within the Strategic Communications Unit; the Government Press Office continues to operate as before in dealing with day -to-day media queries, under the direction of the Government Press Secretary.<\/p>  <p>  A key part of the modernisation of Government communications is the greater use of social media.

The Report sets out a number of proposals to develop a long term sustainable funding model.\u00a0 I look forward to receiving the Committee's recommendations.  This will\u00a0assist in facilitating informed decision-making for the future direction of funding for higher education.<\/p>  <p>  While the Committee are undertaking this important work, I have been working in the interim to secure additional funding for higher education to address, inter alia, rising demographics.  This\u00a0commitment is reflected in the recent Budget 2018 announcement\u00a0in which the higher education sector will benefit from a total\u00a0investment package of &euro;60m in additional funding in 2018.  This funding is on top of the\u00a0&euro;36.5m that I\u00a0secured for 2017 and which is being provided again in 2018.  In total, we will be investing &euro;100m more in higher education in 2018 than in 2016.  This additional funding will allow for targeted\u00a0initiatives in higher education and will allow for places to be provided for 2,100 additional students in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, the Government increased Exchequer funding to higher education by &euro;36.5 million and announced a consultation exercise to consider an Employer-Exchequer Investment Mechanism.\u00a0 This reflected the recommendation in the Report of \u00a0the Expert Group on Future Funding of Higher Education that a structured contribution from employers should form a key element of future funding for higher education as employers are major beneficiaries of higher education.<\/p>  <p>  Following a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-Employer Investment Mechanism earlier this year, it was announced in Budget 2018 that the National Training Fund levy will be raised by 0.1% in 2018 from 0.7% to 0.8% and by a further 0.1% in both 2019 and 2020.  This measure allows for additional expenditure of &euro;47.5 million from the Fund in 2018.  The 2019 and 2020 levy increases will be subject to the implementation of the necessary reforms to ensure that employers have a greater role in determining the priorities and the strategic direction of the Fund.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Exchequer will also make an additional investment of &euro;17m in 2018.\u00a0 Together this will facilitate an increase of &euro;64.5 million in the Department&rsquo;s expenditure ceiling.\u00a0 This will be used to fund initiatives in the higher education system including targeted skills programmes, performance and innovation funding, technological university development and apprenticeship costs in the higher education sector.<\/p>  <p>  Also, following the review of the Capital Plan, a total of &euro;357m in capital funding is now available for investment in higher education over the period 2018-2021.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0As set out in the Programme for Government, this comprehensive approach is being taken in order to achieve a sustainable funding model for the higher education sector going forward.

The majority of these applications were made before the commencement of the 2015 Act but were not finalised by the former Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) by that date.  These applications must be processed by the IPO under the transitional provisions of the 2015 Act.  Various categories of cases reverted to the IPO including asylum appeals transferred from the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal and asylum and subsidiary protection cases transferred from the former ORAC.  This has added significantly to the IPO&rsquo;s caseload.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that considerable progress has been made by the IPO in getting the new single procedure process up and running.  To date, the IPO has scheduled over\u00a02,000 single procedure interviews (including in respect of EU relocation cases).  More than 150 additional interviews have been scheduled in the IPO for the coming weeks with more interviews being scheduled on a daily basis.  Some 1,400 recommendations\/decisions in respect of international protection and permission to remain have also been made by the IPO.  This includes some 600 recommendations in respect of the grant of international protection.<\/p>  <p>  At the present time, it is not possible to calculate an accurate current median processing time for international protection applications due to the different case types on hands, which were returned to the IPO under the transitional provisions in the 2015 Act. \u00a0Considerable additional resources, have and are, being allocated to the IPO to assist it in undertaking its statutory functions with a view to processing the volume of cases on hands as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the scheduling of interviews and the processing of cases in the IPO, I am also advised that the prioritisation of international protection applications is provided for in the International Protection Act 2015 subject to the need for fairness and efficiency.  When the Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) and other supporting documentation is returned by applicants, the IPO is scheduling applications for interview primarily on the basis of date of application (oldest cases first).  However, certain categories of applicant are also being prioritised such as those from refugee generating countries (such as Syria) and unaccompanied minors.

In addition, the Scheme states that the AHR treatment provider would have to consider the welfare of the child in making the final decision whether or not to provide AHR treatment. <\/p>  <p>  Those providing AHR treatment need to make a clinical assessment of any prospective patient and ensure that AHR treatment does not represent a disproportionate risk to the health of the patient or to the health of any potential child.

The Deputy may be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013.  Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.  The Health Service Executive has advised that there are currently 4,133 individuals in receipt of this payment.<\/p><p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government<i><\/i>acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health (Transport Support) Bill.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that: <\/p><p>- There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation; <\/p><p>- There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme; <\/p><p>- Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and <\/p><p>- The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the consultation with other relevant Departments has been completed, the next step will be to seek Government approval to the drafting of a Bill for the new Scheme.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.

On the contrary, the National Maternity Strategy recognises pregnancy and birth as a normal physiological process.  It recognises that all pregnant women require a certain level of support and that some will need more specialised care.  As such, it proposes a woman-centred and integrated care model that encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles, which delivers care at the lowest level of complexity.  Equally, the model has the capacity and ability to provide specialised and complex care, quickly, as required.  <\/p><p>In terms of induction rates, the fact is that pregnancy care in Ireland has become more complex.  More challenging cases arise due to increases in obesity levels, diabetes, average age of primigravidas, assisted reproduction, multiple pregnancies etc.  However, we have established a National Programme for Women &amp;amp; Infants Health within the HSE, to drive improvements in maternity services.  In addition, the Programme will lead on the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy.  <\/p><p>The Deputy may find the following data sources useful: <\/p><p>1. The Irish Maternity Indicator System (IMIS)  ;<\/p><p>2. The Maternity Patient Safety Statement (MPSS) .<\/p><p>In particular, the 2014 &amp;amp; 2015 IMIS reports includes data showing the range of the rate of induction of first time mothers at hospital\/unit level for those years, while the national induction rate of all mothers for the years 2008 &ndash; 2014 is available in the 2014 IMIS report.  In addition, since December 2015, the Maternity Patient Safety Statements have detailed the monthly rate of induction, including of first time mothers.

Latest data from September 2017 shows that the public\/private mix at a system level stands at 82% public for elective in-patient work and at almost 86% for day-case work.  This is consistent with the typical 80\/20 split provided for in the consultant contract. <\/p>  <p>  The Contract allows consultants engage in differing levels of private practice, depending on the contract type held.  Consultants holding a Type A contract are not permitted to engage in privately remunerated professional practice.  Consultants holding a Type B contract may undertake private practice on-site, up to a limit of 20% of activity on a casemix-adjusted basis, and limited off-site private practice in cases where the individual consultant previously held a Category I or Category II contract under Consultant Contract 1997.  Serving consultants whose public to private ratio in 2006 was greater than 20% are permitted to retain this higher ratio, subject to an overriding maximum ratio of 70:30%.  Consultants holding a B* Contract or a Type C Contract may engage in off-site private practice.  Their in-patient and out-patient private practice activity is also subject to maximum limits.<\/p>  <p>  Arrangements concerning implementation and monitoring of Consultant Contract 2008, including the provisions in relation to private practice, are matters for the HSE in the first instance.

The Project Team has now completed a series of consultation meetings with farmers in the six designated Hen Harrier Special Protected Areas (SPAs), which more than 500 farmers attended.  A seminar for advisors took place in September, and comprehensive training courses are planned for January 2018 and May 2018.  The scientific officers in the team have carried out Hen Harrier monitoring in all SPAs and preliminary results from this campaign will be available within weeks.  Work is also progressing on detailed Terms &amp;amp; Conditions for the new programme.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the first expressions of interest from farmers in taking part in the new programme will be invited before the end of 2017.  Unlike other schemes, the new hen-harrier programme will not be tied to calendar years and this provides for greater flexibility in both recruitment and payment.  The programme will be action based, with a result based approach.  Most importantly it will be farmer led and tailored to each individual SPA.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to clarify that my Department has no role in the designation of lands.

The question of compensation does not arise, therefore, in the context of any schemes or measures introduced by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  I have allocated a budget of &euro;25 million for the hen harrier programme.  It is worth noting that a significant framework of support for farmers with hen-harrier designated land is already in place through my Department's agri-environment scheme GLAS.  Under GLAS, farmers with hen harrier habitat qualify for a payment of &euro;370 per hectare and can earn up to &euro;7,000 per annum through a combination of GLAS and GLAS Plus payments.  The GLAS Hen Harrier action has proved hugely successful, with some 2,678 farmers now signed up.

As part of the initial ground work to Food Wise 2025, a public consultation took place which involved 15 background papers and a questionnaire.  These included a particular focus on climate change and sustainability. <\/p>  <p>  We are committed to ensuring that the sector continues to grow sustainably so that Ireland can play its part in meeting the increasing global food demand while having regard to Ireland&rsquo;s climate obligations.  It is independently and internationally recognised that ours is a climate and resource efficient agri-food production system and we are working with all stakeholders to find even greater efficiencies. <\/p>  <p>  A number of initiatives are being undertaken to make the farming sector even more environmentally sustainable, including measures under the Rural Development Programme (RDP), which is worth almost &euro;4 billion over 7 years.  The Department&rsquo;s implementation of its RDP has seen significant focus on the targeting of support interventions.  This Programme is aimed strongly towards environmental benefits, including knowledge transfer programmes, which will bring the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers. <\/p>  <p>  The Knowledge Transfer Programme supports the roll-out of best practice on farms, while improved efficiency of the national suckler herd is being achieved through the Beef Data and Genomics scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Agri-Environment scheme GLAS has 50,000 participants. \u00a0It is based on prioritised eligibility based on environmental objectives such as hedgerow and tree planting, minimum tillage and encouraging the sustainable management of upland peatlands.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem there is a focus on sustainability through the &lsquo;Origin Green&rsquo; programme.  Under the Origin Green programme Ireland is a world leader in areas such as sustainable auditing and carbon foot-printing.  Origin Green is a strategic priority in Food Wise 2025. <\/p>  <p>  Initiatives such as the Carbon Navigator tool also assist, as does Teagasc through its advisory, research and education programmes. <\/p>  <p>  The Pasture Profit Index and the Agricultural Catchments Programme help to reduce carbon emissions per unit of output produced and protect our rivers. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore the establishment and maintenance of landscape features (for example Ecological Focus Areas under CAP Pillar I) can assist with achieving other environmental objectives which are expected of land, such as water and biodiversity management, in addition to carbon sequestration benefits.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding renewable energy Anaerobic Digesters (AD), to date, this has played a limited role in promoting and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0as methane emissions from the storage and management of animal slurries only compose approx. 12% of the total methane emissions arising from agriculture and the scale of Irish farms are small.  Methane accounts for approximately 22% of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions and, of this, approximately 12% of methane emissions result from the storage and management of animal manures.<\/p>  <p>  It remains however an opportunity to recover methane with consequent climate change benefits.\u00a0 AD plants can take in waste animal products including slurry, meat products, waste food, silage etc.  The gas produced in an AD plant may be used to produce electricity, through a Combined Heat and Power unit (CHP), or may be used to supply &ldquo;Green Gas&rdquo; (biomethane) to the gas network. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Afforestation is the main cost effective land based climate mitigation tool available to Ireland including the provision of sustainable source of wood biomass for energy purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Forests have the potential to sequester and store large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which can then be harvested as wood products, and these continue to store carbon over the long term and be employed as a sustainable source of fuel.  In this way forests directly sequester carbon and substitute other materials that are associated with high levels of emissions such as steel, concrete and fossil fuels.  Forests will play an important role in meeting EU emissions reductions targets during the 2021-2030 period.<\/p>  <p>  Over the period 2021 to 2030, projections show that 4.5 MT of CO2 eq may be removed annually from the atmosphere by afforestation that has occurred since 1990.  Based on proposed accounting rules under the LULUCF proposal 2.2 MT of CO2 eq is forecast to be accountable against our Effort Sharing Regulation targets from afforestation.  In 2016 6,500 ha of new forests were planted in Ireland under the afforestation scheme.\u00a0 The overall target is to expand Ireland&rsquo;s forest estate from 11% to 18% by mid-century.<\/p>  <p>  Agriculture and afforestation are intrinsically linked in Ireland.

The immediate concern is with regard to the control and data collection funds.\u00a0\u00a0The EU Commission wrote in July 2017\u00a0advising that due to the non implementation of the Points system,\u00a0EMFF funding allocated for control spend will be suspended.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the new system being impartial, it is intended in this regard that the new SI will provide for the independence of both the members of the Determination Panel and the Fisheries Adjudicator in the performance of their functions.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to rights of appeal, it is intended that the new S.I. will provide for a right to appeal to an independent Fisheries Adjudicator if the licence holder is dissatisfied with the\u00a0determination of the Determination Panel.\u00a0 The\u00a0Adjudicator is a legal person appointed by the Minister. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is also intended that under the new S.I. the licence holder may appeal on a point of law a decision of the independent\u00a0Fisheries Adjudicator to the High Court.\u00a0 In the 2014 S.I., this appeal was &ldquo;final and conclusive&rdquo; - this aspect of the provision has been\u00a0removed.<\/p>  <p>  Having an effective, proportionate and dissuasive system of points for all fishing vessels, Irish and non Irish, operating in our 200 mile zone is beneficial to maintaining the sustainability of fish stocks on which our seafood sector is dependant.\u00a0 This system will ensure that the vast majority of our law abiding fishermen are able to compete effectively and look forward to a sustainable future in the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200087#WRH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Severe Weather Events Response","counter":413,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200087#WRH01700"},{"type":"question","counter":414,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[49642\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112200087#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the compensation funds available to persons affected by Storm Ophelia (details supplied).","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":415,"content":"<p>Following a challenging period, the dairy sector has experienced positive trends this year in terms of raw milk and specific commodity prices, particularly for butter.

Under the treaties, PESCO is firmly set within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and CSDP.  PESCO is seen as the primary initiative in demonstrating EU ambition in advancing the agenda on CSDP.  In this regard, the establishment of PESCO is seen at EU level as a political demonstration of unity, inclusivity and continuing ambition to provide global leadership, in the face of Brexit and the increased security threats in the European Neighbourhood and beyond.   <\/p>  <p>  There has been significant engagement by all member States in the development of PESCO to ensure that it fully respects the differing security and defence policies of the member States as reflected in the treaties and the treaty protocols including in respect of the development of the &lsquo;Notification&rsquo; to participate in PESCO.  The &lsquo;Notification&rsquo; document recites treaty and protocol provisions, recalls the EU commitment to multilateralism with the UN at its core with a view to increasing the commitment and contributions that Member States can make towards crisis management.  It also sets out the criteria for participation.  Once a country has agreed to join PESCO it can decide on the projects in which it participates on a case-by-case basis. <\/p>  <p>  En marge of the Council meeting and prior to the working lunch, 23 Member States signed the PESCO Notification.  The five that did not sign were; the UK due to Brexit, Denmark - which has an opt out on military CSDP matters, Portugal, which I understand intends to participate but has yet to complete its decision making process and Malta which has a very small and limited defence capacity and does not therefore intend to participate at this time.  A further FAC Defence, is scheduled for 11 December in Brussels and at which it is expected that PESCO will be formally launched. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, discussions on PESCO were forward looking on the follow-up to the expected launch of PESCO in December.  Discussion centred on the EU&rsquo;s comprehensive approach, encompassing foreign policy, trade, aid as well as security and addressed the need for PESCO projects to strengthen same and the requirement to also strengthen and reinforce civilian capabilities and crisis management tools.  Regarding budgetary commitments, Ministers noted that commitments should not be seen nor presented as prejudging national parliaments' prerogatives in this area.  Ministers also discussed the need for communication to the wider public. <\/p>  <p>  To date Ireland has participated in all aspects of CSDP and has thus been able to influence the overall direction of CSDP, in particular ensuring ongoing support for the UN and multilateralism.  Given this and the priority being given to the security and defence agenda by our partners in Europe, it will be important for Ireland to participate in PESCO so as to maintain a central influence on the development of CSDP, but also in terms of ensuring access to the latest developments on military capabilities for our Defence Forces on crisis management operations.<\/p>  <p>  Participation by Ireland in PESCO will be subject to the approval of the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2009.
