Are they agreed to?  Agreed.  <\/p><p>  Two matters arise from the minutes.  One relates to the invitation from the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe Costello, to the committee to visit a country to examine the expenditure of development aid.  The committee agreed that it would send a delegation later this year.  The original suggestion was that we send a delegation to Ethiopia.  However, having examined requirements with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, it has now been suggested Mozambique would be a more appropriate country to examine for the following reasons: it is the subject of Ireland&rsquo;s largest bilateral aid programme, included in which is general government support, which is not the case in the case of Ethiopia.  A wide range of supports are also being provided in Mozambique.  What we want to ensure is that the aid programme, the figure for which was &euro;657 million in 2011, is effective in the service it delivers to programme countries and that all the systems in place to channel the money to meet the cost of front-line services are efficient.  To that end, the delegation will be able to follow the money trail at first hand and judge the impact of programmes on the ground by visiting projects in some of the poorest areas of the world.  That is the thrust of the visit to which we have agreed.  I have asked the clerk to work with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to put the programme together.<\/p><p>  The second item arising from the minutes is a review of public sector allowances.  We must agree on how we can proceed in the examination.  At last week&rsquo;s meeting we agreed that we would examine the payment of allowances.  To that end, the clerk wrote to all Accounting Officers seeking the details of such payments.  They were informed that it was the intent of the committee that there would be an appropriate follow-up by it on the issue by way of public hearings.  The committee is aware that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, is due to brief it on Thursday, 11 October.  The briefing will form the commencement of the review.  To date, 800 business cases on allowances have been submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the majority of which have argued for the maintenance of the allowances.  We will commence that arrangement after our meeting with the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700003#B01700","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1348736400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>The minutes state it was agreed that the committee would examine the issue of allowance payments as part of its examination of the accounts of public bodies in 2012 and 2013.  It was stated requests would be made to all Accounting Officers and accountable persons for details of payments.  I have read in newspapers and other forums something to the contrary - that we would have speeded-up hearings in some form, with which I do not necessarily disagree.  What I do disagree with is one member of the committee, be it the Chairman or whoever else, dictating in the media and the public domain what the committee will do without recourse to the committee and its members before we have a meeting to discuss what we will do.  That is not how a committee operates.  Members of a committee should be treated fairly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700003#B01800","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speech","time":1348736400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>That is fine.

The business cases have been made, but the information is not complete.  Therefore, it is important, when we request information, that we receive a list of allowances in each Department, the amounts  of the allowances, the numbers in receipt of allowances and the total amount.  It is also important that we receive an indication of the average salaries of grades receiving allowances or those in receipt of the lowest and highest salaries and those who are in the middle in order that the information is complete.  We know from the business cases made that some have provided the information, while others have not.  If we are to be successful in identifying where we think savings could be made, we will need to know how much we are talking about in each instance.<\/p><p>  My second point relates to how the Chairman envisages matters proceeding from when the Minister comes before the committee.

That work provides an overview of financial management and propriety issues across the third level education sector and allows us to identify issues that are common across a number of institutions and matters in individual institutions that are exceptional or unexpected.  Special Report No. 78 was compiled to draw attention to a range of matters of potential sector-wide interest.<\/p><p>  The third level sector as a whole receives State grants amounting to about &euro;1.4 billion per year.  This includes current, capital and research grant funding provided by the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills.  Grants in lieu of undergraduate student fees are part of this total.  Further substantial State project funding for many of the institutions is provided in the form of research grants from public bodies such as Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p>  At the end of the academic year 2011, it is estimated that the total cash to hand across universities and institutes was in excess of &euro;700 million, held in commercial bank accounts.  In addition to student fees paid in advance of the start of the academic year, these balances included substantial research project funding received in advance and held as deferred income.  In responding to the report, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, pointed out that it has taken action to slow down payments in respect of its grant funding to take account of the institutions' cashflows at particular times of the year.  The report concludes that it may be worthwhile reviewing the State's wider treasury management policy and considering the merits of providing for a sweeping up of surplus funding in third level institutions and other State bodies.  Part of the balances held by institutions relate to advances of banking concession fees and pension related reserves.<\/p><p>  Access to sizeable student and staff populations on campus represents a commercial opportunity for third level institutions.  Most institutions receive concession fees from commercial banks in return for the right to deliver banking services on campus.  The amount received across the sector averages around &euro;10 million per year, often received in the form of lump sums for five or even ten year contracts.  In most cases, the institutions assign revenue from the bank concessions for a range of current and future development activities, but the audits found situations where concession income was transferred directly to subsidiary companies and to restricted reserves rather than being accrued as annual income.  The report concludes that there would be merit in a review of the application of such concession income across the sector to ensure there is an agreed State policy covering its use in accordance with wider education objectives.<\/p><p>  Funded pension schemes in five universities closed to new entrants in 2005.  From then on, new staff joined a university pay-as-you-go model pension scheme.  Up to 2005, the HEA had included an additional 15% of salary costs in the annual core funding provided to the universities to fund the employer contributions to the pension funds.  The normal practice in respect of pay-as-you-go model schemes is that employer contributions are not made, but the HEA continued to pay the additional 15% in respect of staff covered by the model schemes, which it asked the universities to hold in separate pension funds.  At the end of September 2010, the funds held an estimated &euro;46 million.  The HEA pointed out that, separately, the universities were owed almost &euro;12 million in respect of pension payments under the closed pension schemes, so it estimated the net surplus on pensions was around &euro;34 million.  The report concluded that this represents an advance of funding in excess of current requirements.<\/p><p>  An employment control framework for the higher education sector was introduced in July 2009, replacing a blanket Government moratorium on all recruitment and promotion imposed across the public sector in March 2009.  The framework restricted each institution in relation to the number of core staff employed in each grade up to 31 December 2010.  Overall, the restrictions resulted in a reduction in staff numbers within the third level education sector by an estimated 7.3% between the end of 2008 and the end of 2010.  This exceeded the target reduction of 6%.  Over the same period, full-time student numbers increased by an estimated 10.5%.<\/p><p>  After the moratorium and framework were imposed, Trinity College Dublin informed the HEA that it proposed to promote 27 academic staff following an internal promotion process.<\/p> <p>The Higher Education Authority, HEA, advised the university that the employment control framework monitoring committee considered that it would be acting outside the framework in making those appointments and that financial penalties in the form of a reduced recurrent grant in 2011 could apply as a result.  The university proceeded with the promotions with effect from 1 January 2011.  Up to the time our report was completed, no penalties had been imposed on the university.  The HEA will be able to advise the committee on the action taken subsequently.<\/p><p> Many third level education institutions have established subsidiary companies, which typically provide campus services such as catering, accommodation and sporting facilities.  Universities produce consolidated financial statements incorporating the results of subsidiary companies, but some institutes of technology with subsidiaries do not.  To ensure transparency and comparability, it would be desirable for institutions to adopt a consistent approach to reporting the results of subsidiaries.  When the report was being completed, the HEA advised that work was under way to update the codes of governance for higher education bodies, including provisions in respect of the governance of subsidiaries.  Specific issues were noted in respect of subsidiaries in Waterford Institute of Technology and Dublin City University.  At Waterford Institute of Technology, a wide range of campus services is provided by a group of companies but the results are not consolidated in the financial statements of the institute.  The HEA has requested the institute to review the position and submit proposals for any necessary changes in corporate governance.  At Dublin City University, DCU, the results of 11 subsidiary companies are included in consolidated financial statements.  Three DCU subsidiaries, including the company that runs the Helix arts centre, had accumulated substantial losses by September 2009.  The balance sheets of two of the subsidiaries were repaired at September 2010 through capital contributions from DCU totalling &euro;9.8 million.  The university has committed to providing &euro;100,000 per annum for 19 years to meet a funding shortfall for the other subsidiary, and I understand an annual grant of &euro;500,000 is being paid to the Helix centre company.  The presidents will be in a position to update the committee on the financial positions of the subsidiaries and any ongoing subsidies.<\/p><p> Foundations often are established with the aim of raising philanthropic funding for the associated third level institutions, and some universities have received very substantial philanthropic funding through their foundations.  However, given the lack of discretionary income available to foundations, it is common practice for the institutions to provide funding or other support to their respective foundations to meet running costs.  In some cases, the foundations have not succeeded in raising any significant funds.  For example, Waterford Institute of Technology transferred a total of &euro;550,000 to its foundation, which was spent in less than two years without significant donations being raised.  Mary Immaculate College, Limerick transferred a total of &euro;3.84 million to its foundation, including bank concession fee funds, for the acquisition of property along the college perimeter, even though the foundation was not set up as a property holding company.  It would be desirable to ensure transfers from third level institutions to foundations are reported in a transparent manner and occur only on the basis of a demonstrated business case.  The audit of the 2009-10 financial statements found breaches of procedures and lack of economy in transactions administered through the president's office in Waterford Institute of Technology.  The chairman of the institute's governing authority commissioned an in-depth investigation of non-pay expenses in that office over the period 2004 to 2011.  This found there were a number of instances of non-compliance with institute policies and procedures, including with regard to the procurement of taxi and public relations, PR, services, as well as expenses relating to travel and hospitality.  The report concludes that the institute, the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills had taken appropriate steps after the matters surfaced.<\/p><p> The final matter to which I wish to refer relates to an update on the issue of remuneration of senior staff of universities in excess of ministerially approved levels.  The fact there were such payments was reported upon in an earlier special report and most of the payments had ceased.  However, there was disagreement about the amounts involved and whether and how recoupment would be effected.  The Department and the HEA sought to carry out an exercise on a case-by-case basis relating to a five and a half year period to identify the amounts involved, in advance of deciding on what action to take on recoupment.  My office agreed to assist by carrying out a validation process of the estimates, including advising on the design of the data-gathering methodology and sample-based testing of the completeness and accuracy of the returns.  The estimates produced in most cases tested were found to be correct.  The overall estimate amounted to a total of the order of &euro;8 million.  The highest amounts of remuneration in excess of ministerially approved levels were in UCD, UCC and Trinity.  The verification testing found a number of cases in some universities where there was uncertainty about the approved level of remuneration and these were referred back to the HEA for further review and investigation.  The chief executive of the HEA will be able to inform the committee of the results of its further deliberations on those cases when he appears next week.  That probably is sufficient to outline what is in the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700005#D01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348738200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

UCD welcomes the opportunity to discuss with the Committee of Public Accounts the issues raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General report, Matters Arising out of Education Audits, dated February 2012.  By way of background I will provide some facts and figures on UCD and refer members to our briefing paper, which I hope they all have received.  UCD is Ireland&rsquo;s largest comprehensive, research intensive university and ranks among Europe&rsquo;s top universities in the world rankings.  Some indicators of UCD&rsquo;s scale of activity for the 2011-12 year include the total number of students being approximately 25,000, of whom approximately 18,000 are undergraduates and 7,000 are postgraduates.  Moreover, of the total student body, approximately 5,000 are international students.  In addition, UCD delivers courses to more than 4,000 students at overseas locations, including Spain, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore and China.<\/p><p>  Between 2004 and 2009, UCD undertook a major change programme with the goals of enhancing the quality of its educational programmes, growing its research base, enhancing its international footprint, growing its non-Exchequer income streams and developing its campus infrastructure.  During this period, the following fundamental changes were delivered, namely, the restructuring of UCD&rsquo;s academic units from 11 faculties and 85 departments to five colleges and 35 schools, the complete reform of the undergraduate curriculum with the introduction of the modular, semesterised, credit-based UCD Horizons curriculum, reversal of the trend in CAO first preferences and consolidation of UCD&rsquo;s position as leader in first preferences, and the formation of graduate schools to support the largest postgraduate cohort in Ireland.  In addition, there has been major growth in international students such that UCD now hosts one third of all Ireland&rsquo;s full degree international students.<\/p><p>  There was a trebling of research income, a major growth in research outputs of various types, expansion of incubation facilities and innovation services and the establishment of the alliance in innovation between Trinity and UCD.  Moreover, there was completion of a new campus development plan and the launch of a capital programme of &euro;300 million, of which 62% is funded from non-Exchequer sources.  When one uses industry norms, that will create approximately 2,000 construction related jobs.  We also expanded the university&rsquo;s global footprint and overseas income.<\/p><p>  Over the past three years, the university has for the most part maintained the quality of its education and research programmes through changes and efficiencies, thereby absorbing a cut in State income of &euro;58 million or 28%.  Moreover, with 10% fewer staff, including 17% fewer core-funded staff, it accommodated 10% more students.  The financial profile is also presented in our briefing paper.  We have an annual turnover of &euro;411 million, of which &euro;227 million is Exchequer funding and &euro;184 million or 45% is non-Exchequer income.  The university has produced a modest surplus in each of the past three years.<\/p><p>  As for the issues raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, with regard to cash balances, UCD&rsquo;s operational cash balances, as at 30 September 2011, were within the recommended sectoral norms.  In respect of bank concessions, UCD generates &euro;62 million in commercial income per annum.  The university&rsquo;s bank concession income has been used to fund the capital development programme and capital projects on the Belfield campus, which, as I stated, amount to more than &euro;300 million in total, of which 62% is non-Exchequer funding, thereby creating approximately 2,000 jobs.  As for pension related reserves, the pension issues raised in the report are sectoral in nature and UCD has been compliant with the instructions of the HEA at all times with regard to the pension scheme.<\/p> <p>University College Dublin, UCD, has fully complied with all of the provisions of the various employment control frameworks which have been applied to the sector and achieved all of the targeted reductions in core-funded staff numbers which have been imposed.  In the past three years UCD has provided funding for UCD Foundation for running costs of &euro;3.9 million, while UCD has received gifts and pledges of over &euro;40 million.  When benchmarked against other national charities and equivalent UK institutions, this cost-income ratio rates UCD Foundation as among the best in the class.  The main projects to benefit from this fund-raising have been the Science Centre and the Sutherland School of Law, as well as funding for academic posts and student supports.<\/p><p> With regard to higher responsibility allowances for academic staff, UCD notes the conclusions in report No. 78 on the issue of senior staff remuneration.  UCD has confirmed to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, that it will co-operate fully in the steps regarding the reallocation of the moneys in question as set out in the report and as recently advised by the authority with the approval of the relevant Ministers.  It should be noted the allowances in question were halted by UCD in 2009.  However, we wish to reiterate the context in which these allowances had been paid in the period in question and the problems that their cessation has caused.<\/p><p> These allowances were not gratuitous payments to staff but were paid in respect of specific roles such as dean, head of school and college principal which involve significant leadership and management responsibilities over and above the normal academic duties and which are not covered by national salary scales.  In many cases, these duties involved specific objectives relating to the generation of non-Exchequer income for the university, a process which led to a substantial increase in such income in the relevant years.  This income now stands at some &euro;184 million, which represents 45% of UCD&rsquo;s total revenue.  This has contributed to a significant offsetting of the reduction in Exchequer funding in the period in question.  Most of these categories of allowances predated the 1997 Act and the approval provisions which it contains.  Furthermore, the principle of allowances for management posts was acknowledged as recently as 2008 by report No. 43 of the review body on higher pay and management allowances have been approved by the HEA in other institutions.  Allowances of this nature for the functions in question such heads of school, college principal and dean, are the international norm in higher education, the market in which UCD competes in staff recruitment.  In the absence of a prescribed form for seeking or granting approval, UCD notified the HEA annually from 1999 of the detail of these allowances and regularly sought approval.  UCD&rsquo;s legal advice was to the effect that approval by acquiescence had developed over this period of seven years.  When the HEA indicated that it had a problem with these allowances and requested that UCD cease payment, we engaged constructively with it between 2006 and 2008 to work through the contractual issues associated with each of these allowances such that we were able to cease all such allowances by April 2009.  The constructive nature of UCD&rsquo;s approach was acknowledged by the HEA chairman in writing as late as July 2008.  Again, I stress that all of these allowances had ceased by April 2009 and that UCD has indicated its willingness to co-operate with the resolution mechanism put in place by the HEA that will result in specific funds being allocated for student services over and above the normal allocation.  I must stress, however, that, without these incentives, it is becoming increasingly difficult to persuade staff to take on these important leadership and management roles, thereby compromising both the university&rsquo;s international competitiveness and revenue generating capacity.<\/p><p> UCD's financial statements and audits are up to date.

I welcome this opportunity to answer questions the committee may have.  Before doing so, it would be useful to give some context regarding Trinity College Dublin, TCD.  Points of detail on the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report are addressed in the briefing paper previously submitted.<\/p><p>  The college educates 17,000 students, 12,000 undergraduates and 5,000 postgraduates.  We draw students from every county in Ireland, North and South, and all of our students are part of a vibrant university in the heart of the capital city.  Trinity College's mission is to excel in education and research by advancing knowledge and using that knowledge for the benefit of all.  Our education is research-led, with students working alongside their professors giving able students an internationally competitive educational experience.  Widening access to this quality education has long been a key priority for the college.  This year we will be celebrating the 20th year anniversary of our Trinity access programmes which enable students from non-traditional groups, under-represented in higher education, to go to university.  Up to 19% of our students enter through these routes.<\/p><p>  Trinity College's reputation is recognised internationally.  It is the only Irish university in the top 100 world universities and ranks 20th in Europe.  A global university cannot ignore these rankings which measure the provision of a high quality education, impact of research, the employability of graduates globally and international reputation.  The current economic environment poses significant challenges to all Irish universities to maintain or improve the quality of education they offer and compete globally.  Trinity College's annual expenditure is of the order of &euro;320 million.  Approximately one half of its income derives from non-Exchequer sources, mainly student fees, EU and industrial research contracts, commercial and philanthropic activities, and is used to support the college's academic goals.  For example, the income from the bank concession enabled the college to create 40 new non-Exchequer lectureships which support both teaching and research and assist in maintaining the college's ranking.<\/p><p>  Trinity College has recently launched its global relations strategy which will increase the number of international students but will also develop academic linkages with leading universities worldwide.  In line with the Government&rsquo;s policy, it aims to contribute significantly to develop Ireland as a global education hub.

Just 23 years old, DCU is a young and ambitious university.  In its short life, it has grown significantly in scale and impact, with a student population of 11,500 and a ranking in the top 50 young universities in the world, that is, those under 50 years old.  It has a well established reputation for both high quality research and innovation and proactive engagement with enterprise.<\/p><p>  In achieving this level of success, we believe in operating to high standards of corporate governance.  Despite the recession and the significant reductions in Exchequer funding in the past five years, DCU has achieved balanced budgets in each of these years.  It is useful to note that it receives its funding from various sources, with 62% coming from the Exchequer and 38% from non-Exchequer sources.<\/p><p>  Report No. 78 made several observations concerning DCU subsidiary companies.  DCU Commercial Limited has 11 subsidiary companies, the primary objective of which is to generate income to support the university in delivering its strategic mission.  The companies mainly provide facilities and services for the campus and some, owing to the nature of their activities, will not make significant surpluses.  Nevertheless, by 30 September 2012, the group will have generated surpluses of &euro;21 million, with &euro;3 million being generated in the past five difficult years.  These funds have been used to support the university and some of the subsidiary companies, especially at an early stage in their development.<\/p><p>  Report No. 78 makes specific reference to three of the subsidiaries.  First, the Helix, established in 2002, is a top class performing arts and conferencing centre which brings thousands of people to the DCU campus each year.  It is at the heart of student life on campus and provides a wide range of facilities for the university and the local community, in a particularly deprived area.  It incurred significant losses in its early years.<\/p> <p>Given the importance of the Helix and its particular value to DCU, it has been supported by the other commercial companies and the university.  Its balance sheet was repaired in September 2010 through a capital contribution of &euro;7.4 million from subsidiary company profits, as approved by the governing authority of the university.<\/p><p> The DCU Ryan Academy for Entrepreneurship is a leading supporter of entrepreneurship and innovation in Ireland and a key element of DCU's strategy as a university enterprise.  Owing to the nation of its activities, it will never make significant surpluses.  In 2011 we negotiated philanthropic support for a four year period which will enable it to break even each year in that period.  It runs many successful programmes, one of which, the propeller programme, created 49 new jobs through start-ups in the past year and a half.<\/p><p> Invent DCU, the third element of our strategy in innovation, was built at a cost of just under &euro;7 million.  It is our innovation and enterprise centre and plays a key role in our innovation strategy.  A fund-raising campaign successfully raised 72% of the overall cost, which obviated the need to resort to bank borrowings.  The balance of the funding is being made up by a contribution from DCU Commercial Limited revenues at a rate of &euro;100,000 per annum for 19 years.<\/p><p> Report No. 78 highlights payments to university staff in excess of those approved by the Minister.  Arising from organisational restructuring to take account of our rapid growth, allowances of just over &euro;53,000 in total were paid over a 6.5 year period, between 2005 and 2011, to senior staff who undertook significant additional duties.  All such allowances were terminated by us in September 2011.  The HEA has also proposed a resolution of this issue which we fully accept.  After consultation with the Students Union, DCU has agreed to allocate 50% of the amount to additional student services in the area of counselling, while the other 50% will be deducted from our future funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700007#F00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian MacCraith","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348739400,"counter":81,"content":"<p>May we publish the statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700008#G00200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348739400,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian MacCraith"},{"type":"speech","time":1348739400,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I call on Dr. Ruaidhr&iacute; Neavyn of Waterford Institute of Technology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700008#G00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348739400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Waterford Institute of Technology welcomes the opportunity to advise the Committee of Public Accounts on matters referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The institute accepts the conclusions of the report.  I would like to concentrate on the changes the institute has put in place to deal with the matters raised and emphasise the priority it has given to this task.<\/p><p>  Regarding expenses incurred by the office of the president, the institute's governing body commissioned Deloitte to carry out a review of non-pay expenses incurred by the office.  It is acknowledged by the institute, the Comptroller and Auditor General and Deloitte that breaches of procedure did occur.  However, such breaches were confined to the office of the president, as a further review of internal financial controls across the institute did not identify issues which caused concern for the audit committee.  Since these matters were brought to light, enhanced control procedures have been put in place, which include the following: travel and related expenditure in respect of the president&rsquo;s office is pre-approved; all expenditure in respect of the office is co-authorised; the governing body regularly reviews all expenditure incurred by the office; consultancy costs have been significantly reduced; WIT corporate cards have been withdrawn; procedures and policies in respect of procurement, travel and hospitality have been reviewed and revised, where necessary; and additional control procedures have been implemented in respect of purchase order approvals.  Further, I advise members that a legal case is pending between the former president and the institute.<\/p><p>  Regarding non-academic services, in 1990 the institute's board of management established a committee to create student services that could not otherwise be provided.  The model was largely based on similar models within the university sector and proved very successful with a wide range of excellent student services being developed.  The committee subsequently established a company structure.  Funding from student capitation revenue was transferred to provide necessary student services.  The committee annually informed the institute's governing body of its financial results and development plans.<\/p><p>  Following consideration of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the HEA's request to consolidate the financial transactions of the companies, the institute's governing body has now commenced this process.  The actions taken to date include the secondment of the institute's finance manager to oversee the consolidation process; the commissioning of Grant Thornton to review diverse campus services, its activities, financial controls and governance since its establishment with a view to providing recommendations on how best to proceed; communication with WIT and diverse campus services staff of the decision to proceed with implementing the Grant Thornton recommendations; review of the financial, human resources and legal arrangements of the companies; liaison with legal advisers on the potential implications of consolidation, including the legal basis for consolidation, company structures and employee status. The institute is in regular contact with the HEA on this matter and has been providing it with updates throughout the process.<\/p><p>  Regarding financial transactions with foundations, the institute established a foundation in 2005 at a time when other higher education institutions were generating substantial philanthropic income.  Senior institute management was confident that a foundation would do likewise for WIT.  It was planned that any income generated would be ring-fenced to support a number of scholarship, student support and capital development initiatives.  As stated in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, \"The Foundation has not been successful in that it failed to raise ... significant funds for the Institute and its activities have since ceased\".  The company was wound up in 2011.  Although the project had merit, it was of a different time and the subsequent economic downturn meant that the foundation ultimately did not succeed.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report acknowledges the circumstances prevailing at the time.<\/p><p>  I reassure members that all issues raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report are being addressed and continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700008#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ruaidhr&iacute; Neavyn"},{"type":"speech","time":1348739400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>May we publish Dr. Neavyn's statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700008#G00600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348739400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Please do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700008#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ruaidhr&iacute; Neavyn"},{"type":"speech","time":1348739400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I welcome the university and institute of technology heads and thank them for coming.

They are to be commended, therefore, for maintaining their levels of educational achievement throughout this period.

I note that my <i>alma mater<\/i>, NUI Galway, has escaped being sanctioned or called.  I can only assume that it has a good reputation.<\/p><p>  I want to start with the issue of the 27 staff promotions at Trinity College.  According to the report, a decision was made in 2008 to start looking at internal promotions.  That process was brought to a conclusion in 2009 and those to be promoted were identified.  The HEA states the employment control framework in place at the time prevented such a course being taken; nevertheless, a decision was still made to go ahead with the promotion of 27 staff, albeit at a later time in 2011.

It is not exactly accurate to describe it in the way he has.  When we met the HEA on 16 June 2010, we told it that we had these 27 staff who had been involved in the process for a year and a half and that we wanted to proceed with the promotions at the expiry of the employment control framework, which was due to expire at the end of that year - in other words, December 2010.  The HEA's view was it was not unreasonable to proceed with the promotions on 1 January 2011, as there was no employment control framework in place at the time.  We had to make the decision and communicated with the staff members whom we were going to promote at the expiry of the employment control framework.  It turned out subsequently - I suppose nobody, neither the HEA nor any others, was to know this - that, after we had made the decision and written to the staff concerned that they were to be promoted on 1 January 2011, a new employment control framework was supposed to be put in place.  It was, in fact, put in place in March 2011.  However, we could not reverse the decision taken.  We had to go ahead and promote the staff concerned because we had said we were going to do this.  We had a commitment to them.  We promoted them in January 2011, three months ahead of the putting in place of the new employment control framework in March.

The basic problem is that one has salary scales up to and including professor and one has set salary scales at, for example, the president's level, but what one does not have is set salary scales for heads of departments and schools, deans and college principals.  That could have been dealt with in two ways.  In many universities across the world, it is dealt with by simply recognising that it is a different job and carries a different salary.  We took the approach that it is better for this to be an allowance because those individuals will then move back into their regular academic job after the completion of their post as, for example, dean, and will not have a long-term pension liability.

The objective of the DCU commercial suite of companies is to generate non-Exchequer income profits to enable the university to deliver on its strategic intent.  That is their function.  In terms of the Helix, since 2008 there has been a subvention of &euro;500,000 per annum of non-Exchequer funds from the university to the Helix.  The university does not inject income into any of the other subsidiaries.  The rationale for this is twofold.  One is the actual financial benefit we get from having the Helix for running events, including graduations and so on, in respect of which we obtain lower rates.  The net value to us is of the order of &euro;200,000.  We have brought this to the attention of the governing authority.  More significantly, the role of the Helix is way beyond its financial value.  The footfall it brings to campus is approximately 250,000 per annum.  In terms of promotion of the university, that is significant.  The Deputy may be aware of the region in which DCU is located.

The other issue I wish to raise is cash balances across all the colleges.  People will be surprised to read in page 13 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report of the net cash balances in the universities and institutes of technology.  At the end of 2010 there was &euro;573 million in cash sitting in the bank.  At the end of the 2011 academic year there was &euro;706 million cash in the bank.  That is an increase of &euro;133 million in cash sitting in the third level institutions' bank accounts.  I am not directing this specifically to Trinity College.  It is an increase of 23%.  As a member of this committee I will be asking the Accounting Officer of the Department of Education and Skills how he was able to preside over increasing cash balances in the third level institutions' bank accounts when we were making cuts to special needs assistants, increasing pupil-teacher ratios, cutting back on capital expenditure and cutting DEIS schools.  It utterly defies all logic.  Chairman, I ask you to write to the Accounting Officer of that Department to explain how he can preside over those cash balances while savage cuts are being made in education that affect special needs assistants, disadvantaged schools, pupil-teacher ratios, school transport and so forth.  We are accumulating millions in increases in the cash balances of the third level institutions.  It will not happen next year.  It might be happening in 2012 but it will not happen in 2013.

The point the report made was that a new system was brought in to better allocate funding from the Exchequer to universities.  It wanted to come up with a way to understand the use of staff time and the resulting outputs.  One of the observations in the conclusion is that a fundamental building block within the model is staff time, particularly how it is allocated.  The report states that in early 2009, the staff representative bodies recommended their members should not engage or co-operate with data collection.  It went on to state that the inclusion of actual hours worked in the form would facilitate the evaluation of the contribution of individual academics.

There is a sweep of activities on which we need each of the academic units to deliver.  We use the academic workload model to determine the distribution of that work within the particular college.  If somebody in our business school is less research - active, he or she is likely to do twice as much teaching as somebody engaged in research.

It was in response to our request for help in understanding the comparative levels of pay between professors across countries.  The following information was provided in that report.  In Ireland the starting point on the salary scale for university professors was &euro;113,000, rising to &euro;145,000, depending on levels of performance.  In the United Kingdom the starting salary was &euro;67,000, rising to &euro;124,000.  In the United States the starting salary was &euro;79,000 but it rose considerably.

The University of Edinburgh, the university against which we often benchmark Trinity College, has closer to 12 students per staff member.

Trinity College collaborates closely with many universities in the higher education system, including University College Dublin.

Much has happened in the past year separately from the international panel report to which the Deputy refers and which I have not yet seen either.  For example, Dublin City University has formed a major, deep partnership with NUI Maynooth and the Royal College of Surgeons.  Launched by the Taoiseach in June 2012, this three year partnership will be a significant vehicle for DCU in terms of academic programmes, research, internationalisation and other activities.  In parallel, an international panel which, in contrast to the other international panel that produced the recent report, consulted all the institutions involved, made a recommendation in the area of teacher education where close to 20 locations were providing approximately 40 programmes.  Its recommendation to reduce the number of teacher education institutions to six is being actively implemented, with St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, the Mater Dei Institute of Education and the Church of Ireland College of Education all moving into Dublin City University.

Waterford Institute of Technology runs courses with media and communications elements and courses with a large telecommunications or electronics component.  The presence of radio and television studios is not uncommon on the sites of institutes of technology and we believed sharing such facilities between two State agencies would be a good approach to take.  In addition, we believe it is important to share expertise.  Social media and new technologies in media and broadcasting techniques will be best advanced or developed in the environment of a student centre and certain advantages can be obtained from such an arrangement.  The project will involve shared services and new technologies in media.  Waterford Institute of Technology has a proud and strong record in that regard, for example, in the Telecommunications Software &amp;amp; Systems Group, TSSG, a research group based in our Carriganore campus.  The interaction between RTE and the institute will help to evolve and develop our existing courses in the media and communications area.  That is the position in a nutshell.

One of the things we recognised after the issues were raised with F&Aacute;S was that we needed to change what we were doing with regard to propriety matters and in 2009 we developed a programme of work that focuses more on propriety issues, such as expenses, remuneration of chief executives and so on.  Another response since then has been the further development and revision of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies to require the disclosure in financial statements of the remuneration of chief executives and of the expenses they incur.  Had those things been in place, we might have picked on the issue sooner.<\/p><p>  In fairness to Mr. McFeely, I would make the point that we began to apply our new programme with the 2009 audits, which we carried out in 2010.  Mr. McFeely and WIT have traditionally been one of the first to produce draft financial statements.  We would have been carrying out our audit of the 2008-09 financial statements at the time we were developing the propriety framework.  Therefore, we were not focusing on those issues during the audit and would not have found or picked up on them.  We would, of course, have drawn the institute's attention to anything we found in our management letter.  In our 2010 propriety work, we picked up on some of the issues and these were mentioned in the management letter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700022#V01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1348747800,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I am disappointed to have to say this, but while I understand it was some years ago, I am very disappointed that the audits conducted by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2006, 2007 and 2008 did not pick up on these issues.<\/p><p>  We have Waterford Institute of Technology here today to answer questions on what went on in those years.  Now, however, we find that the taxpayers' watchdog audited the accounts, but did not pick up on what was going on.  That is serious.  I understand that Mr. McCarthy has said that following the 2009 audit they started developing a programme to catch these issues.  However, this committee must ask what has not been picked up last year and this year or what will not be picked up next year and whether a programme will be developed to pick up on those things in five years time when the Committee of Public Accounts of the next D&aacute;il is examining these issues.  Will they say then, \"We used not look at those things in those years, but we have now developed a programme for them\"?<\/p><p>  Public confidence in the annual audit process of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has been dented somewhat by this.  I am happy the office has done a special report and has caught up on these issues, although late in the day.  However, we and the public generally take some comfort from the fact that the office conducts an audit and finds no major issues, but now, three or four years after the audit, we are told the office did not look specifically at the issues but now as a result of what happened with F&Aacute;S, it is looking at them.  It will be something else in another couple of years.  Where does Mr. McCarthy think the risks are for the audits just completed and published in the report today?  Perhaps he did not have a programme to examine specific issues he may feel in three years time he should have examined.  My confidence in the office is dented somewhat now as a result of what I have heard here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700022#V01200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348747800,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I am sorry that is the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700022#V01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1348747800,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I mean historically, of course.

The danger is that one is always fighting the last war in one's approach to current issues.  We try to identify the key risks that arise with regard to any entity we audit and try to put the emphasis on what we see as those key risks.  In the period the Deputy speaks of, my recollection is that the expenditure in Waterford Institute of Technology would have been approximately &euro;80 million to &euro;90 million euro per year.  We would have focused on the bulk of the spending, on pay areas and so on.<\/p><p>  The lesson we have learned from the F&Aacute;S experience - and other Deputies made this point - is that there is a question of confidence around public bodies and that we must address that in the audit.  That is the reason that since 2009, we have been putting more emphasis in our audit on those areas of propriety, such as travel and subsistence, remuneration and payments in excess of entitlement, an issue we reported on previously with regard to the universities.  However, the resource required to bring out the level of detail that has been brought out by Deloitte and Grant Thornton is a level of resource we do not have.  One can drill down in considerable detail and generally come back with some concerns.<\/p> <p>Sample-based auditing is not going to catch everything.  One would hope that it would catch a significant amount and give one enough pointers to where one might need to redirect or refocus attention.  The point about Waterford is that in the testing we did in areas like procurement, travel and subsistence over the years, we picked up relatively little because, as I understand it, the issues were specifically confined to the president's office.  In general, the institute is well run, with good controls in place.  That was our conclusion over the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012092700022#V01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348748400,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I raised the question because expenditure started at &euro;30,000, which was a reasonable amount, but it travelled some distance to &euro;180,000 and from there to &euro;635,000.

I cannot accept the explanation given by the governing bodies that some of the auditing committees are voluntary.  If a person is appointed to a committee of that kind and has a job to do, whether voluntary or otherwise, he or she has a responsibility to carry out that job to the finest level of detail.  That is the reality of a position on an auditing committee.

On behalf of the council, I thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to appear here to publicly explain our assessments.  The council has found earlier feedback from the committee extremely useful in developing the content of our reports.  The other council members in attendance today are Mr. Sebastian Barnes, Professor Alan Barrett and Dr. Donal Donovan.  Unfortunately, Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan, who is based in the United States of America, cannot attend today.  The council's secretariat is also present, namely, Ms Rachel Joyce, Ms Eimear Leahy and Mr. Diarmaid Smyth.<\/p><p>  Today we will deal with our third fiscal assessment report, which was published on 13 September.  The report is written in line with the mandate of the council, set out in the fiscal responsibility Bill.  The main purpose of this report is to assess the macro-economic and budgetary projections set out by the Government in the stability programme update, SPU, published in April 2012, including the appropriateness of the overall fiscal stance for the period to 2015, in advance of budget 2013.  The report also sets out some background for our planned future assessments of compliance with fiscal rules.  A number of themes are developed in this report.  These include the uncertainty that surrounds economic and budgetary forecasts, the large size of remaining adjustments required for debt sustainability and the importance of transparency in the recording of revisions in the Government's fiscal accounts and plans.  <\/p><p>  In assessing the Government's macro-economic forecasts, a multi-step approach is followed.  First, we assess the performance of past forecasts, using the most recently available national accounts data.  Second, we compare the Government's forecast with contemporaneous forecasts from other agencies.  Third, we examine the pattern of revisions to the forecasts and, fourth, we explore the uncertainties surrounding the forecasts using past forecast errors to develop confidence intervals around the forecasts of different horizons.<\/p><p>  The national income and expenditure accounts for 2011, released in July, estimate that annual real GDP growth in 2011 was 1.4%.  This was higher than official forecasts, while real GNP growth in 2011 was almost three percentage points lower than forecast by the Department of Finance in 2011.  An analysis of the forecast errors over the period 1995 to 2011 indicates that the pattern of past forecast errors is similar across the main forecasting agencies and does not show evidence of bias.  Current Department of Finance forecasts for 2012 to 2015 are also similar to the forecast of other agencies.  In general, forecasters remain of the view that growth rates of about 3% will return over a two to three year horizon, although earlier forecasts of such a rebound have not materialised.  <\/p><p>  The uncertainties surrounding the growth outlook for the Irish economy, highlighted in the council's previous report, remain and are illustrated in this report through the use of fan charts.  A fan chart shows the uncertainty that surrounds the forecasts at different horizons.  The council sees the risks to growth as being weighted to the downside.  More generally, we recommend that this uncertainty should be more explicitly factored into the presentation of official forecasts through a more detailed sensitivity analysis.  <\/p><p>  In assessing the budgetary projections, the council again follows a multi-step approach.  First, we review the accuracy of past Department of Finance forecasts, including a detailed examination of data and forecast revisions.  Second, we examine the SPU projections, using the most recent Exchequer data.  Third, we compare the SPU forecasts with contemporaneous forecasts of other agencies and, fourth, we explore the uncertainty surrounding the projections using a combination of fiscal fan charts and sensitivity analysis.<\/p><p>  The general Government deficit, adjusted for the impact of banking related transfers, is estimated to have improved to 9% of GDP last year.  This is approximately &euro;1.2 billion better than had been anticipated in last December's budget.  For 2012, the forecast for the general Government deficit was revised to 8.3% of GDP in the SPU, from 8.6% in the budget.  This reflected, in part, revisions to interest payments and the impact of banking related revenues.  The council is of the view that a general Government deficit of 8.3% of GDP for 2012 looks achievable at this stage, based on the cumulative trends in the Exchequer data and the economic outlook.  That said, there have been significant spending overruns in health and social protection over the first eight months of the year.  There has also been a notable increase in non-tax revenues, partly related to the State's involvement in the banking sector.  These sources of income should be closely monitored.  <\/p><p>  There were a number of significant changes to the official budgetary data and forecasts over the past year.  To facilitate adequate assessment of budgetary projections, the council urges that comprehensive and timely explanations be provided on methodological changes in data revisions that impact on the fiscal outturn or official forecasts, on sources of major modifications to the forecasts and on the components of non-tax revenues.  <\/p><p>  For the period 2013 to 2015, the SPU budgetary projections are in line with projections from other agencies.  This outlook is heavily dependent on achieving significant reductions in Government expenditures and a sustained upturn in growth.  Given the extent of the required total adjustment, the council again urges that all adjustment margins be kept under close review, including tax rates, public sector pay and pensions and welfare rates.  In light of the uncertainty surrounding the growth outlook and a suggestion from this committee previously, the report also considered the sensitivity of the budgetary projections to changes in the macro-economic outlook, including the use of fan charts.  This analysis serves, once again, to highlight the fragility of debt sustainability.  <\/p><p>  The council's view on the appropriate fiscal stance was again widely reported, following the publication of the report.  As in earlier reports, the appropriateness of the fiscal stance is analysed in terms of a trade-off between supporting domestic demand and ensuring debt sustainability.  The council assesses the Government's current fiscal stance to be conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management.  However, debt sustainability and creditworthiness remain fragile.  <\/p> <p>Weighing up the risks relating to debt sustainability and ongoing weakness in the real economy, the council supports an alternative fiscal stance involving a total of &euro;1.9 billion of additional adjustments in the period to 2015 compared to the Government's baseline.  This alternative stance does not involve additional adjustments beyond the &euro;3.5 billion planned for 2013.  Due to a continued weakness in demand and some further improvement in market assessments of Ireland's creditworthiness, the amount of additional adjustment for the period to 2015 has been scaled back by &euro;900 million since our previous report.  Model-based projections indicate that this alternative scenario would help with the debt-to-GDP ratio and a faster downward trajectory and would provide additional insurance, albeit limited, in the effort to ensure debt sustainability.  While we recognise possible rationales for a separate stimulus programme, balancing various considerations, the council is of the view that any relaxation sought by the Government in the overall fiscal stance should be examined within the context of the main fiscal adjustment programme.  The council does not see a case for a relaxation of the fiscal stance at present.<\/p><p> Debt sustainability remains fragile and judgments on this issue are coloured by whether it is believed GDP or GNP provides the most appropriate measure of Ireland's fiscal capacity.  Both GDP and GNP have limitations as measures of fiscal capacity.  In the report the council introduces a hybrid measure, which places a differential weight on GNP and the excess of GDP over GNP, as an intermediate measure of fiscal capacity.  The required fiscal adjustment appears challenging under all three measures, but above all under the GNP measure.  While relief on the banking-related part of Ireland's debt is unlikely to be a panacea, any relief will increase the chances of a successful outcome.  This will be measured by a robust return to market creditworthiness.<\/p><p> In terms of fiscal rules, Ireland has an obligation to comply with the EU Stability and Growth Pact, revised in 2011, and the fiscal compact, which is being implemented in national law through the fiscal responsibility Bill.  While the details are complicated, in essence the rules relate to the structural budget balance.  This is consistent with the EU's medium-term objective or budgetary rule and a debt reduction requirement, known as the debt rule.  To explore the implications of the fiscal rules, the report also presents an illustrative scenario that extends to 2020.  The assumptions mirror those in the stability programme update, SPU, for the period to 2015.  For the period 2016 to 2020, the scenario assumes average nominal growth of approximately 3.4% per year and a gradual closing of the output gap by 2018.  It also assumes expenditure growth will be approximately flat in real terms.  The scenarios assessed are consistent with meeting the budgetary rule throughout the period and meeting the debt rule after 2018, when it will become binding.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it today.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has been up and running for more than one year now, during which time it has produced four reports.  Although the council will not be on a statutory basis until later in the year, we hope it has already had a positive impact on the public understanding of budgetary management.  Anyway, the council's main value will be for the long term.  At all times the council will strive to be independent and objective and to provide a voice in the best interests of sound fiscal policy.  We look forward to taking the committee's questions and hearing the views of members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700003#C00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348751400,"counter":599,"content":"<p>In order to have a good question and answer session this afternoon I appeal to people to keep their contributions short and to the point, if possible.

It is an important contribution to the debate on the public finances, which will feed into the preparation of the budget in December.  From reading the report and listening to the opening remarks of Professor McHale, the centrality of growth becomes clear.  It seems that during recent years the halo of 3% growth is always next year or the year after but it has never come.  Despite this we are basing all our fiscal projections on 3% real GDP growth in 2014.  The Government is forecasting 2.2% real GDP growth for next year, although I suspect this will probably be revised downwards in the medium-term fiscal statement next month.  Where does the council believe that growth will come from?  It seems it would require a spectacular performance by exports over a sustained period to have real GDP growth of 3% on average in the coming years given that all the other elements of output are likely to remain depressed.  Consumer demand in Ireland is likely to continue to contract because of the effect of the forthcoming budgets, Government spending will reduce and the environment for private sector investment does not appear to be especially positive at the moment.  The concern I expressed last year in the budget debate was that we continue to be too optimistic in some of the forecasts.  These form the basis of the plan to bring Ireland to within the 3% deficit target.  I am keen to hear the council's views in this regard.<\/p><p>  The council has addressed the issue of debt sustainability in its report.  It indicated there is a 40% chance that the debt-to-GDP ratio will fail to come under control by 2015.  Is it possible that this risk is higher?  Ultimately, does it not come down to economic growth?  At the moment there is no evidence that growth is materialising.  Since the council signed off on the report before us, the latest CSO quarterly accounts have been published.  They show GDP to be absolutely flat in quarter 2 at 0.0%.  There was an unexpected rise in GDP but that has been explained by an anomaly relating to profit inflows.  The forecast this year, a modest 0.7% growth, may not be achieved and the projected 2.2% growth for next year appears to be optimistic at the moment.  I am keen to hear the council's views in this regard.<\/p><p>  The council also addressed the need for the Government to keep adjustments under review, including in tax rates, public sector pay, pensions and welfare rates.  The council will be aware that this runs contrary to commitments made in the programme for Government and repeated several times by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  Recently, the Government recommitted itself to maintaining the Croke Park agreement through to 2014.  How difficult will it be to achieve an adjustment of &euro;3.5 billion in the coming budget without touching any of the three pillars that the Government indicated it would not revisit?<\/p><p>  I am keen to hear the council's views on the statement by the three finance Ministers from Germany, the Netherlands and Finland some days ago.  It would appear to unravel to some extent the spirit of the agreement reached by the Heads of State and Government last June.  What impact will this development have?  It seems the markets have factored into their thinking that Ireland will get some deal on the banking debt but it appears that if this does take place it will be some distance down the road when the single supervisory authority is up and running and has had its effectiveness proved.  That is some distance away.  The number of caveats and the conditionality set out in statement of two nights ago causes us some concern on the fiscal side and I am keen to hear the council's views in this regard.<\/p><p>  The council recommended an extra &euro;1.9 billion in fiscal consolidation.  I realise the recommendation is not for next year but for 2014 and, substantially, 2015.  The council has referred to trying to strike a balance between reducing the deficit and not killing the economy completely.  This indicates that the council does not have full faith in the forecasts made or that it does not have confidence that, under the current strategy, projections and policy parameters, we will reach a 3% deficit by 2015.  Is the council confident this will be achieved?  Will the delegation explain how?  It is a difficult sell for ordinary people, who are reeling from the effects of recent budgets.  They know what is coming in future budgets as well.  How would the council explain that the imposition of an additional &euro;1.9 billion would be the right thing to do in the coming years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700004#D00300","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348751400,"counter":601,"content":"<p>These are important questions.  Deputy McGrath suggested that growth is absolutely central to our pulling our way out of this crisis.  One thing we stress in the report is the significant uncertainty that surrounds the growth prospects of the Irish economy, given that we are in a post-bubble economy whose dynamics are hard to predict.<\/p> <p>We also have a volatile international environment.  Once a bubble bursts, there can be all sorts of adverse feedback effects which feed on each other and harm growth for a number of years.  Problems in the banking sector spill over to the fiscal sector and problems in the fiscal sector spill back to the banking sector as the credibility of guarantees declines and holdings of Government assets are marked down on the balance sheets of the banks.  As the fiscal sector adjusts this hurts demand in the real economy while decline in the real economy feeds back to worsen the fiscal situation.  As the banking sector is impaired this harms credit growth, which harms the real economy, and as the real economy deteriorates this, in turn, harms the banks.  All these adverse feedback loops can pull down growth and lead to a very uncertain growth environment. <\/p><p> I would stress the uncertainty aspect.  It is not all bleak.  If one can start to turn these dynamics around things can turn around fairly quickly.  This is not easy to do and is certainly not guaranteed.  There is, however, an upside.  The Deputy mentioned the assumption that the economy will return to an underlying trend growth rate close to 3%.  This is what modellers have been assuming will happen when these adverse feedbacks begin to turn around and domestic demand begins to turn around.<\/p><p> In the report, we draw on the literature on financial and economic crises that have followed the bursting of property bubbles in other countries, such as Japan.  Economies can go through a long period during which things are pretty flat.  In the report, we highlight the pattern of downward revisions to the forecasts as one comes closer to the date.  We include a graph showing that some earlier forecasts assumed that by 2012 we would be back to 3% growth.  Of course, that did not happen and the forecasts are continually revised downward.  This suggests that there is a downside risk.  Beyond the issue of uncertainty, we think the risks are to the down side and that we could be in for quite a flat period.  That, of course, has important fiscal implications that should be planned for.  It will make it hard to reach the target for a general Government deficit of less than 3% by 2015.<\/p><p> One of the things that contributes to low growth is fiscal adjustment.  We are well aware of the adverse effect fiscal adjustment has on the economy.  It is, however, important to note that the economy is facing other headwinds besides fiscal adjustment.  Let me deal with the Deputy's fourth question, because it relates to this, and I will come back to the others.  We think of an appropriate fiscal stance as a balancing act between trying to support the economy as much as possible in the here and now, while people's lives are being hugely affected by the state of the economy, and trying to ensure debt sustainability.  Debt sustainability can sound like an abstract thing that cannot be compared to the pain people are experiencing now with unemployment and so on.  Part of the concern about debt sustainability, however, is that if we were to lose control of the debt, with the debt-to-GDP ratio on an upward path and looking as though there were no chance of getting it under control, we could certainly lose access to market funding and maybe to official funding as well.  Certainly, official funding would come with much stricter conditionality and tougher fiscal adjustment, and possibly a fourth restructuring of the debt.  It is that risk that requires that we take action and plan for actions to prevent such unsustainability.  It is also a concern about the real economy because it is a forestalling of a very serious risk in the future.  That is the balancing act we are dealing with.  <\/p><p> One could ask why we are engaging in the fiscal adjustment at all.  I think everyone realises it is because we have to get our fiscal situation under control.  The job is not fully done and, particularly with the uncertainties about growth the Deputy mentioned, there is a significant probability it will not be done if we get a bad draw on that growth.  In the report, we estimate there is a 40% probability that the debt-to-GDP ratio will not have stabilised by 2015, given these uncertainties about growth.  It is to make sure the job gets done, or to improve the chances that the job gets done, that we are recommending those additional adjustments.<\/p><p> In terms of keeping the various margins of adjustment under review, we note in the report that the planned adjustment to 2015, particularly on the expenditure side, is daunting, with two thirds of the &euro;8.6 billion being on the expenditure side.  We estimate that the average reduction in real expenditure is about 3.5% per year.  This is a very significant, almost unprecedented, reduction, coming on top of big reductions so far.  The more one narrows the margins of adjustment the harder it will be.  Where the adjustment does take place - in health services, for example - the damage caused to people can be very great.  We think it better to keep all margins on the table.  We are concerned that a political equilibrium may be reached under which different sides are able to take different things off the table.  This would make for a more damaging and, potentially, less feasible adjustment.  If the adjustment is that damaging it will be less credible and it will be harder to regain our market creditworthiness.  For that reason, we think it is important to keep all margins under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348752000,"counter":603,"content":"<p>How difficult will the forthcoming budget be, with those three pillars off the table?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700005#E00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348752000,"counter":604,"content":"<p>The fewer margins there are to adjust, the more difficult it will be.  The more margins there are to adjust, so that one can spread the adjustment out and be more targeted in minimising the damage, the less damaging the adjustments will be.<\/p><p>  With regard to the statement from the three European finance Ministers, I can give a personal rather than a council view, because this is not something we have had an opportunity to discuss at length.  I was never optimistic that the taking of direct stakes in Irish banks by the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, was going to yield large benefits.  Part of that was the result of scepticism: if the ESM did take stakes in the Irish banks, which was a big \"if\", it was unlikely to pay that much more than the market value of the banks.  It could pay somewhat more.  The banks might be more valuable in the hands of the ESM, as a different owner, than in the hands of the State, although that could be argued, but the gain was likely to be relatively small.  <\/p><p>  To the extent that the EMS funds were used to pay down gross debt, they could reduce Ireland's gross debt.  However, one of the things we emphasise on the council - which will be the focus of a forthcoming paper from the council and will be emphasised in our next report - is the importance of looking at the broader State balance sheet and not just at gross debt.  When one sells assets one reduces one's assets.  One may be able to reduce one's liabilities as well, but it is the net effect and how the financial standing of the State is changed that really matters.  The statement from the three finance Ministers makes it less likely that much progress will be made there, at least in the near term.  I do not think much was likely to come from the arrangement in any event so I am not sure the statement contains any new bad news to be worried about.  The reaction in bond yields was minor; they ticked up a little as a result of the announcement.  I have not had a chance to check them today.<\/p> <p>In fact, the action is likely to be elsewhere.  My sense of the issue, which is not as exciting as the alternative, is that a restructuring of the promissory note and emergency lending assistance, ELA, type of arrangements, might do more to reduce the real burden of the debt.  It is difficult to explain to the public why those benefits are accruing, but the outcome in terms of the current discounted value of the debt could be quite significant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348752600,"counter":606,"content":"<p>Is Professor McHale saying that the June summit statement was not as ground-breaking or important a game changer as it was presented or interpreted to be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700006#F00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348752600,"counter":607,"content":"<p>That was my view, as I stated at the time.

It is very useful to have the information collated in this manner from the various sources.  This is the council's third report since it was established, albeit not on a statutory footing.  It is not often I have cause to welcome any decision by the Government, given its current direction, but I did welcome its decision to ignore the report's recommendation in regard to additional fiscal adjustments.  While the council has in fact rowed back in this latest report on the scale of additional adjustments it recommends, it continues to argue for some &euro;1.9 billion in further cuts.<\/p><p>  The report bases its projections on a hybrid model which shows debt to GDP peaking at higher than the 123% in 2013 which was envisaged at the time of the bailout.  It was also predicted at that time that we would see growth levels approaching 3% very soon, a rise in GNP and an unemployment peak of 14.7%.  Those expectations have not been met.  The CSO figures released today show that 86,000 people have left the State in the past year, which is mirroring the unemployment challenge we face.  Is it the case that we are effectively on a train that is out of control and going too fast for us to jump off, or is there a point where we must accept that the bailout has not worked and seek a different approach?  I realise that the council reiterates in its report its resistance to a stimulus programme and encourages the Government to persist in its current fiscal stance.  Did it, however, engage in any modelling or dialogue in respect of an alternative strategy which would include a stimulus programme for the domestic economy?<\/p><p>  The council's remit is primarily concerned with debt sustainability, fiscal adjustments and projections, and we are all agreed on the importance of debt sustainability and the need for fiscal adjustments.  The message from ordinary people, however, whether in Donegal, Dublin or elsewhere, is that they have nothing more to give.  However, the council, in a recommendation which touches on matters of Government policy, proposes that welfare rates should be kept under review.  How would a reduction in welfare rates assist in any way in growing the domestic economy?  Given that such a reduction would take more money out of people's pockets, surely it would merely contribute further to the spiral of unemployment and the reduced working hours and staff numbers in shops and businesses throughout the State?<\/p><p>  The section of the report dealing with projections was very interesting, and I understand the council's difficulties in this regard.  In the context of its first report and the level of fiscal adjustments it proposed at that time, is the council still of the view that it would have been more prudent to take that direction, given what it now knows not only about the Irish economy but also the impact of developments in the European and world economy?  Alternatively, is it of the view that the Government decision to stand firm on its own adjustment targets, albeit marginally increased, was the correct one?  Has the Government issued a formal response to indicate why it has not taken on board the council's recommendations?  Should we expect it to be a trend that the council will release its reports and the Government will either ignore or accept them?  I am not arguing that the Government should not ignore them, but will there be a formal response mechanism that will allow us to understand why the Government is ignoring the council's recommendations?<\/p><p>  I share the delegates' concerns in regard to debt sustainability.  As I mentioned, it is due to peak at a higher level than anybody previously suggested.  I recall the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, observing at one of the conferences with the troika representatives that he could not envisage Greece returning to the bond markets given that its debt-to-GDP ratio had passed 120%.  Ireland itself is now at those levels although, fortunately, the spreads have come down.  I am arguing that we should go much further than what is proposed in regard to debt sustainability because, as it stands, our debt is already unsustainable.  Professor McHale's view, as reflected in the report, seems to be that an agreement on the banking portion of Ireland's debt will prove to be some type of panacea which will increase the chances of a successful adjustment as measured by a robust return to market creditworthiness.<\/p><p>  The difficulty is that the June statement was utterly over-egged by the Government as a ground-breaking achievement of negotiating skill.  I was at the ploughing championship yesterday when I heard the Taoiseach's claim that what was agreed in the June summit is as clear as day.  On the contrary, it seems as clear to me as the mud I was stepping through down in Wexford.  If there is to be a separation of sovereign and banking debt and if it is to be retrospective, then we must have a proper separation of these two types of debt.  In other words, the sovereign debt, which is approximately one third of our banking debt, should be taken on board by the European Stability Mechanism.  That, however, was never on the table and it is not what has been negotiated.  It was disappointing but not unexpected to hear the comments by Ministers on this point yesterday.  Has the council done any modelling in regard to the different possible impacts on our financial situation of having a deal in regard to the banking debt, whether by way of a restructuring of the promissory note or by the ESM taking over the full liabilities arising from the State's recapitalisation of the banks other than Anglo Irish Bank?<\/p><p>  Will the delegates comment on the council's terms of reference?  It is clearly focused on debt sustainability, the fiscal adjustment and projections made in the past, but does it believe there is a role for a committee such as this to examine the social impact arising from some of the policy decisions the council is advocating?<\/p> <p> I do not agree with the headline figure of &euro;1.9 billion, on which everybody will focus.  The report contains a great many statistics and I do not doubt that our guests have done much work in respect of modelling, etc.  It is easy to state that social welfare rates should be reviewed or that the adjustment should be increased by &euro;1.9 billion but what does that mean for ordinary people?  I accept this might not be the council's role at present but given that it has a particular standing and is going to be placed on a statutory footing, it has a responsibility to go that much further and deal with some of the issues to which I refer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700006#F00900","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348753200,"counter":615,"content":"<p>The Deputy took ten minutes to make his contribution.

Some of the ground has been covered already in reply to Deputy Michael McGrath so that will probably allow me to proceed somewhat more quickly.<\/p><p>  On the size of the adjustment we recommend or the fact that we do recommend an additional adjustment, this relates to the balancing act to which I referred earlier.  We would very much like to be in a position where we could stimulate the economy because that is what is appropriate for an economy in recession.  We are of the view that demand management can have a very positive effect, so we take a generally Keynesian approach from that perspective.  That is wonderful if one's country is robustly credit worthy.  If it is not, then one faces constraints in that one must achieve debt sustainability in order to establish that robust credit worthiness.  There is a general sense that people want to get the State's sovereignty back and this requires that it must be robustly credit worthy.  If we cannot do that, then at least we will have a reliable source of official funding that will not impose even more onerous conditionality upon us.  This is why we are trying to achieve the balancing act to which I refer.  That point sometimes seems to become lost in the debate.<\/p><p>  As circumstances change, that which is in the different scales also changes.  As the Deputy noted, in scaling back the amount of adjustment we were recommending, we considered two issues, namely, the fact that greater than anticipated weakness in the eurozone economy was having what we saw as a short-term further dampening effect on the Irish economy and that there had been substantial improvements in credit worthiness since our first report, in which we suggested the biggest additional adjustment.  Given that the purpose of making such difficult additional adjustments is to regain the credit worthiness of the State and because the evidence of that credit worthiness is improving in any event in the context of the current programme, this allows us to scale back.  If we can scale it back to having no additional adjustments or perhaps suggesting a greater stimulus beyond the Government programme - if we thought that was appropriate in light of the balancing act to which I refer - we certainly would do that.  We are absolutely not pushing austerity just for the sake of it.  In view of the essential aspect of debt sustainability and credit worthiness, however, we are of the view that this is the appropriate macroeconomic policy course for the Government to pursue.<\/p><p>  In the context of the stimulus programme, a broader question arises with regard to the fiscal stance and how contractionary or stimulative it should be.  What having a stimulus programme that is focused on specific capital investment projects is about is something that is somewhat separate from the main fiscal adjustment programme.  In our report we seek possible rationales for having such a separate programme.  There are arguments to be made in this regard.  One set of such arguments relates to the fact that it can be financed without adding to the gross debt of the State.  However, to repeat something I noted earlier, it is necessary to examine the broader balance sheet of the State in terms of financing it by running down assets, accessing the National Pensions Reserve Fund, using privatisation revenues that could have been used to pay down gross debt or taking on particular contingent liabilities relating to public private partnerships and so on.  This matter must be considered in the round.  It is sometimes presented as almost off-the-books money about which we do not have to worry in terms of what it is doing to the credit worthiness of the State.  Taking that broader balance sheet perspective, we become less convinced of this separate stimulus idea.<\/p><p>  Another rationale for having a separate stimulus programme is one which is very much part of the international debate on fiscal policy.  Many countries are of the view that their economies must be stimulated in the present but that they must also credibly commit to carrying out fiscal adjustments in the long term when those economies are in better shape.  One hears this in the UK and the US.  The problem that arises in this regard relates to how to stimulate one's economy in the short term while making it credible that one will actually start behaving differently in the future.  One could view the separate stimulus approach as giving one an extra instrument in the context of achieving a better trade off, whereby one sticks to one's main fiscal adjustment programme while also having an explicitly temporary stimulus programme in place.  In theory, there is a rationale in this regard but it would be extremely difficult to credibly commit that this would be a once-off improvement in capital spending.<\/p><p>  There are rationales to consider and we take these very seriously.  Following much discussion, however, we reached the conclusion that if one was going to implement a special programme of capital spending, it would be better to build it into the main programme.  This would be partly for reasons of transparency in order that it would be possible to see exactly what was happening and that matters would not hidden off balance sheet or whatever.  Even if one is using some of these other funding mechanisms, which certainly have a great deal of merit to them, it should be made part of the main programme.  The question then arises as to whether the fiscal stance should be relaxed.  In that context, I return to the first matter we debated with regard to the trade off between supporting the economy in the short term - for which there are very good reasons - against the risks to debt sustainability, particularly in the uncertain environment in which we find ourselves.  We reached the conclusion that at this point we do not really see an argument for relaxing the fiscal stance beyond where they Government is at present.  We did, as I have already noted, scale back the additional adjustments for which we had been calling.<\/p><p>  I accept that there are time constraints which apply.  However, these are important and complicated questions and I hope the Chairman will forgive me for taking a long time to answer them.<\/p><p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty inquired as to why we changed the advice we are giving since our first report.  In the context of how the Government formally responded to our advice, the stability programme update contained a short response.  We would perhaps like a more lengthy response.  It is very important that the Government does not feel that it needs to respond immediately to what we say - sometimes such responses can come a little too quickly - but that it should take the advice on board and then provide a more considered reaction in the appropriate way.  I refer, in this regard, to the budgetary documentation and the stability programme updates.<\/p><p>  I did not take note of all the points the Deputy raised so I will, perhaps, allow some of my colleagues to reply in respect of any matters with which I do not deal.  However, I will conclude by responding to his final question on the terms of reference of the council.  I understand what he is saying with regard to the fact that we sometimes discuss big macroeconomic figures and adjustments which seem very divorced from the reality that such adjustments will have on people's lives.  That is something with which we really struggle.  We take the mandate we have been given seriously.  We have not been given a mandate to discuss anything we want and put our own particular views or preferences forward.  Our mandate is to assess the Government's macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts, its fiscal stance and, under the new fiscal responsibility legislation, the level of compliance with certain fiscal rules.  This is what we are supposed to be doing and we have largely been focusing on that.<\/p><p>  As we discuss making these adjustments, we see that we should be saying more about what are the possibilities and laying down certain criteria for judging good and bad adjustments.  We are struggling with this ourselves, as a council.  One of the matters about which we are concerned - this was discussed at earlier meetings we had with the committee - is that we do not wish to become only political in our outlook.  It is one thing to talk about the size of these adjustments - which of course is a political question to a certain degree - but once we begin to suggest that welfare rates or public sector pay should be cut, we will, as a council, become much more politicised.<\/p> <p>That may take from our main function which relates to these macro-economic issues.  We are struggling with that tension and it is something we will talk a good deal about before the preparation of our next report in terms of whether we need to say more in regard to the details of the adjustments.  It is not to give our preferences but perhaps to give more analysis of the options as opposed to the dangers of going into those more micro questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348753800,"counter":618,"content":"<p>One or two other members of the council might like to add their comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700008#H00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348753800,"counter":619,"content":"<p>In response to the question on whether we should take on board the social impacts or the issues we talk about, we should be clear on this.

From very early on we tried to steer away from the notion that austerity worked best if one went down the expenditure cuts road as opposed to the taxation road.  We have tried to stress that we did not necessarily buy into that and that, collectively, we were quite open to the notion that taxation could well form a significant part of this overall.

The Deputy asked a specific question on the level of credit that would hold in a normal economy.  I am not sure there is an answer to that question, so I will come at it from a different route.  There is obviously a problem and if one takes the Central Bank's work on this, there are difficulties for SMEs in getting credit.  That is clearly a problem but in an economy that is under the pressure ours is under, it is absolutely the case that a certain proportion of SMEs will fail.  Therefore, there are real risks to lending to this group.  This is a very difficult question.  I remember at the outset of this crisis being involved in a discussion along the lines that if we were not going to have a functioning banking system for a long period of time, that would act as a constraint on growth.<\/p><p>  To return to the remarks about life in a post-bubble economy, one of the great difficulties is having an impaired banking system and it is very hard to see an economy growing in the absence of a banking system.  We will have an impaired banking system for quite a while and a banking system that may not feel comfortable lending, precisely for the reasons that banks do not want to get burned again.  There may not be the human capital in the banks to make good lending decisions.  We had a banking system that was made up of people whose job was to lend on property transactions; they were not people who were able to analyse good investment decisions.  There is a real problem.  To use the economic term in that respect, we talk about a market failure, that the market will not deliver something that the economy really needs.  It is a standard economic argument that if there is market failure what one wants to see is the government intervening.  I noted with great interest earlier in the week an announcement at the Liberal Democrats conference of the notion that the British Government was simply going to short circuit the difficulty and establish a bank that would lend directly to people.<\/p> <p>That is something we have not explored, but it would be an issue this group would discuss.

A property tax falls into that zone.  As it is suggested more and more people should be exempt from the property tax, by definition, it means the rates will be higher.  One can certainly make a case for the exemption of persons who are genuinely on low incomes because typically we make allowances for this.  When the argument starts to be made, however, that one should be exempt from it if one paid a lot in stamp duty in recent times, it introduces a different consideration.  It is not about one&rsquo;s current capacity to pay, rather it relates to a notion of tax previously paid.  Philosophically, that seems different to me.  To the extent that we can keep rates as low as possible, that means broadening the base.  Current income is a reasonable criterion on which to exclude people, but if one goes beyond this, one is getting into a dangerous situation of limiting the base and thereby raising the amount that must be raised from every other person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700009#J00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Barrett"},{"type":"speech","time":1348754400,"counter":642,"content":"<p>Does it have to do with negative equity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700009#J00700","speaker":"1048"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348754400,"counter":643,"content":"<p>Not by definition, in the sense that many people are in negative equity, but their life carries on.

It is not an issue we have discussed explicitly at great length, but it obviously provides the context for all our discussions.  The Deputy articulated very well some of the challenges being faced in Europe.  In some ways, this country has an advantage because it is at the sharp end of the euro crisis and naturally people in this country understand it better than, for example, people in Germany who are experiencing something very different and facing a very different set of issues.<\/p><p>  What has happened in Europe in recent months has been significant, in that three things that have fallen into place are important.  The first is that the ESM has finally been approved and the detail is being worked out.  I understand it will become operational within a few weeks.  Second, the European Central Bank has launched an outright monetary transactions plan programme, which is a significant step forward and clarifies its role in the crisis.  Third, we have the Commissions&rsquo;s proposals banking union and a political commitment to do something about it, although exactly what remains unclear.  These three things, taken together, potentially are very powerful and change the game somewhat in Europe, in particular by breaking the sovereign-banking sector link that people in this country understand very well.  However, they are significant, as what they all do is put the ball firmly in the politicians&rsquo; court, in respect of countries such as Spain and Italy and also countries such as Germany that would have to approve some of these programmes, implicitly or explicitly.  Unfortunately, there are still lots of risks.  We have the instruments, but there is a deep question about whether they will be used and how the politics of it will work.  I hope that answers some of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.<\/p><p>  The other point the Deputy made which is very important was on growth.  Achieving stability is a necessary condition, but it is not sufficient for growth.  Once stability is achieved because politicians do what they need to do in the right countries, there will have to be more thought given to the need for growth.  If it works, potentially, it will create more fiscal space.  If one compares the United States to the euro area, objectively it is in a much worse fiscal position but because it has a large federal government debt and a single central bank and is in a different position from that of European countries.  There may be more to do on the monetary policy side.  <\/p><p>  A point that is worth emphasising is that many of the growth problems in Europe are structural.  That may be less so in Ireland.  It is a credit issue.  In some ways, one has an economy that is flexible and dynamic, but if one looks at a country such as Italy, it is in trouble, but it did not have the kind of boom period that we had in this country or Spain.  The Italian economy has not grown for ten years and its market share has been showing a downward trend.  That is not a demand management problem, rather it is a structural problem.  What Europe needs is ambitious reforms to deal with the structural problems.  Fortunately, in Spain and Italy things have moved on quite a lot relative to the experience of the past decade, but in all countries there is a huge need to make the European economy competitive again on a global scale.  I do not think the measures have been put in place will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700009#J01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1348754400,"counter":647,"content":"<p>Could someone deal with the funds issue for banks?

Since they have a difficulty in attracting new funds in terms of new deposits from abroad, that is a constraint.  However, again referring to the work of my former employer, the IMF, there is a very interesting analysis of whether it is restrictive credit conditions or a lack of demand that has caused bank lending in Ireland to be weak in recent years.  The conclusion is that while there is some evidence of more stringent lending criteria, in that the banks are super cautious, most of it is due to a lack of demand.  That is not necessarily a conclusion that would fit with everyone&rsquo;s prior beliefs, but that is what the IMF has concluded, having analysed the situation and done a lot of statistical work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700009#J01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Donal Donovan"},{"type":"speech","time":1348754400,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I will keep it brief-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700009#J01400","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1348754400,"counter":650,"content":"<p>That is the second Labour Party speaker in a row.

The Nevin Economic Research Institute refers to freezing spending cuts and adjusting by way of taxation in 2013.  I am paraphrasing to be brief.

Other people advocate the idea of stopping payment of the promissory notes, cutting our national debt by &euro;30 billion, which would lead to a year to year saving on interest payments.

The headline is that it is recommending a &euro;2.7 billion adjustment for 2013 instead of the &euro;3.5 billion adjustment.  There are many valuable recommendations in the report but I am not convinced by its particular proposal or the reasons it gives for it.  One aspect is that it does not grapple with what is central to our report, namely, the basic trade-off between supporting the economy in the present and dealing with debt sustainability.  That is missing from its report.<\/p><p>  In terms of this &euro;2.7 billion adjustment for 2013, it believes that the programme target, which is a general Government deficit of 7.5% of GDP, can still be met with the smaller adjustment, that is, the &euro;2.7 billion instead of the &euro;3.5 billion.  The argument it makes is that we can have this different composition of the adjustment, as the Deputy said, that will be less damaging to the economy.  It picks out particular multipliers for specific areas that makes that true in the sense that it assumes the damage done to the economy by tax increases are quite small and that the damage done by reduced capital spending is quite large, and it draws on some evidence to support the multipliers it uses.<\/p><p>  However, there is no agreement in the economic literature on the relative size of these multipliers.  The larger share of the evidence goes in the opposite direction where tax-based adjustments, that is, adjustments based on tax increases, probably do more short-term damage to the economy but those findings have been disputed.  We have looked closely at that literature and we did not believe we had a basis for distinguishing between different types of adjustments in terms of their effects on the economy based on the existing state of knowledge.  There is a somewhat selective use of the literature that ultimately produces this result that one could hit the 7.5% target with a smaller adjustment that is heavily weighted towards tax increases with minor expenditure changes, but it is a useful contribution to the debate in that it brings these important issues to light.<\/p><p>  In terms of stopping payment on the promissory notes or other forms of default, at this stage we have to recognise that, rightly or wrongly, the senior bondholders in the banks have been almost completely paid off at this stage.  To default on the promissory notes, therefore, essentially would be to default on the Central Bank of Ireland and, ultimately, on the euro system.  It is important to note who we are defaulting on if we make that decision.<\/p><p>  There is a huge amount of literature on the costs of default.  The early part of the literature focused very much on the damage it would do to our reputation and, ultimately, our ability to borrow in the future.  The empirical evidence does not support that strongly.  Countries often make a surprisingly rapid return to markets after defaulting, and without apparently huge penalties in terms of the interest rates they pay in the future.  There are some exceptions to that but as a general tendency what the literature has found is that the faults tend to be incredibly disruptive to the economy and are associated with often much deeper recessions.<\/p><p>  There is also a lot of evidence that shows substantial reputational spillovers as a result of default which could be particularly important in the Irish case since it is so dependent on foreign direct investment.  To the extent that it undermines confidence in the stability of Ireland's business environment for investment, those reputational costs could be severe.  Based on this international evidence, default is something that should be avoided and strong commitments made to avoid default, which brings us back to the need to achieve debt sustainability so that we are not forced into a situation of default, but behind all that and the need to restore the creditworthiness of the State is the need to avoid the consequences of losing it in addition to losing official support as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700010#K00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1348755000,"counter":661,"content":"<p>Would it be worthwhile for Professor McHale's group to do an analysis of the likely spillover if that road was taken?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700010#K00300","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348755000,"counter":662,"content":"<p>We can certainly look at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700010#K00400","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1348755000,"counter":663,"content":"<p>In deference to the members who have been waiting a long time to contribute and the fact that I have to speak in the Chamber, I will be pointed and brief in my remarks.  I ask Professor McHale to pardon me for being blunt.  I do not believe he and his colleagues live in the real world.  Their prescriptions are from an ivory tower but in the real world people are suffering very badly the effects of austerity and of a criminal decision to bail out a system of speculation and profiteering on a European basis on the backs of the Irish working class, pensioners, low and middle income workers, and the poor, and Professor McHale and his colleagues want to pile more misery and more austerity on them.  He said his role was to analyse Government policy.  Why is he not proclaiming from the rooftops that it is a disastrous failure when 14,000 fewer people are at work in the second quarter than in the first quarter, investment has collapsed catastrophically in the past four years, our young people are leaving the country, and all the economic indicators indicate that this is a disastrous policy yet he wants to take more demand out of the domestic economy which is already eviscerated?<\/p><p>  One of Professor McHale's economic colleagues, Professor Stephen Kinsella, said in recent days that domestic demand is now at 2003 levels and that any further drops in spending will cause an increase in unemployment and further hardship for the private sector.  Professor McHale's prescriptions, on top of what the Government wants in this budget, will make the situation far worse.  How does Professor McHale respond to that situation?  Has he read, for example, the fairly mild suggestion in the Nevin Economic Research Institute report yesterday about an additional 30,000 jobs at risk of being lost under the current budget strategy to which it suggested an alternative?<\/p><p>  Professor Barrett referred not just to cuts but to taxation, but taxation on whom?  Have the witnesses ever come up with the suggestion that there should be an audit of real wealth among the top 5% or 10% who have substantial wealth which has increased even during the recession?  What about an emergency tax on wealth rather than coming back to working people again?<\/p><p>  On the so-called property tax, it is not a property tax; it is a home tax.  What is the obsession of right wing economists with a tax on people's homes and the myth that it represents a broadening of the tax system?  Did they hear another colleague of theirs, Dr. Peter Bacon, on \"Morning Ireland\" a few weeks ago demolish the idea of a so-called broadening of the tax base and saying it is coming from the same pot of income workers get from their wages and salaries, pensions or social welfare?<\/p> <p>That is where it is coming from; it is not coming from a secret hoard of gold that everybody has under his house and which he has been hiding heretofore.  The measure would hit the same people, yet economist after economist blindly wants it.  It is argued that every country in Europe has the tax.  European countries have very different social and health systems, some of which are superior to those in Ireland.<\/p><p> One of the realities we face in Europe is that investment by big businesses and corporations has collapsed absolutely.  I am sure the delegates have been reading the <i>Financial Times<\/i>and <i>The Wall Street Journal<\/i>, for example, which argue that trillions of euro is being sat upon by major corporations, or that it is swilling around in money markets, yet the corporations will not invest in the manufacturing industry, where real jobs could be created for real people.  How about an emergency tax on uninvested profits in Ireland and every other country in Europe?  This would result in a turning around from the disastrous policy of austerity.<\/p><p> Did the delegates ever carry out a moral or democratic analysis of how and why we should tolerate a system in which faceless, unelected, unaccountable major corporate and financial entities that are sitting on top of trillions of euro are allowed to speculate daily against countries, banks and governments for their own super-profit?  Their victims are the millions of unemployed people in Europe.  So-called democratically elected leaders are simply bending the knee.<\/p><p> Dr. Donovan referred to his former employers.  The prescriptions of his former employers, as with those of the troika, for example, pertain to more privatisation, cuts in public expenditure and attacks on living standards.  These are similar to those that were applied in the structural adjustment programmes in the 1980s and 1990s in poorer countries in Latin America and Africa, with devastating social and economic effects.

As the Deputy pointed out, current circumstances are bad.  The Deputy used the word \"disastrous\" in this regard.  Unfortunately, however, it is quite possible to make bad circumstances worse.  Even today, if we were to repudiate completely all the debt, we would have to note the anticipated primary deficit for this year of 4.2% of GDP, assuming there are certain improvements.  Essentially, we would have to close the deficit immediately, with greater pain for people and a much greater fiscal adjustment.  If we want to phase the burden out over time and limit the pain, we must retain our ability to borrow.  I hope we will be able to borrow from market sources or, failing that, official sources.  It is not enough to say circumstances are bad without considering that some of the solutions being offered risk making circumstances much worse.  We are balancing the risk of making circumstances much worse against the real cost of slowing the economy in the present.<\/p><p>  The Deputy called the property tax a home tax.  I believe he would support a substantial role for the Government in the economy, which necessitates substantial expenditure.  This must be funded somehow, either by taxation or borrowing.  Given that borrowing will, for the time being, be an important way to fund expenditure &ndash; this is why we need to retain our creditworthiness &ndash; there will be no really easy form of taxation.  Therefore, one needs to develop a tax system that does as little damage to the economy and people as possible.   All other developed economies have identified the property tax as a central component of any well-designed tax system.  The Deputy is absolutely correct that, for the most part, it draws from the same income pool from which income tax, the universal social charge and PRSI are derived; the difference is that it does not raise marginal income tax rates in the sense that, depending on the design, there should not be a need for one to pay a higher property tax.  It does not have the same incentive-damaging effects of bringing marginal income tax rates to very high levels - they are currently at 52%.  Most people across the political spectrum who have considered well-designed tax systems see an important role for a property tax.<\/p><p>  Let me discuss those whom the Deputy calls speculators.  There are certainly speculators but many of the participants in the financial markets in whom we are most interested at present are the people we want to buy our debt.  This is to allow us to continue to spend more than the income we are bringing in.  It is a question of financial market participants deciding that we represent good credit so we can phase out the adjustment over time, thereby limiting the near-term damage to the economy and the people.  It is not right to dismiss outright speculation as having a considerably adverse effect on the economy and people's lives.  We are very much dependent on their judgment that we represent a good risk if we are to prevent further damage from being done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700011#L00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Barrett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348755600,"counter":666,"content":"<p>I wish to respond on Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s remarks about the structural policy supported by the IMF.

This actually constitutes an increase of 50% year-on-year, which is partly due to timing factors.  I believe there have been three bank guarantee payments in the year to date, whereas we only had two such payments last year.  However, there have also been some interesting developments, in that &euro;300 million has come in from interest paid on contingent capital notes which, again, are related to the possible over-capitalisation of the banking sector.  In addition, I believe the Government received &euro;1 billion in Central Bank profits, much of which, again, relates to emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, which we document in the report.  On a broader scale, in terms of general Government figures, there has been a notable increase in non-tax revenues, much of which relates to the bank guarantee, as well as dividend and interest income.  It is a subject we are exploring and we hope to bring out a paper within the next couple of months specifying what these items are, as they must be monitored.

I would be slow to get rid of the guarantee for the following reasons.  From the banks' point of view, it certainly is extremely expensive and undermines their profitability.  I acknowledge that we need to repair the banking system and bring banks back to profitability in order that they can play their proper role in the economy.  On the other hand, as Mr. Smyth outlined, those revenues are having a very positive effect on the size of the Government deficit.  However, the reason I would be slow to get rid of the guarantee - this relates, in particular, to the extent to which the banking system is not State-owned - is that there is likely to be an implicit guarantee in place.  One thing we have learned from the crisis is that even when there is no explicit guarantee, it can be very difficult for the State not to ultimately take on the liabilities.  This applies, in particular, to the banks that are not actually State-owned because in that case it really is just a transfer from one pocket to the other.  However, for instance, in respect of the 85% of Bank of Ireland, if the State really is taking on those liabilities and ultimately providing an implicit guarantee for the bank, the bank should be charged for it.  I stress this, however, that is a personal view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700012#M00700","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1348756200,"counter":679,"content":"<p>That pertains to the short term.

It really is to allow the banks to be able to borrow.  They are now well capitalised.  Much of the uncertainty about the asset side of the balance sheet has been reduced, although certainly not eliminated, as I am sure Deputy Peter Mathews would underline.  However, on foot of the transfer of the most toxic assets to NAMA, the uncertainty on the asset side of the balance sheet has reduced.  Consequently, in respect of the ability of the banks to raise funding, including deposits but I hope longer term funding also, the guarantee is not as necessary as it was in the midst of the crisis.  However, it was not what allowed the banks to sustain the deposits they had, particularly domestic deposits.  When one does not have a state that ultimately is creditworthy, its guarantees do not mean an awful lot.  What really stopped a complete run on deposits in the Irish banking system was the backing of the European Central Bank.  That is the reason it was necessary to be extremely careful about how one dealt with issues relating to senior bonds.  While that is a more complicated issue, one definitely needed to retain the support of the European Central Bank which often went beyond its normal lending operations to banks, particularly as it related to emergency liquidity assistance, ELA.  However, to the extent that the guarantee implicitly is in place in order that the State can cover the losses of the banking system, I support charging the banks for the guarantee provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700012#M00900","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1348756200,"counter":681,"content":"<p>What of the question I asked about corporation tax?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700012#M01000","speaker":"994"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348756200,"counter":682,"content":"<p>Mr. Barnes will respond to that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700012#M01100","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348756200,"counter":683,"content":"<p>I realise this is a sensitive issue.  The discussion of corporate taxation concerns not simply the rate but also the entire set of arrangements around corporation tax.  As it obviously is important in Ireland, it has come into our discussions, but obviously it is not the main topic we discuss.  However, as the work of the council develops and our analysis goes into greater detail, I am sure we will get into the subject more, as we will with many other subjects.  As Professor Barrett noted, for us, all of the issues are on the table.  It is not as though we are focusing on particular subjects for ideological reasons.  One reason that is worth noting is the corporate tax arrangements are not entirely in Ireland's hands because they partly rely on agreements with other countries, as well as on tax competition and what goes on in other places.  In a long-term sense, it actually is a significant fiscal risk that even if Ireland keeps its policies the same, other things might change in the world that would make it less favourable to Ireland.  <\/p><p>  One point that is also extremely striking and at which we look a little in the report concerns the GNP-GDP distinction.  As we spell out in the report, some think it is GDP, while others think it is GNP, but, of course, the extent to which they are different is largely associated with multinational profits.  I note there is some tax value in this, but it is probably just not as high as in the rest of the economy.  In a way, this is true of a lot of other countries also because, typically, the tax rate on corporations is much lower than it is on individuals, for example.  The issue in Ireland is that the size of profits in the economy relative to GNP which probably is the most appropriate measure in this sense is very big.  Consequently, one of the things we wanted to do by showing this hybrid measure, between GDP and GNP, was to show those foreign multinational profits were not worth anything to the economy.  It is simply the case that they are not taxed in the same way as others.  Moreover, it would be surprising if they were taxed in that way because nowhere are corporate profits taxed as highly as individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700012#M01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348756200,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I will make one more point on corporation tax with regard to something that makes it very hard to analyse.  One can perform an analysis of most taxes to determine what might be the effect as the tax goes up or down.  However, when it comes to Ireland's corporation tax rate, there is an argument that the certainty around the rate is something that always is sold.  It is not really a question of moving the rate from 12.5% up to 15% and that this would be okay.  The argument is that once one breaches this absolute commitment that it will remain the same forever, one may have created a worry in people's minds and may have lost the real value.  Consequently, while increasing the rate by a couple of percentage points may seem like a small thing to do, one would be breaching a fundamental principle that appears to have continued for a long time.  In a sense, as a group of economists, we cannot predict what the reaction might be to something such as this.

The key point I noted that resonated across the paper was that debt sustainability remains fragile.  I concur with almost 90% of what Deputy Higgins said earlier.  The council&rsquo;s brief is macroeconomically scaled.  It does not go into the branches or the boughs of the trees; instead, it is looking at the forest outline.  Within that forest, there is a larger landscape of the financial system, the eurozone and even the world financial system.  If Ireland is fragile as regards debt sustainability, the eurozone&rsquo;s financial system is super-fragile.<\/p><p>  In November 2010, Timothy Geithner vetoed a credit restructuring or write-down of Irish banking funding.  Greece&rsquo;s write-downs had not occurred at that stage.  If that had happened, we would have been the first in a cascade across the financial system.  Tuesday&rsquo;s letter from the Dutch, Finnish and German finance Ministers is one hell of a disappointment.  It is also one hell of an unacceptable U-turn.  Ireland actually saved the euro back in November 2010.  The euro system had an exposure of at least &euro;135 billion to Ireland.  If that had buckled, the whole framework would have buckled and God knows what would have happened.  It is still fragile.  Simon Johnson of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, wrote an article recently in which he examined Deutsche Bank, which I mentioned at the committee a year ago.  My son, who has emigrated to Australia, prompted me to have a look at this article.  Deutsche Bank is over-leveraged, under-capitalised and carrying suspect assets on its balance sheet.  Its balance sheet is the equivalent of 80% of the German economy&rsquo;s gross domestic product.  That is how serious the whole matter is.  Here we are frightening ourselves, walking on eggshells, when the eggshells are smashed.  We can put on boots to walk around the mess that has been left.  We should not be afraid, on the next due date of a bond for AIB - a bank we own - to say that borrowing more European Central Bank or emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, moneys to pay this bond is a farce and we actually want to discuss creditor restructuring.<\/p><p>  We have already raided the pension fund, robbing it of &euro;20 billion to stick into banks that are bust.  Leaving a residual shareholder proportion of 15% in Bank of Ireland is the daftest move, considering the earlier discussion of covering all liabilities.  There would be no deposits in that bank if the State did not support it, admittedly in a fragile and wobbly way through the euro system.  It is all so interconnected and so farcical.<\/p><p>  It is true the processing of &euro;70 billion of loans into sovereign loans on the backs of Irish citizens is misplaced, odious, unjustified and should not happen.  Instead, a restructuring and write-off is long overdue.  We should all stand up for the people of Ireland and take off any of the restrictive paraphernalia that we have worn from yesteryear when the establishment had certain norms and protocols of discussion.  We have gone beyond that; we are in a battle zone.  I am not saying we should become brutal or boorish in our approach.  Instead, we must become assertive.  We have to tell Mr. Draghi that we do not have the money for the bond now coming due and we are not borrowing on historical terms.  They will be over here fast - cash concentrates the mind.  The euro system will buckle.  They will want us instead to pretend that all is well.<\/p><p>  We should all get down and talk real.  Deutsche Bank should talk real, as well as all the other European banks such as the Spanish banks.

First, how much is the bank guarantee worth to the State?  What is the figure?  They made reference to it.  If the bank guarantee was effectively to be withdrawn, what level of tax revenues would the Exchequer forsake per annum?  Professor McHale states there is an implicit guarantee regardless of whether there is a direct guarantee in place.  If the bank guarantee was to be removed, would he expect Ireland's cost of borrowing externally to reduce?  Would it have an impact on our cost of borrowing?<\/p><p>  Second, on the question of the impact on the economy of the austerity in terms of the level of cuts, the council stated it wants to see &euro;1.9 billion of extra adjustments up to 2015, above what is planned at present.  What is the council's view on pushing it out, say, for another two years or whatever, and making the corrections over a longer period?  Would that have a positive impact?  We have not spoken about the domestic economy.  The export economy and the multinational sector is doing well.  The domestic economy is where the long-term unemployed are.  The domestic economy is a matter that needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>  Finally, throughout its report, the council makes reference to debt sustainability and creditworthiness remaining fragile.  It comes up everywhere in the report.  Dr. Donovan made reference to the IMF viewing a figure of &euro;24 billion in debt write-off in terms of the banks.  What do they perceive - they may not want to go there - is the requirement for our debt to be sustainable and what do we need to get?  How do they view the pronouncements of the German, Finnish and Dutch Finance Ministers in the past couple of days in that regard, linking into the ESM and the issue of banking debt?

I understand the macro situation in terms of Ireland Inc., but I am considering the profile of those who are unemployed.  Many used to work in construction, but a cohort are from the SME sector, which relies on spending power in the domestic economy.  A rising tide lifts all boats and it is a question of making balanced choices.

We have primarily been focusing on 2015 as the deadline, but we hope the world will continue after that time.  Ireland will continue to have a high level of debt.  That could be a risk, as there could be new shocks and Ireland would need to face them with only small margins.  A great deal of the evidence that economists examine suggests that high public debt has an impact on growth.  It is important that we move beyond having such a debt.  Fairness is also an issue.  How much do we want to push onto younger people?  Significant questions remain and it is clear that debt needs to reduce.  As our report showed, additional consolidation will be required.<\/p><p>  In this regard, we began to discuss an important context in the report, namely, Ireland's new fiscal rules, which will be introduced under the fiscal responsibility legislation and our European commitments.  Those rules apply a debt target of 60%.  There is nothing magic about that number; it just happens to be the one we signed up to.  This is an important context in the medium term.  By increasing the sustainability of the public finances and future stability, that framework and many other measures will hopefully allow us to avoid returning to our current position.  In principle, macroeconomic stability should be good, and we know that can be incredibly damaging to small businesses and the functioning of the real economy, but reaching that point from where we are today will be difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2012092700015#P01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1348758000,"counter":759,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for attending.  I apologise for being late.  This meeting forms part of an interesting debate.  Indeed, it is the core debate.  According to the Nevin report, the witnesses' report and stated Government policy, we must arrive at a certain point.  The question is how to get there and how quickly that should be done.<\/p><p>  Luck was mentioned.  It is linked with what level of growth will be achieved in Ireland and, more importantly, the countries to which we export.  Were the witnesses' report implemented, would our levels of growth be damaged?  We are bouncing along the bottom of an L-shaped economic pattern.<\/p> <p>The fear would be that this might force us into further recession.  There has been some discussion here even from colleagues in our party about corporation tax.  It is important to repeat the comments of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that our corporation tax is not a subject for debate or discussion.  Obviously the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is free to have its own deliberations but I would hate it to waste its valuable time in any way.  Politicians in the United States frequently advertise to their own corporations and to the world that Ireland is a country in which to invest in order to secure a reasonable level of tax for those seeking to export into the European Union.  We welcome that promotion from our colleagues in America.  However, it is not just about the 12.5% rate but also about us having an open economy.  If it went to 15% or 13% or even if we started discussing it, it would be a serious dent in a massive piece of marketing ammunition we have.  We are blessed that we have St. Patrick's Day and that we have a very low corporation tax rate.  It is not just that I am saying it - it has been said by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and other senior Ministers.  It is also the position of the Opposition parties.  We are very lucky to have it and, more important, to be known to have it.  I compliment the witnesses on this interesting and comprehensive debate.

While we do not want to do things that might frighten people internationally, the witnesses could give clarity and state what they believe.  When they ask whether the Government will give its views consideration, the council may have to wait a while but it will get the Government's consideration on 8 December or whenever the budget is presented.  That is ultimately when we express our views on what the witnesses are saying.<\/p><p>  The committee and the debate overall would benefit from the witnesses giving their view on the sustainability issue as they have given this afternoon.  They could write that in a report.  Their views were extremely clear and they did not hedge around the issue today.  They discussed the option of a new bank and they could outline clearly how we could investigate the issue.  They have suggested getting information from the CSO regarding where wealth lies and its potential for taxation.  They have discussed whether wealth would stay in the country depending on the taxation issues.  They could add to the debate on property tax and whether it should be based on site valuation or property valuation by giving clear views.<\/p><p>  We did not spend much time this afternoon discussing jobs, nor was there much mention of the matter in the report.

That is the value of having this independent body.  We want to ensure we are seen as independent and not political.  If we get into specific issues involving very strong political divides there is a risk that we become associated with one side or the other.  That is not to say that we cannot get into more issues as we feel our way.<\/p><p>  I would like people to understand that we believe that the perception of our independence is critical to our functioning and we need to maintain that while expanding the scope of what we review.  We have a mandate that will be set down by legislation and we also need to be sensitive to that.  Within the constraints of that and the constraint of having to protect our independence for reasons of impartiality, we will certainly try to expand the scope of what we consider and give an opinion on it in the report as much as possible.  In many cases it may be laying out, based on the economic knowledge of these areas, various criteria of good policies and finding options that look good across a range of those criteria.

Ireland is lucky in having many good commentators.  One may not agree with everything they say and some people on the council in a private capacity express their views as such.  The council tries to make very sound evidence-based analysis which naturally limits how much we can do.

I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Ann O'Connor, director of human products licensing at the Irish Medicines Board, IMB.  It is a pleasure to be here.  This visit follows from our presentation to the committee before the summer recess when we discussed metal hip implants.  It is a pleasure to give the committee an overview of the IMB's role and remit.<\/p><p>  Essentially, the role of the IMB is to protect and enhance public and animal health through the regulation of medicines, medical devices and health care products.  We regulate a range of sophisticated health care product industry sectors and health care technologies.  With the exception of controlled drugs, the legislation for all the areas we regulate is derived from European Union regulations and directives.  The IMB was established on a statutory basis under the Department of Health in 1996.  This had the effect of transferring the licensing function for medicines for human use to the IMB from the Minister for Health.  Prior to that date, the Minister granted licences based on the recommendations of the IMB's predecessor, the National Drugs Advisory Board, which had been in existence for 30 years.  The IMB has developed a strong reporting relationship with various Ministers and departmental officials and we provide support and assistance for the various policy areas on a regular basis.  The founding legislation, primary legislation from the Oireachtas, provides our legal basis.  It directs that the IMB is largely a self-funding organisation.  The committee will be aware that we charge fees for the majority of our services - 85% of our budget is fee - derived - and that this is the funding model for regulators of these sectors throughout Europe and internationally.<\/p><p>  The IMB has many responsibilities.  In the case of medicines, we approve and monitor clinical trials at the beginning or at an early stage of development.  Then we review data submitted for the licensing of medicines.  We inspect and license manufacturing sites and wholesalers.  This is limited to medicines for human consumption because the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine covers the wholesale of veterinary medicines.  We monitor medicines throughout their full life cycle, which is important for vigilance.  <\/p><p>  The IMB is the central contact point for the reporting of adverse reactions, which is known as pharmacovigilance.  We receive reports from Irish patients and health care professionals and ensure companies notify us of all reports they receive, as they are legally obliged to do.  Every report made to us is independently and individually assessed by our pharmacovigilance experts and added to the cumulative data for every product on the market in Ireland.  We provide continued expert assessment of the overall benefit-risk of medicines in use by patients.  Our adverse reaction data for individual products is submitted to EU and World Health Organization, WHO, databases, to which we have access.  This access gives us valuable worldwide licensing and safety data for thousands of products.  <\/p><p>  We sample and test products from the marketplace.  We oversee the recall of products that pose a risk to the health of patients and enforce the legislation for patient safety, when required, up to and including taking prosecutions for serious breaches.  We have an inspections programme of manufacturing facilities and provide export certification support.  Exports in the various areas of medicines, medical devices and so on are now valued at more than 50% of all Irish export earnings.  We issue export and good manufacturing practice certificates which facilitate exports throughout the world.  <\/p><p>  The IMB is also the competent authority for the blood directive, under which we assess applications and authorise activities relating to the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components.  We also carry out site inspections to ensure compliance with the safety and quality requirements of the legislation.  In addition, the IMB is the competent authority for tissues and cells directives, advanced therapies and cosmetics.<\/p><p>  Members will recall from our appearance earlier this year that the IMB is also the competent authority for the regulation of medical devices.  Our remit in this case relates to vigilance and surveillance and begins after a medical device is placed on the market in Ireland.  Unlike our role in the case of medicines, it is not a function of the IMB to license or authorise medical devices.  <\/p><p>  Recently the IMB has been designated by the Minister as the competent authority for two new areas of interest, namely, the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and organ donation and transplantation.  The two relevant directives are due to come into effect shortly.  We have added an appendix to the presentation to set out the way various additional functions and duties have been added to the IMB during the past 16 years.<\/p><p>  I offer some background information on how medicines are licensed.  Members will be aware that pharmaceutical companies may make an application for product approval to the European Medicines Agency, EMA, for a licence which permits that medicine to be sold throughout Europe.  The EMA is based in London.  To date, up to 500 medicines have been approved through this route.  In practice, this involves every application being assessed by experts drawn from EU member states and the work of these experts is co-ordinated by the EMA.  The IMB contributes significantly to this European assessment process on behalf of Irish patients and is the lead rapporteur for Europe for several of these medicines.  Our involvement is greater than our size would otherwise dictate and we are performing well in this regard.  We also contribute to the work of the various expert scientific committees at the EMA and, consequently, have access to a larger pool of specialist opinion to augment our own expertise.  Ultimately, this benefits Irish patients taking medicines.  Including the 500 medicines authorised through the European system, there are more than 6,000 human medicines and more than 1,000 veterinary medicines approved in Ireland.  Members will appreciate that the majority of medicines are actually approved at national level by the IMB, either solely for marketing the product in Ireland or for a restricted number of member states.  This occurs through two legal arrangements in place derived from the mutual recognition directive or the decentralised procedures directive.  The IMB also contributes strongly at this level.<\/p><p>  In addition to our EU partnerships, the IMB has in place co-operation agreements with several sister regulatory agencies throughout the world.  This allows for the early exchange of information and expert knowledge on products, safety data and emerging trends and issues to the benefit of Irish consumers and patients.  Regulators with which we have arrangements include the US Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada and the authorities in Mexico, Singapore, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.  We are negotiating an arrangement with the authorities in Brazil.<\/p><p>  The presentation includes a short note on some of the key issues and challenges we see which I will summarise briefly.  The first relates to changing demographics and disease burden and new science and new therapies that are being developed.  These changes are a constant challenge for the IMB.  Thus, it is essential that we have in place the appropriate skill set and expertise to assess and monitor new products to ensure a positive benefit-risk balance for patients, while supporting research and innovation.  Globalisation of the market in all the sectors we regulate is a reality.  Therefore, our international reach and networks are vital to enable the IMB to do the job of regulator effectively.<\/p><p>  Within this global context, we face the ongoing challenge of the availability of counterfeit products, many of which are available for purchase on the Internet, in respect of which consumers and patients have no real level of protection or assurance in what they might be buying.  This continues to receive considerable attention nationally and internationally and the IMB has warned consumers repeatedly about this issue online and in the broadcast and print media. If we have time, I am keen to discuss the new European directive on what are termed falsified medicines.  The directive will take effect next year.<\/p><p>  Patient engagement is a significant focus for the IMB and will be into the future, as are transparency, communication and the provision of reliable information in order that health care product users as well as health care professionals can make informed decisions.<\/p> <p>The new EU pharmacovigilance legislation for human medicines is a relevant development in this regard and aims to ensure that members of the public become better informed about the benefits and risks of taking medicines.  That legislation has been in place since July 2012.<\/p><p> It would be very useful for the committee to have an insight into what the public thinks about medicines.  It is heartening to know that research we have carried out shows that nine out of ten consumers have confidence in the safety of the medicines they purchase and have very high trust in pharmacists, GPs and consultants.  The figures are in the high 90s.  In particular, they are very willing to seek the advice of their pharmacist.  However, our research also tells us that four out of ten health care professionals think consumers are not adequately aware of the risks that come with taking medicines.  Health care professionals also believe that up to 90% of patients who come to them for advice do so after using the Internet to self-diagnose.  Our research with consumers also indicates widespread use of the Internet to access health information.  This poses challenges.  The increasing use of mobile technology and near instant access to information have implications for regulators on how we publish information and how we position ourselves as the most credible source of information.  In this regard, the IMB has developed a suite of leaflets for members of the public both in print and online.  One of these leaflets deals specifically with the area of accessing medicines online while another is focused on the purchasing of medical devices over the Internet.  We are attempting to deal with that information deficit.<\/p><p> In our relationship with Government and other State bodies we provide advice across all the areas for which we regulate.  We work closely with sister agencies where our expertise can bring benefits to discussions and expert insights across common areas of focus.  This includes all agencies operating in the health sphere and development bodies such as the IDA and Enterprise Ireland where we are very involved in dialogue with companies that are considering establishing manufacturing operations here.<\/p><p> We support various important Government initiatives.  An ongoing example, which is pertinent at present, is the initiative on generic substitution of medicines.  The Bill currently before the Houses provides that the IMB will determine and publish the lists of medicines that are interchangeable and we look forward to assisting in this initiative.  One of our information leaflets for consumers deals specifically with generic medicines.  We are acutely aware that resources for health budgets are constrained and will do whatever is within our remit to assist in this area.<\/p><p> Members may be aware that there are substantial challenges from time to time with regard to availability of certain medicines and that shortages pose a particular risk for patients and added cost to the system.  We continue to contribute within our remit to the work of the Department of Health and, in particular, of the HSE colleagues on this important topic.  We have also established in the past year a consultative panel to examine the status of certain medicines as over-the-counter or prescription-only and to make recommendations to the IMB to change the legal status where appropriate.  This membership consists of interested stakeholders including the Department, the HSE, health care professionals and patient representatives.<\/p><p> Health technology assessment, reimbursement and pricing are not in our remit.<\/p><p> Chairman, you will be aware that during the Presidency, from 1 January, the IMB will host up to 20 meetings of European counterparts across the various areas we regulate and we have ambitious plans for these meetings to contribute to public health and safety improvement in Ireland and for the entire European system.  We will also provide support to the policy units in the Department in the areas of clinical trials, medical devices, precursor chemicals and cosmetics, where new legislative proposals are expected to come before the European Council during the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p> The board of the IMB, which comprises nine members, is appointed by the Minster for Health.  It considers strategic matters including corporate policy, planning and finance while also reviewing reports from the statutory advisory committees and the audit committee.  In addition, it notes the licences for all medicines as approved by the management committee, which consists of me as chief executive and my senior directors.  In the event of a proposal to refuse a licence, the final decision rests with the board.<\/p><p> There are three statutory advisory committees, also appointed by the Minister, for human medicines, medical devices and veterinary medicines.  The statutory role of these committees is to provide advice to the board in cases where it is proposed to refuse to grant a licence for a medicinal product on any grounds relating to its safety, quality or efficacy.  There is also a variety of sub-committees.  These are listed in the briefing note.  More than 100 experts contribute to these various committees and the role they play, on a voluntary basis, is of immense value to the IMB.<\/p><p> We are also fortunate to have a cadre of highly qualified, experienced, specialist staff across the various areas we regulate.  We have in place a robust quality management system and our organisational performance is routinely benchmarked against our European peers.  We have an established performance management programme for all our staff and we seek excellence in all we do.  We work hard to meet timelines for our work and we have state-of-the-art IT enabled solutions for both patients and industry to report adverse reaction reports, submit online applications of various types and for monitoring staff and organisational performance.<\/p><p> Finally, the IMB has a strategic plan for the period 2011-15.  It was adopted by the board at the end of 2010 and is available on our website.  As well as dealing with the regular running of the board it sets out five high level strategic objectives.  They are to enhance health care product safety and patient outcomes by effective risk management and market surveillance; to deliver clear, relevant and timely communications to patients, consumers and health care professionals; to improve service delivery within a high quality, risk-based regulatory framework; to influence legislation and policy development at European and international levels for the benefit of public and animal health; and, to build future capabilities to meet evolving regulatory requirements and scientific and technological advances.  We are on target across each of these objectives in terms of our work delivery and planning.<\/p><p> Thank you, Chairman.  We would be pleased to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092700004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348735500,"counter":816,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee.  It is evident that we have a difficulty with regard to the cost of medicines, both wholesale and retail, in Ireland.  I was disturbed to read in the IMB report that it has established a consultative panel to examine the status of certain medicines as over-the-counter or prescription-only.  I did a quick check and discovered that the IMB almost never delists prescription-only medicines and seems to be inactive in that area.  Why is the IMB one of the few medicines boards in Europe that never seems to delist medicines from prescription-only to over-the-counter?  Is that because of a mindset or a lack of resources, or is it simply something the board never thought of previously?  Expensive medicines are a major difficulty for families and for the State itself.<\/p><p>  A person must study for between five and seven years to become a pharmacist but apart from being allowed to sell lipstick and nail varnish, they have a very small role in the area of medicine and of dealing with the public.  We must examine this area in detail.  Pharmacists are a wonderful resource and should be more involved with prescribing medicines, perhaps at a lower grade.  A pharmacist could have a role in repeating prescriptions for a recurring non-serious illness, where the original prescription was given by a doctor.  Families are in huge difficulty regarding the cost of medicines.  The programme for Government contains a commitment that primary care will be free and available to everyone.  Meanwhile, every day families are deciding not to go to the doctor, because the visit will result in a huge pharmacy bill followed by another huge bill if the condition does not improve and a further prescription is required.  Mr. O'Mahony may say that is anecdotal evidence, but it is happening daily.  <\/p><p>  The IMB has a role in trying to reduce the cost of medicines.  <\/p> <p>A problem arises, however, if the board does not regularly review the list of prescription-only medicines, as other medicines boards in Europe do.  In that situation, where drugs are not delisted to over-the-counter status on an ongoing basis, we are left with an automatically inflated pricing system.  This is an issue which the board is obliged to consider.  When do the delegates expect the consultative panel that was established in the past year to begin making recommendations to the board in this regard and when, thereafter, will the board be in a position to begin delisting medicines?<\/p><p> Pharmacists are a wonderful resource and there is a central role for them in the delivery of community health care.  In terms of the Government's stated commitment to the establishment of primary care teams and so on, pharmacists are eminently qualified to play a key role and have already invested strongly in communities, towns and villages throughout the country.  Their function should be reviewed as part of broader Government policy in regard to the delivery of health care.  I understand the Government is engaged in ongoing discussion with the pharmaceutical companies in regard to generic drug substitutions.  Given the apparent reluctance, as I have observed, on the part of the IMB to recognise the need to review the status of prescription-only drugs on a regular basis, how confident can we be that the board will engage in regular reviews of developments in regard to interchangeable generic drugs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092700005#D00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348736100,"counter":818,"content":"<p>It is important to emphasise that pharmacists do more than sell medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092700006#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1348736100,"counter":819,"content":"<p>Of course.

The regulation of medicines is an increasingly important area of activity, with new products being developed on a continuous basis.  This creates challenges for both regulators and Government, not least in the area of cost.  In the course of Question Time in the D&aacute;il earlier this year, my colleagues and I pressed the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on the difficulties for patients regarding access to new and developing cancer treatments and medicines and the need to ensure speedy access thereto for all who need them.  In this regard, we pointed the Ministers to the clear disparity across Health Service Executive regions in terms of access to medicines, with Tysabri cited as an example.  My understanding is that this matter has not been resolved and it remains the case that some HSE regions are not fulfilling their obligations in terms of the right of patients to access that particular drug.  Does the Irish Medicines Board have a function in this regard and has it been involved in addressing this disparity across HSE regions?<\/p><p>  The chart included in the delegates' presentation is useful and welcome.  What would be even more useful, however, would be a chart setting out the relationship between the Minister and the Department, the HSE, the IMB, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association.  It is often very unclear to members of the public how each of these bodies relates to the others in terms of specific roles and responsibilities.<\/p><p>  The delegates' presentation includes a specific statement that health technology assessment reimbursement and pricing are not part the board's remit.  My final point relates to the latter aspect.  The delegates have said they are looking forward to assisting in the implementation of a scheme for generic substitution following the passage of relevant legislation through the Oireachtas.  As it stands, however, the massive disparities in the cost of medicines as between this and other countries apply not only in respect of on-patent drugs but also their generic equivalents.  The potential of the new legislation to realise critical savings in terms of health expenditure will be washed away if this issue is not addressed.  As a Border resident, I am aware that the cost of medicines is substantially cheaper under the National Health Service system in the North in the case of both on-patent medicines and their generic substitutes.  Constituents have cited instances in which medicines, both on-patent and generic, in pharmacies south of the Border are charged at up to 12 times their cost in the North.  This is a very worrying situation which must indicate gross profiteering on the part of the pharmaceutical companies and distributors in this jurisdiction.  The delegates have indicated the IBM has no role in regard to pricing, yet they are anxious to participate in the implementation of the generic substitution plan following the passage of legislation through the Oireachtas.  Surely they cannot be blinkered to the facts to which I have referred?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092700006#E00800","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1348736100,"counter":825,"content":"<p>The issue of costs has been raised by previous speakers.

Products are authorised as either prescription, over-the-counter in the pharmacy or for general sale in grocery stores.  The rules, regulations and directives generally provide that a certain number of medicines - injectables or whatever - can never be switched from prescription.

The most important issue in respect of how the landscape has changed - this gets to the kernel of the question - is that the prerogative remains with the companies to make applications in respect of switching.  Let us be clear about this; if we were to determine that a particular medicine should be switched from prescription-only to being available on an over-the-counter basis, in legal terms we are prevented from insisting on this with the company involved.  That is an extremely important point.  Until approximately two years ago, the decision on whether a medicine should be prescription-only resided - through the various Schedules to the relevant legislation - with the Department.  However, it was transferred to us as a specific task at that point.  That is what led us to start thinking more proactively about the concept of switching.  The consultative panel was established in order to draw out opinion from the broader stakeholder groups, including patients, public health professionals, doctors, pharmacists, the Department, the HSE and nurses.<\/p><p>  I was asked if a policy exists in respect of switching.  The Department has made it clear that where medicines can be switched from prescription-only to being safely available on an over-the-counter basis - in other words, where they can be provided by pharmacists without patients being obliged to go directly to doctors for full clinical examinations and proper diagnoses - then, at the lowest cost in circumstances where benefit-risk is maintained, the trend should be to switch.  That is the current position.  Deputy Kelleher stated that IMB has never delisted, which is not correct.  We have switched quite a number of medicines over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092700007#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1348736700,"counter":834,"content":"<p>I stated that the IMB is slow to delist rather than that it never delists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092700007#F00900","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348736700,"counter":835,"content":"<p>Okay.

In that context, there are much more restrictive regimes in some European countries.  The biggest comparator of which people in Ireland are aware relates to the UK, with which we have a common border.   Approximately five years ago the UK Government took a principled policy decision to push for the switching of medicines.  It encouraged applications for switching and made a very positive move to drive the policy through in order to switch as many medicines as possible.  As a consequence of this, it received more applications and it switched more medicines as a result.  Cholesterol-lowering medicines are widely used throughout the world and in the UK people can go direct to their pharmacies in order to purchase these products.  These medicines are, therefore, largely available over the counter in the UK but in the main are still prescription-only here.<\/p><p>  Everyone is now very conscious of costs.  As I stated at the outset, the IMB is not immune in this regard.  Our procedures are robust and we are bound by timelines.  If we receive an application to switch a certain product, we deal with it in the appropriate period.  Our judgments are based on benefit-risk factors, namely, whether a medicine can be delivered safely at the level of the pharmacy.  Another point which is important to note and of which we are very aware is the fact that regulation of community pharmacies has changed, very substantially, in light of the new pharmacy legislation.  There are now much more stringent controls in place in respect of pharmacies.  In our view, it is now safer to make certain medicines available in pharmacies than might have been the case five years ago.  There is a definite trend in this regard and it will help improve circumstances.<\/p><p>  A number of very specific questions were asked in respect of pricing.  As already stated, pricing is not my brief.  However, we are fully aware of what goes on.  In that context, the industry engages in a dialogue with the Department and prices are agreed in respect of on-patent medicines during that period.  This exclusivity or patent protection is set under European rules and expires after ten or 11 years.  Thereafter, generics are licensed.  Most generic products are licensed directly by the IMB and when applications in this regard are received, they are dealt with in a very timely manner.  Members are correct: there is very little price differential between generics and innovators in this country at present.  In the context of the new Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 and generic substitution, our role will be to determine the medicines that are interchangeable.  In other words, if there is a patented medicine for a particular indication, if this has gone off-patent and if there are five generic products licensed, our job will be to publish a list and indicate whether all of these six medicines - the original and the five generics - are all interchangeable.  We already have in place a list of priority medicines in respect of which decisions will be made, as quickly as possible, when the legislation - in its final form - is enacted.  Setting what is called the reference price will not be our function.  Responsibility in this regard will rest with the HSE and the Department.  If, for example, a medicine costs &euro;10 at present, I have no idea with regard to the level at which the reference price will be set.  Our task will be to indicate which medicines are interchangeable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092700007#F01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1348736700,"counter":838,"content":"<p>Should the IMB have a role in respect of price setting?<\/p> <p>There are various attitudes to that internationally.  Typically, pricing is not within the remit of the medicines regulator.  The regulator is asked to focus on the safety of patients and the quality of the medicines.  I understand two equivalent agencies in Europe have a role in this area: the agency in Denmark and the agency in Italy, which has a small role.  Most agencies are like ours in that this role is done by somebody else.  The regulator is set up to access the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines and deal with the manufacturing sites, distribution and so on.<\/p><p>  On the question of the independence of the regulator as an independent agency versus the Department, although I note Deputy Ciara Conway who raised this issue has left the room, that is a philosophical policy debate.  It has happened across all the developed world that medicines regulation has been moved to independent stand-alone agencies, the argument being that they can develop, have resources and run their business and that lets Departments deal with policy issues and the regulator deal with regulatory issues.  There is nothing we are doing that could not be done within the Department if the necessary staff were in place and there was a legal basis to provide for that but the model I outlined is the one that exists across the developed world.<\/p><p> Deputy Healy asked specifically about our role in clinical trials.

The clinical trials carried out are controlled under a clinical trials directive which is transposed into Irish law by statutory instruments.  If someone wants to do a clinical trial in Ireland, be it an academic body or a big manufacturing company, they can apply to the IMB.  There is a period of 60 days allowed once we receive the application to assess it and come forward with either a positive or a negative outcome, and in the intervening period there would be some level of correspondence with the applicant to clarify questions.  The trials can be divided into four phases, with phase one trials being the very early stage and the phase four trials being products on the market that are being further investigated.  It is all controlled under a legal framework.  Generally what we get on the applications are the protocols and the investigators' brochures.  There is a system around it.  The legislation on this area in Europe is being reviewed to change it to a regulation, which will mean there will be a uniform application of the legislation in Europe.

Mr. O'Mahony said that a company would apply for a drug to be changed from having a prescription-only to an over-the-counter classification.  In the interests of being proactive, is it not within the remit of the IMB to say that medicine X or medicine Y could be available over the counter?  I was not trying to be facetious earlier when I spoke about lipstick and nail varnish products but the difficulty is that most people who go to a pharmacy to get medication must have a prescription in their back pocket.  That is the reality of life.  People have to go to the doctor to get a prescription for almost everything.    I am speaking from my experience as a parent and of what I have seen when I have gone abroad to other countries.  It is possible to buy some medicines in other civilised countries around the world that are not available on a prescription-only basis but it seems the difficulty here is that there is very little delisting of products.  We must compare practices here with those in general in the UK, with which we have a border, as well as similar set-ups in the delivery of health care.  There seems to be a very slow move towards the delisting and supply of over-the-counter medicines.  That is my concern.  Mr. O'Mahony will know that if I want to buy medication that is priced at &euro;7 or &euro;8, which is available over the counter in other countries, it will cost me &euro;62 because I will have to go to a GP to get a prescription for the medication and pay him &euro;55.  That is the reality.  We have the new pharmacy Act, computer software data and various systems available but the Department seems incapable in terms of general health policy in that pharmacists play no role in this respect other than in the dispensing of medication.  That resource is under-utilised.  These are highly professionally qualified and capable people.  The IMB has a role in this respect in terms of pushing for the availability of over-the-counter products.  Why would a company not want to have its product available over the counter?  It beggars belief that a company would say it would prefer its product to be available on a prescription-only basis.  That would surely limit its market availability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092700008#G00500","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1348737300,"counter":844,"content":"<p>I raised the issue of the disparity between the HSE regions in terms of access to specific drugs, to which Mr. O'Mahony did not respond.

It is hugely important that people have access across the board and that there is equal access in every region irrespective of where one lives.<\/p><p>  On the point in regard to the chart and the relationships between the various organisations, I do not know who would undertake to put that in place.  The IMB might consider that.  <\/p><p>  The 2005 directive on blood and blood products is one of the elements of the IMB's work programme.  To follow up on Deputy Healy's question, it is sadly the case here, although not in other jurisdictions, including in the United States, that blood taken in venesections of those who have haemochromatosis is disposed of - it is literally discarded - yet their blood is rich in iron, which is the problem.  Many other people go to the pharmacy to buy over-the-counter medications to substitute their deficiencies in iron.  There is no reason this could not be addressed.  It is wasteful.  There is a cost involved and the international best practice should be applied here.

There are two separate issues I would not like to see get blurred.  We as a nation have to look critically at the issue of drug pricing.  I am committed, wearing both this hat and my day job hat, to our moving wholesale to generic prescribing.  I am very comfortable with generic prescribing and I believe we need to do that.  The reality is that if we do not find a way to save some money on some of the drugs for which we have generic alternatives, we will not have the money available to pay for other drugs which are coming on stream and which may be expensive.<\/p><p>  I would like to familiarise the committee with the term \"biosimilars\".  These are genetically engineered or manufactured versions of certain drugs that are biological products, such as proteins or glycoproteins.  They are not exactly generic; the molecular structures are slightly different, but they will have the same effect.  Because the revolution in molecular medicine has now been ongoing for nearly 20 years, we are now getting the first of these biosimilars, which are the biological equivalent of generics.  We will be under considerable pressure not to move in this direction, with some potential for misinformation, but I believe we should.  <\/p><p>  I would like to qualify slightly what my colleague Deputy Kelleher said.  Although we see certain drugs available over the counter in many of the countries to which we travel on holidays, this is not always appropriate.  The big example people always talk about is antibiotics.  I believe that from the point of view of individual health and concerns about the development of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics, there should be medical regulation of the prescription of antibiotics.<\/p> <p>It is not obvious to me that there is a big problem right now.  I can think of some drugs which in truth probably should be made available over the counter, but it is not obvious to me that there is a big problem in this regard in terms of tardiness in delisting drugs as prescription-only.  In response to Deputy Kelleher, part of the reason companies make the decision is to do with liability issues.  The companies can have issues of liability if something is prescribed or given inappropriately.  At least with a prescription they have an extra level of protection that the product is being used wisely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2012092700008#G00700","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348737900,"counter":847,"content":"<p>I apologise that one or two of the earlier issues were not addressed.

It is not our brief.<\/p><p>  On whether we will be proactive on switching, while the company makes the application and then we assess it and deal with it, the reason we established the consultative panel was to draw out opinion from across the various stakeholders to raise awareness of the issue.  Our ambition is that we will be able to say that in our opinion, particular classes of medicines could be delivered safely over the counter in pharmacies.  We fully support the comments about the expertise available.  My question is whether companies will respond to that and if legislation should be changed to facilitate it.<\/p><p>  I was asked why companies would not want their products reimbursed.  That is a complex issue.  Again, it is not for me to say, but one of the big issues is that when a medicine moves from prescription-only to over-the-counter, it is no longer on the reimbursement list.  Suddenly, a medicine that was prescribed by a doctor, dispensed by a pharmacy and paid for in the reimbursement scheme is no longer available and patients must pay for it themselves.  That is an important issue.  This is something we have raised in discussions at senior level.  We must make informed choices as a country on whether certain medicines can be delivered at the OTC level in the pharmacy, with all of the supports that are available, and whether we should automatically delist them from reimbursement, because that is a disincentive to companies to agree to the change.  In addition, a patient might still choose to go to the doctor and have another medicine prescribed that will be reimbursed so that they do not have to pay the pharmacy for it.  Pricing is not our area, but we have suggested in discussions at a senior level that the restriction of reimbursement to prescription medicines is another area that should be examined in the current, evolving environment.  That is something on which the committee might be able to take a view if it is discussing the matter with colleagues from the Department of Health or the Health Service Executive.

The debate in that regard is ongoing.<\/p><p>  One of the issues that has been discussed internationally, which is worth examining, is the area of medication reviews.  It is not exactly our remit but we are interested in the area.  If a patient is on a complicated regime of five, six or seven medicines, and he or she visits a GP on a monthly basis and has the prescriptions renewed and then the pharmacist dispenses the medicines, in some countries there is another dialogue, perhaps at the level of the pharmacy, to talk about the overall basket of medication he or she is taking.  One might find that he or she is no longer taking one or other of the medicines because in his or her judgment it is not doing them any good or does not suit them.  The medicine is still being dispensed and is still a cost to the state.

I was born and raised in New Ross.  After a number of years working in Dublin and a spell abroad, I returned to New Ross in 1986 and have been in business there ever since.  Throughout my business career, I have been involved in the local business community.  I have been a committee member of New Ross Traders Association and was chairperson for two years, from 2002 to 2004.  As a member of the board of directors of New Ross Chamber of Commerce, I was involved at all levels of chamber activity.  This included chamber of commerce policy, local and national promotions, retail and tourism marketing and lobbying.  I am a board of management member of St. Canice&rsquo;s national school and a director of New Ross Credit Union.  I have served previously on the board of New Ross Port Company from 1997 to 2002 and from 2004 to 2009, when I was also a member of New Ross Town Council.  During this time, I was highly involved at board level and committees of which I was a member ranged from the board audit committee to the pension review committee and the company interview panel.  Because of my experience on the audit committee, I can review and appraise financial statements, I understand accounting procedures and controls and know how to measure operating performance and liquidity.<\/p><p>  I am honoured to be asked to chair the board of New Ross Port Company and, if approved, look forward to meeting the other board members and working with them.  I will ensure a high standard of corporate governance and board reporting and that existing practices comply with governance best practices.  I will provide leadership for the board.  The core objective of national ports and shipping policy is to facilitate a competitive and effective market for maritime transport services.  In the current economic downturn this objective is more important than ever.  However, the same economic downturn means that achieving this objective is now more difficult than ever.  New Ross Port is unique, as it is tidal and 14 miles inland.  It straddles two counties and three local authority areas, namely, those of Wexford County Council, Kilkenny County Council and New Ross Town Council.  The majority of the jetties in the port are in private ownership. <\/p><p>  All ports have been affected by the recession and tonnage, throughput, margins and revenues have suffered.  New Ross Port is no exception and, in fact, owing to the loss of liquid fuel imports from the customer base, the decrease in turnover is much more stark than the national average.  The incoming board of New Ross Port Company face challenges on a number of fronts.  The need to increase throughput and revenues will be highest on the agenda.  As a small port with low tonnage, the loss of one major customer has a hugely detrimental effect but, consequently, any new business has a large beneficial effect on revenues and cash flow.  It will be the highest priority to look for new business.  It also will be necessary to look at other areas where revenue can be generated for the company.  New Ross Port has always supported marine tourism initiatives but has not been involved in generating income from this source.  This is an area the board should examine further.<\/p><p>  I look forward to publication of the port policy review and working with the board on its implications for New Ross Port.  The corporate structures and reporting requirements for a small port such as New Ross may come in for mention and there may be changes.  I will work with the board and staff to ensure New Ross Port Company meets all of its governance requirements.  In spite of the challenges facing New Ross Port, I am confident about its future.  While there certainly will be changes, the board and I will make sure these changes improve New Ross Port.  <\/p><p>  I look forward to hearing the views and comments of members and thank them again for giving me this opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Lawlor"},{"type":"speech","time":1348736400,"counter":882,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lawlor for his opening statement and will throw open the floor to members to ask whatever questions they wish.

The first issue he has raised pertains to the possible sale of the port.  While I was not on the board when the McCarthy report was published, I was aware the possible sale of ports was mentioned therein.  I note that during my first stint as a director of the port from 1997, this issue was also raised in a port review document.  I believe the forthcoming port policy review will revert to addressing this issue again.  As to whether a sale would affect throughput or the port itself, as someone who has been involved in business, if it was Government policy to sell off a State asset, I cannot envisage that whosoever would seek to buy it would so do without a view towards increasing business.<\/p> <p>It is dependent on the Government&rsquo;s policy and the incoming board will have to wait for the policy review to see the implications for New Ross Port.<\/p><p> New Ross Port Company has always been supportive of marine-leisure tourism initiatives in its catchment area on the Barrow and on the estuary.  There is a galley cruising restaurant in New Ross, the only one in the country.  New Ross also has the Dunbrody famine ship which expanded earlier this year and its visitor numbers are up.  Both of these facilities, as well as the marina owned by the local authority, are supported in all ways by the port company.  To my knowledge, the port company has not, to date, been involved in generating any income from these supports.  In the current difficult economic circumstances, the port company is not in a position to support an initiative unless there is a possibility of generating income.<\/p><p> Regarding the merger of ports, in the original ports policy in 2005 mergers were seen as a possibility.  The New Ross Port Company examined it at the time but it was not seen as a viable option.  I would have to wait for the forthcoming review to see if anything has changed in the interim.  In certain instances, port mergers have worked very well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700003#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Lawlor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348737000,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lawlor for his presentation to the committee.

Is Mr. Lawlor confident he would be able to bring the board with him in the event of such moves?  Does the port have any capital requirements to continue being viable?  Mr. Lawlor pointed out that, as the port is 14 miles inland, dredging and capital works to quays are necessary.  From where are the funds for these works coming, considering capital funding nationally is scarce?  Mr. Lawlor stated the decrease in liquid fuel imports has had a detrimental effect on New Ross Port.  Shipping will come to a port if it is competitive and its cost base is low.

This would not be the first instance the company has had to make difficult decisions and neither would it be the first instance since I have been on the board.  At the New Ross Port Company&rsquo;s request several years ago, the Department was requested to have our directors&rsquo; fees reduced because company revenues had dropped.  It was the board, with the co-operation of the staff, which introduced the last redundancy scheme and which reduced the company&rsquo;s cost base drastically.

There is ongoing maintenance dredging that is funded out of cash flow.  Any company that uses the heavy infrastructure that ports do would always have a capital requirement for expansion and maintenance.  The majority of jetties in New Ross Port are in private ownership so their maintenance is the responsibility of the private owners.  The New Ross Port Company jetty was in good condition in 2009, so I believe there should be no problems with it.<\/p><p>  I believe the new board will be examining strategic alliances with other ports.  It would be of a major advantage on a national basis.<\/p> <p>To a certain extent, I have always found in business, particularly in niche markets, that those alliances will happen because it is advantageous to the customer.  Deputy Harrington is correct in stating that the customer will go to the port offering the best value.  It may not necessarily be the lowest price but it will be to the best advantage of that particular customer.  In bringing in a particular type of dry bulk such as fertilisers, coal, animal feed, one will always look for where one will get the best advantage for one's business.<\/p><p> As I mentioned, New Ross Port Company has a low cost base because of the last redundancy scheme.  It has been well managed to date.  I pay tribute to the outgoing board, particularly the outgoing chairman, Mr. Mark Minihan, whom I know well.  From what I have seen, they have done an excellent job to date.<\/p><p> If there is one area sticking out in which the cost base could be improved, it is that the River Barrow estuary still has a dual pilotage authority, with the New Ross pilotage authority and the Waterford pilotage authority.  It is one area on which, if appointed chair, I would very much like to work with the board.  Having two pilots on the one river for one ship movement is difficult to sell to customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Lawlor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348737300,"counter":892,"content":"<p>How many are employed in the port?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700005#D00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348737300,"counter":893,"content":"<p>There is the chief executive, one office member, one outdoor staff and two pilots.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Lawlor"},{"type":"speech","time":1348737300,"counter":894,"content":"<p>Five.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700005#D00400","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348737300,"counter":895,"content":"<p>We are running it on five directly employed by the port company.

It fizzled out without so much as a whimper.  I was appointed to the board in 1997 and when that term of office came to a conclusion in 2002, a new board was appointed and I was not one of the members who were reappointed.  In 2004, I was appointed to the board from New Ross Town Council and I sat on the board until 2009.  My term of office, as a town councillor and as a board member, came to an end in 2009.<\/p><p>  The advantages and disadvantages of a tidal river relate back to what I described earlier in terms of niche product that a particular ship owner or stevedore wants to move.  The two stevedores in New Ross Port Company have always used the fact that they are 14 miles inland to their advantage, particularly with animal feed and coal imports.  They can get their product that much further inland and the recepients, be they wholesalers or, in case of animal feeds and fertilisers, the agricultural co-operatives, would appear to want to get that product as close to their warehousing and storage as possible.  The disadvantages of a tidal river, as the Senator described, are that heavily laden ships must come and go on the tide.  Again, I pay compliment to both the chief executive and the pilots of New Ross Port Company because in the past they have always been more than co-operative in ensuring those ships can move with the tides and get their loading done to their best advantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700005#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Lawlor"},{"type":"speech","time":1348737300,"counter":899,"content":"<p>I meant to ask the maximum capacity tonnage that can progress upriver to the port of New Ross.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700005#D00900","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348737300,"counter":900,"content":"<p>I will give a maximum tonnage in the view of a lay chairman.

In 2009, when I finished my previous term, the company was not profitable and I do not believe the situation has improved since.  For a number of years, it was breaking even.  Turnover has declined since, largely due to fuel imports.

I am applying for reappointment as chairperson of Galway Harbour Company.  I was first appointed as a director in June 2007, subsequently became acting chairperson in 2008 and was appointed as chairperson the following year.  My background is in construction.  I graduated in civil engineering and construction management from Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, which in my day was called the regional technical college.  I have subsequently returned as an external examiner at GMIT and have forged strong links in supporting postgraduate programmes and research.<\/p><p>  I founded my own construction business in 1998 and currently employ 26 people directly.  We are fortunate that we never entered the development market and have no development loans or large redundant land banks.  We specialise in industrial, medical device and health care projects.<\/p><p>  I have had an interest in all things nautical since I was a young boy.  I recall the port of Galway being a hive of activity with imports of fertiliser, animal feed and large-scale exports of product from the Tynagh Mines, together with the importation of oil.  I should also mention that I am a keen sailor.  While many of the aforementioned commodities no longer come through the port, Galway Harbour Company has not sat back and new products and new types of business have been sought.  I will deal with this later in my presentation.<\/p><p>  As stated, I was appointed in 2007.  I believe I have made a valuable contribution to the harbour company and to its shareholder, the State.  Some achievements and notable events during my tenure as director-chairman include the opening of the Enwest oil terminal in Galway, which has a capacity in excess of 35,000 tonnes of product and operates 24-7, thereby reducing traffic at peak times; and hosting the Volvo Ocean Race stopover 2009 and Volvo Grand Finale 2012.  We are currently awaiting an independent report on the cost benefit analysis of the last stopover of the Volvo Ocean Race in Galway.  I was also involved in restructuring of the pension fund, which is now in positive territory, with a reduction from &euro;600,000 to &euro;110,000 per annum in the annual company contribution; the rationalisation programme to ensure sustainability, which through a review of practices and costs has produced savings of &euro;400,000 per annum, without any redundancies to date; and the reintroduction of Galway as a cruise stopover, with eight ships this year.  I will outline later what the port has done in relation to this and the promotion of tourism in the west.<\/p><p>  Other achievements include the review and updating of all leases on lands and property the company owns; procurement and installation of a 30 berth marina; an increase in bitumen imports and construction of the extended bitumen terminal; and continued growth in exports, including a new commodity, namely, refined sand for use in the manufacture of glass and food production, which is a local success story.  McGrath Limestone Works in Cong in County Mayo has commenced exporting crushed limestone through the port.  Laboratory tests have shown it has an extremely high purity and is low in iron; hence, it can be used in glass manufacturing as well as in the food and cosmetic industries.  The company has established markets in Scotland, northern England and Sweden.  More than 2,500 tonnes were loaded in one day last week and exported to the port of Ayr in Scotland.  Samples have also been sent to Germany and southern England and it is anticipated this business has enormous potential.  Galway is the only suitable port for its export as the nature of the product, which is bulky, makes it cost prohibitive to haul it by road to Limerick or Dublin.  Jobs have been created in Cong, including in haulage and stevedoring.<\/p><p>  Other achievements include the construction of a new multi-purpose slipway; partaking in discussion groups with the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, GMIT, the Marine Institute, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, IDA Ireland, Galway City Council and Galway County Council on the development of the brownfield lands in the existing harbour once the port is relocated and making this area a cultural and tourism support area, together with its being a hub for new research and development centres with a global impact in the marine, medical and technology sectors.  This is an area we believe can be exploited to the good in Galway because of our links with NUIG, GMIT, IDA Ireland and the Marine Institute.  There are a wealth of possibilities including tidal and wind energy, offshore exploration and so on.<\/p><p>  I have also assisted in making the public and media aware of the current port, its facilities and our plans for the future, and interacting and partaking in negotiations with port users, Departments, future customers, State agencies, EC, civic dignitaries and so on.  I have hosted a two-day public consultation programme in relation to the new port.  On this note, the harbour company firmly believes in consultation through the preparation of the planning process, and consultations have taken place with many organisations, bodies and individuals, including the city and county councils, numerous resident associations, An Taisce, CIE, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport officials, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine officials, Galway fire and rescue services, the Western Regional Fisheries Board, council members and Members of the Oireachtas, to name but a few.<\/p><p>  I have also been involved in promoting Galway Port and the surrounding area as a commercial and tourist gem.  I have hosted an international architectural competition for the development of the port.  Last night, I attended the launch of Open House Galway, an annual event, which has become an international event, which promotes architecture.  Events such as Open House Galway and Open House Dublin, which promote architecture, are held in the UK, the US and throughout Europe.  It is important this is done in the current economic climate.<\/p> <p>We have also hosted cultural events at the harbour and the World Power Boat Championships<\/p><p> Galway Harbour Company has 12 full-time employees.  The Vision lands, which are the inner port, comprise approximately 32 acres and the Galway Harbour Enterprise Park comprises 45 acres.  Approximately 500 people are employed in the Galway Harbour Enterprise Park.  The principal lines of business are shipping, which while it has declined is still our main source of income; cruise liners, which are an expanding area; car parking; and as landlord to a number of properties.  Imports and exports comprise largely oil.  Bitumen, limestone and scrap metal are exported and we have imports of steel and coal.  I believe we are the only port in Ireland importing reinforced steel for construction.  All the rest of the steel comes in by road on ferries.  Lydons in Galway is the only company importing it in bulk.<\/p><p> We have three car parks and on-street car parking yielding approximately &euro;1 million per annum.  The company is a landlord, holding 25 leases with a value of approximately &euro;1 million per annum.  We have approximately &euro;1.4 million in borrowings, predominantly for the construction of an oil pipeline from the tanker berth to the new Enwest terminal, which we decided to undertake ourselves in order that we would have full control of it in the future.  We also have some borrowings on a port crane.<\/p><p> In my submission I listed the company's financials for 2009 to 2011, inclusive.  There is no denying that shipping has declined from &euro;2.1 million to &euro;1.6 million.  Car parking and rental income have remained static.  Employment costs have reduced following some rationalisation and our profit has increased.<\/p><p> I will give some statistics on port throughput.  We had 229 ships in 2009, 211 ships in 2010 and 184 in 2011.  The tonnage throughput in 2011 was 552,000 tonnes, a significant decline since 2005 when we hit the 1 million tonne mark.  However, I think this further emphasises the need for us to develop, rather than contract, because otherwise we will lose some of our existing port business.<\/p><p> The highlights of 2012 to date include the final leg of the Volvo Ocean Race.  We intend to lodge our planning application for the new port in the fourth quarter of this year.  The decision to proceed with Article 6(4) of the habitats directive for the planning application is imminent.  This will be an IROPI, imperative reasons of overriding public interest, application, as opposed to going through An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and we have a meeting on Monday with An Bord Plean&aacute;la to discuss this further and to agree the process.  We have close working relationships with Galway City Council, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the European Commission regarding the proposed development.<\/p><p> We have been granted multiple planning permissions this year for the retention of car parking and a new landing pontoon for the cruise line business.  The harbour company has embarked on a campaign to promote tourism.  A few years ago we had no cruise liners and we have had eight this year.  We also have bookings for next year and the following year.  This is a business we sought ourselves.  We travelled to the United States and engaged with cruise line executives whom we invited to Galway with great success.  On the night I met the first group, I mentioned to one individual that I could not wait to see one of his ships come up Galway Bay.  When he laughed out loud, we were very taken aback.  However, after they had seen the harbour's proximity to Galway city, the Cliffs of Moher, the Aran Islands, Connemara, Kylemore Abbey, Ashford Castle, Cong, and the Maam Valley, they were blown away.  When I dropped him back to Shannon Airport three days later, he apologised, took it all back and said he would bring a ship here.  This summer I am delighted to report that he kept to his word and brought a university ship that travels the world on semesters with 700 students.  Not only did they partake in tourism, they also engaged with the colleges in Galway.<\/p><p> Other highlights include the additional pontoons and the extension of the marina.  We developed a major new export line for limestone.  We are about to sign a new lease with the Marine Institute for extended facilities to service its two vessels, the <i>Celtic Explorer<\/i>and the <i>Celtic Voyager<\/i>, whose home port is Galway.  New sailing club facilities have been provided on the enterprise park.  In excess of 500 people are going out on Galway Bay on dinghy sailing, racing canoeing, and so on.  More than 20 clubs are accommodated in this new building, including the sea scouts who had no home for a number of years, and it is great to see them back in the port.<\/p><p> There is a continuation of strong financial performance and a pension fund surplus.  Since we were first incorporated in 1996 the company has always traded profitably.  We have just issued a new suite of corporate governance documents.  We have a strategy for the future of Galway Harbour.  This year we paid a dividend to the State for the first time in the company's history.  This is something in which I firmly believe and it is correct policy to do so.  When I raised the matter at the company's board, it was debated and passed unanimously.<\/p><p> In the fourth quarter of 2012 we hope to lodge a planning application for the new port of Galway, which we hope will be granted in summer 2013.  We anticipate commencing building in 2014 with the first stage complete in 2016.  While a few years ago we all had grand plans, in the current economic climate we understand that projects need to be completed on a phased basis.  We completely re-evaluated what we would do with our port and we have gone with a phased format, with the first phase costing approximately &euro;50 million.  By 2016 all existing business will have transferred from the old harbour to new port of Galway and by 2017 that will allow the old harbour to be developed to the benefit of the city.  In 2018 we will commence stages 3, 4 and 5 for the new port.<\/p><p> I will outline my vision for the future of Galway.  The port operates in the heart of medieval Galway city, within a few hundred yards of the city's high street.  Its location gives rise to tremendous opportunities but also to significant challenges.  To overcome the challenges identified and exploit the opportunities, the harbour company management and board of directors have undertaken a strategic review of their current situation.  From this review, a programme of action has been agreed which will protect the harbour business and return the inner harbour area to the city, separate but connected, different but complementary.  It is strongly believed this development will reinforce the ideal of a real centre of trade in the west, honouring the city's tradition as a large commercial port which is recorded in records dating back to the 14th century.<\/p><p> The strategy being employed is consistent with the Government's ports policy which has some central tenets, including the provision of adequate and efficient capacity into the future and acknowledging the long lead-in times in developing facilities and, as a result, the obligations on port management to act now to provide adequate capacity for the future on time.  Regional ports have a major role to play in the health of local economies, and Galway Harbour Company's management decision is based on clear business logic and reflects the goal as expressed in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport strategy statement to ensure investment in ports meets port capacity requirements and to facilitate the availability of commercial port services which are effective, competitive and cost effective.<\/p><p> Galway's strategic location is recognised as a gateway under the provisions of the National Spatial Strategy 2002-2020, which is defined as &quot;a city having a strategic location nationally and relative to their surrounding areas and providing national scale social, economic infrastructure and support services&quot;.  Following on from the national strategy, the Regional Planning Guidelines for the West 2012-2033 acknowledge that Galway sea port is of strategic importance to the west region.  The document states that the plan for the relocation and extension of Galway Harbour area, which includes deep water port facilities, has the potential to contribute to both tourism and enterprise in the local economy and is considered critical for growth in the region.  The undisputed importance of the port and the development proposed is further supported in the Galway City Development Plan 2011-2017.  The Galway Harbour Company's decision to relocate its commercial activity and develop its lands is driven by an identified business need to protect, develop and grow the port business.<\/p> <p>Galway needs to expand.  We cannot stand still.  If we do so in the short rather than medium term, it will not be cost-effective to bring business into Galway and we will be merely a landlord.  Our port is both tidal and gated in that ships can only come into the port on high tide, which occurs twice a day.  So we have a two-hour window every 12 hours to bring ships in and out of the port and we also have dock gates to hold the water in the inner basin.  We are restricted on ship size - up to about 115 m in length and maximum tonnage is approximately 4,500 to 5,000 tonnes, depending on the tide.  <\/p><p> We want to preserve existing business.  If we do not expand, economies of scale will defeat us.  An oil tanker with possibly 3,000 tonnes of fuel on board has a crew of approximately ten.  An oil tanker with 8,000 tonnes on board has a crew of 11 - one extra man.  It does not take three times the amount of fuel to steam it to Galway.  Hence, oil companies, no more than everyone else, focus on margin in their business in these times and Galway will lose out if we do not expand.  We hope to obtain new business and we have had several meetings on offshore exploration and the importation of biomass products to feed some of the power generating stations in the country.  Our port is too small but we believe we can add value to that business if we have our new port.  We have a rail link which would serve a new site being developed in Killala for the production of electricity.  <\/p><p> In respect of tourism and cruise business, Galway is a jewel in the centre of a necklace of attractions for tourism, including the Cliffs of Moher, the Aran Islands, Galway city, Connemara and Mayo and the Midlands.  I have also spoken about the utilisation of existing lands in the inner port to promote culture, tourism and employment.  We have a strategy group which is reviewing what will happen with the brownfield lands and there is a firm belief that there is huge capacity to employ people in Galway in research and development, marine and, in particular, offshore energy.  We have the Marine Institute and the colleges.  <\/p><p> The planning for the new port involves reclaiming almost 24 ha of land.  It will have 660 m of sheltered quays at a minimum depth at low water of 12 m and a turning circle of 400 m so we can bring some of the largest cruise liners in the world into Galway.  We will have a fishermen's pier, a marina for marine tourism with 216 berths and a freight rail link.  We will be connected to mainline rail.  We will be developing 28 ha of port land and there will be opportunities for the deployment of ocean energy prototypes and an offshore oil and gas service base.  We have had to turn down vessels for that at the moment because they are now too wide to come into Galway.  Our dock gates are 19 m, while some of these vessels are in excess of 20 m wide.  I believe some of them are coming from Scotland to service off the west coast.  We have a nautical centre which will be further developed in the new port.  <\/p><p> In respect of planning permission and IROPI, we believe that this is the way we will be going with our application.  We have met with EU officials and engaged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the National Parks and Wildlife Service and that will be moving on this week.  It will be the first IROPI case in the country and is a learning curve for all of us.  The cost of phase one is approximately &euro;50 million and funding will be from our resources.  We have property we could dispose of.  It is not as valuable as it possibly was a number of years ago but, in turn, construction costs have reduced dramatically.  We would be hopeful of European funding.  We have been told that there is no Exchequer funding at the moment and we take that on board but there are other forms of funding, be they public-private partnerships or sovereign funds from abroad.  Perhaps cruise companies would look for a base they would have full rights to, as with offshore exploration.  <\/p><p> In respect of an integrated approach by Galway City Council, CIE and the harbour company, CIE has a proposed development at Ceannt Station in Galway.  I think that has been long-fingered in the short term but we have had various interactions on that to develop in tandem.  Planning officials have requested that we work together in harmony to ensure there are no conflicts in our planning permission.  In respect of Galway Harbour Village, which is the old port, I believe when the new port is built, that will open up the city.  Rather than looking out to sea, people will look into the city and see what we have in it.  <\/p><p> I would like to mention the new board but before I do so, I recognise the exceptional work the previous board members carried out on behalf of the company and its shareholder.  As chairman designate and together with the CEO, I met with our three newly appointed directors last week and am excited about the valuable contribution each of them can make.  Their previous experience in marketing, finance, commerce and local government will enable them to make a substantial contribution to our board.  They will attend their inaugural board meeting tomorrow morning at 8.30 a.m. at the harbour office in Galway.  <\/p><p> In conclusion, I believe I am an ideal choice of chairman to lead the Galway Harbour Company through the next few critical years of its development.  I believe I possess the correct leadership skills, experience and ability to listen, comment and be decisive in representing both the company and its shareholder.  Furthermore, I believe that the current proposal for development of the port has been well thought out and debated and has received valid input from experienced and competent experts in its preparation.  To safeguard against the port of Galway becoming commercially unviable and the province losing its regional port, it is essential that the harbour company proceed with its current phased development plan.  I take this opportunity to request that Galway, as a regional port for imports and exports, tourism, employment, culture and safeguarding the gateway to the west, be given particular mention in the current port policy statement which is being finalised and is to be issued by the Department of Transport in the near future.  Finally, I thank the committee for allowing me the opportunity to make my presentation today as chairman designate and I will gladly answer questions to the best of my ability and take on board any comments that members wish to make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700006#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Carey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348739100,"counter":908,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Carey provide us with more detail about the total cost of the planned development, which is &euro;126 million?

The first phase, which is essentially a new pier that is not tidal, would allow cruise liners to come in.  It would allow larger ships for oil imports and other bulk products into Galway.  That would allow us to hold onto existing customers so really it is the first &euro;50 million that is critical.  I am informed that there is a possibility of European funding for tourism in Galway and it may also come through the cruise business.  We have several other lines of funding we can explore.  It is easy to say \"build it and they will come,\" but one cannot do that nowadays.  It was done in the past and it does not work.  However, I believe areas of funding will be opened up once we obtain our planning permission.  When one has planning permission, people start to take an interest and investors will come on board.

I thought he was a more modest individual but I agree entirely with the sentiments expressed in his contribution.  He has made a very valuable contribution to the Galway Harbour Company since he was appointed first as a member and subsequently as chairman.<\/p> <p>I served on the board with Mr. Carey from 2005 to 2009 so I know first hand that on many occasions he went far beyond the call of duty in his role.  Going through notes for the meeting I saw a document which suggested Mr. Carey had attended 53 out of the past 53 meetings.  He has not missed any meetings and is making a very valuable contribution, which is reflected in the fact the Minister has chosen to reappoint him.  I am new to this game but I suggest it is unusual that a Government of a different political persuasion would choose to reappoint a chairperson appointed by its predecessor.  It speaks volumes of Mr. Carey's ability and contribution to the board over the years.<\/p><p> I am familiar with Mr. Carey's ambitious plans.  I know the existing funding structures and that Mr. Carey may be able to gear up against other assets to fund these plans.  On several occasions the Taoiseach has clearly outlined his strong support for this vision for Galway port and has publicly stated as recently as during the Volvo Ocean Race that he is entirely behind the plan and will be of assistance with regard to whatever funding mechanism Mr. Carey tries to achieve.<\/p><p> Mr. Carey mentioned the cruise operators which visited Galway last year.  These included some of the biggest cruise line operators in the world, many based in Miami.  It was a great achievement to have this calibre of person reviewing Mr. Carey's plans and seeing the region.  I spoke to one of the CEOs who had just placed an order for a vessel costing in the region of US$1 billion.  She indicated the possibility that some of these cruise line operators would part-finance the development of the new port.  Has Mr. Carey explored this in any great detail since then?  Is it an avenue he could pursue?<\/p><p> Through my involvement with the Volvo Ocean Race I have spoken to John Killeen, who was the main man behind bringing the event to Galway for the second time.  He has suggested concerns are beginning to emerge about the quality of the infrastructure at Dublin Port for the storage and acceptance of oil product.  He sees Galway Port having a major advantage, as the Enwest terminal and other terminals developed in recent years are state-of-the-art.  He suggests the facilities at Galway Port are the safest and most advanced in terms of acceptance and storage of oil product in Europe.  Does Mr. Carey see this as being a possibility for future development?  Will he elaborate, if he has the information, on the people behind the Enwest terminal?  At what cost was it developed?  I do not believe he meant the Galway Harbour Company contributed to it but does he have a rough estimate of its cost and where it stands with regard to the Seveso regulations?  I am aware of concerns about oil product and proximity to areas of population.<\/p><p> The Government will soon introduce a policy on ports.  Where would Mr. Carey like to see Galway being positioned in this policy?  On the basis of the information provided today it will not be up there competing with Dublin, Shannon Foynes or Cork, which are the top three ports.  What statement would Mr. Carey like to see in the ports policy relating to Galway Harbour?  I thank Mr. Carey for coming before the committee today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700008#G00400","speaker":"1109","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348739700,"counter":912,"content":"<p>With regard to cruise funding, we have had preliminary discussions.  When one has valid client permission people sit up and take notice.  An executive from a subsidiary of Royal Caribbean came to Galway.  It has funded many ports in the Caribbean and the United States and is looking for hubs in Europe where it would have certain landing and docking rights.  While Galway is on the west coast of Europe, it links with cruises around the British Isles and as far north as Norway, Sweden and the Arctic Circle.  When a company relocates ships they travel across the Atlantic, and Galway would be their first or last port of call.  One of the executives was very interested in how far the nearest airport was from Galway, which is now Shannon Airport after the closure of Galway Airport.  If it had a hub it would fly passengers in and out, and the fact that Shannon airport is 50 miles down the road certainly did not scare away the executive.  In large cities it can take an hour or an hour and a half to travel to and from an airport.  The jewel in the crown for the companies is that one can get off a ship in Galway and walk safely into the city centre in five minutes.  This is very rare.<\/p><p>  Deputy Walsh is correct about John Killeen and the Volvo Ocean Race, which was an excellent success.  I cannot comment on Dublin Port but I know it has had tank farms for a number of years.  Due to the Seveso regulations it probably would not obtain planning permission if it were to take them down and rebuild them in the same spot.  Certain rules on exclusion zones and residential units, hospitals and schools now exist with regard to the storage of petroleum.  One of the terminals in Galway was demolished prior to the previous Volvo Ocean Race and the fact that the new Enwest terminal is further out to sea and away from the city has opened up some land.  In order to open up much more land, including Galway Harbour Company land, land owned by other individuals and land owned by the State, it is essential that the operation of unloading ships moves away from the city.<\/p><p>  The cost of the Enwest terminal was approximately &euro;50 million and John Killeen was the project manager.  As I stated earlier it is fully automated and trucks can load day or night 24-7.  It can take all products including petroleum, kerosene and DERV.<\/p><p>  With regard to where in the policy I see the place of the new and existing ports in Galway, it is a regional port and we accept it will not be a Shannon Foynes, Cork or Dublin.  However, it has something to offer on the west coast serving Connacht and the midlands with the new motorways and infrastructure which has been put in place for the haulage of products to and from Galway.  I would like Galway to feature strongly in the new ports policy.  It is very important to the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Carey"},{"type":"speech","time":1348739700,"counter":913,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Carey for his very good and detailed presentation.  The passion he has for the port, the maritime field and Galway is quite clear.  Mr. Carey has a great deal of experience of the port and working in Galway.  It must be disconcerting to note the strategic nature of the port in Galway and the strategic business it carries out is still shipping.  I suggest the decline in shipping from 2005 to the present day needs to be addressed, not only for the good of the port but for the strategic benefit of Connacht.  To compare the port in Galway to the likes of Dublin, Cork or Shannon Foynes is to downplay its important role in servicing Connacht and the west of Ireland in shipping.  It facilitates business through importing and exporting.<\/p><p>  We have a basic familiarity with the strategic plans of many of the ports.  Many of them state they need to expand and relocate and Mr. Carey mentioned the possible demolition and redevelopment of Dublin Port's Seveso sites.  It is a crowded house with regard to funding.<\/p> <p>Everyone has a passion for his or her own port and wants to attract more cruise line traffic to facilitate the tourism industry, more offshore exploration traffic along the western seaboard or more marine leisure.  In the event of the funding not coming through and if Galway Port, for example, wants to make the strategic decision to attract economic shipping, be it bulk goods, fuel or whatever, it may need to restrict its plans for cruise line traffic, leisure, etc.  Is Mr. Carey confident that he would be able to take the difficult decision to doff the maroon jersey and don the green one?  For example, if Dublin Port was expanded, it could become the fuel importing port servicing the country and Galway could become the cruise line traffic port while maintaining strategic import and export levels for Connacht.  We could discuss Cork in another context.  Is Mr. Carey confident that this decision could be taken and that he could bring the board with him?<\/p><p> In terms of Galway Port&rsquo;s expansion, Mr. Carey referred to the reclamation of an extra 50 or 60 acres.  It is a significant undertaking.  Is he confident that day-to-day decisions at the port are taken with a view towards a potential expansion?  It may not occur for ten years, given the current climate.  Cruise line traffic might not be found to subsidise the port.  How would that affect its day-to-day running and the way it attracted business on the markets?<\/p><p> As chairman, is Mr. Carey confident concerning costs?  As mentioned during the last presentation, shipping will be attracted to the lowest cost base.  Is Galway Port competing well for shipping?  If so, why has it lost half of its shipping in seven or eight years?  This stark issue needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> The port is strategic, not just for Galway or Connacht, but for Ireland.  All of the ports in question are important.  Some 90% of goods entering and leaving the country do so via the ports.  The airports are more glamorous, but the heavy lifting is done by the ports.  Those like Galway are strategic and of national importance.  I look forward to Mr. Carey&rsquo;s comments in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700009#H00300","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348740300,"counter":915,"content":"<p>I agree that Galway Port has a significant role to play as a regional port for Connacht and the midlands.  We can compete with the likes of Shannon Foynes, Cork and Dublin.<\/p><p>  It would be fundamentally unwise to have a single port or even two handling the majority of the country&rsquo;s petroleum imports.  Cargo could get contaminated and contaminate the cargo in the other storage tanks.  If an incident caused a terminal to shut down for even a short time, no fuel would be available in the country.  The National Oil Reserves Agency's storage of fuel product in the event of an emergency could go to a new port.<\/p><p>  Competing is difficult.  We have trimmed our costs and are profitable.  We will maintain that profitability.  Our largest handicap is the fact that we are a gated port, in that we can only bring in ships at a certain time.  The gates require a gateman to open and close them two hours in every 12, leading to overtime costs, etc.<\/p><p>  If our plans are postponed, be it for planning or fund reasons, we will need a plan B.  We have considered bringing larger tankers to Galway.  The harbourmaster is working to maximise what we can bring into the port, bearing safety in mind at all times.<\/p><p>  Instead of agreeing to the cost figures for the new port that were prepared by our design team, we decided to have the project peer-reviewed by external experts so that we might be satisfied with the first phase&rsquo;s costs and that we are taking the port in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700010#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Carey"},{"type":"speech","time":1348740300,"counter":916,"content":"<p>As no other member wishes to contribute, I will ask about a somewhat different issue.

I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Tom Hayes on his appointment as Chairman of the committee and wish him well.  There is a heavy agenda to be addressed in this area.  We had a good working relationship with the Chairman's predecessor, Deputy Andrew Doyle, and members of the committee, with whom we managed to get through a good deal of work.  I have no doubt this will continue under the direction of the current Chairman.<\/p><p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak to the committee about the analogue switch-off campaign which has been under way since this time last year.  Giving television viewers a full year's notice of what was coming down the track was deliberate.  In addition to my discussions with individual colleagues, some of whom are here today, two separate presentations were made in the audiovisual room on the implications of digital switchover.<\/p><p>  I am accompanied by the assistant secretary at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Eamonn Molloy, who has oversight of this campaign from the Department's point of view.  Ms Mary Curtis is the head of RTE's digital television services and director of the digital switchover campaign for RTE.  Mr. Michael Keogh is a technical genius.  His ingenuity has been tested as he travelled the country to ensure a smooth roll-out of the digital network.  Should members have detailed or technical questions they wish to raise, one of us will, it is hoped, be able to provide answers for them.  <\/p><p>  I understand each member of the committee received a briefing document from my Department and RTE earlier this week.  I do not wish to go over the details contained therein.  This meeting presents me with an excellent opportunity to get several messages out, the first of which is that the analogue switch-off will take place on 24 October.  It is important that people are persuaded that it will happen and that it is not a frolic by the Irish Government or me, as the signal is being switched off across Europe.  The date and time for the switch-off in Ireland is 10 a.m. on 24 October.  It will happen.  People who have not switched before that date will have no signal on 25 October.  It is important that people appreciate this.  This is not a case of \"It will never catch on down here.\"  People will not be able to view \"Coronation Street\" if they do not make the switch before 24 October.  In this regard, it would be immensely preferable if people did not wait until 23 October to do so.  It is the nature of people in Ireland to wait until the last minute to do things, at which point there will be queues and many people will be disappointed.  We do not want to see that happen.  <\/p><p>  Irish television customers have a choice in terms of the three different television platforms available.  In order of scale, these are satellite, cable and digital free-to-air.  Saorview is the national digital free-to-air network.  Following switch-off, we expect Saorview to be the exclusive television viewing platform of between 12% and 15% of households in this country.  The range in respect of households with a second or third television is somewhere between 20% and 25%.  Some colleagues here have raised with me the fact that Saorview will only be available to 98% of the population.  One hundred percent of the population is covered by the free-to-air Irish satellite option, Saorsat.  This solution was developed to cater for the 2% who cannot get Saorview.  As such, there is, for the first time, virtually full coverage nationwide for free-to-air viewers choosing to use Saorview and Saorsat.<\/p><p>  The digital switchover campaign has been a national one, involving efforts across a range of areas, including information, advertising and PR and community initiatives and campaigns locally.<\/p> <p>I would like to record today my appreciation for the work done by the voluntary organisations and the 26 local digital champions we put in place working under the auspices of The Wheel and Irish Rural Link, which are the national co-ordination groups.  I have been around the country to some of the voluntary organisations and there is tremendous commitment from them, including the GAA.  Its social initiative in this regard is very important, and other contributing organisations include Age Action Ireland, the Irish Farmers Association, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the rural transport initiative.  I was in Meath last Friday evening at an event with approximately 150 people.  There is also the work of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to consider, as well as a myriad of other local community and voluntary organisations.<\/p><p> These voluntary groups have given the digital switchover campaign a particular focus in getting the public at parish level and in local communities to assist neighbours and relations in making the switch to digital.  The campaign has also received strong support from An Post, which I acknowledge, as it conducted a very successful national mailing of publicity information on time.  Post offices nationwide are currently offering switchover information and services to consumers, and I commend the staff and management of the company for the contribution to the campaign.  I know the committee is examining the future role of the post office network in a different context, and I suggest that the company's role in this campaign is a useful pointer to the type of service that it can offer to the State and general public in what is a rapidly changing business environment.<\/p><p> Through the committee I also emphasise my advice to those making the switch to digital in the days and weeks ahead to use a trusted and approved installer.  The names of the installer organisations are available from Saorview if anybody is in doubt.  That is important, as we have had regular contact on a range of issues, technical and otherwise, with installer organisations.  We do not want people to be taken advantage of.<\/p><p> The aim of the digital switchover campaign is to ensure nobody is left behind in this move to digital broadcasting.  All the international experience suggests that a substantial proportion of television viewers leave the change to the last minute, which could be a concern.  I am encouraged by reports in recent weeks from around the country of a significantly higher level of retail sales of set-top boxes, as well as increased installer activity.<\/p><p> Since the launch of the digital switchover campaign in October last year, I have taken an active role in the programme.  A former Fianna F&aacute;il spokesman, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, asked if there is an alternative if 20,000 people are left without a television signal.  I told him I had one - for me to emigrate - so for that reason I have been closely involved in the process.  We do not want such a scenario, so we have operated a campaign of public information and advice and hand-holding by local organisations where possible.  I have attended many of the public events during the campaign and we have had a special digital switchover awareness week, as Deputies know, and we have attempted to respond to requests from Deputies for information in so far as we can.  I am very impressed by the efforts put in by local communities, in particular, across the country to ensure we have as smooth a transition as possible to the world of digital broadcasting for all.<\/p><p> We will do our best to answer questions.  Perhaps the Chairman can give a few minutes to my colleague, Ms Mary Curtis, who can provide some up to date statistics, as the process is monitored week by week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700011#K00300","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348741500,"counter":928,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Molloy, whom I neglected to introduce earlier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700012#L00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348741500,"counter":929,"content":"<p>The most recent figures we have are from Nielsen, taking in conversion rates from August.

They might think it would monitor their every move.  The vast majority of people have Sky boxes, etc., and most people will have switched over quite willingly because of the advertising campaigns.  There will be a percentage of people who will not get the Saorview signal after 24 October.  There will be another cohort who will have installed a Saorview box but because of their location will not be able to get a signal.<\/p> <p>They are looking at alternatives and some have been advised that it might not be possible.  The local communities have become involved.  They have bought into it and have put in huge work on getting people connected, but there is a percentage of people outstanding.  The Minister has clearly indicated there is no plan B.  I am not sure, bar some form of divine inspiration, that we can get to some sectors and to the people who have problems due to mountain ranges and so forth.  There needs to be further awareness raising, perhaps through An Post.  These people are predominantly elderly so perhaps there could be a way through social welfare to communicate with them.  A mighty effort is required.<\/p><p> What is being spent on the overall scheme in terms of advertising?  There was a huge advertising campaign dating back to this time last year.  The most effective piece of advertising I saw was the leaflet that was sent to each house.  It was a direct hit where elderly people are concerned because they read through their post.  Much of the time they do not buy into the advertising on television because they do not have a notion about it.  What has been spent on it?  As we approach 24 October, what contingency measures are there, if any, to target the remaining people who have not been connected?  These are the people who will hit the headlines because they will be branded as being isolated and so forth.  What does the Minister have in mind or what has he targeted?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700012#L00600","speaker":"987","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348742100,"counter":934,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his presentation and acknowledge the presence of the officials from RTE and the Department.<\/p><p>  To follow on from Deputy Moynihan's comments, one of my concerns is that while there is a temptation to ensure that everybody has a Saorview box, unfortunately there is a group in society that is already mobilising to use Saorview as a way to get inside the front door of elderly people's houses.  That is very sinister.  It has been reported in the media that some people are traversing the country and claiming to be at the house to connect it to Saorview.  They are picking on vulnerable people.  They will do this for everything, be it a gas connection or anything else.  A message must be conveyed that the Department and RTE are not sending people door to door and that people should be wary of somebody calling to the door under the auspices of Saorview to try to get into the house.<\/p><p>  Has the connection been subjected to trials?  Have we tried the signal and satellite to ensure that after 24 October in the far-flung corners of the country the satellite will be turned on once the analogue is switched off?  If there was such a trial, how did it go?<\/p><p>  I believe the most effective piece of advertising was the \"Let's Get Connected\" advertisement.  The Minister referred to the personalities and the warm faces.  Until then, the cartoon cat and dog lost many people.  However, when people saw Derek Mooney telling them their televisions would be switched off on 24 October it was very effective.  My concern is about isolated rural areas outside the main urban centres.  When the analogue signal is switched off and people do not have access to it will there be a contingency plan in place for the following fortnight, three weeks or month to try to identify the people affected and help them?  Bear in mind that in many of these houses, the arrival of the second RTE channel was a big thing.  The people in these houses might not have a great connection with their neighbours and they might not be the best communicators, but they expect to be able to sit down and watch the news to find out what happened in the D&aacute;il or to watch \"Coronation Street\" and so forth.  What contingency plan is there to reach out to those last few people?  It will be a small number and they will be widely dispersed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700013#M00200","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1348742100,"counter":935,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the officials from the Department and RTE for attending this meeting.

Certainly, the queries I have received in the last few weeks did not match the number of queries about All-Ireland tickets in Mayo.<\/p><p>  The presentation referred to virtually full coverage.  The worry for us in these last few weeks is the 'virtual' part.

Ms Mary Curtis provided data for the end of August and the uptake at that stage was at approximately 60%.  Congratulations are due for that.  The nature of the Irish people is that they tend to leave things to the last minute so a 60% uptake rate at that stage is very positive.  Well done.  It is running slightly behind the household charge payment rate so perhaps the Minister could get some tips from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.<\/p><p>  In the context of other countries that have gone through this process already, is it possible to project what figures or percentage should be expected for the month of September, which is not included in the data, and up to 25 October?  Invariably, there will be people who do not make the necessary adjustments.  As regards communicating to those people the length of time they will be without a service, is there any estimate, depending on the numbers, of how long it will take to reach 100% uptake?  After the event will people be waiting a week or two weeks?  Is it possible at this stage to project what type of delay one would expect?

There is a particular problem or difficulty in County Kerry.  There are pockets of the county, particularly in the south, south east and west, where the existing transmitters were put in place with the co-operation of RTE to provide coverage to black-spot areas where historically there was huge difficulty in getting a signal.  The introduction of Saorview will not address the problems with coverage in these areas.  It appears that the transmitters will be decommissioned on 24 October but thousands of people are living in isolated remote areas, valleys and so forth.<\/p> <p>Given the mountainous terrain, these people will be left with blank screens.  Many of them are elderly and live alone.  They already have problems with isolation and with few people living in the neighbourhood.  It will pose terrible difficulties for many communities.  <\/p><p> Saorview appears to be the solution and Saorsat the alternative.  In many respects, it is not workable because of the sheer size and physical shape of the masts.  They will be prone to obstruction and being blown down during windy conditions, which are frequent in the south west as winds come in from the Atlantic and there is very little protection.  It will also be a cost for many of these people who are living on low incomes and who may not have the budgets to meet the cost, which is &euro;300 for installation of Saorsat.  <\/p><p> There is a very simple solution, which is to retrofit and upgrade these particular transmitters and this work has been undertaken in other areas.  Recently, we were informed that four have been upgraded in County Cork in areas similar to those in County Kerry.

I welcome the Minister, Mr. Eamonn Molloy, Ms Mary Curtis and Mr. Mick Keogh, the genius from RTE, whom, we need at this time.  Given the way things are looking, I am afraid the Minister might have to emigrate, even though the Government cannot afford to lose any more members, because we have a serious problem.  Despite this mighty publicity campaign and public awareness roll-out with people going around giving talks and explaining what will happen on 24 October, the one thing nobody thought prudent was to have an engineer with those people.  It is one thing to talk about a problem but it is another trying to come up with engineering solutions to it.<\/p><p>  Many people do not get what is happening and are missing the point.  I raised this issue twice with the Taoiseach and, unfortunately, on both occasions, the man failed to grasp the point.  The point is that there are people who have a service today but who will not be able to get coverage after 24 October because engineering solutions are not available to them.  The Taoiseach thought I was speaking about places which already had a problem with the service but I was not.  These places do not have a problem now but they will have one after 24 October.<\/p><p>  Do people realise there are parts of our country where one cannot get Sky?  Everybody thinks that if one has the money and cannot get any other solution, one can always pay for Sky but there are places which do not have coverage by Sky.  What solutions will be available for those people?<\/p><p>  I am very friendly with a number of people who work in the business of selling televisions, putting up the aerials and that type of work and it is a real problem for them in certain locations.  As my colleague, Deputy Fleming, outlined, people dismiss it and say only 2% of the country is in trouble.  I believe the majority of the 2% are in County Kerry.<\/p><p>  With all due respect to my colleague from Cork, Deputy Harrington, what did we do wrong in Kerry given that the investment was made in Cork?  Flip all was given to County Kerry.  One mast was put up in Dingle, for which I am grateful.<\/p><p>  I highlighted the fact that I wanted a solution.  Does the Minister realise the enormity of what will happen?  There are places in east Kerry and in Bonane where people pay their taxes but which will have no coverage after 24 October.  In Lauragh, fine hardworking people will have no coverage after 24 October.  The local television men in that area are Bertie McSweeney and his son but the solutions they have come up with will not work in that a windy night will upset the dish and people will have no coverage the next day.  What does the Minister propose for these people?  It is a really serious situation.<\/p><p>  A couple of years ago people might not have been as worried about television because they did not have time to watch the damn thing but now with the lack of work and everything else, in many homes, the only thing people have to do at night is to look at television to see what is happening and who is resigning from the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700014#N00200","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1348742700,"counter":940,"content":"<p>I need the Deputy to conclude because he is straying a little into-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700014#N00300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1348742700,"counter":941,"content":"<p>I would really be interested to hear from the people with the Minister.

Deputy Healy-Rae touched on this issue and I want to focus on the 2% who cannot get coverage on the Saorview system.  That 2% is not dispersed around the country.  One hundred percent of a community may not get Saorview coverage and I would like to focus on that.  The obvious answer is Saorsat.  It should, and probably would, cover a lot of it but I have a concern which has come from many of the recognised and registered installers.  The signal strength Saorsat offers is strongest where the Saorview is strongest and is weakest where one cannot get Saorview.  As Deputy Fleming said, that is directly affected by weather conditions, location and topography.<\/p> <p>The lily is being gilded where it is unnecessary while not enough strength is being provided where it is needed most.  I have a real concern about some people being left behind, apart from what other members said about the set top box, the additional costs and connectivity issues.  People who want to subscribe to Saorsat cannot get the signal to allow them view a proper picture.  Has there been feedback from registered and recognised installers who have looked at signal strength in peripheral areas of this country and who have said there is a problem in adverse weather conditions?

This has become so acute that people in the Ballymacarbry and Nire valley area will lose the signal.  Many of them are elderly and are operating off aerials.  In the last week, Councillor O'Ryan sent a petition to the Minister to ask that the analogue signal not be turned off in that area on those boosters until there is a solution to this.  From what I heard earlier about upgrading in Cork, there was a similar problem in Kilmacthomas and that has been addressed by the provision of new transmitters.  The problem remains, however, and I know there are parts of Donegal that will suffer.  I wanted to bring this element to the attention of the committee and Minister.  I appreciate much of it will be in the south west; my wife comes from Castletownbere and I know it well.

People have contacted me in recent weeks from all over Kerry because they are very concerned about the switchover.  They have had the tests done and have been told Saorsat will not work for them.  A guesthouse owner told me he is afraid he will not have television for the guests who stay with him.  His only option will be to go with Sky or another provider and that is not viable for him.  There are others who simply want a television in their own homes but cannot get it and they are worried about 24 October.  Around Kenmare, Bonane, Baile na nGall, Baile an Fheirt&eacute;araigh, D&uacute;n Chaoin, Feothanach, Ceann Tr&aacute; and even Kilgarvan there are many concerns about the switchover.  Three weeks remain before the switchover and there is time to get these issues sorted out.

Deputy Jim Daly raised the matter as a Topical Issue in June in the Chamber and he was concerned about large areas of Cork South-West.

I can tell Deputy Moynihan and Deputy Brian Walsh that we will have new statistics in coming days for the end of September and will be able to measure how far things have progressed, and again on 10 October.  We will have a close handle on the speed of uptake.  That is not to deny that we will have latecomers or that some people will be left behind.  That is human nature and we are conscious of that.  That is why we are putting so much into alerting people to understand what is involved.  We are not going to go out of business on 24 October; we must follow up on the situation immediately after the switchover.<\/p><p>  Deputy Moynihan's suggestion about An Post is a good one that we should consider.  In reply to Deputy O'Donovan, Saorview has been conscious from the beginning that its brand will be used as a means for people interested in subterfuge to gain admission to the homes of vulnerable people in particular.  Great pains have been taken to ensure that does not happen in so far as it is within our control.  Ms Curtis might want to give some examples of that.<\/p><p>  On the net point outlined by the Chairman of the difficulties involved for the 2%, I say to Deputy Healy-Rae that this is not the first time people sitting around this table have become aware of this; the technical challenges have been there since the start.  RTE is to be commended on the substantial investment it has put into the roll-out of the digital network and it has responded to claims from particular Deputies who have highlighted where for topographical and other reasons there are particular difficulties.  We have taken that seriously.  The existing signal never reached 100% of the country.<\/p> <p>I take the point being made by the Deputies for south Kerry and west Cork that the figure of 2% is not dispersed equally across the country.  It could well be the case that 100% of the members of a small local community have no reception.  I can assure Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, knowing his county very well, that the last thing I want to do is to deprive his constituents of the opportunity to see either replays of himself or his work on their behalf in the D&aacute;il.  The objective is the opposite.  People should have access to the station's programmes.  We have put a great deal of work into that issue; in particular, RTE and Saorview have put a lot of work into it. <\/p><p> Deputy Michael Healy-Rae also makes the point that we did not send an engineer around the country, which is not entirely correct.  In many cases, engineers concerned with this problem have been around the country.  It is acknowledged in the case of County Cork that visible solutions have been suggested to protect against this problem.  I heard what Senator Paschal Mooney had to say about the Nire valley, about which he had spoken to me privately.  It would be best to ask Mr. Keogh to comment on the technical difficulties that have been encountered in parts of the country and how we propose to respond to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700015#O00500","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348743900,"counter":953,"content":"<p>I will respond to the questions raised; however, I did not take note of the names of the individuals who raised them.<\/p><p>  The word \"virtual\" has been a cause of concern.

I cannot tie down the exact figure without visiting every house.  As the Saorsat satellite is at a higher orbit than that of Sky, it will get a signal to places the Sky satellite signal cannot reach.<\/p><p>  When we set out to consider this new network, the first objective was to meet the obligation under the legislation to replicate analogue coverage.  Analogue services reach about 98% of the population.  We sought to replicate this through Saorview.  It is a bugbear that a percentage of people have never been able to receive free-to-air television services.  We also put in an effort to see if we could develop a solution to that problem.  The solution we came up with was Saorsat, a new satellite launched just about two years ago.  Between the two services, virtually every home in the country has access at the chimney or rooftop to the Irish public service channels, free to air.<\/p><p>  An issue arises in counties Kerry, Donegal and Wicklow, which have a similar topography.  The Saorsat solution will be more beneficial to them than it will be in County Kildare, which is more or less flat.  It can reach places that line-of-sight analogue or terrestrial technology cannot.  <\/p><p>  We must also consider the spectrum available.  When the original sites were built back in the early 1960s, we were able to do whatever we wanted to do with the available spectrum.  There was no one else using it.  Now we have wireless phones in the house and mobile broadband services, as well as mobile phones.  As a result, the spectrum available for broadcasting has shrunk.  We are not using the VHF spectrum, which was good in mountainous areas.  In addition, approximately 20% of the UHF spectrum is being given over to meet the digital dividend in order that it can used for the mobile phone services.  We are very much constrained in what we can do.  The digital network must be different from the original analogue network.  Given this, we believe we have free-to-air television reception in virtually house in the country.  <\/p><p>  There is an international satellite with spot beams covering the whole of Europe.  We were lucky enough that one of the beams was pointing at Ireland.  It was not the case that somebody launched a satellite for Ireland.  None of our television services can be freely available in the United Kingdom.  If we turn up the power too high, people living in Liverpool and Manchester will receive Irish services.  However, Irish broadcasters do not have the right to transmit to them.  They must be turned off or they must be encrypted.  We have to keep within a power window which means that Irish people can receive the services but population centres in the UK cannot.  We are fortunate enough that every home in the country can receive them with a dish one metre in size.  The beam happens to be pointed at somewhere in north Tipperary.  It is operated by Eutalsat, one of the biggest satellite companies in the world, and we are buying capacity from it.  It works quite well with us to try to find a solution for Ireland.  <\/p><p>  The signal strength in County Kerry is similar to that in County Donegal because they are located on the outer edges of the beam.  The satellite has been operational for virtually 18 months.  It was formally announced that it was operational by the Minister in March this year.  It running for the best part of 18 months.  We have been through a number of humps and hollows.  Members will be happy to learn that TV3 is available on Saorview in Castletownbere and we have measured the signal and it works.  <\/p><p>  In the extremities one needs a 1 m dish; however, in the middle of the beam a 60 cm dish is sufficient.  Installing a 1 m dish seems to be an issue for some installers, but we have provided training and will provide more.  As there seems to be a particular issue for some installers in south Kerry, we are providing extra training for them next week.  There were similar issues when Sky services first became available when an 80 cm solid dish was required.  There were similar statements then to what we are hearing now 20 years later.  It is a slightly different technology and needs to be a little more accurate in pointing it.  One cannot use a &euro;10 B&amp;Q beeper; one needs to have a 1 m dish in order that it can be pointed more accurately.  We also have the issue that it moves when the wind blows.  Anyone who cannot have a 1 m dish that will not move in the wind should consider changing.  We have heard accusations that the 1 m dish will blow away the gable end of a house.  In the case of a 1 m dish in high winds in County Kerry, it is the equivalent of me pushing against the wall or four or five guys learning up against it.  If anybody is living in a house which has a wall that might be pulled down by a satellite dish, they need to move out for health and safety reasons.<\/p><p>  We have made a significant effort to educate public representatives.  We know that there are vulnerable people, as well as old people.  We are also aware that there are dodgy dealers and, unfortunately, installers are not regulated.  We have made a great effort to ensure that when public representatives speak, they give accurate information.  As I said, there will be houses sheltered under the north face of a mountain which we will have to deal with individually.  We cannot say a satellite dish will pull down the gable end of a house.  We cannot say it will cost &euro;450 more in County Kerry than it will in County Cork.  It will cost &euro;100 more to install a Saorsat solution than Saorview.  We have done our best to get the price down as far as we can, but it is a different technology.  There are people looking at these small transposer sites.  They were receiving RTE 1, RTE 2 and TG4.  If they move to Saorsat, for an extra &euro;35, they will have 200 channels, as they will be able to pick up all of the European free-to-air satellite channels.<\/p> <p>There is a small cost overrun for the person who only wants RTE 1 and RTE 2.  In County Kerry, for example, TV3 would have been available as an analogue service to approximately 44% of the population.  It will now be available through Saorview to 95% of the population of the county.  If TV3 decides to go onto Saorsat - as a commercial operator, it can make that decision for itself - the rest of the population of the county will be covered.  There has been a huge improvement in the area covered by TV3 and, to a lesser extent, TG4, in counties such as Kerry and Donegal.  The rate of RTE 1 coverage in County Kerry was 90% under the analogue service, but that figure will increase to 95% under the Saorview service.<\/p><p> There has been a big improvement, although some homes are still inconvenienced.  I am aware of the problems in the Nire valley, particularly in four or five houses nestled in the Forest View area where the bottom of the Nire road approaches the main junction.  When I drove up the road, I noted that three of the houses in question have Sky satellite dishes.  If they can get Sky, they can get Saorsat more easily.  There is a solution there for them.  We have to do a bit of work in these individual areas to educate the local installers.  We seem to have done a good job in County Donegal, which would have roughly the same types of coverage figures as County Kerry.  We seem to have failed to educate some of the installers in County Kerry about what Saorsat is and how it works.  There are 20 or 30 houses in places like Headford, Bunane and Lauragh that can get RTE 1 and RTE 2 as an analogue service and will now have to go to Saorsat.  We need to work with the local installers to facilitate that.  We have some extra training lined up for them next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700016#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keogh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1348744500,"counter":957,"content":"<p>Senator Mooney's colleague seems to be under the impression that we can leave the analogue signal on after 24 October.

The small transposer gets the signal from Mount Leinster and repeats it.  Therefore, the analogue signal for the whole country has to stay on, or the signal for the whole country has to go off.  We cannot decide to leave the signal at an individual small site on for an extra few weeks.  Technically, that is not possible.<\/p><p>  I have said that there is no reason for a blank screen.  I think I have covered the issue of costs.  We have engineered a technical solution while avoiding getting involved in any conversations about things like whether County Cork should get more sites than County Kerry.  We did all the main sites - all the big transposer sites - before doing a technical review to see how they were performing against what we had planned.  Parts of County Cork were not performing, so an extra three or four sites were put in the county.  An extra site was put in each of counties Donegal, Kerry, Louth and Tipperary because the system as planned was not working as we expected.  Wireless signals do not recognise geographical or political borders.  We are trying to deal with areas where there are coverage issues, rather than areas where there are political or county borders.  We have had issues.  County Waterford has been mentioned.  Historically, we had an issue in a place called Kilmacomma.  The only way we could possibly get a service into the area was by bringing it through Clonmel.  Kilmacomma is in County Waterford, whereas Clonmel is in County Tipperary.  It was a little difficult to get planning permission in County Tipperary for something that was going to help people in County Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700017#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Keogh"},{"type":"speech","time":1348744500,"counter":959,"content":"<p>It should have been a job for Deputy Mattie McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700017#Q00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1348744500,"counter":960,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy saying he had gone off air?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2012092700017#Q00500","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1348744500,"counter":961,"content":"<p>There are difficulties in certain areas.
