However I have on-going contact with Minister Noonan to ensure that tax policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture.\u00a0 In this regard I am pleased that the Minister and I could facilitate the Agri-taxation Review, which was published as part Budget 2015. It gave us a unique opportunity to examine a critical element of Government support to the agriculture sector in the context of the strategy of expansion and increasing exports under Food Harvest 2020.<br\/><br\/>The Review provides a strong evidence base for continued assistance to the primary sector through taxation measures and it is a clear strategy with specific policy objectives for the future. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture is evidenced by the immediate implementation of the majority of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations in Budget 2015, including 12 new measures, which form part of a strategic policy response to the opportunities and challenges ahead.<br\/><br\/>One of the taxation policy objectives identified by the Review is to assist succession. The age profile of Irish farmers is increasing and it is recognised that there are many social and economic reasons why succession management is a challenge for farmers. Assisting succession and the transfer of farms has been a central part of the Government&rsquo;s agri-taxation policy and Budget 2015 included a number of measures to maintain and strengthen that support, specifically:<br\/><br\/>- The retention and targeting of Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax to active farmers or to those who lease out land long-term.<br\/><br\/>- The retention and enhancement of Retirement Relief from Capital Gains Tax, including two new measures:<blockquote>- The extension of the eligible letting period of a qualifying asset to 25 years.<br \/><br \/>- For transfers other than to a child under Retirement Relief, as a once-off measure until the end of 2016, the inclusion of conacre lettings as eligible.  I believe that this measure is significant.  It will allow farmers who have been engaged in conacre to avail of Retirement Relief if they transfer or move to long-term leasing before the end of 2016, thereby giving exit options to a large cohort of farmers.<\/blockquote>- The retention of the current stamp duty exemptions on transfers of land, including the extension of Stamp Duty Consanguinity Relief, i.e. relief to related persons, on non-residential transfers to the end of 2017.<br\/><br\/>I am confident that the package of measures introduced in Budget 2015, the most substantial package of this kind ever introduced in a single budget, will lead to a more efficient and productive sector. This is an exciting time for Irish agriculture, especially for young farmers, and I expect the impact of these measures to be felt for a generation to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200069#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Missions","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200069#WRB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[43012\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200069#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide an update on foot of his recent trade mission to China on the potential for seafood exports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>On 5 November, following a meeting with Chinese Vice Minister Niu Dun who has responsibility for Fisheries, I was privilaged to open the largest ever Irish pavilion at the China Fisheries Show in Qingdao, the second largest trade show globally for the international seafood sector. An estimated 25,000 visitors from 100 nations were forecast to attend the show, with no other exhibition of its type in Asia coming close to matching its size or success.  When the inaugural China Seafood and Fisheries Expo was held in 1996, China's total international seafood trade was worth under &euro;3 billion. In 2013, China's seafood trade had surpassed &euro;20 billion in value, cementing China's position as the world's leading seafood trading country. Growing incomes and increased urbanisation in the world&rsquo;s second biggest economy have helped fuel a massive growth in demand for imported seafood. The United Nations FAO predicts that China will need an extra 16 million metric tons of seafood by 2020 to meet this growing demand from a swelling middle class, which is expected to reach 500 million by 2020.   <\/p><p>Irish seafood exports to China &amp;amp; Hong Kong grew by an impressive 46% in 2013 to reach &euro;17 million. China continues to be a growing market for Irish seafood and is currently our tenth largest export market, demonstrating value growth of over 300% between 2011 to 2013. This strong trend in Irish exports to the region is continuing in 2014 with sales for the first 6 months of 2014 up 56% compared to the same period in 2013.   <\/p><p>  Whilst traditionally the Chinese market has been important for the Irish seafood industry predominantly for the sale of pelagic species, in the last 3 years significant effort has been invested by Irish processors and Bord Bia to identify and develop opportunities for premium shellfish in this growing market for seafood, notably for shellfish such as live and processed brown crab, langoustines, scallops and razor fish. Considerable success has been secured by a number of the leading Irish shellfish processors in penetrating this market, as demonstrated by the strong growth in the value of exports to the region. Exports of shellfish to China, for example, increased in value by 201% between 2012 and 2013 and by 117% to Hong Kong during the same period.<\/p><p>  As the demand for premium seafood in China continues to grow and Chinese consumption of aquatic products continues to outpace growth in production of such products, Ireland is well placed to capitalise on the growing opportunity for Irish seafood in this market. Through the offices of Bord Bia, Ireland has ambitious plans to further grow the share of Irish seafood into China and has a number of programmes in place to assist Irish seafood processors in identifying, profiling and targeting new customers that are willing to pay a premium for quality seafood from Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200069#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commonage Framework Plans","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200069#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[43014\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200069#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will confirm the risk of financial corrections being imposed by the European Commission on undergrazing on commonages.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>Each year farmers in Ireland benefit from funding of over &euro;1.5 billion under Schemes such as the Single Farm Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Agri-Environment Schemes, etc. This comprises the entire net income of many thousands of Irish farmers.The Deputy will be aware that following consultation with the EU Commission, as part of the normal Accounting process, my Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database. This on-going review is of major significance as the Commission is seeking to disallow &euro;181m of funding to Ireland relating to payments over the past 5 years this is currently the subject of an Irish appeal to the EU Conciliation Body. <br\/><br\/>The European Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States manage and use the EU funding granted to them in accordance with the very restrictive provisions governing the Direct Aid Schemes and general financial provisions. All of the lands declared by farmers must be eligible if these lands benefit from payment under one of more or these Schemes. Under the Terms and Conditions of the Direct Aid Schemes, which includes the Single Payment scheme, farmers are obliged to declare only eligible land when making their applications, and to exclude ineligible features such as roads, buildings, farmyards, dense scrub, etc. Furthermore, farmers are reminded that they should not declare for payment purposes land, which they are no longer farming. It is not sufficient to simply exclude the ineligible features from the declarations submitted as lands, which are no longer being farmed and\/or is abandoned should also be excluded.<br\/><br\/>To ensure the eligibility of lands declared, farmers must maintain lands through normal farming practices such as cropping, cutting hay\/silage or grazing by animals with an appropriate stocking rate to control invasive species. In the case of Commonage lands farmers must therefore ensure that lands are kept adequately grazed in order to ensure that the commonage retains the area eligible for payment. <br\/><br\/>Commonage lands form a significant area of the lands declared annually by some 14,936 farmers in Ireland for the purposes of claiming under the Direct Aid Schemes, with <b>approximately 7%<\/b>of the lands declared nationally being commonage lands. However, due to reasons such as previous destocking requirements and the age profile of farmers on commonage lands, there is a growing risk of land abandonment on commonages as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. It is therefore the case that the increasing ineligibility of these lands under the Single Payment Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes poses a significant risk to the State in view of the risk of financial corrections being imposed by the European Commission. <br\/><br\/>However, from 2015 onwards, a minimum grazing requirement, equivalent to at least one ewe per 1.5 hectares, will be required of all those applicants declaring marginal lands including commonage under the Basic Payment Scheme and the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme. A lower grazing level will be fixed for marginal lands where it is necessary on environmental grounds. These requirements must be met by each individual claimant by end December 2015 at the latest. The minimum grazing requirement must be met in order to qualify for the Basic Payment Scheme and the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme under the new CAP. <br\/><br\/>In 2015, I would strongly urge all farmers to ensure that all of the land that they declare is eligible and is farmed by them. The entitlements established under the Basic Payment Scheme will be based on the eligible hectares declared in 2015. In order to protect their payments in the subsequent years, farmers should exclude all ineligible areas from their declarations. In that case, the newly established entitlements will be supported by land which is eligible for paymentin order to draw down their full payment entitlement in 2015 and subsequent years.This would also reduce the risk of further financial corrections in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200069#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aquaculture Licences","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200069#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[42802\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200069#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if recommendation has been made to him in relation to the licence application lodged by Bord Iascaigh Mhara for a salmon farm in Galway Bay; when he expects to make a decision on this application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>An application by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) for an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of finfish near Inis Oirr in Galway Bay was received by my Department in 2012.\u00a0 The application and its accompanying Environmental Impact Statement are being considered under the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act and the 1933 Foreshore Act.

The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP as it is called, has the potential to increase growth and boost jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. As a small open trading economy, Ireland is well positioned to take full advantage of trade liberalisation.  In the agri-food sector we have strong offensive interests, both in terms of market access and in eliminating some of the irritants that hinder trade. We already export over &euro;500 million in agri-food to the US &ndash; dominated by beverages and casein. Beverages are already traded between EU and US at zero rates of duty so TTIP will not, in itself, grow this trade. However, we are seeking substantial market access for our dairy products and in the prepared foods area. We also want to see action to action to address the question of Grade A equivalence for dairy and the licensing system that applies to dairy imports into the US.   <\/p><p>  Of course, we have defensive interests as well. One of these is our beef sector. While we see some opportunities for establishing a niche market in the US for Irish beef, we have concerns regarding the prospect of increased beef imports into the EU. Indeed, the most recent report of the European Parliament on the trade implications of an EU US agreement bears out our concerns in relation to the suckler cow herd in Europe. The report finds that this will be adversely affected by the trade deal. I have raised these concerns on a number of occasions with the EU Commission. I have proposed that Ireland&rsquo;s sensitivities are reflected in the size and composition of any quota offered to the US. I have argued that the size of the quota should not exceed European market absorption capacity, which is substantially reduced according to the latest forecasts. I have also proposed that the quota should be designed &ndash; via end use conditions &ndash; to ensure that imports are not all concentrated on high value cuts and that an in-quota tariff rate should continue to apply to imports within the quota.   <\/p><p>  Finally, I would like to correct some of the reports circulating that TTIP will result in the import of hormone treated meat into the EU. Just to clarify the position, a decision was taken many years ago to ban the use of hormones in animals in the EU destined for the human food chain. The ban forms part of the EU positive but precautionary principle to limit the use of medical treatments to disease prevention and cure. The US takes a different approach that allows the use of hormones in the absence of scientific evidence that they may cause harm. While the US has said that it will be seeking access for its hormone treated meat to the EU as part of the TTIP negotiations, it is impossible in the current climate to see a reversal of the EU prohibition decision.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200070#WRC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Scheme Eligibility","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200070#WRC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[43004\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200070#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will revise the requirement for 50% of farmers on a commonage to agree a grazing plan in order to participate in GLAS; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>The preservation and management of our commonages is accorded a very high priority within GLAS.  This is as it should be given the importance of these habitats and of the work carried out by farmers in maintaining and farming these hills. However, p ayments under GLAS can only be made in respect of actions going beyond the baseline requirements under the Basic Payment Scheme under Pillar 1 of the CAP. In simple terms this means that a farmer cannot be paid twice for the same commitment under both schemes. Since the introduction of agri-environment schemes in the 1990s the Pillar 1 baseline has been progressively raised for each programming period and this challenges us all in developing schemes that will gain approval at EU level. Farmers are required under the Basic Pay ment Scheme to ensure land meets eligibility requirements and commonage land is no exception to this requirement. So, in order to secure funding for hill-farmers under GLAS, I have to design a scheme which manifestly goes beyond baseline. I also have to ensure that the commitments outlined are measurable and controllable, as this is critical to securing approval.    The key characteristic of commonage land is that it is farmed in common and the actions undertaken under GLAS will have to reflect that. We cannot have multiple and varying plans submitted for the commonage &ndash; we need a single plan, drawn up by a single advisor, that sets out clearly what the objectives are over a five-year period and what those participating in this plan will do, individually and together, to achieve those objectives. <\/p><p>  On this point, we clearly need to have sufficient people working together to achieve the best results for these commonages, in the interests of both the farming community and of the environment. I have already revised the minimum participation rate   down from 80% to 50%, having listened to the concerns of farmers in this regard. I believe that 50% participation is the minimum required to make this work but I also believe that it represents an achievable target.     <\/p><p>  I think it is particularly important to point out that , again in response to farmer concerns, the 50% requirement will be based on active farmers only, i.e. those actually grazing the commonage. To give an example, if there are 20 shareholders on a commonage, and 15 are claiming shares under the Single Payment Scheme, but only 10 of those are actively grazing the land at present, the 50% requirement to trigger priority access to GLAS is just 5 farmers. I do not believe that a minimum participation requirement based on this model is insurmountable but where real difficulties are being encountered I have already said that the farmers concerned can approach the Commonage Implementation Committee to make their case. <\/p><p>  Last month my Department held a series of information evenings for hill-farmers, where the new proposals have been explained in detail and where the farmers themselves have had the opportunity to express their concerns in person. In most cases, the farmers at these meetings have engaged very constructively and positively in the discussion and it has been a very useful process.\u00a0 Once within the scheme, it is the farmers themselves who, in consultation with the commonage advisor, design their own plan, set the grazing levels and distribute any additional grazing requirement.\u00a0\u00a0This puts the development of the plan in the hands of the farmers themselves and in recognition of the additional effort involved in both designing and implementing this plan, I have increased the rate of payment for commonage land from &euro;75 per hectare under the last programme to &euro;120 per hectare under GLAS. <\/p><p>  If people look carefully at what is actually proposed, they will see that this is a very flexible scheme which actually gives the shareholders a real say in how the hills are managed, in their own best interests and in the interests of the environment. The priority now is to progress the launch of the scheme so that the benefits of these new arrangements, including the increased payments, can transfer to farmers as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200070#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishery Harbour Centres","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200070#WRC00525"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[42800\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200070#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the status of the proposal to introduce paid parking at Howth Harbour, County Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>The House will be aware that I have been considering introducing a charge for parking facilities within Howth Fishery Harbour Centre for some time as part of an overall traffic management plan for the safe operation of the harbour,<br\/><br\/>-  to assist in operating Howth Fishery Harbour Centre on a financially-sound basis, by providing a new source of revenue for further investment in Fishery Harbour Centre facilities, and<br\/><br\/>-  in order to maximise the return on this significant State asset.<br\/><br\/>There is a broad range of factors to consider in coming to a decision; first and foremost Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is a working fishery harbour, one of 6 Fishery Harbour Centres in the State.

The programme now offers increased grant aid of up to 75% for fishermen who present live lobsters for v-notching and return them live to sea.  Since the announcement in May BIM has seen an upsurge in participation in the Programme and expect that year-end figures for 2014 will be double those of 2013.

Cattle p rices are determined by supply - demand dynamics which are in turn influenced by a range of different factors such as consumer preferences, distance to market, consumer confidence, retail promotions, competition with other meats and the overall macroeconomic situation .

My role as Minister for Agriculture is to create a policy support environment that will allow the beef sector to flourish in line with normal market principles.<\/p><p>  In the recent budget, I announced a total package of approximately &euro;74 million for the beef sector in 2015, including a provision of &euro;52 million for a proposed Beef Data and Genomics Programme which will place Ireland at the leading edge globally in the use of genomics in beef production. The current Genomics Scheme is being further developed and enhanced as part of a 6-year RDP measure which, once approved by the European Commission, will deliver a payment per animal of &euro;100 for the first ten animals, with the remaining animals being eligible for an &euro;80 payment per animal in participating herds. In 2014, I have brought forward a number of initiatives to help the sector, including the creation of the Beef Genomics Scheme with a budget of &euro;23 million in 2014. I have also ensured that the budgets of the Beef Data Programme and the Beef Technology Adoption Programme are retained at &euro;10 million and &euro;5 million which, when added to residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme, amounts to an investment of &euro;40m in 2014.<\/p><p>  I have also been proactive in securing new market opportunities for Irish beef with Japan, Lebanon and Philippines opened in the last 12 months and significant progress in the US and Canada where I expect Irish beef to be landing on supermarket shelves sometime soon.

The importance of the Chinese market to Ireland is demonstrated in our agri-food and related exports to China and Hong Kong which have expanded from &euro;254m in 2011 to &euro;442m in 2013, a 74% increase, while exports to the end of August 2014 amounted to &euro;405m from &euro;300m in the same period last year, a 35% increase. I would expect to see these exports reaching &euro;500m this year. The potential for our exports to continue to grow is linked to China&rsquo;s ongoing food security and food safety concerns and an insatiable demand for infant formula, from which Ireland can benefit strategically because of our potential to increase production particularly in the dairy sector from 2015, and because Ireland is, increasingly in the eyes of the Chinese, being regarded as a country which has the highest food safety standards, having had all its dairy plants, which applied to export to China, approved this year.<br\/><br\/><i>Following political meetings with my\u00a0Chinese counterparts<\/i><i>, including\u00a0the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Han Changfu)\u00a0and the Minister responsible for market access (Mr. Zhi Shuping), we have had a significant breakthrough on beef, with a firm commitment from the Chinese Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQSIQ) to carry out a formal inspection visit in Ireland in early December. My Department has already begun an intensive engagement with the Chinese authorities and with Irish industry on the planning for this inspection visit.

An Irish company (Dovea) signed a contract of intent to export bovine semen.<\/i><br\/><br\/>In the dairy sector, the week saw a number of events marking strategic partnerships between Irish and Chinese dairy companies which are now resulting in dairy produce including infant formula, manufactured in Ireland and identified as originating in Ireland on sale on Chinese supermarket shelves, <i>and becoming the premier product of choice for Chinese consumers. We are fortunate to have Irish companies such as IDB, Glanbia, and Kerry Foods, and multinationals such as Abbot, Wyeth, and Nutricia, which have manufacturing facilities in Ireland, representing Ireland in this important market.

Just over 400 farmers received quota allocations in that period.  An analysis of successful applicants for the period 2009 to 2011, involving 230 applicants, indicated 58% were involved in beef production of some description at the time of application and that a further 25% were involved in mixed farming which would include some beef as well.  There is nothing to suggest that this trend was not followed in the remaining two years of the Scheme.  It is of course a common feature in Irish agriculture for dairy farmers to have a beef enterprise as part of their farm as quota constraints limited the size of their dairy output.  The abolition of quotas may see these farmers divest themselves of the beef cattle in order to use their available land for dairy production and maximise their output.  <\/p><p>  With the advent of a milk quota free environment from 2015, there will be more opportunities for farmers in other sectors, including the beef sector, to consider whether dairy production is a viable alternative for their enterprises.  I expect that some farmers in the beef sector will make that switch though in the context of the numbers in each sector, I believe that the number converting will be relatively modest.  In this context, constraints on land and the capital investment required to move to the dairy sector will remain as barriers   <\/p><p>  I am confident that the beef sector will continue to strengthen its position as one of the biggest net exporters in the world.  Indeed, the expansion in the dairy sector will also provide new opportunities for the beef sector, both at producer and processor level, in terms of adding value to the increased progeny of these dairy cows or rearing replacements on a contract or partnership basis. <\/p><p>  I have made it clear on a number of occasions the priority I attach to the suckler sector and this is the reason I have &euro;74m in 2015, for schemes specifically directed to suckler farmers.  This year alone I allocated &euro;33m in funding towards beef data genomics scheme, which are among the first of their kind in the world for the beef sector.  I am also proposing a new six-year scheme starting in 2015 under the Rural Development Plan which will build on and further develop this genomics concept.  This scheme, which is currently under discussion with the European Commission, will have a budget of approximately &euro;300m over the life of the programme and will revolutionise the breeding strategies employed by suckler farmers and deliver a genetic gain which help to improve environmental sustainability and drive farm profitability. This funding allocation is a vote of confidence by this Government in the sector and its role at the heart of the Irish agri-food development story.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200076#WRJ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200077#WRK00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200077#WRK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[43345\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200077#WRK00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding a review of the decision to refuse an application for domiciliary care allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 6 November 2014, who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.  <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200077#WRK00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Measures","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200077#WRK00350"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[43355\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200077#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide a distributional analysis for the measures contained in budget 2015; if she is unable or unwilling to provide same and if she will provide her reasoning on this; her views that all budgetary measures should be equality proofed; and when will this be implemented; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1188","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>Social impact assessment is an evidence-based methodology which uses a tax\/welfare simulation model developed by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) to estimate the likely distributive effects of budgetary measures on income and social inequalities.

The agreement is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters, utilising best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas in the future.   <\/p><p>  As well as providing the framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores, the new CFP will result in the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.  The package agreed will support the rebuilding of fish stocks in European waters and will allow for setting TACs and quotas to reflect catches when a landing obligation is introduced on the basis that for the first and subsequent years, discarding of that stock will no longer be allowed.  In the longer term as fish stocks reach and are maintained at healthy levels, it will support increased fishing opportunities for our fishermen.   <\/p><p>  The policy provides for the development of measures appropriate for each region by the member States working with the stakeholders through the new Advisory Councils to devise and implement measures that work for the types of fisheries in the region and involving fishermen in the decision making process. <\/p><p>  The reform also contains a commitment to continue and further strengthen conservation measures in the biologically sensitive areas, including that off the South and West coast of Ireland (new Irish box).  This commitment will also protect the livelihoods of coastal communities by ensuring that fish are allowed to grow to maturity, are more plentiful and fished in an environmentally responsible manner   <\/p><p>  From the outset of the Common Fisheries Policy revision process, Ireland's overarching goal was to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations.<\/p><p>  I take great comfort in the Commission's most recent assessment that the state of fish stocks in European Atlantic and nearby waters continues to improve which indicates that we are finally starting to see the benefits of prudent and responsible fisheries management practices.  I am confident that we will continue to make significant progress as we commence the implementation of setting TACs under the new reformed CFP.   <\/p><p>  The Commission make clear that we must make progress on setting TACs in accordance with fMSY and clearly this will be a challenge over the coming few years. <\/p><p>  Ireland is committed to implementing this ambitious policy in a rational and progressive manner. In line with the policy, we consider that we will need to phase in delivering fMSY if its immediate application seriously jeopardises the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleet.  We are facing the additional challenge of implementing the landing obligation and in line with the new CFP, increasing TACs to take account of the current levels of discards.  Clearly the challenge will be managing this situation in tandem with delivering fMSY for all stocks by 2020 at the latest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200087#WRU01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Labelling","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200088#WRV00150"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[43472\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200088#WRV00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is satisfied that labelling and traceability regulations applicable throughout the European Union in respect of product originating within the Union or outside continue to be observed in the spirit and the letter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Under EU law primary responsibility for the safety and traceability of food placed in the market place lies with food business operators. The role of my Department is to verify compliance by the food business operators with this requirement.   Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002, which sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law, stipulates, among other things, that food business operators at all stages of production, processing and distribution within the businesses under their control must ensure that foods satisfy the requirements of food law. Specifically in regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators must have systems in place to be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food. They must also have a system in place to identify the other businesses to which their product has been supplied. In other words a food business operator at each and every stage in the food chain must be able to identify the source of its inputs as well as having details of the first recipient of its output. This is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;one step forward one step backward&rdquo; traceability system. <\/p><p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants. Controls at stand-alone secondary processing plants are carried out at a frequency which is based on an annual risk assessment for each plant. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department approved meat plant. The audit includes physical identity, labelling and documentary checks. This includes product originating both in EU Member States and third countries. In addition, labelling and documentary checks form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. <\/p><p>  Rules on the labelling of meat and meat products\u00a0are laid down in EU legislation. For beef, the current rules require compulsory origin labelling, with place of birth, rearing and slaughter specified.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  In 2011 , the European Union passed a new Council Regulation on Food Information for the Consumers (FIC), Regulation 1169\/2011, which will be implemented by way of EU Commission implementing regulations and has updated the requirements for consumer information and labelling in a number of areas , including   :<\/p><p>  -  country of origin or place of provenance including the origin labelling for meats other than beef (that is swine, sheep, goats and poultry),<\/p><p>  -  voluntary labelling of all foods and<\/p><p>  -  the mandatory labelling of meat as an ingredient. <\/p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by EU Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office, to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes a series of health and supervisory requirements, designed to ensure that imported products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between Member States.   <\/p><p>  Import controls on products of animal origin arriving from third countries must be performed at an EU Border Inspection Post approved for that category of product being presented.<\/p><p>  Consignments for import requiring veterinary checks must be notified in advance to the Border Inspection Post of import and presented on arrival for checks with all the appropriate documentation. Border Inspection Posts in Ireland are operated by my Department.

The ending of milk quota regime represents an exceptional opportunity for the dairy industry to increase milk output and, as a result, the industry has set itself a target, under Food Harvest 2020, of increasing milk production by 50% in the period to 2020. This will result in increasing the 2008\/2009 average annual milk production of 5bn litres to 7.5bn litres in 2020. Consequently I am satisfied that dairy production in Ireland will not suffer in the aftermath of the abolition of quotas  Since the publication of the Food Harvest 2020 Report ,   my Department has been providing a range of supports to assist farmers in exploiting the potential for expansion and development. Through a combination of Departmental supports and the work of Teagasc, AHI and ICBF, significant advances have been made over the last four year in improving efficiencies, education and training at farm level. In that time some 7,000 Irish dairy farmers (c.40%) have participated, to varying degrees, in knowledge transfer programmes, delivered through the medium of Discussion Groups. These programmes were aimed at encouraging efficiency gains on dairy farms through changing attitudes and improving technical, financial and scientific knowledge, as well as skill levels at individual farm level. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the recent softening of prices for dairy products on world markets and the consequent reduction in farm gate prices for milk, the general consensus among forecasters in this area is that increasing incomes and globalisation of diets are expected to raise the demand for milk and dairy products in developing countries and an increasing import demand will support prices of dairy products during the next decade. Ireland is well placed to take advantage of this increased trade and the removal of quota restrictions will allow the necessary increased production.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200088#WRV00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry","counter":248,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200088#WRV00550"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[43474\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200088#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he is satisfied that beef producers here are likely to receive a fair price for their product, with particular reference to the need to strive towards a price to producers similar to that in the adjoining jurisdiction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It is neither appropriate nor possible for me or any other Minister for Agriculture in the EU, to intervene directly on these issues. Indeed, the new Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has emphasised this point again in recent days via correspondence directed to my Department. Cattle prices are determined by supply - demand dynamics which are in turn influenced by a range of different factors such as consumer preferences, distance to market, consumer confidence, retail promotions, competition with other meats and the overall macroeconomic situation.  Nonetheless, it is vital that farmers are sufficiently remunerated for producing quality animals. My role as Minister for Agriculture is to create a policy support environment that will allow the beef sector to flourish in line with normal market principles.   <\/p><p>  In the recent budget, I announced a total package of approximately &euro;74 million for the beef sector in 2015, including a provision of &euro;52 million for a proposed Beef Data and Genomics Programme which will place Ireland at the leading edge globally in the use of genomics in beef production. The current Genomics Scheme is being further developed and enhanced as part of a 6-year RDP measure which, once approved by the European Commission, will deliver a payment per animal of &euro;100 for the first ten animals, with the remaining animals being eligible for an &euro;80 payment per animal in participating herds. In 2014, I have brought forward a number of initiatives to help the sector, including the creation of the Beef Genomics Scheme with a budget of &euro;23 million in 2014. I have also ensured that the budgets of the Beef Data Programme and the Beef Technology Adoption Programme are retained at &euro;10 million and &euro;5 million which, when added to residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme, amounts to an investment of &euro;40m in 2014.   <\/p><p>  I have also been proactive in securing new market opportunities for Irish beef with Japan, Lebanon and Philippines opened in the last 12 months and significant progress in the US and Canada where I expect Irish beef to be landing on supermarket shelves sometime soon. In addition I made a major breakthrough in China last week where I secured the agreement of the Chinese authorities to send a formal inspection team to Ireland within the next month.   <\/p><p>  I will continue to engage with both farmers and processors to ensure that the market operates in a fair and transparent manner. Improved transparency has been delivered through the development of a Beef Pricewatch App which was developed by Department and already has 17,000 users.

The purpose of the trade mission was to provide an opportunity to<i><\/i>showcase Ireland&rsquo;s world class food and drink products and services in this expanding market and to facilitate business to business meetings between companies.<i><\/i>The opportunities and potential of the Chinese market for the Irish agri-food and related sectors are enormous. The importance of the Chinese market to Ireland is demonstrated in our agri-food and related exports to China and Hong Kong which have expanded from &euro;254m in 2011 to &euro;442m in 2013, a 74% increase, while exports to the end of August 2014 amounted to &euro;405m from &euro;300m in the same period last year, a 35% increase. I would expect to see these exports reaching &euro;500m this year. The potential for our exports to continue to grow is linked to China&rsquo;s ongoing food security and food safety concerns and an insatiable demand for infant formula, from which Ireland can benefit strategically because of our potential to increase production particularly in the dairy sector from 2015, and because Ireland is, increasingly in the eyes of the Chinese, being regarded as a country which has the highest food safety standards, having had all its dairy plants, which applied to export to China, approved this year.<br\/><br\/>Following political meetings with my\u00a0Chinese counterparts , including\u00a0the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Han Changfu)\u00a0and the Minister responsible for market access (Mr. Zhi Shuping), we have had a significant breakthrough on beef, with a firm commitment from the Chinese Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQSIQ) to carry out a formal inspection visit in Ireland in early December. My Department has already begun an intensive engagement with the Chinese authorities and with Irish industry on the planning for this inspection visit. In addition the Chinese authorities also agreed to the wording of a certificate for the export of bovine semen to China which paves the way for the first exports of bovine semen from Ireland to China. An Irish company (Dovea) signed a contract of intent to export bovine semen.<br\/><br\/>In the dairy sector, the week saw a number of events marking strategic partnerships between Irish and Chinese dairy companies which are now resulting in dairy produce including infant formula, manufactured in Ireland and identified as originating in Ireland on sale on Chinese supermarket shelves,<i><\/i>and becoming the premier product of choice for Chinese consumers. We are fortunate to have Irish companies such as IDB, Glanbia, and Kerry Foods, and multinationals such as Abbot, Wyeth, and Nutricia, which have manufacturing facilities in Ireland, representing Ireland in this important market. In seeking to ensure that there are no technical barriers to trade in the future, I have agreed an MOU with Minister Shuping on introducing a pilot electronic certification system in the dairy sector. <br\/><br\/>In the seafood sector, I opened the largest ever Irish stand at the Chinese Seafood Expo,  in Qingdao, the largest in Asia, where Ireland was represented by 11 companies. I also concluded an MOU with Minister Zhi Shuping of AQSIQ on facilitating market access for seafood into China. While our exports of seafood are small, valued at &euro;16m in 2013, these exports have grown by almost 50% from 2012 when we exported just &euro;7m.A number of agri-services companies on the trade mission also concluded contracts in China including Samco and Keenans. <br\/><br\/>The one clear message Ireceived from the Chinese authorities, companies and buyers this week is that they know and trust food originating from Ireland as being produced to the highest standards when it comes to food safety, quality\u00a0and sustainability.\u00a0It&rsquo;s important now that we build on this momentum and keep focused on providing quality agri-food, seafood products and services to the Chinese market.<i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200089#WRW00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Household Incomes","counter":258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200089#WRW00550"},{"type":"question","counter":259,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[43477\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200089#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he and his Department continue to monitor the margins available to producers in the beef, lamb, pig and poultry sectors; if any particular action is warranted to address any obvious issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":260,"content":"<p>In terms of returns to farmers, Teagasc&rsquo;s annual National Farm Survey provides analysis of output, inputs and income at farm level, based on a representative sample of farms.\u00a0Family farm income per farm (FFI) is the principal measure of income used in the National Farm Survey. It is calculated by deducting all farm costs (direct and overhead) from the value of farm gross output.

Family farm income therefore represents the financial reward to all members of the family, who work on the farm, for their labour, management and investment.\u00a0 It does not include income from non-farming sources and thus may not be equated to farm household income.  The National Farm Survey is based on a sample of over 900 farms, and represents a national population of 79,000 farms, with a standard output of &euro;8,000 or more.\u00a0 The main farming systems covered are: dairying; cattle rearing (suckler farming); cattle other (mainly beef finishing); sheep; tillage; and mixed livestock.

The EU legislation has been transposed into national legislation via S.I. No. 207 of 2014 - European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations 2014. Regulation 504\/2008, which came into effect on 1 July 2009, requires three elements of identification to be fulfilled in respect of each equine &ndash; i.e. a single lifetime passport, a method to ensure the unequivocal link between the animal and the passport (transponder) and a database which records the identification details of the animal under a unique identification number which relates to the animal for which the passport was issued and the person responsible for identifying the animal. Furthermore the Regulation provides that if an equine animal has not been identified properly within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31 st   of December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, it cannot be admitted to the food chain. <\/p><p>  Equine identification legislation is complemented by mandatory requirements which I introduced in recent years to register equine premises and notify change of ownership. Before verifying the eligibility of equines for slaughter for human consumption, my officials at the slaughter plant must be satisfied that the animals in question have originated from premises that is registered with my Department . Keepers from outside the State are accommodated through the use of a generic herd number.   <\/p><p>  My Department established a central equine database for equines last year on the Animal Identification and Movement [AIM] system.\u00a0 The central equine database is now used to supplement the checks carried out by Department staff in slaughter plants, in particular to check that horses presented for slaughter are identified correctly and eligible for the food chain.\u00a0Aside from the usual veterinary checks, the passport of an animal presented for slaughter is examined to ensure eligibility for the food chain, absence of evidence of tampering and that the markings recorded on the passport match the animal. \u00a0 <\/p><p>  I strengthened equine identification legislation earlier this year with the signing of S.I. 207 of 2014 - European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations 2014 - which consolidates previous secondary legislation in this area and which further reinforces my powers in relation to the seizure and detention of documents and equine animals. <\/p><p>  In addition, there has been an increase in enforcement of legislation relating to the identification of equines at sales, marts, fairs , etc, and I acknowledge the successful collaboration between other agencies and my Department in this area.   <\/p><p>  With regard to the application of care and management, primary responsibility for safeguarding   the health and welfare of their horses rests with owners. Owners are also encouraged to adhere to best practice in disposing of their horses when they no longer fulfil the purpose for which they were bred, as such actions prevent the emergence of long-term animal welfare problems.   <\/p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to maintain ongoing vigilance in relation to official controls on the identification of horses at marts and other sales venues, in meat factories and at points on entry to the country.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200090#WRX00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry Development","counter":271,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200090#WRX00550"},{"type":"question","counter":272,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[43481\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200090#WRX00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his vision for the future development of the fishing industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":273,"content":"<p>The new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores, the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.  My plans for the development of the overall seafood sector in the very short term are set out in the Seafood Development Programme 2007-2013, and the complementary Irish Seafood National Programme 2007-2013, which identify the investment priorities for the development of the sector up to 2015. The Seafood Development Programme includes the overwhelming majority of initiatives for the development of the sector. That Programme is co-funded by the European Union under the European Fisheries Fund. It was considerably updated in 2012, following an interim evaluation of its progress and further updated again in 2014 to include additional investments in the 6 State owned Fishery Harbour Centres. The Programme identifies the development needs of the catching, processing and aquaculture sectors and the measures that will be implemented to address those needs. The complementary Irish Seafood National Programme is the framework programme for a small number of measures that are not included in the Seafood Development Programme or are not eligible for EU co-funding.   <\/p><p>  My Department is presently preparing a new Seafood Development Programme for the period 2014-2020 under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. Earlier this year, following months of intense lobbying and negotiation at EU level, I announced on 12 June that I had secured for our industry &euro;148 million from the new EU Fund. I followed up on that announcement in Budget 2015 with the announcement of national co-funding that will bring the total Fund available for the new Seafood Development Programme to &euro;241 million. This is a doubling of the investment funds available compared to the previous Programme and will ensure a strong seafood industry in Ireland that can grow and expand to meet its potential up to 2020. I expect to publish a draft of the new Programme for public consultation before the end of this year and to see new support measures being launched from 2015 onwards.   <\/p><p>  I have also launched measures to focus development of Ireland&rsquo;s inshore fishing sector, which I see has a key role to play in sustaining rural, coastal communities. The measures include the establishment of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum based on a network of regional forums to give inshore fishermen and their communities a direct voice in developing their sector. The first Regional Inshore Fisheries Forum meetings have taken place and I look forward to meeting their representatives at the National Inshore Fisheries Forum at the start of December. I have also committed up a total funding programme for inshore fishermen in 2014 worth up to &euro;1m. This is aimed at providing financial assistance for sustainable, environmentally friendly fishing practices and the recent safety equipment and training initiative.   <\/p><p>  From the outset of the Common Fisheries Policy revision process, Ireland&rsquo;s overarching goal was to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations. This will ensure that families dependent on fishing can look forward to being part of a vibrant, productive and resilient Irish fishing industry. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200090#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":275,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200090#WRX00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200090#WRX00750"},{"type":"question","counter":275,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[43409\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200090#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if a person (details supplied) who served in the Irish Army is entitled to an Army pension and if on their death that pension is transferred to their widow; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

responsibility of the Courts Service and I have no role in the matter.  Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of information on the courts system. <br\/><br\/>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had inquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that it is unable to supply the reasons why a case is dismissed nor is it possible to extract cases recorded by Go Safe cameras from the overall camera offences figures.  Set out in the table below is the number of cases dismissed in respect of all camera offences for each District Court area for each year from 2009 to date.<br\/><br\/>The breakdown of cases by month is not readily available.  The compilation of such statistics would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort to prepare and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.<br\/><br\/>I can also inform the Deputy that my Department, in consultation with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service is currently studying the arrangements required to bring into effect section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.

The School Completion Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at those school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  It involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.  The programme's project model approach gives local communities the autonomy to devise innovative approaches to address the needs of young people most at risk of early school leaving.  I am happy to acknowledge the ongoing and highly committed work of these individual projects, the staff involved, the partner schools and communities in supporting their target groups of vulnerable students.<br\/><br\/>Since its establishment on 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to projects within the programme. <br\/><br\/>As with all major spending programmes, the School Completion Programme budget was subject to examination under the terms of the 2011 Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  This process identified a requirement for savings of 6.5% per annum across the programme over the period 2012 to 2014.  These savings required are reflected in the allocations to the programme in those years.  Details of the allocations to the School Completion Programmes in 2012 to 2014 and the savings requirement under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, are as follows:<table><tr><th><div>Year<\/div><\/th><th><div>Annual Allocation<\/div><\/th><th><div>Comprehensive Review of ExpenditureSavings<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>2012<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;28.256m<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;2m<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2013<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;26.456m<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1.8m<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2014<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;24.756m<\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1.7m<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>The detailed information the Deputy has sought in relation to the School Completion allocations by county over the past five years is not readily available. The Child and Family Agency has advised that the funding to be allocated to the School Completion Programme in 2015 is being considered in light of the Agency's budgetary strategy in the context of its 2015 overall allocation of &euro;635m.<br\/><br\/>The Agency further advised that it  has completed the detailed process of evaluating and approving the 2014\/2015 school retention plans for individual school completion projects as a basis for 2014\/15 funding, and the first instalment of funding issued to projects in September 2014.  Further instalments will issue in December 2014 and May\/June 2015.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy may wish to note that a review of the School Completion Programme has commenced.  It is an important initiative in relation to planning for the future development of the School Completion Programme.

The aim of the Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services so that there is a clear pathway to services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.<br\/><br\/>The Programme is organised at national, regional and local level and includes representatives from the health and education sectors, non-statutory service providers and parents.  An additional &euro;4 million has been specifically allocated in 2014 for implementation, which equates to approximately 80 therapy posts.  Details of additional funding to be allocated in 2015 to improve services under this Programme will be set out in the HSE's 2015 Service Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200097#WREE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Charges","counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200098#WRFF00100"},{"type":"question","counter":365,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[43418\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200098#WRFF00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide the details of the various current hospital charges per person in the public system; the overall amount generated by such charges in one year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":366,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine the matter of income generated by hospital charges and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.  If the Deputy has not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office who will follow up the matter with them.  The hospital charges that currently apply are as follows. <\/p><p>  The Health (Out-Patient Charges) Regulations 2013 provides for a &euro;100 charge for out-patient services provided at an emergency department, an accident and emergency department, a casualty department, a minor injury unit, an urgent care centre, a local injury unit or any other facility providing similar services, subject to certain exemptions.  In addition, under the Health Services (Out-Patient) Regulations 1993, the HSE may levy a charge on private patients for the use of an MRI machine in a public hospital.<\/p><p>  Under the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations 1987 (as amended) public in-patients in public hospitals are liable to a &euro;75 per day charge subject to a maximum of &euro;750 in any 12 consecutive months, subject to certain exemptions.  Under the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 private in-patients in public hospitals are subject to charges that range from &euro;329 to &euro;1,000 per day.  The charge levied depends on whether accommodation is provided in a single or multiple occupancy room and if overnight accommodation is provided.<\/p><p>  As required by the Health (Amendment) Act 1986, where a hospital is informed that the patient, their personal representative or a dependent is pursuing a Road Traffic Accident (RTA) claim, billing data is generated on the local billing system.  Invoices can be raised for an RTA related in-patient or out-patient charge depending on the services provided at the hospital. <\/p><p>  The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005-2011 provide that, subject to certain exemptions, charges apply to the maintenance element of &quot;long-stay&quot; in-patient services (excluding acute in-patient services or services supported under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme) provided in hospitals or other specified settings by or on behalf of the HSE for over 30 days within a rolling 12 month period.  Charges apply to those with full or limited eligibility and may not exceed 80% of the weekly non-contributory State pension.  The Regulations provide for sliding scales of charges based on income, with the current maximum being &euro;175 per week where 24-hour nursing care is provided or &euro;130 per week where 24-hour nursing care is not provided.  The charges may be waived or reduced where necessary to avoid financial hardship, having regard to each individual's financial circumstances (including whether he or she has dependants).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200098#WRFF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Expenditure","counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200098#WRFF00400"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[43419\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111200098#WRFF00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if bulk buying on an international level with either the NHS or EU has been examined for medications or equipment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>Most drugs, medicines and consumable appliances which are paid for by the HSE are supplied to patients through over 1,800 community pharmacies who, in turn, purchase them from wholesalers or, to a lesser extent, directly from drug manufacturers. <\/p><p>  The current pharmacy based model results in over 70 million items being dispensed annually through local pharmacies across the State, including low population centres in rural areas.

The functions of an audit committee are to review financial and budgetary reporting practices and procedures within a local authority, foster the development of best practice in the internal audit function, review auditors&rsquo; reports and special reports and assess follow-up action by management, assess and promote efficiency and value for money, review risk management systems and make such recommendations to the authority as the committee considers appropriate in respect of such matters.<\/p><p>  The allocation of the &euro;1m in additional funding for 2014 is fully conditional on a realistic and achievable financial plan, which charts a path to long term financial sustainability, being agreed between my Department and the Council.

The analysis underpinning the draft Plan is that an additional bioenergy focussed measure in the heat sector would represent the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals. Therefore, the draft Plan recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources.

The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5bn in network upgrades and at least 1.6 million of the 2.3 million addresses in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next number of years. In the last month alone, two companies have announced projects to deliver direct fibre connectivity to approximately 500,000 homes and businesses in every county in Ireland including the town of Monaghan. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the National Broadband Plan is to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of where they are located, benefits from a high quality, high speed broadband service. This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments, such as those I have already mentioned, and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<\/p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services.
