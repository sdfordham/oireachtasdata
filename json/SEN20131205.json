We are looking forward to earning our turkey.<\/p><p>I welcome yesterday's announcement by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, that applications will be accepted from next week for new recruits to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is a positive step and one for which I have repeatedly called.  An issue I have raised directly with the Minister in respect of any new programme of recruitment is the position of members of the Garda Reserve, many of whom would be expected to apply.  There is a two-year training programme at Templemore before new recruits pass out as full members of the force.  Provision should be made whereby those who have served as members of the Garda Reserve, and have thus completed basic training, are given priority in the application process.  I understand there might be a legal issue in this regard, but I would like to tease it out with the Minister.  Will the Leader clarify how many recruits are proposed to be appointed?<\/p><p>The Bill to establish the pyrite resolution board and thereby allow people to make applications for funding to remediate their homes was expected to be published before Christmas, with the Leader indicating it would be initiated in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>We were expecting it before Christmas and the Leader had indicated it would be initiated in this House.  I assume now that it will not be ready before Christmas, but perhaps the Leader could give an indication as to when it will be published.<\/p><p>The tax and online betting legislation has been in preparation for some time.  Does the Leader know when that Bill will be brought to the House?  The independent bookmakers in Ireland, many of them family-run concerns, are under increasing pressure daily due to the lack of a level playing pitch as no tax is levied on online betting.  It will be another income stream for the Government.<\/p><p>Finally, with regard to the HSE service plan for 2014, the Leader said yesterday there will not be a debate on the plan prior to Christmas.  That is very regrettable.  I do not blame the Leader for this but it is a strategic move by the Government and the Minister, Deputy Reilly, to ensure there is no debate on the plan.  I expect it will be published just before the Christmas, which the Government is doing to keep it under the radar.  That is unacceptable.  I indicated eight or ten weeks ago that this would happen, due to the constant delays and time extensions for the plan.  I seek a commitment from the Leader that when Members return in January there will be a full debate on the HSE service plan.<\/p><p>In that context, I have written to the HSE and the Minister, and the Leader's office might follow it up, asking how much money was spent by the HSE on legal fees in 2012 and 2013.  I would like to get a response to that, because my information is that a staggering amount of money is being paid every year by the HSE for legal services.  Obviously, some of that would be valid in the normal course of events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500002#A00500","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386239400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome the news that Forbes has named Ireland as the best country in which to do business, ranking it first this year as opposed to sixth last year, with New Zealand and Hong Kong in second and third places, respectively.  However, it is something of a mixed blessing, in that the reasons cited for Ireland being such a good place to do business include the 12.5% unemployment rate and the availability of a highly qualified workforce.  While it is good to be acknowledged as a great place to do business, we must look at some of the reasons for that.<\/p><p>In that context, Pfizer has cut the number of jobs in its Newbridge plant by 150, which follows the loss of 570 jobs at the MSD plant in Swords and 110 jobs in Castlebar.  On the other hand, there has been growth in the biopharmaceutical area.  It is important that we do not end up with a situation in which there are structural issues where plant is available and educated workers are losing their jobs on the one hand and, on the other, emerging sectors within the industry are showing great promise.  Will the Leader invite the Minister to the House to discuss the future of the pharmaceutical sector and what actions the Government is taking to protect jobs in that sector?<\/p><p>Once again, I seek an emergency debate on homelessness, as I have done on a number of occasions previously.  A number of matters have emerged in the last week that show the seriousness of the problem.  According to the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, there has been an increase of almost 50% in the number of people sleeping rough, the highest number since 2007 when the count began.  That is on top of a doubling of the number of people who are presenting as homeless to the Homeless Agency.  It includes a significant increase in the number of families.  I was also struck by a recent report on the D&oacute;chas Centre, the Mountjoy women's prison, in which the Irish Penal Reform Trust points to homelessness as a significant reason for women being in prison.<\/p><p>Last weekend, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, announced the provision of &euro;100 million for the construction of new social housing units.  A proportion of those units should be allocated specifically for homeless provision.  Money is also being made available to local authorities to bring forward voids more quickly.  However, much of that housing is three bedroom housing or family accommodation, but the majority of people in homeless accommodation are single men and women.  There must be a strategy to ensure that a proportion of those voids is kept for single people.  We must broaden the subject of this debate to cover housing generally and housing supply.  It has become clear that the type of people presenting as homeless has expanded dramatically to include people who are experiencing a difficulty with rent arrears or, quite simply, experiencing the impossibility of finding housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500003#B00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1386239400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The Naval Service will take delivery of a new ship early in 2014.  Will the Leader and the other party leaders confer, with a view to nominating a possible name for the ship to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter?  It would be appropriate for Members of a House which has proved to be unsinkable this year to arrive at a jointly agreed proposal for the Minister, Deputy Shatter, on the name for the new ship.<\/p><p>  Yet again this week there was an increase in public transport fares.  This follows the publication by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, of its most comprehensive Transport Omnibus, a most valuable document.  It shows that since 2007 there are 51 million fewer bus passengers and 8 million fewer train passengers in this country.  It is time the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport came up with something better than always increasing fares, particularly in an economy in which there has been zero inflation.  That is part of the <i>Forbes<\/i> accreditation and I agree with Senator Hayden's misgivings, in that some of the prizes we were awarded are ones I would prefer not to have.  In an economy with zero inflation, why were some bus fares rising by multiples this week despite the loss of 51 million bus passengers and 8 million train passengers?  The mistakes were illustrated by what the Minister of State in that Department, Deputy Alan Kelly, did with his taxi Bill.  After 60 pages he included exclusive bus routes for people who have them at present and the award of contracts by direct award without competitive tendering.  That produces a system which results in nearly 4 million fewer passengers on Dublin suburban rail per year, 4.3 million fewer on the Dublin Area Rapid Transit, DART, 32.3 million fewer on Dublin Bus, 5.2 million fewer on the provincial city bus services and 8.1 million fewer passengers on the provincial bus services.<\/p><p>  The policy is not working.  There are obvious differences between the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, whom I believe is right on this, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly.  The result of public transport losing 50 million passengers in such a short period is unacceptable.  There must be competition for subsidised routes and competition on the routes.  As I have said several times in the House, when the Dublin-Galway service was a monopoly there was one bus per day, and it travelled via Mullingar in case one was in a hurry.  There are now 59.  That is the type of advance we must have.<\/p><p>  I also regret that the Cabinet agreed yesterday - the Leader was following up on this issue for me - to seek yet another deferral of a competitive health insurance market, which was due to be in place by the deadline of December this year.  It has asked for another year.  This has been ongoing since 1992 and the results are felt in people's pockets when they try to renew health insurance.  Approximately 250,000 have decided not to do so.  There are 50 million fewer passengers on public transport and 250,000 fewer people have health insurance.  It is time the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Health woke up to 21st century economics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500003#B00300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1386239400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Following the CSO figures last week on unemployment, it is important to note the live register figures yesterday, which have decreased from 12.6% last month to 12.5%.  I wish I was welcoming a figure of 4%, but I am not.  We will get there, however, as we are on the right track.  Also, as Senator Hayden mentioned, <i>Forbes <\/i>yesterday announced that Ireland is the best country in which to do business.  I congratulate the Taoiseach on reaching his target in 2013 rather than 2016.  Ireland moved from sixth position last year.<\/p><p>  It is important to look at the figures for how the country was measured across 11 categories, ranging across property rights, innovation, technology, freedom to do business, red tape and so forth.  They are all weighted equally, so none was considered higher than another.  That is important.  Taxes were also included and they were weighted equally among the 11 measures.  This is very positive progress and the challenge will be to remain in that position.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 will be important in that regard.  Like other Senators, I believe we must continue to focus on this area.<\/p> <p>I would like the Minister to come to the House early in the new year so that we can track the progress of the 2013 jobs action plan and his preparations for the 2014 jobs action plan, which I understand will be in place shortly.

In many of these cases, homelessness is at the back of the dilemma that leads to offending.  I thank Senators again for yesterday's debate.

Similarly, it is important that <i>Forbes<\/i> magazine has named Ireland is a great place in which to do business.<\/p><p>  I spoke earlier this week about the issue of co-funding, which is of critical importance to the north west.  The rumours in this regard intensified after the Minister said at the annual general meeting of the ICMSA that the current economic environment makes it highly unlikely that 50:50 funding will be possible.  The positive news we have heard about the income of &euro;500 million, at a time of the year when approximately one sixth of the tax take has come in, makes it clear that there is scope to do these things.  I hope the Leader will impress on the Minister the importance of providing additional resources, if necessary, to ensure this 50:50 co-funding takes place.  If the moneys in question are provided, they will go directly into the real economy in every townland in the country.  Every shop, wholesaler and feed sales outlet in Ireland will benefit from that.  It will get right into the economy.<\/p><p>  The second issue I would like to raise is the change in the medical card eligibility scheme, which will save just &euro;25 million.

Additional taxes are available and it would be possible to make that &euro;25 million available to ensure the changes are not necessary.  It is one thing to celebrate the good news of better tax results but what is in it for the people?  There are two tangible measures, the first of which is for the co-funding of Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy to be 50:50 and not less, as the Minister said, and the second being medical card eligibility.  I am sure any of us would be happy to allow those 25,000 to hold on to their medical cards in the relative autumn of their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500004#C03100","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386240600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>On last night's edition of \"Tonight with Vincent Browne\", Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn from the Sinn F&eacute;in movement did the State some service when he allowed the mask to slip to reveal the ugliness and vileness at the heart of the Sinn F&eacute;in and republican movement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500005#D00200","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1386240600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>We are not discussing last night's television programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500005#D00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1386240600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>To say that somebody has a duty to kill an unarmed man who is trying to surrender when he is surrounded on a country road by armed gunmen, was an incredible statement which was compounded by the comparing of the current republican movement to the old IRA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500005#D00400","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1386240600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>We are not discussing the content of television programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500005#D00500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1386240600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I am looking for a debate on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500005#D00600","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1386240600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>The Senator should look at the history of his own party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500005#D00700","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1386240600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I will look at the history.

This amendment proposes the inclusion of the term &quot;educational welfare&quot; on page 12, line 16, before the word &quot;development&quot;.  Its purpose is to support and promote the educational welfare, development and protection of children by ensuring all services engage in prevention and early intervention practice.  The rationale of the Children Rights Alliance for this amendment is that the provisions on family support and the role of educational welfare should also be expanded upon.  It states:<blockquote>Section 72 of the Bill provides for the transfer of the functions of the National Educational Welfare Board to the Agency, and this Agency function is referred to in Section 8(1).  Section 8(1)(b) and (c) further elaborate on the functions of the Agency in relation to family support and the &ldquo;development, welfare and protection of children&rdquo;. Educational welfare may be implicitly included in the latter phrase.  However, we believe that the Bill would benefit from a more explicit acknowledgment of the importance of educational welfare.  The link between school non-attendance and child welfare concerns is well known.  It is also critically important to recognise educational welfare services as a route for identifying other underlying child protection issues in a child&rsquo;s life.  We believe the greater visibility of the issue of educational welfare would also help ensure buy-in from staff within the National Education Welfare Board.<\/blockquote>This certainly constitutes a large improvement from a time when a garda would be given responsibility, without backup, for school attendance issues.  This created major difficulties because the backup was not in place, which is the reason I believe it to be important.  The Minister should consider this matter and respond accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500009#J00300","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1386242700,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I second the amendment and support Senator Leyden's remarks.  I do not wish to delay the House on this amendment, which I consider to be straightforward.  I agree with the Senator on the need for greater visibility regarding the issue of educational welfare, which would help in ensuring buy-in from staff from the National Educational Welfare Board, and this amendment should be supported.  In general, as Members progress through all the amendments that have been tabled, the Minister will be aware that my party supports the Bill.  I believe it has the support of all parties and Independent Members in the House and in this context, all the amendments tabled are to improve the Bill and to help and assist the Government.  Consequently, it is to be hoped that in the spirit of political reform, the Minister will engage with Members and will accept some of the amendments tabled.  Other Senators may make a similar point as the debate continues because to do otherwise does a disservice to both the House and the Government, when genuine engagement takes place on a Bill for which there is support but on which there are views on how it can be improved.  I wish to signal this point to the Minister before progressing further on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500009#J00400","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1386242700,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I will begin by noting that I have taken a collaborative approach to the development of this legislation with both non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and Members of both Houses.  I tabled quite a number of amendments on Committee Stage at an earlier point in the Bill's development and took on board the vast majority of the recommendations made from the NGO sector, for example, which were supported by colleagues in both Houses.  I have introduced some highly significant amendments with regard to the family support area in particular, as well as to other aspects of the Bill.<\/p><p>As for the question of highlighting educational welfare, one reason the educational welfare service is being brought into the agency is precisely because of the point made by Senator Leyden, namely, the importance of educational welfare.  I recognise this and was delighted when the educational welfare service was brought in under the umbrella, as well as with the co-operation I received from the Minister, Deputy Quinn, in that regard.  This is really important because as the Senator pointed out, educational welfare clearly is a key issue.  One of the first places in which it will be noticed that children are having difficulties is often in non-attendance at school.  I refer to section 72(2), as I did on Committee Stage, in which it is absolutely clear that all functions being undertaken by the National Educational Welfare Board at present are being transferred in full to the new agency.  On Committee Stage, I read those functions into the record of this House and as Senator Leyden is aware, they are well-detailed in that legislation.  Consequently, all of this will come under the remit of the new agency.  It is all captured in the provisions of section 72(2) that all the current functions of the aforementioned agency will transfer automatically to the new agency.<\/p><p>It might be helpful to add further that the welfare of a child encompasses many aspects and in this regard, the term &quot;development and welfare&quot; encompasses any functions transferring from the National Educational Welfare Board.  I do not wish to replace the broad focus of the section.  In its broadest sense, educational welfare also comprises part of the work and function of teachers, the National Educational Psychological Service and the National Council for Special Education.  Consequently, I do not wish to include a suggestion in the Bill that educational welfare is solely the remit of the agency and I believe the broad-based approach I have taken in drafting the legislation captures what both Senators Leyden and Cullinane seek.  The concept of educational attainment is captured clearly by any commonsense understanding in respect of development and welfare.  Moreover, added to this is the transfer of all the functions of the National Educational Welfare Board to the agency.  This is greatly to be welcomed because the work being undertaken by educational welfare officers is highly significant and all of this will be transferred.<\/p> <p>That work includes the school completion programme and the home-school liaison programme.  Those initiatives are very important in terms of prioritising that group of young people who might leave school early.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500009#J00500","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386243300,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister's explanation that these matters are encompassed within the relevant provision.

The provision is considered too narrow and not sufficiently reflective of the range of appropriate and proportionate supports that will be on offer to families as per the constitutional amendment and as outlined in section 3 of the Child Care Act 1991.  Family support plays a crucial role in preventing situations from escalating, but it is only one of a range of available options.  Other options must be included in the suite of supports open to families in order to ensure they can address their own difficulties.<\/p><p>  Barnardos also makes the case that the Bill implies that parents will play a passive role in these matters, being merely the recipients of services, as opposed to recognising the active role they actually play in improving their children's lives.  The legislation should explicitly outline how the State will support families in order for them to be effective.  The 2001 Act is heavily biased, according to Barnardos, towards supporting families based on marriage.  Given the diversity of family formations in Ireland, the Bill should be reflective of all situations.  I presume the Minister and her officials have had discussions with Barnardos on these points.  I respect that organisation's views as coming from its experience in the field.  We have agreed to put forward those views in the House as the organisation itself is not in a position to do so.

We have already dealt with that issue.<\/p><p>In regard to the issue of different family formations, the definition of &quot;family&quot; in section 2 is probably one of the most inclusive definitions used in any legislation.  It was included precisely to address the points raised by Barnardos and is as follows: &quot;&quot;family&quot; means spouse, parent, grandparent, step-parent, child (including a step-child), grandchild, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, and any other person who, in the opinion of the Agency, has a bona fide interest in the child;&quot;.  As the Senator can see, this definition is, in fact, broader and more inclusive than the formulation set out in his proposal.  The amendment is not necessary because its intent is already captured in the definitions.  The definition of &quot;couple&quot;, also set out in section 2, is likewise very inclusive.  Separating out the role of parents and guardians would detract from the broad definitions contained in the Bill.

The amendment proposes to delete the provision in subsection 8(4)(<i>a<\/i>) whereby &quot;psychological services associated with the provision of specialist mental health services to children&quot; are excluded from the range of services provided by the new child and family agency.  I accept the need to outline what the agency will do, but I have a major difficulty with a provision which serves to rule out the inclusion of these particular services.  I listened carefully to what the Minister said on this point on Tuesday, but I still do not understand why they must be explicitly excluded.  I accept that special mental health services are not, at this stage, included within the remit of the agency, but there is no such explicit exclusion in the case, for example, of public health nurses, who are not transferring over.<\/p><p>  The child death reports published by the Health Service Executive indicate that in 75% of cases, there was evidence of a need to engage with the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  In her response to Senator Leyden's amendment No. 1, the Minister argued that a reference to &quot;educational welfare&quot; could not be included in the Bill  because other bodies such as the National Educational Psychological Service have a role in carrying out those functions.  There is a contradiction, in light of that argument, in specifically excluding specialist mental health services from the Bill.  It is an exclusion that imposes a straitjacket in terms of our ability to develop essential links in the provision of services for children.  Subsection 8(3) outlines what the agency will include, but why is there a need specifically to exclude these particular services?  It seems to me the Minister is double-bolting the door and preventing them from ever being included within the remit of the agency.  As I said, the child death reports show that at least 75% of cases involved mental health issues which would require access to CAMHS.  I have a huge difficulty with a provision that explicitly excludes those services from the remit of the new agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500010#K01100","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1386243300,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500010#K01200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1386243300,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Senator van Turnhout's analysis is incorrect.  Certain services are transferring to the new agency on the establishment day, which we hope will be 1 January 2014.  What we are doing in section 8 is clarifying the services that will transfer.  The task force recommended that specialist mental health services be considered for inclusion within the remit of the agency.  At this stage of the transfer of functions, we are not bringing in public health nurses.  The latter are not mentioned specifically in the Bill because they are not coming in as a group.  In the case of psychologists, on the other hand, some are transferring over to the agency, where they will have the general function of providing psychological services for children in the community.  The specialist services under CAMHS, however, are not transferring on 1 January.  It is because some psychologists are transferring that it is necessary to be clear that specialist mental health services, specifically, are not transferring.<\/p><p>The reason they are not transferring is that in the first stage of the development of the agency, we are bringing three agencies together, namely, the National Educational Welfare Board, the Family Support Agency, and the child protection components of the HSE.  The vision of the task force was of a broader remit, which would include bringing in public health nurses.  We already have 4,000 people transferring, which amounts to the single largest public sector reform we have initiated in terms of transfer of personnel and agency.  If we were to transfer all public health nurses who work with children and all of the mental health services, there would be a deal of work to be done in terms of the discussion of that concept, negotiating with other Departments, working out all of the human resources issues and so on.  We have taken what we consider the right approach by specifying very clearly in the Bill the functions that are transferring.

Section 9(1) of the Bill specifies that the agency when making decisions in performing its functions under sections 8(1)(a), (b) or (c) shall \"have regard to the best interests of the child in all matters\".  In practice, this means that when the Agency is performing its functions, which are being transferred from the Family Support Agency, the Education Welfare Board and the Health Service Executive, it will have to pay due regard to the best interests of the child.  The principle also applies to its functions in supporting and promoting the development, welfare and protection of children and supporting and encouraging the effective functioning of families.<\/p><p>This is a very welcome development and represents a major evolution in adopting a children's rights approach in public sector reform.  However, questions arise as to how this principle will operate in practice, as there is nothing specific in the legislation on this.  The best interests principle is interpretative in character and decision-makers need guidance on how to interpret it in practice.  The provision falls short of Article 3.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which states: &quot;In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.&quot;<\/p><p>The Committee on the Rights of the Child, CRC, issued a general comment to clarify the meaning of this principle in 2013.  It stated that it has a three-fold meaning.  First, the best interests principle is a substantive right, the right of the child to have his or her best interests assessed and taken as a primary consideration when different interests are being considered in order to reach a decision on the issue at stake, and the guarantee that this right will be implemented whenever a decision is to be made concerning a child, a group of identified or unidentified children or children in general.  Article 3.1 creates an intrinsic obligation for states, is directly applicable and can be invoked before a court.<\/p><p>Second, it is a fundamental, interpretative legal principle.  If a legal provision is open to more than one interpretation, the interpretation which most effectively serves the child's best interests should be chosen.  The rights enshrined in the convention and its optional protocols provide the framework for interpretation.<\/p><p>Third, it is a rule of procedure.  Whenever a decision is to be made that will affect a specific child, an identified group of children or children in general, the decision making process must include an evaluation of the possible impact, positive or negative, of the decision on the child or children concerned.  Assessing and determining the best interests of the child require procedural guarantees.  Furthermore, the justification of a decision must show that the right has been explicitly taken into account.  In this regard, states shall explain how the right has been respected in the decision, that is, what has been considered to be in the child's best interests and the criteria on which it is based.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister will take on board the views of organisations that have lobbied Members on this issue, if not the concerns of the Opposition.  NGOs and other organisations have concerns and they believe the wording in the amendment would add value to the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500011#L00700","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1386243900,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I have tabled amendment No. 8 which is quite similar.  The points I raise refer to both amendments.  On Committee Stage last Tuesday, I outlined to the Minister why I consider this amendment important and I explained general comment No. 14. from the CRC.  I will not repeat what I said then.  The general comment was by the Committee on the Rights of the Child on the right of the child to have his or her best interests taken as a primary consideration.  The UN has sought to ascertain how state parties who have signed and ratified the convention can uphold exactly what is meant by the best interests of the child as a primary consideration.  In that context, the main objective of the general comment is to strengthen the understanding and application of the right of children to have their best interests assessed and taken as a primary consideration or in some cases the paramount consideration.  I believe we have dealt appropriately with the paramount consideration within the Bill, but today we are dealing with &quot;a primary consideration&quot;.  The general comment goes on to state that each state party must respect and implement the right of the child to have his or her best interests assessed and taken as a primary consideration, and is under the obligation to take all necessary, deliberate and concrete measures for the full implementation of this right.<\/p><p>  I hope the Minister accepts one of the two amendments.  In 1998, when the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child had its concluding observations on Ireland's hearing in respect of its upholding of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, recommendation No. 25 stated:<blockquote>In view of the fact that the Convention can only be referred to before the courts as a means of interpretation of national legislation, the Committee recommends that the State party take further steps to ensure that the Convention is fully incorporated as part of the domestic law, taking due account of its general principles as defined in article 2 (non-discrimination), article 3 (best interests of the child), article 6 (right to life, survival and development) and article 12 (respect for the views of the child).<\/blockquote>In the committee's second hearing in 2006, and I was there for it, it made further recommendations with regard to the best interests of the child.  I remind Members that these are the concluding observations after reviewing the Irish State and its upholding of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In point No. 22 of its concluding observations the committee said: &quot;The Committee notes that steps have been taken in some areas to ensure respect for the best interests of the child, yet remains concerned that the principle is still insufficiently addressed&quot;.  In point No. 23 it said:<blockquote>The Committee recommends that the State party: (a) Ensure that the general principle of the best interests of the child is a primary consideration without any distinction and is fully integrated into all legislation relevant to children; and (b) Ensure that this principle is also applied in all political, judicial and administrative decisions, as well as projects, programmes and services that have an impact on children.<\/blockquote>  I believe the Minister's and my intentions are the same.  What we are seeking to do here is provide the opportunity to adopt the convention's language.  I believe establishing the child and family agency is ground-breaking.  We can be world leaders.  Why not use the language of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to bring us absolutely into line?  It is not only appropriate but also our obligation.  Ireland has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and we ask that the convention's language be used, that is, the best interests of the child as a primary consideration.  When Ireland is next before the committee it will be highlighted by the committee if we do not take this opportunity to incorporate this language.  As I said, it does not change the intention of the Bill, but the UN committee has twice advised us on this issue and earlier this year it issued a general comment which deals extensively with the best interests of the child as a primary consideration.  I hope the amendment is accepted by the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500011#L00800","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1386243900,"counter":128,"content":"<p>When the UN committee reports on the next occasion it will also cite the referendum on children, the Adoption Act 2010 which included the paramountcy principle and a number of other initiatives, including this Bill.  This Bill contains, for the first time, a novel and wide-ranging commitment, which is not featured in any other way in Irish statute law, regarding the best interests of the child in the way it is formulated here.<\/p> <p>The paramountcy principle is also articulated in the Bill.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the detail of the Bill.  Section 9(1) provides: &quot;The Agency shall, when making decisions in relation to the performance of its functions under section 8(1)(a), (b) or (c)<i>, <\/i>have regard to the best interests of the child in all matters.&quot;    The use of the term &quot;the best interests of the child in all matters&quot; is ground-breaking and I shall explain why in terms of the Irish situation and the Constitution.  Many of these issues arose when we debated the children's rights referendum last year.  There must be a balance, as in the Constitution, between the rights of the individual child and the rights of the family and parents.  Both rights are held in the Constitution so both must be balanced and the Bill has been drafted to reflect the situation.  There are good constitutional reasons for drafting the best interest principle in the way that we have in the legislation.  I shall explain how Irish law took account of the UN convention and the particular issues that must be dealt with due to the Constitution and its various wording.  <\/p><p> Section 9(1), as worded, is a broad encompassing provision that will ensure that the best interests of the child are key to the agency's decision-making processes when the agency is exercising functions related to the following: the Education (Welfare) Act 2000; child and family services under specific enactments as set out in Schedule 1; supporting and promoting the development, welfare and protection of children; and supporting and encouraging the effective functioning of families.<\/p><p> Section 9(1) is an overarching provision in terms of the delivery of services by the agency.  It imposes a duty on the agency, when making decisions on the delivery of its services under section 8(1)(a), (b) and (c), to have regard to the best interests of the child in all matters.<\/p><p> Reference has been made to general comment No. 14, issued by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, on the right of the child to have his or her best interests taken as a primary consideration.  Senators van Turnhout and Leyden commented on No. 14 so let me also comment on the matter.  The CRC's general comment also stated that &quot;since article 3, paragraph 1, covers a wide range of situations, the Committee recognizes the need for a degree of flexibility in its application&quot;.  That means that the UN accepts that every country must have a degree of flexibility in the application of its principles which includes taking account of a constitution in a country.  The CRC continued: &quot;The best interests of the child &ndash; once assessed and determined &ndash; might conflict with other interests or rights (e.g. of other children, the public, parents, etc.).&quot;  When we considers individual cases, it is often possible to harmonise individual rights but if that is not possible the rights of the child must be taken as a primary consideration and we allow for that in the drafting of this legislation. <\/p><p> The convention entered into force in Ireland in 1992.  Similar to many other common law countries, Ireland has a dualist system under which international agreements to which Ireland becomes a party are not automatically incorporated into domestic law.  The challenge is providing a legislative commitment to best interests as a primary consideration which must be considered in the context of the Irish constitutional and statutory framework.  <\/p><p> I am satisfied that in the great majority of situations the best interests of the child will be the primary consideration.  As we saw during the debate on the children's referendum last year, there may be a small number of situations where there is a need to balance other constitutional considerations.  The approach adopted has been considered carefully by the Office of the Attorney General and my Department's legal personnel and the way it is captured in the Bill is the best approach to the legal framework.  <\/p><p> Today's debate should focus on a commitment to ensuring, as a general procedure in the performance of its duties, that the State body must evaluate the possible impact of any decision it makes on a child or children.  This is a novel and wide-ranging commitment that has not featured in Irish statute law.  It is in addition to the paramountcy principle that is strongly reiterated in respect of specific situations where decisions are taken on an individual child.<\/p><p> Section 9, subsections (2) and (4) imposes certain obligations on the agency where the agency is performing its functions in respect of individual children.  I am satisfied with section 9 in terms of the balance it establishes in cases where the agency exercises its functions in respect of children generally or individual children.  It is reasonable and possible to ensure the best interests are considered and that the agency's decision-making is clearly underpinned statutorily to ensure that they are child-centred.<\/p><p> During the Committee Stage debate I made a point about the agency's work and confirmed that it would be a judicial interpretation but to expect, in the normal course of events, front-line staff to be involved in a broad range of the agency's functions would not be the best way to go forward.  I told Senator van Turnhout, and other Senators who raised the matter, that I would examine the UN commitment and its interpretation in Irish law.  I hope that I have explained that the balance in section 9 deals very effectively with the situation that where individual children's issues are concerned there is the paramountcy principle and that in the broader terms of functions that the language is worded to reflect the balance.  It also reflects our approach to the children's referendum and it is the <i>de facto<\/i>position once the referendum is fully incorporated.  We have achieve a balance between a child's rights and other constitutional provisions that must be considered.  That is the best legal advice that I have and I hope that I have clarified the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500011#L00900","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386244500,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500012#M00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1386244500,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Can I reply?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500012#M00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1386244500,"counter":132,"content":"<p>No.  The only person who can speak is the person who tabled the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500012#M00400","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1386244500,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I was very impressed by the point made by Senator van Turnhout and I have decided, in the circumstances, that it would be worthwhile to put the issue to a vote.

As the Senators appreciate, the consideration of best interests in court-related proceedings is a matter for the relevant court or decision making body.<\/p><p>  Under section 24 of the Child Care Act, where a proceeding is before a court in respect of the care and protection of a child, the court, having regard to the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise, shall have regard to the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.

I see no reason to restate provisions relating to proceedings before a court or the Adoption Authority of Ireland in the Bill.

It was addressed by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan.  She spoke about the need to listen to children at all times, which this amendment is attempting to ensure.  Section 9(3) of the agency Bill introduces a new provision requiring the agency &quot;when planning and reviewing the provision of services in connection with the performance of functions&quot; that are being transferred from the Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, and the HSE to &quot;ensure that consideration is given to the views of children&quot;.  This provision is welcome, in that it obliges the agency to take account of the views of children in its consultation exercises when planning and reviewing certain services.  However, what happens when the agency does not plan any consultation?  The provision does not put an onus on the agency to organise consultations <i>per se<\/i>.  If the agency decides not to consult at all when planning and reviewing its services, it is possible that it will not be in contravention of this provision.<\/p><p>  The amendment imposes an obligation on the agency to consult widely when planning and reviewing provision of services in connection with the functions being transferred from the Family Support Agency, the NEWB and the HSE.<\/p><p>  Section 9(4) of the Bill provides that the Agency &quot;shall, in performing its functions in respect of an individual child under the Child Care Act 1991 ... [or] the Adoption Act 2010 ... ensure that the views of that individual child, where that child is capable of forming and expressing his or her own views, be ascertained and given due weight having regard to the age and maturity of the child&quot;.<\/p> <p> Currently, section 3(2)(ii) of the Child Care Act 1991 provides that when a health board is performing its functions to promote the welfare of children when they are not receiving adequate care and protection, it shall \"in so far as is practicable, give due consideration, having regard to his age and understanding, to the wishes of the child\". <\/p><p>Section 24(b) of the Child Care Act 1991 also includes an explicit obligation on courts in care and protection cases to &quot;in so far as is practicable give due consideration having regard to his age and understanding, to the wishes of the child&quot;.<\/p><p>Section 9(4) in the agency Bill is stronger than the existing obligations in the Child Care Act because it places an obligation on the agency to seek out the views of the individual child when performing its functions under the Child Care Act and the Adoption Act.  This is important as a major failing uncovered in the child deaths report was the failure of social workers to properly consult with children in the care or in contact with the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p>It is disappointing, however, that this legal obligation pertains solely to the agency's functions under the Child Care Act and the Adoption Act.  The agency will be taking up the functions of the Family Support Agency and the education welfare board and will also be working with individual children, yet the obligation does not extend to these areas.<\/p><p>A 2011 report on children's rights commissioned by the Ombudsman for Children, analysing ten cases which came before the office, found that &quot;the individual children appeared to be largely invisible in the decision-making process&quot;.  In her 2012 annual report, the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, highlighted the lack of awareness among decision-makers of the detrimental impact that administrative decisions can have on children and their families.  She criticised how these decisions were made with little or no regard for children's rights noting: &quot;... in particular, the parameters of the child's best interests and the child's right to be heard were not used to guide administrative decision-making to any great extent, if at all&quot;.  Ms Logan cited cases involving a lack of access to education, separating children from their parents, and cases where children could not access necessary therapeutic equipment recommended by health professionals, due to bureaucratic processes. <\/p><p>It is important to ensure the administrative decisions taken by all agency employees impacting on individual children's lives will be covered by section 9.  As already stated, this should apply in all cases of very young children as well as non-verbal children.  While we acknowledge that it may be difficult to obtain these views, there is an onus on the agency to be proactive in seeking the views of the children concerned.<\/p><p>Individual practitioners may, as a matter of good practice, hear the view of the child and consider what is in the child's best interest.  However, under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, the Family Support Act 2001 or the Health Act 2004, there is no duty on practitioners to do so.  Examples of cases where the worker under the Bill has no legislative obligation to hear the views of the child, include an education welfare officer engaging with a lone parent in relation to her 13-year-old child's non-attendance at school, or a family support worker working with a homeless family who is faced with splitting up the family members in an effort to find them accommodation.<\/p><p>Those are some of the concerns that external organisations have concerning the Bill.  I will be happy to listen to the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500014#O00700","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386246000,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I wish to second Senator Cullinane's amendment.  He has comprehensively expressed his concerns about the importance of hearing the voice of the child.  Barnados feels that this aspect should be strengthened in line with best practice and in recognition that the agency will be working in a number of settings.  As users of the agency's services, children's views must be sought in planning and reviewing all the agency's functions and not just restricted to sections 8(1)(a),(b) and (c).  I accept that this is a difficult area because it depends on the age of the child.<\/p><p>While the concept is vague, naturally the child's view should be taken into consideration, particularly when a child is in a position to give his or her view.  We should also consider whether a guardian or parent could influence a child's point of view to the detriment of some other party involved.

Much evidence in respect of service provision will emerge from client feedback, participation in respect of reviewing how services are impacting on people, quality reviews and audits, of which we have a lot now.  For example, when HIQA does its current reviews, individual children and families are interviewed, as well as foster families.  HIQA talks directly to children and provides an up-to-date report on the experience of children in care.  We are seeing more and more of that.  Mr. Gordon Jeyes is working with children in care and those who have been in care in order to obtain continuous feedback about their experiences in the care system.  All of that is welcome.<\/p><p>  I take Senator Cullinane's point about the report of the Ombudsman for Children.  There is still a big cultural job to be done in the broadest sense in our schools.  We need to have more sensitivity concerning a range of services for children, including housing policy.  We should carefully examine the impact of issues, events and policies on children.  That general challenge should be increasingly met as the country becomes more child-centred.<\/p><p>  We now have the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i> or GAL system in court more frequently, which involves a central approach to what children and adolescents think, including their views on courts, access, custody and adoption.  That practice needs more development and judges themselves have spoken at legal seminars about how the judicial system needs to respond better to children's needs.  All of that is happening in parallel to what we are trying to do with this Bill.<\/p><p>  One section of the Bill states that in planning the provision of services in connection with the performance of functions a, b and c, the views of children must be considered.  That provision is very important.<\/p><p>  There is a problem about unintended consequences concerning this proposition.  On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, I changed the way this was formulated.  In the original draft of the Bill, and following feedback from NGOs, Members of the Oireachtas and others, it stated that the views of children would be listened to as part of any consultation. I have taken that out now and have broadened it, so that it gives a broader direction to the agency.  I agreed on reflection that the original term as drafted was too limiting.<\/p><p>  To avoid the problem of unintended consequences, we are suggesting that any organisation would be required by law to consult on all aspects of planning and reviewing the provision of services.  It could have an unintended effect of paralysing management decisions, diffusing responsibility for decisions taken, and delaying necessary change when responsiveness is critical.  I am working towards achieving the broad principle, but as I have outlined, that is one concern we have as regards the proposed amendment.<\/p><p>  The reference to consideration being given to the views of the child will ensure that the agency does so in carrying out its mandate.  That will also apply to each of the agencies involved, including the Family Support Agency, education welfare boards and child protection services.  In order to achieve a high quality of service, they must have a keen eye to the users of the service, namely, the children themselves.  Improvements in service provision have been contributed to and led by children.<\/p> <p>I expect this will continue in the new agency.  I am satisfied the section as drafted makes the child's voice more central to the proofing of decision-making and in that sense breaks new ground.  We are providing that the views of children should be taken into account but do not want to do so in a manner that could have unintended consequences.  There is an obligation on everybody working in the provision of these services, including in the Child and Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board, to do this.  There is a cultural issue here.  Every agency working with children needs to develop ways and means of listening to children.  For example, the involvement of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g with county managers in terms of putting ideas to them and other decision makers at a local level also forms part of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500015#P00400","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386246600,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I support the Minister's view that adoption of this amendment could have unintended consequences.

My difficulty is with the body corporate accepting gifts.  There is need for a mechanism under which there would be disclosure of and accountability for such gifts.  I am always concerned that a gift from a drinks or other inappropriate company could be accepted by the agency and that we, namely, the board, Minister or other appropriate authority, have no way of knowing this.  The amendment seeks to ensure such gifts are declared in the annual report of the agency.  Given the discussion we had on this issue on Committee Stage, we need to look more generally at disclosure obligations for body corporates.  We have done quite a lot of work in this regard on individual members and officeholders.<\/p><p>  As this is a matter related to legislation in general, I do not propose to press the amendment.

Section 19(2) reads that the Minister will appoint persons who have experience of and expertise in matters connected to the functions of the agency or matters connected to organisational governance, management or public administration.  The Bill does not specify the type of experience or expertise referred to in section 19(2).  Sinn F&eacute;in believes the inclusion of specified professional backgrounds would be beneficial to guard against inappropriate appointments.

The function of the board is to oversee the activities of the agency and, as such, the suggestion that the composition of the board should reflect each function of the agency is unnecessary and restrictive.  It would be important, for example, to have on the board experience in management, as well as expertise in human resources and communications.  I already have announced the membership of the Family Support Agency board that will oversee the transition to the Child and Family Agency and this will become the new board.  The calibre of its membership is very high and as the Senator is aware, it brings together highly qualified and experienced members with a range of high-level skills in the areas of child protection, family support and education, and critical areas such as public sector reform, corporate governance, financial management, communications and change management.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the Senator is not questioning the calibre of the current board membership or indeed my approach to the nominations but I refer to my own experience of other boards and the prescription of particular professions thereon.

Rather than looking at the overall goals of an agency, they have become reflective of particular interests as opposed to the overall challenge of the governance and running of the board.

Ritter, who I believe to be the authoritative source and is the author of <i>The Oxford Guide to Style<\/i>, published by Oxford University Press in 2002, in British English the spelling &quot;judgment&quot; is correct when referring to the formal ruling of a court or a judge, whereas the spelling &quot;judgement&quot; is used for other meanings.  I put it to the Minister that &quot;judgment&quot; is used exclusively for legal judgments handed down by the law and the correct spelling in this context requires an &ldquo;E&rdquo;.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the Minister can examine other legislation to ascertain whether this was done but I believe an opportunity exists to ensure absolute clarity and to prevent anyone from claiming subsequently that one can only look at a judge's formal ruling when considering the advice to be given to the Minister.  This amendment and amendment No. 31 will ensure clarity and I hope it is accepted by the Minister because Members facilitated the holding of Report Stage this week rather than next week as had been planned, to allow the Bill to revert to the D&aacute;il, if necessary.  I acknowledge it is quite a small issue but there is a chance to get it absolutely perfect.  Members have a chance to ensure absolute and utter clarity.  As I stated on Committee Stage, I have spoken to several legal people in this regard.

Section 58B(1) is clear and states: &quot;The Minister shall, after consultation with the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, make regulations for the purpose of securing the health, safety and welfare and promoting the development of children attending early years services.&quot;<\/p> <p>That could not be clearer - promoting the development of children attending early years services.  That is what the Senator and I want to see.  The quality issues have been neglected in the past and need to get more attention.  That is the reason we are taking action on the preschool quality agenda.  Section 58B captures fully the health, safety, welfare and promoting the development of children attending early years services.  For any providers who may have been speaking to Members who have any doubt - it is already set out in the regulations - we are making it even clearer here.  If any providers have any doubt that is an obligation, we already have regulations that are statutorily based where the challenge to promote the development of children attending early years service, applies to everybody who is working in the service.  This imperative is captured in the regulations in section 58B.  The inspectors will go out and inspect.  The regulations against which they will inspect are that the service has to be for the purpose of securing the health, safety, welfare and promoting the development of children attending early years services.  I assure Members that section 58B(1) applies to everybody who is working in the service and that it has general applicability.  It is laid out clearly that this is the standard that has to apply in terms of delivering those services and so it is already well-understood.<\/p><p>When discussing a previous Stage of the Bill, I was asked by, I think, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, to repeat the equality legislation in this Bill.  There is no need to repeat the equality legislation because it is already in place by statute.  In fact, one is raising the applicability of it by inserting it into another Bill.  It is taken that it applies to all legislation and other legislation has to be tested against it.  For that reason I did not accept that amendment.  I want to assure the Senator that promoting the development of children attending the early years services is statutorily reinforced in section 58B(1) and it applies across the board and to those being referred to - the duty of every person to take all reasonable measures to safeguard.  I understand the point the Senator is making but it is built in and named in the regulations and it has to be applied by all people working in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500018#S02600","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386248400,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Senator van Turnhout made her point very well.

We have all the historic reports of the failings in child protection and we are on a course to change that.

It has been extremely helpful and influential in terms of approaching the establishment of the agency.<\/p><p>In terms of what Senator Conway said about the changes in approach to legislation, the suggestions the Taoiseach has been making about having committee hearings at an earlier stage with experts is the way to go and it will give that kind of fluidity about which the Senator spoke and will probably be more satisfactory for everyone.  I hope the way I responded to the amendments today and the suggestions I made about how various issues can be taken further, will make a difference in terms of how the agency functions and that Senators' contributions will impact on the development of the work of the agency.  I thank the NGOs because prior to going into the D&aacute;il with the Bill, I published quite a number of amendments to it to capture some of the key points people felt were missing at the earlier stage.  <\/p><p>Accountability is a crucial part of the Bill.

Children and families and those in need of support, assistance, guidance and direction deserve the best service we can offer.

The Bill amends the Health Act 1970, as amended, principally section 45A and section 48A, to take account of the changes to the eligibility criteria for medical cards for persons aged 70 years and over, as announced in budget 2014.<\/p><p>The 2014 financial provision for the health services is &euro;13.66 billion, including &euro;397 million in capital expenditure.  This provision also includes savings measures amounting to &euro;666 million.  This is some &euro;360 million less than was provided in 2013, and represents a 3% reduction in funding.  As a result, 2014 will be the most challenging year the health services have yet had to face.  I assure the House, however, that maintaining safe, quality health services will be as much a priority for the Government in 2014 as it has been in 2013, despite the need for significant and difficult financial savings.  It has been, and most assuredly continues to be, our intention that front-line health services would be protected to the greatest extent possible, and I have made clear that providing safe, quality services in a timely fashion is my top priority.<\/p><p>We continue to build on the ongoing measures to achieve savings through efficiencies and reorganisation under the public service agreement, to curtail the growing cost of pharmaceuticals, and to increase income generation.  None the less, the level of savings required means the Government has had to make some very difficult decisions and all of us, personally, and as public representatives, are well aware of the vast impact of these difficult decisions forced upon us.  The Government continues to ensure we reduce the cost of services while maintaining safe services to ensure the most vulnerable are protected.<\/p><p>The General Medical Services, GMS, scheme, is one of the areas identified in budget 2014 for required savings.  As the Senators are aware, the GMS scheme comprises general practitioner, GP, services and prescription drugs, as well as some other services provided to holders of medical cards or GP-visit cards.  Over recent years there has been a significant expansion in the GMS scheme.  The GMS costs in the region of &euro;2 billion per year, and several steps are being taken to reduce this cost.  At the end of October 2013, approximately 1.99 million people qualified under the GMS.  Medical cards make up most of this number, amounting to 1.86 million or more than 93% of the total.  At the end of 2005, there were 1.16 million medical cardholders.  Since then has been an increase of more than 60% in the number of medical cards, amounting to 700,000 individuals.  In excess of 40% of the population now holds a medical card, compared with just 27% at the end of 2005.  Medical cards for persons aged 70 years and over account for approximately 350,000 individuals, or approximately 19% of all medical cards.  The total cost of the GMS provided to over-70s medical card holders is approximately &euro;750 million per year, which represents more than one third of the total cost of the GMS scheme.<\/p><p>Under the Health Act 2008, special eligibility rules applying to persons aged over 70 years were put in place which are more generous than those applying to the standard means-tested medical cards.  It is estimated that there are approximately 379,000 people aged over 70 years in the State.  Given that there are approximately 350,000 medical cards issued to people aged over 70, medical card coverage of the over-70s population is approximately 93%.  In comparison, the medical card coverage of the under-70s population is of the order of 36%.<\/p><p>In the recent budget, changes to the over-70s eligibility criteria were announced to deliver &euro;25 million in savings during 2014 from the expenditure on over-70s medical cards, which is in the region of &euro;750 million annually.  Under this proposed legislation, the income limit for an over-70s medical card is to be set at &euro;500 per week, equivalent to an annual income of about &euro;26,000, for a single person.  For a couple, the income limit for the over-70s medical card is to be set at &euro;900 per week, equivalent to gross annual income of almost &euro;47,000.<\/p><p>Those affected by these revised thresholds will qualify for an over-70s GP-visit card.  A single person aged over 70 with a gross income of up to &euro;700 per week, or approximately &euro;36,000 per year, will continue to qualify for free access to a GP.  A couple over 70 years of age with a gross income of up to &euro;1,400 per week, or approximately &euro;72,000 per year, also qualify for a GP service without fees.  In addition, under the drugs payment scheme, DPS, the HSE will meet the prescription drug costs of older people without a medical card who face drugs costs higher than the DPS threshold of &euro;144 per month.  This means that a single person aged over 70 with a gross income in excess of &euro;500 per week or a couple with an income in excess of &euro;900 per week will have to pay no more than approximately &euro;33 per week on prescription drugs.<\/p><p>It is estimated that approximately 35,000 people will have their medical card replaced with a GP-visit card under the new income rules.  It is necessary to reassure people in their 70s and older that we are implementing this measure in a manner that is intended to avoid affecting the most vulnerable of our elderly population.  Out of every five people aged over 70, the four poorest will not be affected by this budget measure.  Therefore, it is useful to note that 10% of those aged over 70 who previously qualified for a medical card will now qualify for a GP-visit card instead.  Every person aged over 70 living on the State pension alone will still qualify for an over-70s medical card.  The new income limits for over-70s medical care is more than twice the level of the basic State pension of &euro;230 per week for a single person and &euro;436 per week for a couple.  Therefore, following implementation of this budget measure, just 7% of over-70s, those with the highest incomes, will not qualify for either a medical card or a GP-visit card.  In other words, 93% of over-70s will continue to be covered for free GP care, either through a medical card, which would be the bulk of that group, or a GP-visit card.<\/p><p>As I stated, there has been a significant expansion in the GMS scheme and, while the rate of increase in the numbers of people with eligibility under the GMS scheme has declined, the overall number of people with eligibility has increased.  We must ensure those most in need can qualify for the service.  We have an obligation under the legislation to ensure the State is not paying for a service for those who are no longer entitled because their situation has improved.  To this end, a critical element of probity in the medical card scheme is the ongoing review of client eligibility by the HSE.  Senators are aware that, under budget 2014, medical card probity measures were announced whereby significant savings are to be achieved by improving the accuracy of the medical card system.  This is intended to ensure those who are entitled to medical cards continue to hold them and those who are not entitled to medical cards do not.<\/p><p>I am aware there has been public concern that cards may be indiscriminately withdrawn or cancelled.  This concern or perception is similar to the misconception that cards awarded on a discretionary basis are being withdrawn or refused arbitrarily.  This is not the case.  Let me put it on the record, to dispel any misconceptions that might still exist, that in line with the legislation, there has never been an automatic entitlement to a medical card on the basis of having a specific illness or condition, there has been no change to the policy on discretionary medical cards in the past year, the scheme continues to operate in such a way that those who suffer genuine financial hardship as a result of a medical condition receive the benefit of a medical card, and notwithstanding the need to secure savings under the medical card scheme, nobody who is entitled to a medical card will lose it or be refused one.  I stress again that no person meeting the eligibility conditions laid down in the legislation for a medical card will be affected.<\/p><p>We want people to be clear on their entitlements and this should help ease the fears of those who have been worried unnecessarily.  To this end, the HSE devised a wide-ranging plan to improve the provision of information to the public about medical cards.  On 30 October last, the HSE announced a communications campaign designed to raise awareness of the rules governing eligibility for medical cards.  This is just one example of how this Government is focused on improving the health service.  While it may not be affordable to provide medical cards to the entire population, this Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees within its term of office as set out in the programme for Government and in the Future Health strategy framework.<\/p> <p> The introduction of a universal GP service free at point of use constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme and the introduction of universal health insurance.  A universal GP service will underpin the delivery of health care close to people in their communities, at the lowest levels of complexity and at the lowest levels of cost.  This is a critical step on the road to universal health insurance and eliminating the two-tier health system.<\/p><p>As announced in the budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service free at point of use by ensuring that all children aged five years and under will have access to a GP service without fees.  New additional funding of &euro;37 million has been ring-fenced by the Government to fund this new initiative so that it does not draw on resources for the medical card scheme.  Including the 93% coverage of the over-70s population, this additional coverage of those under six will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  This Government is committed to achieving the goal of a universal GP service before the spring of 2016.<\/p><p>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the views of Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500021#W00300","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386250200,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, and thank him for coming to the House.

While I know the Minister of State was a very welcome and excellent colleague in this House at the time, it is impossible to consider this legislation without assessing the response of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and others who are in government now in terms of their narrative at the time that a much more generous eligibility criteria was being considered.  I recall people in the Opposition almost fighting with one another to get up on the truck on Kildare Street outside Leinster House to speak to the very considerable number of elderly people who had gathered in protest at what was a wrong initiative by the then Government in terms of adjusting the eligibility criteria.  There was a row-back from that position, as we know, to an eligibility limit of some &euro;1,400 for a couple and half of that for an individual.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, was the player with the starring role among the Opposition at that time.  He said:<blockquote>...those are the people who made this country what it is today ... They raised us, nursed us when we were sick, protected us from violence, grew our food and ran a proud Civil Service.  This decision is morally wrong and the people of the country know it.<\/blockquote>At that time, 2008, the now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Gilmore, spoke on the lorry outside about how people had protested for civil liberties in the 1960s, for tax equalisation in the 1980s and were now rightly protesting for fair eligibility for medical cards.  The current Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said, &quot;Shame on you.  Shame on you.  Shame on you&quot;, and that was in regard to a more generous eligibility criteria of some &euro;1,400 at the time.<\/p><p>  On top the 20,000 cards that were taken away over the course of this year due to the budgets, and even though the Taoiseach has lately said no more than 3% would be affected by any change to the criteria, which would be only some 11,000 cards in total, the reality is that in the region of 35,000 people over the age of 70 are set to lose their cards.  One wonders what has changed.  In the House earlier we were celebrating the relatively welcome development of <i>Forbes <\/i>highlighting Ireland as one of the best places in the world to do business, according to its metrics and tables, and both sides of the House acknowledged the encouraging signs in terms of employment and also income tax returns, of which I spoke earlier today.  The net gain to Government of this measure is some &euro;25 million in savings, although we are &euro;520 million ahead of schedule up to November, at a time when no more than one sixth of our total tax take is catered for.  Despite these surpluses, I acknowledge we are coming from a very low base and that there is debt we would like to eat into, which we will be able to do next week with the benefit of Bank of Ireland giving us back &euro;2 billion.  Surely, however, when there is some leeway, figures can be adjusted and we can look at this and decide that, while we know we must make savings, this will bite hard, so let us look at not doing it.  Let us say: &quot;We will be able to take this &euro;25 million from another area because the relative health and protection of those over 70 is extremely important to us.&quot;<\/p><p>  As I said, in 2008 the then Opposition participated in the anger and the narrative of the justifiable protests of the day, at a time when the limit was &euro;1,400 per week.  Now, it is down to &euro;900 and, in effect, we are going to crystallise a discriminatory measure in this Bill whereas, historically, the practice has always been that if it was &euro;700 for an individual, it was twice that for a couple, which is &euro;1,400.  Instead, this time it will be &euro;500 for an individual but &euro;900 for a couple, thus discriminating against those people who happen to be lucky enough to have a loving relationship in a marriage for a lifetime.  One wonders why this is the case.<\/p><p>  I appreciate this is all about the fight for resources.  We had a good debate in the House last night on mental health, always the poor relation, I would argue, in terms of the cuts, in that when it comes to the budget, that is money to be ring-fenced until such time as it is needed, but we then pull it out again and it is no longer ring-fenced.  When it comes to the less well-off, the over-70s and children, we really ought to be prepared to push that boat out a little further, particularly given the information coming our way in the last week is encouraging in terms of additional resources becoming available.<\/p><p>  There is an element of gimmickry on the issue of the under-fives.  I have children under five who will get free GP care, and, of course, I will take it.  However, should I be eligible for it?  No, I probably should not as I am on &euro;65,000 a year.  A very small percentage of the public service is on that kind of wage, and some are on significantly more than that, not least the Minister of State, officials and so on.  This is the case throughout the country.  We have often mentioned known wealthy people and, in jest, said we do not want to be providing free GP care to people who have many millions, and so on.  I am not sure we have the element of joined-up thinking and the whole-health service approach for which the Minister of State would probably yearn, although I realise there are a lot of difficulties within that.<\/p><p>  I believe this measure is wrong.  If we read back and assess the responses at the time of the then Opposition, I believe what they said was justified at that time and is no less justified today, except from a financial position.  The Minister of State will recall that at the time, although I was finance spokesman in this House, I would not hold back when it came to criticising my own Government, particularly on health matters.  We have a different set of financial circumstances now that are arguably much stronger than they were at the time.  If one wanted to be party political about it, those opposite will say it is all because of their great work over the past two and a half years, which would be a bit naive on the basis that the late Brian Lenihan took major decisions at the time.<\/p><p>  It is Second Stage.  This is something we do not have to do.  The figures ought to allow, in a discussion with the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, that the Government should not have to do this, in particular given the more positive situation.  This is notwithstanding the unpublished Labour Party policy of looking at those earning an income of over &euro;100,000, who were conditioned over the last two budgets to give a little bit more but were not touched.  Those people could still give a little more.  For the relative health and security of our elderly and our children, that could and should be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500022#X00400","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1386250800,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This Bill amends the qualifying criteria for medical cards for the over 70s, but it needs to be put in perspective, in that, when the scheme was introduced, there were free medical cards for everyone aged over 70 years without a consideration of the cost.  Nursing home care was one such cost.  As far back as 1976, the Maud McInerney High Court case defined nursing home care as falling under the qualifying criteria for medical cards.  Therefore, if one had a medical card, one was entitled to free nursing home care.  As a result, the introduction of the medical card for all over 70s created problems, in that it subsequently led to the Department needing to pay out nearly &euro;500 million in the refund of nursing home charges.<\/p><p>My colleague on the other side of the House, Senator MacSharry, has referred to the hit and miss approach to adjusting policy.  We want to introduce a planned policy over a number of years.  We are putting in place a regulation covering the qualifying criteria for people with incomes.  It is not about removing medical cards.  People have an entitlement to a GP card.<\/p><p>Another issue that has been left out of this debate is the cost of medication.  A major effort has been made in recent months to reduce the cost of generic medicines.  The situation that used to obtain showed the unplanned approach that had been adopted in the preceding ten years.  Some 18% of our pharmaceuticals are generic, whereas the figure in other European countries is as high as 70%.  The cost of medicines has been unrestricted for a long time.  If someone has a GP-only card, the maximum price that he or she must pay is &euro;144 per month, after which he or she is entitled to a refund.  It is important that we keep this in mind.  It is not the case that every item a person gets for free will suddenly start costing the full amount.<\/p><p>Since the Government entered into office, 254,000 additional medical cards have been issued, increasing from 1.7 million, including GP-only cards, to 2.001 million in June.  This figure has changed somewhat in the past two or three months, but it is a significant number, representing 43% of the population.<\/p><p>Some 35,000 people will be affected, but 49% of the population will have a medical card or a GP-only card after we introduce the GP-only card for children aged under six years.  This is a significant step on the part of the State.  Despite the economic pressures, we can look after people who no longer have the level of income that they previously enjoyed.  We have been decisive in giving this level of support in recent years.  We have specifically set aside &euro;37 million to budget for the cards for children aged under six years.<\/p><p>The Department of Health has taken all of the right steps in the past two years.  One cannot change budgetary management overnight, but significant efforts have been made, particularly in the past 12 months.  In an unplanned way, we allowed the cost of drugs to increase from more than &euro;570 million in 2000 to more than &euro;2 billion a year ago.  Now, a serious plan is in place to reduce the cost of medication and, therefore, the cost of health care for the taxpayer, allowing us to increase the level of services provided.<\/p><p>The Bill is a step in the right direction and ensures that we take a planned, rather than piecemeal, approach.  A mistake was made between 2000 and 2010, in that many policy changes did not form part of a planned approach.  We have set out our health care plan for the next five to ten years.  It is a question of achieving changes.<\/p><p>A point I highlighted at a meeting of the health committee has since taken on a life of its own.  I raised it on 17 October, having submitted a question in September.  It concerns the budget we are paying non-HSE and non-departmental organisations, which amounts to &euro;3.27 billion or 25% of the overall budget.  This expenditure has not been subjected to significant scrutiny during the past ten or 15 years.  It is as if there were no limits.  Now, the Department is examining it carefully.  Last week, I tabled an Adjournment matter at which the Department again confirmed that it had written to the section 39 organisations asking them to comply with pay policy so that the same levels of pay might apply in those organisations as apply to equivalent posts in the HSE.  This welcome development shows that the Minister of State, Deputy White, his colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and departmental officials are dealing with the health budget in a more planned and structured way.  As a result, there will be a benefit for the taxpayer and people who are entitled to supports.  We will also be able to expand those supports.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for attending, for introducing this legislation and for ensuring through it that the most vulnerable, for example, people with low levels of income, are looked after.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500023#Y00100","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1386250800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

It was easy to be generous during the good times.<\/p><p>I will not attempt to cover all of the figures supplied, as there are too many.  I will touch on a particular one, that of the General Medical Services, GMS, scheme, which costs &euro;2 billion per year.  From where will we get this money?  We must make adjustments.  More than 40% of people currently hold medical cards, compared with 27% only six years ago.  This shows how we can get into habits and assume that they can continue.  We must balance the books.  I will not spend more time on this point.<\/p><p>In general terms, I agree with the principle that those who have more money should pay more, but I get exasperated when the State claims it cannot, for example, means test child benefit.  I do not understand it.  It is absurd that wealthy people receive such benefits, resulting in the Government needing to find savings elsewhere.  Senator MacSharry discussed this issue easily, hopefully regarding himself.<\/p><p>While I believe that the measures in the Bill are a relatively small step in the right direction, we must ensure fairness.

If the income limit for a single person is &euro;500, why is it not &euro;1,000 for a couple?  I do not understand that and would welcome an explanation in this regard.

Even though it is only a technical amendment it is a fairly important one, not least in terms of the potential it offers to the Opposition to make mischief and scaremonger the very people they purport to protect.  The temptation also exists for the Opposition to conflate, as Senator MacSharry has already done, this technical amendment with many other things that are happening in terms of reform of the health services, including free GP care for children under six and the many other concerns which people have about health service reductions.<\/p><p>As stated by the Minister of State, a safe, quality health service despite reductions in spending must be to the fore of everybody's mind.  As identified by the Minister of State, the cost of the general medical services scheme is in excess of &euro;2 billion per annum, which is an incredible amount of money.  This &euro;2 billion combined with the &euro;3.8 billion, which as stated by Senator Burke is provided to the section 38 agencies, amounts to more than half the entire spend of the health service.  This indicates the level and scale of the problem facing the Minister.  If we cannot balance the books, savings have to be made.  Regardless of from where savings in the bigger spending Departments are sought by Government, there will be pain involved.  <\/p><p>Some 1.86 million people are now entitled to a medical card.  This means there has been a 60% increase in this regard in recent years.  As stated by Senator Quinn, 43% of the population of this country meet the medical card eligibility criterion.  In 2008, the qualifying eligibility for a medical card was greatly expanded.  Some people would say that the extension of eligibility for a medical card to all people over 70 years of age may not have been based on medical evidence.  Some people would go as far as saying that there were perhaps other considerations foremost in the then Minister's mind that again were not based on medical evidence.  We could seek evidence as to whether there is any support for that contention.  I believe there might well be.  The then Minister massively under-calculated the number of people who would be eligible, resulting in an immensely unplanned spend in this area.  As stated by Senator Burke, planning and certainty are key in the delivery of any services.  He also referred to other initiatives in respect of which a previous Minister did no planning, including the nursing home refunds scheme.  When asked about this issue in committee, the then Minister put the blame on his officials.  Current officials need have no fear in this regard as this Government will happily accept responsibility in respect of any planning undertaken by it, including any negativity arising in that regard.<\/p><p>Approximately 7% of those who are better off in Irish society will be affected by the change in the eligibility criterion for medical cards.  Under this Bill, to be ineligible for a medical card a person must be in receipt of a pension of approximately &euro;24,000.  The threshold in this regard for a couple is &euro;47,000.  I understand that in this regard 35,000 people will be affected, which is a substantial amount of people.  However, fairness being the underpinning value of everything this Government intends to do, it is fair, if unpalatable, to ask the better off in our society to contribute a little more.  This has been said by Members on all sides.  To say that the Government is reducing eligibility in this area is true.  To say that it dislikes doing so is also true and to say that it is necessary is also true.  <\/p><p>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's Second Stage response and to engaging further with him on the Bill on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500024#Z00200","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1386251400,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Under this Bill, more people over 70 will lose their medical cards and fewer will qualify when they reach the age of 70.  Prior to 2008, people over 70 received a medical card without a means test.  When the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government decided to end that entitlement, the current Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, then Fine Gael health spokesperson, described it as a &quot;vicious attack&quot; and a &quot;savage assault on the elderly&quot;.  We then had the Fianna-F&aacute;il led Government's climbdown in the face of mass protest.  The 2008 legislation set the income limit for over-70s medical card qualification at &euro;700 per week for a single person and &euro;1,400 for a couple.  In response to that proposal then Deputy Reilly said it was a &quot;desperate climbdown&quot;<i><\/i>and that &quot;their tinkering with income limits is nowhere near good enough&quot;.  Since then, Deputy Reilly has become Minister for Health.  Has the hardship for older citizens lessened since that day in 2011 when he received his ministerial seal of office?  It most definitely has not.  Is the removal of medical cards any less an attack on them now than it was in 2008?  It most definitely is not.  The only difference is that Deputy Reilly is now the Minister for Health and different standards must apply according to him and the Government.<\/p><p>  Under budget 2013, the income limit for over-70s medical card qualification was decreased from &euro;700 per week to &euro;600 for a single person and from &euro;1,400 per week to &euro;1,200 for a couple.  It seems that tinkering with income limits is good enough when it is this Government that is doing the tinkering.  This Bill proposes a further reduction in the income limits to &euro;500 per week for a single person and &euro;900 per week for a couple.  The fear expressed by elderly people that once a means test was introduced and the income limits had been set very high, it would be a slippery slope to more elderly people losing their cards was real.  It is expected that some 35,000 older citizens will lose their medical cards as a result of this change.  As stated by Age Action Ireland:<blockquote><i><\/i>It is contradictory to be removing means-tested cards from a section of society which has high medical needs, in a budget which is rolling out free GP care for children and heralding it as the roll out of its universal primary care plans.<i><\/i><\/blockquote>Prescription charges for all medical card holders have been increased to five times the original charge per item introduced by former Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, a measure  Fine Gael and the Labour Party vehemently opposed in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This increase hits older people badly.  The changes introduced in this Bill, taken together with the abolition of the telephone allowance and the prescription charges increase, make budget 2014 a particularly nasty one for older people.  I remind the Government that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, championed Fine Gael's fair care health policy with its promise of universal primary care.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party received record mandates in the general election of 2011, with manifestos that promised greatly extended and then universal entitlement to free primary care.  The programme for Government states that universal primary care will do away with fees for GP care and will be introduced within this Government's term of office.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, promised that the first phase of this, namely, extension of free primary care to claimants of free drugs under the long-term illness scheme would be in place in summer 2012 but it was not.  There were supposed to be drafting difficulties because of the change from entitlement based on income to entitlement based on forms of illness.  In the autumn of last year we were told by the Minister that it was still on track and a Bill in this regard would be introduced.<\/p><p>  When the Health (Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) (No. 1) Bill, came before us last March, there was no Bill to extend free primary care in any way.  Instead, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, had come full circle, from IMO opponent of over-70s universality to IMO beneficiary of it, to vociferous D&aacute;il opponent of change to it and to now imposing a further restriction to the scheme, leading to thousands of older people losing their medical cards.<\/p> <p>The Bill further restricts access and cuts 35,000 medical cards.  When they were in opposition, both Fine Gael and the Labour Party pointed out that restricting access to primary care was penny wise and pound foolish because older people would suffer poorer health outcomes and require more hospital visits, inpatient care and residential nursing home care.  Now, they are further restricting medical card access as a so-called savings measure that will adversely affect the health of older citizens.  It is another smooth transition from Fianna F&aacute;il to Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  There is not a hair's breadth between them.  One simply cannot see the difference.  We are told the difference is that the Government has provided for free universal GP care for children aged five years and under.  I welcome that measure, as far as it goes, but if it is not part of a clear programme of extension of free GP care to all, with a limited timetable, it might actually undermine the principle of universality.  If the Government was genuinely pursuing a policy of universality and a single tier health service with access based on medical need alone, it would have Sinn F&eacute;in's support.  However, that is not the case.  There might be members of the Labour Party who delude themselves into believing they are pursuing such a path, but it is far from the position of Fine Gael in the Government.<\/p><p>A total of &euro;37 million is to be spent on GP cards for children aged five years and under, but &euro;149 million is to be taken from the medical card budget.  It is robbing Peter to pay Paul.  We are giving some people a medical card, but we are taking it away from older people and have seen what is happening with discretionary medical cards.  That is the reality and no amount of spin on the part of the Government will counter it.  The reason more people qualify for medical cards is there are more people unemployed and in low income jobs than has been the case for a number of years.  That is the reality and why more people need and should have medical cards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500024#Z00300","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386252000,"counter":257,"content":"<p>The last speaker said there was no difference between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.

That is a major difference.  There is a plan, towards which we are working as a goal.  Nonetheless, nobody wishes to see reductions, particularly in eligibility for medical cards for people over 70 years of age.  However, one point must be made repeatedly.

It has been glossed over by the Opposition in this debate, but it is a very important support for the elderly.  I have spoken to many people who depend on their GP for advice and support when they are worried about an aspect of their health.  Free GP services which are part of primary care services ensure there will be no barriers to accessing care.  They will ensure early detection of health issues and prevent them from becoming more complex and expensive to deal with and, more importantly, becoming a worry for the individual in terms of consultant visits and hospital care if medical conditions are allowed to get out of hand.  The provision of free GP care is very important from that point of view and the matter should not be glossed over or dismissed as the Government ignoring the elderly because it is not.  It is also making provision for children under six years of age.  The introduction of these measures in the recent budget will ensure 93% of the population aged over 70 years will have cover.  Combined with the coverage of children aged under six years, this means that half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  It is a significant improvement and I commend the Minister for it.  He is very committed to the provision of primary care, which is essential in preventing a medical condition from getting out of control.  Free GP care provision will be very important in that context.<\/p><p>It is important to mention that this country looks after and respects its elderly.  The income limits for people over 70 years of age are considerably greater than those for somebody aged 65.  There are also the taxation measures for people over 70 years.  The treatment of income from capital in terms of savings or investments is exempt where the value of the capital does not exceed &euro;36,000 for an individual or &euro;72,000 for a couple.  There is also free travel, as well as a free television licence.  I acknowledge that the telephone allowance was removed in the budget, but that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has increased funding for alarm systems is welcome.  These measures are in recognition of the fact that elderly people living alone must be supported in their communities.<\/p><p>While nobody likes removing any provision, the point must repeatedly be made that only 7% of people aged over 70 years, a very small number, will not have access to a medical card or free GP care after the enactment of this legislation.  I wish the Minister well in his work in ensuring that by 2016 we will have access to the best primary health care facilities in the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500025#AA00400","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1386252000,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their contributions.  Very interesting points were raised in the course of the debate.<\/p><p>I will start by referring to two points made by Senator Deirdre Clune.  On the extent to which the Government has acted in a proportionate way in its actions in respect of eligibility for people over 70 years, the Senator brought a measure of balance to the debate by pointing out, as I have many times, that 93% of all persons over the age of 70 years will continue to have access to their GPs without fees.  A somewhat lower figure, 85%, have access to a full medical card.  If Senators pass this measure and it is enacted, 85% of all citizens over 70 years of age will still have a full medical card, while a further 8% will have a GP card.  That gives a total of 93% who will have access without fees to their GPs.<\/p><p>The second point made by the Senator was on the importance of access to a GP without the barrier of fees.  The bedrock of a universal primary care system is that we remove the barrier of fees for attending one's doctor.  Senator David Cullinane queried how serious the Government and I were in this respect.  We are very serious.  It is not just a gimmick, as Senator Marc MacSharry suggested; it is not just something that is desirable in its own right, as it is, it is also a necessity.  No country in the world and no taxation or health insurance system will be able to fund and sustain a modern health system unless it adjusts towards primary care provision.  That is a fact.  Let us consider the experiences of any country in the provision of health care and the challenge presented in dealing with chronic illnesses.  We live in a completely different world from the world of 20 or 30 years ago in terms of what we must do in the health service.  There are massive challenges presented by diabetes, cardiovascular illnesses and so forth which demand that we refocus our attention on preventive strategies.  They can only be carried out in primary care settings.<\/p> <p>We must gradually shift resources out of the acute services in order to ensure that we address the challenges of the present and the future in a proper way.<\/p><p>The primary care strategy of 2001 that Senator MacSharry's colleague, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, introduced, was a very good document.  It set out a lot of the challenges that the then Government saw.  The challenges still exist.  We have made progress towards addressing them but not anything like enough progress.  We have experienced times of serious financial constraint and this means that we have been limited in what we can do about them.  I do not accept Senator Cullinane's suggestion that we take with one hand and give with the other.  This is a time when we must make savings and balance the books.  However, we must also have a vision for the future and put aside some money to invest in the future for the health of all our citizens.  We can only do so by adjusting towards primary care.  In my respectful view, the system will literally not sustain itself unless we do so.  It is a necessity.  I do not stand here as a politician just expressing a whim when I say that we must remove the barrier of fees charged when one attends a GP.  There is a lot of evidence that proves that even relatively well off people will not go to their doctor because fees ranging between &euro;50, &euro;60 or whatever act as a disincentive.  We must remove the commercial relationship between the citizen or patient and his or her doctor.  It is a progressive move that we must achieve.<\/p><p>First, a good place to start would be extending free GP cover to those under 6 years of age.  Senator Cullinane will recall that the programme for Government outlined a route that would commence with long-term illness people and then move to high tech drugs.  Last May the Taoiseach made a very clear statement that we were looking at a better and faster way to achieve that goal.<\/p><p>We have dealt with the matter in the Chamber before.  One could have regulations instead of having complex legislation that would set out the base upon which one would give a GP card to people who have various illnesses or conditions, and all of the attendant complications and cumbersome legislation and regulations that would apply.  One could have regulations that stipulated that the diagnostic basis of asthma and the different forms of cancer that qualify for a medical card.  On examination these matters are far more complicated than initially thought.  It is fair to admit that they are far more complicated than they looked to the people who, with the best will in the world, compiled the programme for Government.  We have examined a different route.  The under-6s provision is an interim measure that has been criticised by Senator MacSharry and others as a gimmick.  It is not a gimmick because it cannot be one.  It must be part of the implementation of full access for the entire population to GP services without the barrier of fees.  I ask colleagues to reconsider.  There is no other area of public policy where it is more urgent that we work together than on the future configuration of the health services and their funding.  Universal primary care is an absolutely essential in order for us to achieve that goal.  <\/p><p>Senator MacSharry criticised the measure but he did not attack it.  He raised the issue about the wisdom of universality and gave himself as an example as someone who has young children and is perhaps better off.  People on relatively low incomes cannot qualify for a medical card.  Oddly enough, there are people on low to middle incomes who would not pass the incomes limits set for a medical card and Senators will know that from their work as politicians.  Therefore, it is far from a case of us satisfying millionaires or people who are well off by providing a medical card for children aged under 6.  The measure will help families on low and middle incomes but some people who are millionaires or very wealthy will also benefit.<\/p><p>That leads me back to the tried and tested debate on universality.  I ask Senator MacSharry and others present to consider the following.  We never argue about all children having access to primary education.  We do not means test access to primary education because we regard it as an absolute bedrock entitlement of every child, irrespective of the income of parents.  Immunisation is another example.  There is a range of fundamental rights and entitlements for all children in the State and health care ought to be one of them.

Senator Colm Burke rightly praised the Government's planned approach to reforms.  As I have said and shall repeat, my vision of universal primary care is one of full universal access to GP care without fees.  It should be the norm for the entire population.  However, there will still be a proportion of the population who will need funding for their drugs, and in many cases full funding for their drugs.  I think that there will still be a necessity to maintain the drugs payment scheme.<\/p><p>As Senator Colm Burke pointed out, there is a limit of &euro;144 per month.  I shall engage in the following debate without signalling a policy intention.  There may be a case for an interim entitlement that ranges somewhere between &euro;144 and having completely free drugs.  There might be a better graduation in terms of what we can do for people.  That is something that we would need to examine in the future and I look forward to debating the matter here.  <\/p><p>Senator Quinn also raised the issue of universal access.  I have addressed the matter but I am sure that I can return to it again.  He raised the issue of differential treatment of a couple and a single person and I can explain the rationale for doing so.  The living costs of an individual living alone are more than half the living costs of a couple living together.  It is the Government's view, and appears to be the case, that expenditure does not necessarily diminish relative to the number of people in the household.  There are economies of scale and I hope that I have used the term correctly.  In that context, the over-70s income limit for a single person has been reduced proportionately less than the income limit for a couple.<\/p><p>The differential concept is not new or an isolated example but is evident in other areas of public policy.  For example, the State pension is &euro;230 per week for an individual and &euro;436 per week for a couple; the provision of the living alone increase - an extra payment for people on social welfare pensions who live alone; differential income limits apply for medical cards for persons under 70 years between individuals and couples; and in the assessment for supplementary welfare allowance, a differential applies whereby the rate for a dependent qualified adult is not half the personal rate of the applicant.  Finally, the Insolvency Service of Ireland guidelines used various scenarios but a significant extra sum was not allowed per month, after tax and PRSI, for a couple compared with a single person.  This differential treatment of a couple and a single person is not unique.  <\/p><p>Senator Gilroy made some interesting points and observations.<\/p> <p>I would certainly accept the point that there is no cut in an area like health, or virtually none of which I can think, where one could say there was no problem associated with it or there was not some adverse impact or pain, which was the word used.  The objective of a progressive and a caring Government is to ensure we minimise that adverse impact and do what we need to do in as fair a manner as is at all possible.  <\/p><p>I think Senator Cullinane made the point that we are introducing the under six measure but are changing the eligibility in regard to over 70s.  If the Seanad agrees to this measure, no one will lose GP access because anyone who loses their full medical card as a consequence of this measure will have a GP card - without quibble.  There is no question of a new application regime or otherwise, so it is not inconsistent with universal access to GP care.  If we were taking anybody out of free GP access, a case could be made that it was inconsistent.  Giving it to some and taking it from others would be inconsistent and we would stand to be criticised on that but that is not what we are doing.  We are not taking free GP access from a single citizen as a consequence of the measure we propose to the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500026#BB01300","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1386253200,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 24; N\u00edl, 10.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Aideen Hayden and Michael Mullins; N\u00edl, Senators Thomas Byrne and Marc MacSharry.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500027#CC00200","aye":["1148","1157","1138","1150","1114","1165","1124","1158","1130","1160","1117","1172","1174","1134","1118","1187","1153","1170","1129","1125","1145","1163","1171","1143"],"nay":["1116","1133","1119","1140","1149","1128","1139","1122","1123","1154"]},{"type":"speech","time":1386253500,"counter":276,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500028#DD00100","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1386253500,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500028#DD00200","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1386253500,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 10 December 2013.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1386253500,"counter":279,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500028#DD00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1386253500,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday at 2.30 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500028#DD00500","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adjournment Matters","time":1386253500,"counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500028#DD00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Appeals","time":1386253500,"counter":282,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500028#DD00650"},{"type":"speech","time":1386253500,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, and thank him for taking the Adjournment debate.  A few days ago I was contacted by a mother who recently learned that her son's medical card was to be removed with effect from 30 November 2013.  We have had many debates on medical cards but this case is important to highlight as it is affecting many other families with children who have special needs.<\/p><p>The boy in question is two years of age and has had a medical card since he was three months old.  He was born in 2011.  The medical card was up for review last month and the family's means were deemed too great to be granted the continuation of their son's medical card.  This family has yet to receive the letter withdrawing the medical card but I contacted the Department of Health and was told their son's medical card has been withdrawn and that a letter was sent to the family on 25 November.<\/p><p>The child in question has a very serious condition, hydrocephalus, for which he has a shunt.  He cannot walk, talk or feed himself.  He attends numerous doctors and specialists including neurosurgeons, specialists in eye clinics, paediatricians, dietician, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and speech and language therapist.  As evidenced by this list, this child's level of care and intervention needs are very high and would be a substantial financial burden on this family were it not for the medical card.  For example, last May he needed his shunt reviewed and it was discovered that he required immediate brain surgery which cost thousands of euro.  Additional costs include medication such as the anti-seizure medication he needs to take regularly, the specialist shoes and splints that cost hundreds of euro and the specialist equipment required to aid him in sitting and standing and encourage him to walk.<\/p><p>On paper this family might appear to be able to cope with the financial burden of a chid with substantial special needs but reality tends to be much different from what is assessed on paper.  In the coming months this family will welcome a new little brother or sister to their family, which will add to the pressures they already experience.  I cannot help but believe this young child will regress without the appropriate level of support provided by the medical card.  It is because the State has provided a medical card for this young boy that he has achieved all he has to date.  If the medical card is taken from him we would do him a major disservice and send the wrong message to the family.  The boy's mother is distraught at the thought of losing the medical card.  While she understands the family might be above the financial threshold, the cost they would pay for services for their son greatly outweighs their income.<\/p><p>This opens up the wider area of medical card discretion for children with significant special needs.  I have addressed the Minister on this before.  This mother, like other mothers of children with special needs, must fight to get the services she needs for her child.  The withdrawal of the medical card is an added burden.  She said she would be better off leaving her job and going on social protection because she would then be eligible for the medical card.  I cannot understand that logic when we want people working and being able to provide the best for their children.<\/p><p>I plead with the Minister to examine this particular case and the wider issue of discretionary medical cards.<\/p> <p>Every case is completely separate.  The expenses I have outlined do not take into consideration other child care costs if there is a new addition to the family.  This child and family desperately need the medical card to provide the best outcome for the child in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500028#DD00700","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386253800,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Moran for raising this issue.<\/p><p>By the end of October last, there were over 1,860,000 medical cards issued by the Health Service Executive, HSE.  This represents an increase of over 60% in the number of medical cards, or 700,000 individuals, since the end of 2005.  Over 40% of the national population now holds a medical card, compared to 27% at the end of 2005.<\/p><p>Under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  The 1970 Health Act provides that medical cards are awarded to people who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for themselves and their family.  The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its medical card national assessment guidelines.<\/p><p>If an applicant's means are above the financial thresholds set out in the national guidelines, the HSE examines for any indication of circumstances, medical or social, which might result in undue financial hardship.  Eligibility may be granted on a discretionary basis if these circumstances are such that a person cannot access general practitioner or other medical services without undue financial hardship.  In these cases, social and medical issues are considered when determining whether or not undue financial hardship exists for the individual in accessing general practitioner or other medical services.<\/p><p>Discretion will be assessed automatically during the processing of an application where the applicant has provided additional information, which can be considered for discretion by staff or a medical officer, where appropriate.  However, even in the event that additional information was not provided initially with an application, families can still provide other additional information for consideration on a discretionary basis following receipt of the correspondence indicating an unsuccessful decision.  The HSE has a clinical panel of specialist medical professionals to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards, where a person exceeds the income guidelines but there are difficult personal circumstances, such as an illness.<\/p><p>With regard to the specific case to which the Senator refers, I have been advised by the HSE that, on 29 August 2013, a review notice was sent to the parents in respect of the medical card held by their son which was due to expire on 30 November 2013.  An application was received from the family on 22 October 2013 which was incomplete and which required additional information on the family's weekly income and outgoings.  In this regard, a letter requesting this information issued to the family on 25 October 2013.<\/p><p>The assessment found that the family's weekly income was above the national guidelines threshold for a medical card and a general practitioner visit card.  The application was then referred to a medical officer for review under the processes I outlined above for consideration on a discretionary basis.  Following this review, there was no recommendation to change the unsuccessful status of the application.<\/p><p>I am advised that the family was so informed by letter dated 25 November 2013.  This letter included a financial statement and also outlined the options open to the family, namely to submit additional information to the HSE for a reassessment or to appeal the decision to the HSE appeals office.<\/p><p>I understand that an appeal has not been received by the appeals office.  That may be explained by what Senator Moran outlined.  The family concerned has 21 days to submit an appeal to the decision not to renew the medical card.  Once the HSE primary care reimbursement service is informed of the appeal by the appeals office, the card previously held is reactivated pending the outcome of the appeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013120500029#EE00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1386253800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply but I am disappointed when one examines the individual circumstances of this case.
