This integrated rail network will provide a core, high-capacity transit system for the region and will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Drogheda, Maynooth, Celbridge\/Hazelhatch and Greystones.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0remaining element of the overall DART Expansion Programme -\u00a0the DART Underground Tunnel -\u00a0is not scheduled for delivery within the period of the present NDP.\u00a0 However, over that time, it is envisaged that the route for the proposed project will be established and protected to allow for its future delivery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200061#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Healthy Living Strategies","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200061#WRD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[25318\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200061#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the way in which efforts to promote the daily mile in schools are progressing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1246","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>I consider that the Daily Mile initiative, which originated in Scotland about five years ago, can make an important contribution to the challenge of\u00a0increasing the levels of physical activity in primary school children.

and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":216,"content":"<p>Following\u00a0a period of reduced transport usage and suppressed transport growth during the economic recession, Ireland's transport activity and demand has been growing again and is expected to expand further in future years in line with forecast economic growth rates. This higher demand is\u00a0evidenced in the NTA&rsquo;s recent published Bus &amp;amp; Rail Statistics bulletin that shows a percentage growth of PSO passenger journeys in the Dublin Region at 21.1% and 23.4% for Dublin Bus and Luas respectively between 2013 and 2017. In 2017 alone Dublin Bus carried 136.26 million passenger journeys and\u00a0Luas carried 37.65 million. While these figures are encouraging, they highlight why the major investment in public transport outlined in the recently published National Development Plan (NDP) 2018-2027 is needed to respond appropriately to this growth and to address the congestion problems of the Dublin region.<\/p>  <p>  A number of key investment priorities across the Dublin region are set out in the NDP which will address congestion in Dublin and capacity constraints on the existing public transport network. These projects include investing in the existing road, rail and bus network, BusConnects, MetroLink and priority elements of the DART Expansion Programme.\u00a0\u00a0Planning of the large\u00a0projects\u00a0is now underway and they are scheduled for delivery progressively over the life-time of the 10-year NDP.\u00a0 Meanwhile, in the shorter\u00a0term, various measures and schemes are being taken to ensure more efficient functioning of transport within Dublin city centre;\u00a0 these involve the National Transport Authority (NTA) working with local authorities and agencies and public transport operators. <\/p>  <p>  While the recently opened extension to the Luas Green Line is realising substantial benefits for customers and for\u00a0Dublin, it has experienced a number of problems in its first few months of operations.\u00a0 All parties have worked hard to overcome these problems including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have supported the smooth functioning of trams across key city centre junction by regularly patrolling it in peak periods.\u00a0 I would also like to acknowledge the continual improvements Dublin City Council make to the signalised junctions on the shared-running sections of the Luas system and also on key bus routes in and out of the city. Such fine-tuning of the signals is an essential on-going support to the Bus and Luas system and traffic management in general. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to bus services, the 2017 performance by Dublin Bus was very strong and the company provided the largest annual number of passenger journeys in 2017 at approximately 136 million. This represents an increase of over 10% on 2016 and also represents five straight years of passenger growth. Against this backdrop 140 new buses are being purchased in 2018 for the Dublin Bus fleet to replace older buses and cater for market growth and new routes. This will bring the total fleet up to almost 1100 buses, with a further expansion of the fleet expected in 2019 in advance of the roll-out of BusConnects. Passengers will also see service improvements coming from bus market opening with, as recently announced,\u00a0October 2018 seeing the commencement of\u00a0an increase of service capacity of about 35% across the 24\u00a0routes involved.<\/p>  <p>  Looking to the medium term, the BusConnects Programme aims to transform the bus system in Dublin.\u00a0 It will include: a full redesign of the bus network in order to provide a better and more efficient network\u00a0for passengers; an expanded and modern fleet of vehicles;\u00a0 new road infrastructure to facilitate bus priority and faster journeys for public transport users; improved passenger information and ticketing technology; and transition to a lower emission bus fleet.\u00a0 The\u00a0public will be fully informed by NTA about the\u00a0BusConnects programme as it progresses and will have the opportunity to input at various stages to its development.\u00a0 Over the coming weeks and months there will be number of informative stages.\u00a0 Firstly, the NTA plans\u00a0shortly\u00a0to publish an information\u00a0report about\u00a0the 16 pathways that are emerging as the likely core bus corridors in and out of the city under the new investment Programme.\u00a0 Secondly, the NTA will conduct a\u00a0public consultation\u00a0on\u00a0redesign of Dublin's bus\u00a0network,\u00a0including proposals on a major redesign of routes, schedules and fare structures.\u00a0 Thirdly, the\u00a0NTA then plans to hold a\u00a0public consultation on the emerging proposals for the 16 core bus corridors.<\/p>  <p>  Passenger numbers on Luas also increased (up 10.5% in 2017), which represents 3.6 million more passenger journeys compared to 2016.\u00a0 The Luas Cross City extension boosted numbers using the Green Line by around 24% in January 2018 compared to January 2017.\u00a0 This shows that demand for Green Line services has grown significantly, now that it has been extended to Broombridge and provides interchange with the Red Line and greater connectivity to mainline and DART rail services. As such, passenger numbers are likely to continue to grow in 2018 and beyond. <\/p>  <p>  Again looking to the future, a number of Luas related measured will be implemented to cater for this demand. A new timetable will be published in June to make best use of the new 55-metre trams that have been introduced with Luas Cross City and also a shuttle service between Heuston and Connolly. It is intended to add further additional Green Line Luas Capacity, by lengthening the 26 existing trams from 43m to 55m. The first extended tram will come online in late 2019, and the final by late 2021. Beyond that it is intended that a further 8 new 55m trams will be delivered and introduced into service. <\/p>  <p>  All the planned investment in public transport, short, medium and long-term, combined will add greatly to the level of service available for\u00a0the travelling public, connecting more people with more places, easing congestion and combatting climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200063#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200063#WRF01700"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[25391\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200063#WRF01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will report on his comments at the recent public transport round-table event regarding the possibility of an employee share ownership scheme being introduced in the CI&Eacute; group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1432","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":219,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, on 21 May 2018 I hosted a round-table dialogue on public transport policy\u00a0as part of\u00a0work by\u00a0my Department - in line with a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government - to review\u00a0public transport policy to ensure services are sustainable into the future and are meeting the needs of a modern economy and to develop a policy statement for the sector. <\/p>  <p>  This stakeholder event brought together a wide range of representatives of consumer and passenger interests, public transport operators, unions, business groups, environmental interests, research institutes and the academic community, regulators, and policy makers.\u00a0\u00a0A wide variety of issues significant to the public transport sector were discussed, including potential challenges and competing priorities likely to arise in the future across all aspects of public transport provision including economic, social and environmental considerations. <\/p>  <p>  At the close of the event, I\u00a0put forward a proposal\u00a0for possible share options for workers in the CIE Group of companies and indicated I would ask for NewERA to examine the proposal.\u00a0As I emphasised at the time,\u00a0my suggestion is in no way linked to an intention for\u00a0privatisation.\u00a0 Rather, I am interested in seeing\u00a0how such a scheme\u00a0could be\u00a0implemented\u00a0and how\u00a0it would align with\u00a0the interests of passengers, the staff and management.\u00a0 NewERA has now been\u00a0asked to\u00a0progress this\u00a0initiative and will be advising me on the matter in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200063#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":220,"content":"<p>Question No. 116 answered with Question No. 73.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network Expansion","counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200063#WRF02100"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[25413\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200063#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the impact the draft regional spatial and economic strategy for the eastern and midlands area which sets out restrictive population numbers for County Meath will have on the completion of the second phase of the Navan to Dublin rail line project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1218","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":223,"content":"<p>The Navan Rail Link Project was originally included under the Transport 21 Initiative and was to be developed in two Phases.\u00a0 Phase 1 comprised the Dunboyne Rail Line project and involved the reopening of 7.5km of a railway line running off the Maynooth line, at Clonsilla, to the M3 interchange at Pace near Dunboyne. This was opened in September 2010 with Park and Ride facilities for 1,200 at Pace and for 300 at Dunboyne. The plan for Phase 2 involved the extension of the Dunboyne Line between Clonsilla and M3 Parkway Station, onwards to north Navan. This development together with a number of other transport projects was postponed in 2011 due to the economic and fiscal crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA), which has statutory responsibility for development of Public Transport in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), included an examination of the Navan to City Centre Rail Corridor in the preparation of its \"Transport Strategy for the GDA for the period 2016-2035\".\u00a0 At that time the NTA concluded that, based on population and employment forecasts, the level of travel demand between Navan, Dunshaughlin and various stations to the city centre was insufficient to justify the development of a high-capacity rail link.\u00a0 Instead it proposed that an enhanced bus service would be provided along the corridor in conjunction with the development of a bus hub by the local authority in Navan.\u00a0 This position will be kept under review by the NTA and will be reassessed as part of the next review of its GDA Transport Strategy which is due before the end of 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s recently published Project Ireland 2040, comprising the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the National Development Plan (NDP), confirms a number of key public transport investment priorities.

As part of that process the Department has a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with O.N.E.<\/p>  <p>  O.N.E. is dedicated to looking after the welfare of ex-service personnel of the Irish Defence Forces by way of providing accommodation to homeless, elderly or disabled members in need of such domestic accommodation and shelter and other assistance that may be required.  O.N.E. is a limited company with charitable status and has accommodation in Smithfield, Dublin (Br&uacute; na bhFiann with 30 places), Athlone (7 places), Letterkenny (7 places) a drop-in centre in Limerick, and an advice centre in Dundalk.<\/p>  <p>  Any retired soldier, male or female, may contact the Smithfield centre directly and O.N.E. will assist by directing the person to other facilities within the Health Services, the local authority services, or offer a room if vacant, in Dublin, Athlone or Letterkenny.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that O.N.E. is proposing to increase the number of advice centres in other locations such as Cathal Brugha Barracks, McKee Barracks, Custume Barracks, Finner Camp, D&uacute;n U&Iacute; Mhaoliosa Barracks and Stephens Barracks.  My Department is currently working with O.N.E. in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  As a charitable organisation, I am aware that O.N.E. is heavily dependent on fundraising to finance its operation.  In this regard, under the terms of the SLA, and as part of the supports currently offered to veterans, my Department provides financial support by way of an annual subvention to O.N.E. to support and encourage its work.  This subvention is currently &euro;44,000 per annum.  The funding provided to O.N.E. by the Department of Defence is to support the general overheads of the organisation.  It is not for the provision of services that are provided to citizens, including members of O.N.E., from other arms of the State such as housing, health, social assistance, etc. Dublin City Council continues to support, on an ongoing basis, the O.N.E. homeless initiative in Smithfield.<\/p>  <p>  I have also committed to meeting the recognised veterans associations, including O.N.E., on an annual basis and I provide support by attendance at specific events whenever I can.  Later this month on the 27th June, I will be attending the launch of O.N.E.&rsquo;s annual Fuchsia fundraising appeal.  I am advised that Defence Forces units and installations throughout the country undertake fundraising in support of the work of O.N.E. on behalf of veterans.  The military authorities encourage such fundraising as an illustration of the solidarity and bonds that exists between veterans and serving personnel.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Organisation and I are committed to continued engagement with O.N.E. into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200065#WRH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200065#WRH01700"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[25175\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200065#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the sections and parts of all legislation brought forward by his Department in each of the past four years that have yet to be commenced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":301,"content":"<p>There have been no sections or parts of legislation brought forward by my Department in the past 4 years that have yet to be commenced. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200065#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200065#WRH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[25568\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200065#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his Department's capital allocation in each of the years 2019 to 2023; and the areas to which funds will be allocated in each of those years.","asker":"1280","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":304,"content":"<p>The National Development Plan (NDP) sets out Departmental Capital Allocations for the period 2018&ndash;2022.

Given the complexity of operation in a conflict zone, Ireland&rsquo;s assistance inside Syria is channelled through the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.  It is recognised that provision of humanitarian aid to areas in conflict, including Syria, presents significant challenges, particularly when it comes to the political and security environment.  Ireland&rsquo;s partners working in such environments are therefore subject to careful systems assessments and must demonstrate transparency, accountability, and effective and efficient use of funds.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the standard robust grant management and appraisals processes, a dedicated Humanitarian Advisor for the Middle East, based in the Irish Embassy in Ankara, also oversees programmes and partners in receipt of Irish funding.  This includes membership of donor advisory boards, based in the region, who oversee the allocation of support to various partners.  In addition, Ireland participates in international donor coordination mechanisms that monitor and oversee the work of our partners.  Through Ireland&rsquo;s upcoming chairmanship of the OCHA Donor Support Group, in particular, we will support OCHA to lead an effective and principled global humanitarian response, including inside Syria.  <\/p>  <p>  Through our annual contributions to EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response inside Syria.  Implementation of humanitarian aid managed by the EU is ensured through several layers of checks and monitoring, including regular field visits.  Regular evaluations are also undertaken, the results of which are publicly available.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor closely the humanitarian situation across the region affected by the Syria crisis.

The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, including through use of &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; techniques, forced displacement in the interest of demographic engineering, denial of humanitarian assistance and deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure such as schools, markets and hospitals, including chemical attacks. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports EU restrictive measures (sanctions) targeting the Assad regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as repression continues.  The sanctions currently in place include notably an oil embargo, restrictions on certain investments, a freeze of the assets of the Syrian central bank within the EU, export restrictions on equipment and technology that might be used for internal repression as well as on equipment and technology for monitoring or interception of internet or telephone communications.  In addition, over 250 persons and almost 70 entities are targeted by a travel ban and an asset freeze over the violent repression against the civilian population in Syria.  Most recently, in March, the Council added an additional 4 persons to the list of those targeted by EU restrictive measures against the Syrian regime for their role in the development and use of chemical weapons against the civilian population.  On 28 May 2018, the Council extended EU restrictive measures against the Syrian regime until 1 June 2019.  Given the ongoing repression of the civilian population, the EU decided to maintain its restrictive measures against the Syrian regime and its supporters, in line with the EU strategy on Syria.   <\/p>  <p>  EU Regulations have what is termed \"direct effect\" in Irish law, meaning that they apply and must be complied with in the same way as Irish legislation.  In Ireland, penalties for breaches of sanctions are provided for by Statutory Instrument (SIs).  A comprehensive list of SIs may be found in the Irish Statute Book.  Within the EU each Member State is required to designate Competent Authorities that are engaged with sanctions issues including ensuring that sanctions measures are implemented.  In Ireland's case, there are three such Competent Authorities: the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Central Bank of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade represents Ireland internationally on sanctions-related matters, including communicating with the EU, the UN and other states in respect of international restrictive measures.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is the Competent Authority for implementation of trade-related sanctions and the Central Bank of Ireland is the Competent Authority for the implementation of financial sanctions as they relate to financial institutions.  Given the multi-sectoral nature of sanctions measures however a wide range of Government stakeholders are engaged on sanctions related issues.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support all efforts to ensure a lasting peace and full accountability for war crimes in Syria, in the context of bringing peace and stability to the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200065#WRH06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":345,"content":"<p>Question No. 161 answered with Question No. 159.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":348,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[24355\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200066#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps being taken at national, EU and international level to ensure that the perpetrators of war crimes in Syria are brought to justice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":349,"content":"<p>The situation in Syria remains of grave concern.  The conflict has cost the lives of well over 400,000 people, 13 million Syrians are in need of humanitarian assistance, over 6 million people are displaced within Syria and an additional 5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.  There have been numerous brutal attacks on civilians by the Assad regime and others, including the use of medieval starve or surrender tactics, the use of chemical weapons and the deliberate targeting of medical facilities and personnel.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports a broad range of efforts to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria as part of a sustainable peaceful resolution to the conflict and has consistently called for the situation in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court.  Ireland supports the work of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry established in August 2011 by the Human Rights Council to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law since March 2011 in Syria.  Furthermore, in December 2016 Ireland and a group of like-minded countries successfully pressed for the adoption of a resolution by the UN General Assembly to establish an International Impartial and Independent Mechanism to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under international law committed in Syria.  Last year my predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Charlie Flanagan T.D. announced a contribution of &euro;100,000 to support the work of this mechanism.  Further support for the work of the Mechanism in 2018 is currently under consideration.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also a strong and consistent supporter of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) whose Fact Finding Mission (FFM) was set up in 2014 to &ldquo;establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic&rdquo;.  We support their work financially with annual contributions amounting to nearly &euro;1million since 2014.  In addition, Ireland contributed &euro;200,000 specifically to the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mission to eliminate chemical weapons in Syria. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland deeply regrets Russia&rsquo;s veto of the renewal of the mandate of this Joint Investigative Mission last October. It is extremely frustrating that the UN Security Council has not been able to take meaningful action to maintain peace and security in Syria and to ensure accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria.  Those who have vetoed effective UN action in this regard bear a heavy responsibility.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is supporting an initiative to convene a Special Conference of States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention with a view to considering the introduction of a mechanism for attributing responsibility for the use of chemical weapons.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland also supports EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as repression continues.

I, and officials in my Department, have been monitoring the state of affairs in Yemen with growing anxiety, particularly in recent months as the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate.  After three years of war, three quarters of the population are estimated to require some form of humanitarian assistance.  The situation is already untenable.  I am particularly troubled by reports of growing tensions around the port of Hodeidah.  About 80% of Yemen&rsquo;s humanitarian and commercial aid runs through this port and any interruption of this flow would lead to further suffering for civilians in Yemen.<\/p>  <p>  Humanitarian access is a critical issue, and I have consistently called on all parties to the conflict to ensure that the people of Yemen receive the assistance they urgently need. Commercial access is equally important, since a population of over 20 million people cannot survive on aid alone.  Officials from my Department met with the Saudi Embassy in Dublin late last year and again last month and relayed my strong concerns in relation to humanitarian access.  The EU has also made representations to Saudi Arabia on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen and has provided over &euro;170 million in aid since the conflict began, to which Ireland contributes via the EU Development Budget. Ireland has provided &euro;15.5 million in bilateral humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2015, including &euro;4million in assistance which was announced in March this year.  Ireland also provides global funding to a number of organisations which are particularly active in Yemen including the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also worked in the UN system to raise our grave concerns about human rights in Yemen.  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption by consensus of a Resolution on Yemen.  The resolution established a group of international experts to examine the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has worked to keep communication channels open with all stakeholders and regional actors in Yemen.  At the Foreign Affairs Council in December last year, I urged stronger EU action on humanitarian access in Yemen, and I will continue to raise these concerns with all appropriate interlocutors whenever possible.<\/p>  <p>  The EU supports the work of Martin Griffiths, the new Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General for Yemen, and his team, and in particular his efforts to prepare a framework for negotiations to present to the UN Security Council in June. We hope that peace negotiations can be re-launched shortly afterwards.  I believe that the new envoy will be able to engage all parties to the conflict to come back to the negotiating table, in order to achieve a sustainable solution for the people of Yemen.  My EU colleagues and I are committed to supporting his work, and would be happy to meet with him at the Foreign Affairs Council to hear how we can best do that.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, as well as respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access.  I believe that only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through a negotiated end to this conflict, and the EU stands ready to support this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200066#WRJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland","counter":374,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200066#WRJ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[24677\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200066#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on recent efforts to restore the Executive in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":376,"content":"<p>Over the course of many months, the Irish and British Governments, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, have worked tirelessly to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to form an Executive.

A lender must carry out affordability assessments by examining each case on its own merits and must base its assessment of the borrower's full circumstances including their ability to pay as determined by up to date information on a Standard Financial Statement (SFS).<\/p><p>A lender must explore all options for alternative repayment arrangements (that they offer) in order to offer the most viable solution to each borrower.  The Code also requires lenders to review an alternative repayment arrangement at appropriate intervals for the type and duration of the arrangement.  The lender is also obliged to carry out a review of an alternative repayment arrangement at any time, if requested by the borrower.<\/p><p>It may not be possible for your constituent and their lender to agree on an alternative repayment arrangement. If the lender is not willing to offer your constituent an alternative repayment arrangement, they must give the reasons in writing.  If they do offer an arrangement, your constituent may choose not to accept it.  If your constituent is not happy with the lender&rsquo;s treatment of their case, or if they feel the lender has not complied with the CCMA, they can appeal to the lender under the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012.  If they remain unsatisfied with the outcome of an appeal or complaint, they can refer to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).<\/p><p>The FSPO have developed an extensive guide for complainants which can be found at <i><\/i><\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institution, the Minister has no direct function in the relationship between AIB\/EBS and its customers.

Since then, the Working Group, now chaired by Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D., has published two reports examining the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance for motorists and the cost of employer and public liability insurance for businesses.  These Reports identified and made recommendations on short, medium and long-term measures to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance   was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In its second phase, the Working Group examined the cost of business insurance, in particular employer liability insurance and public liability insurance.  This work culminated in the publication of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance   on 25 January 2018.  The Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.  All 29 actions are scheduled to be implemented before the end of 2019, with 26 due for completion this year.<\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations from the two Reports by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within each that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.<\/p>  <p>  The fifth such update was published on 11 May 2018 and is the first to detail the implementation of both primary Reports.  It shows that, in relation to the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, of the 50 separate deadlines set to date within the Action Plan, 40 have been met, while substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  Meanwhile, all eight actions due during Q1 2018 from the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance   have been completed on time.<\/p>  <p>  Both of the primary Reports and all of the quarterly updates are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, within \"The Cost of Insurance Working Group\" sub-section of the main &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo; section.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for May 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 19% since peaking in July 2016.  While it is accepted that motor insurance premiums are still at a very high level for many people, such statistics indicate at least a greater degree of stability in the market on an overall basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the two primary Reports.  The cumulative effects of the completion of the two reports&rsquo; recommendations, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and businesses, and a more stable and competitive insurance market without unnecessary delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200067#WRK03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stamp Duty","counter":451,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200067#WRK04000"},{"type":"question","counter":452,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[24249\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200067#WRK04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when measures will be commenced involving a reduction in stamp duty to 1% in respect of the purchase of agricultural land which is purchased for farm consolidation purposes; the relevant dates for these transactions to have taken place to be eligible for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[24971\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200067#WRK04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position on the application of a reduced rate of stamp duty on certain farm consolidation transactions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 225 together.<\/p><p>As I have outlined in a number of PQ replies recently, the measure legislated for in section 68 of Finance Act 2017 (which was not a Budget measure) will allow a farmer to claim relief from stamp duty where he or she sells and purchases land for the purposes of consolidating an existing farm holding has been introduced, subject to a commencement order after a full consideration of any administrative or EU state-aid requirements.<\/p><p>For the relief to operate, there must be both a sale and a purchase of land within a period of 24 months of each other.

It should also be noted that the Central Bank of Ireland does not have any regulatory role in relation to this matter either.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the Cost of Insurance Working Group, chaired by Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, examined the issue of the discretion of the court to exercise in favour of the winning party - the &lsquo;costs follow the event&rsquo; principle, as part of its examination of the cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  This was as a result of business stakeholders expressing frustration at the lack of consistency in the application of this general principle where a claim is dismissed and the insurer is still required to meet its own costs.  It was argued by such stakeholders that failure to follow this principle meant that these costs were ultimately reflected in an increase in the premium of policyholders, even though the claim had been found to have no basis.  <\/p>  <p>  The Cost of Insurance Working Group, in its report, acknowledged that the determination of who is to pay costs is ultimately at the discretion of the judge in any given case on the basis of the relevant facts, and that in certain cases costs not following the event can be appropriate, for example, in cases involving the State where an important legal principle has been raised.  However, there was a view expressed that inconsistency in the application of this principle may lead insurers to settle an otherwise defendable case, unilaterally, or in consultation with the policyholder, solely because that strategy is more cost efficient than successfully defending an action, and  not being able to recover their costs.<\/p>  <p>  The Cost of Insurance Working Group believes that a consistent application of the &lsquo;costs follow the event&rsquo; principle &ndash; recognising that it should remain a matter for the independent judiciary to be the key decision makers in this regard &ndash; would probably be one of the most effective ways of tackling fraud and exaggerated claims, as it would give insurers the confidence to challenge more robustly cases which they have doubts about.  It would also remove the common reason expressed by insurers that uncertainty in relation to legal costs forces them to settle regularly on the court steps rather than to dispute a case  in court.  In addition, it would mean that the minority of plaintiffs who seek to exploit the system through fraud or exaggeration would have to think more carefully about the consequences for themselves, should they lose the case.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group believes that such an approach should have no bearing or impact on plaintiffs who have a deserving case, and genuinely feel it needs to be settled in court.<\/p>  <p>Finally, I understand that the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 , which my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Charlie Flanagan TD, has responsibility for, makes extensive provision for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged by legal practitioners, along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients.  Section 169 of the Act puts the general principle of &lsquo;costs follow the event&rsquo; on a statutory footing.  I understand that this section will become operational once the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator is established, which is currently projected for Q3 of 2018 and as Minister for Finance, I welcome this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200067#WRK04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Reform","counter":461,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200067#WRK05000"},{"type":"question","counter":462,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[24388\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200067#WRK05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on tax relief for pension contributions; when his Department's working group on this issue will report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":463,"content":"<p>The State encourages individuals to save for retirement by offering tax incentives when saving for a pension.

As a result, the majority of social welfare payments are deemed as taxable for income tax purposes.  Consistent with this approach, the charge to income tax on Maternity Benefit payments applies to ensure that those with identical incomes will be treated the same for income tax purposes.<\/p>  <p>  The extent to which taxation actually arises, if at all, in a given case depends on the total level of income that the individual or couple concerned has in the relevant period.  In circumstances where the Maternity Benefit is paid in lower income households, such mothers will likely not have to pay any income tax as their tax liability would not be higher than the amount sheltered by their personal tax credits.  This is most likely to be the case in circumstances where social welfare payments are the only source of income for a household.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, recognising that such payments have an important purpose to support women on Maternity Leave from work, Maternity Benefit payments are exempt from Universal Social Charge and PRSI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200067#WRK05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carbon Tax Yield","counter":467,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200067#WRK05600"},{"type":"question","counter":468,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[24487\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200067#WRK05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to increase the rate of carbon tax in the upcoming budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[24488\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200067#WRK05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of carbon tax collected each year since its introduction in 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":470,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 and 203 together.<\/p><p>It is the long standing practice of the Minister or Finance not to comment on any Budgetary decision which may or may not be taken in advance of the Budget.<\/p><p>I can however inform the Deputy that officials from my Department and the ESRI have undertaken a project, as part of a joint research programme, to examine a range of carbon price scenarios, their impact on national CO2 emissions as well as across production sectors of the economy and households.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.  <\/p>  <p>  In making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, insurers will use a combination of rating factors, which include how the vehicle is used, as well as the age and type of the vehicle, the age of the driver, the relevant claims record and driving experience, and the number of drivers.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.  In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to particular categories, different insurance companies will have different views.<\/p>  <p>However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years with a related problem, as referred to in the PQ, being the availability of cover in the first place.  These issues were the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, set out within an Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The fifth such update was published on 11 May and shows that of the 50 separate deadlines set to date within the Action Plan, 40 have been met.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  Both the Report and the quarterly updates are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, within &ldquo;The Cost of Insurance Working Group&rdquo; sub-section of the main &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo; section.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for May 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 19% since peaking in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore I appreciate many people may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that the improved stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.  In addition, with the full implementation of the Motor Report, I believe that Ireland will be more attractive to new entrants thus increasing capacity as well as competition which should have a positive impact in niche areas such as motor insurance for musicians.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, if a consumer is unable to secure a quotation on the open market, he\/she may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA) process.  Under the terms of the DCA, which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance if the person has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  In this regard, there are further details available on the Insurance Ireland website, while more generally, Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.

These measures seek to ensure that lenders act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of their customers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; for example, through protections at the initial marketing and advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties during the course of the credit agreement.<\/p>  <p>   For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, which transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law, provides that lenders must act honestly, fairly, transparently and professionally, taking account of the rights and interests of the consumer, in relation to the provision of mortgage credit.  In particular, lenders must assess the creditworthiness of consumers (which must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate) and that assessment shall take account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations having regard to the terms of the proposed credit agreement.  Furthermore, it provides that the lender shall only make mortgage credit available where the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer's obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under the agreement.  In addition, the European Banking Authority has published Guidelines on Creditworthiness Assessment which provides additional detail on the creditworthiness requirements of the Mortgage Credit Directive which indicates, in guideline 4.3, that if the mortgage loan term extends past the consumer's expected retirement age, the lender should take appropriate account of the adequacy of the consumer's likely income and ability to continue meet obligations under the credit agreement in retirement.  Furthermore, where advisory services are being provided in relation to mortgage credit, the Regulations provide that it will be necessary to obtain information regarding the consumer&rsquo;s personal and financial situation, preferences and objectives and that any assessment shall take into account reasonable assumptions as to risks to the consumer's situation over the term of the proposed credit agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Also, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower, including the age of the borrower.  In particular, a regulated entity must gather and record sufficient information from the consumer prior to offering, recommending, arranging or providing a product or service appropriate to that consumer. The level of information gathered should be appropriate to the nature and complexity of the product or service being sought by the consumer, but must be to a level that allows the regulated entity to provide a professional service and must include details of the consumer&rsquo;s needs and objectives, personal circumstances (including age where relevant) and their financial situation.  Also, prior to offering, recommending, arranging or providing a credit product to a personal consumer, a lender must carry out an assessment of affordability to ascertain the consumer&rsquo;s likely ability to repay the debt, over the duration of the agreement. A regulated entity must take account of the result of the affordability assessment when deciding whether a personal consumer is likely to be able to repay the debt for that amount and duration in the manner required under the credit agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Code, when assessing the suitability of a product or service for a consumer, the regulated entity must, at a minimum, consider and document whether, on the basis of the information gathered:<\/p>  <p>  - the product or service meets that consumer&rsquo;s needs and objectives;<\/p>  <p>  - the consumer is likely to be able to meet the financial commitment associated with the product on an ongoing basis and is financially able to bear any risks attaching to the product or service;<\/p>  <p>  - the consumer has the ability to repay the debt in the manner required under the credit agreement, on the basis of the outcome of the assessment of affordability; and<\/p>  <p>  - the product or service is consistent with the consumer&rsquo;s attitude to risk.<\/p>  <p>  However, subject to complying with relevant consumer protection and other regulatory\/macro prudential requirements, it is then a matter for individual lenders to set their own lending policies and to make their own commercial decisions on individual mortgage or other credit applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200068#WRL05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Claims","counter":533,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200068#WRL06000"},{"type":"question","counter":534,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[24994\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200068#WRL06100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the legislation which will permit the compensation of victims arising from road traffic accidents which involved vehicles which were insured with a company (details supplied) will be brought before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; if same can be expedited in the context that such accident victims to date are only receiving 65% of their due compensation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":535,"content":"<p>Setanta Insurance was placed into liquidation by the Malta Financial Services Authority on 30 April 2014.

Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles, including HSE first responders.<\/p>  <p>  In making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, insurers will use a combination of rating factors, which include how the vehicle is used, as well as the age and type of the vehicle, the age of the driver, the relevant claims record and driving experience, and the number of drivers.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market.  In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience, meaning that in relation to particular categories, different insurance companies will have different views.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the motor insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years with a related problem, being the availability of cover in the first place.  These issues were the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, set out within an Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The fifth such update was published on 11 May and shows that of the 50 separate deadlines set to date within the Action Plan, 40 have been met.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;.  Both the Report and the quarterly updates are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, within &ldquo;The Cost of Insurance Working Group&rdquo; sub-section of the main &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo; section.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for May 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 19% since peaking in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore I appreciate many people may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that the improved stability in pricing will be maintained and that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.  In addition, with the full implementation of the Motor Report, I believe that Ireland will be more attractive to new entrants thus increasing capacity as well as competition which should have a positive impact in the pricing of motor insurance for certain categories of drivers such as cardiac first responders.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to tax incentives or reliefs, there is no specific measure or relief targeted at HSE first-responders.  However, if a paramedic employed by the HSE is obliged to incur an expense that is wholly and exclusively for the purpose of his or her employment, and not reimbursed by his or her employer, a deduction may be available under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Section 114 provides for a tax deduction in respect of expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily by an individual in the performance of the duties of his or her employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200069#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":540,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200069#WRM00500"},{"type":"question","counter":541,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[25089\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200069#WRM00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding customers who were undercharged mortgages in 2013 by a bank (detail supplied); if the Central Bank formally investigated the bank in relation to the issue; the number of mortgage accounts affected; the outcome of the resolution of these cases; the number of these cases that are with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":542,"content":"<p>The Central Bank has advised that errors by lenders (and other regulated financial services firms) are monitored by the Central Bank through a number of supervisory tools, including on-site inspection work and through the statutory requirement imposed on lenders to notify the Central Bank of certain errors within timeframes prescribed by the Consumer Protection Code.

Ireland had many concerns about the proposal as drafted, not the least of which were the potential impacts on, and the trading of, Irish Sovereign debt in the secondary market and in total, the potential negative impact on the liquidity of the financial sector as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  Our concerns are widely shared amongst other Member states, including some of the participating countries.<\/p>  <p>  Opponents of the EU FTT, including Ireland, continue to argue that it only makes sense if it covers many countries or else transactions will shift toward those financial centres which are not covered by it.<\/p>  <p>  Much uncertainty still remains as to the form any FTT might take or if the initiative will be agreed to at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200069#WRM02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":564,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200069#WRM02900"},{"type":"question","counter":565,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[25375\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200069#WRM03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the basis on which a bank can cease providing banking services to a business; the opportunity such a business has to contest such a decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":566,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, in my role as Minister for Finance I have no direct function in the relationship between the banks and their customers; and the provision of banking services to any customer is a commercial decision for the banks.<\/p><p>However, General Principle 2.11 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 requires that an entity, without prejudice to the pursuit of its legitimate commercial aims, does not through its policies, procedures, or working practices, prevent access to basic financial services.<\/p><p>The SME Regulations (2015) also stipulate that, where a regulated entity decides to withdraw or amend a credit facility agreement it shall promptly provide the borrower with an explanation of the reasons for the decision to withdraw or amend the credit facility agreement.<\/p><p>If customers are unhappy with the service received from a firm which is regulated by the Central Bank, they are entitled to make a complaint by writing directly to the firm concerned.

Employers employing the specified categories of workers must comply with the provisions of an SEO covering the sector in which they are operating.<\/p>  <p>  To date, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, has signed into law two SEOs that cover workers in the construction sector: SI 455 of 2017 covering the construction sector on 19 October 2017; and SI 59 of 2018 covering the mechanical engineering building services contracting sector on 6 March 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  Whilst it is the case that there were no transitional arrangements introduced when the SEOs were signed into law, nonetheless there was an 11 month process leading up to the establishment of the first SEO in October 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2016 an application was made to the Labour Court by the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) to commence the process.  As a body who represents significant numbers of employers in the construction sector it must be presumed that this application was made with the knowledge of its members.  An invitation for submissions by interested parties was published by the Labour Court in February 2017.  This was followed by an invitation from the Labour Court to an oral hearing on 26 June 2017 to those who made submissions.  The CIF, having made a submission was one of the bodies invited to the hearing.  Having concluded its deliberations, the Labour Court issued a recommendation to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on 13 July 2017 which was published shortly thereafter.  The Minister, having accepted the recommendation, submitted a draft order to both Houses of the Oireachtas and it was signed into law on 19 October 2017 after a resolution approving it had been passed by each House.<\/p>  <p>  Wages in this sector have experienced increases in recent years as evidenced by average increases of 6% year on year in the biannual tender price index published by the Society of Chartered Surveyors in Ireland since 2014.  The foregoing would suggest that contractors should have been taking wage inflation into account when tendering for construction contracts; public or private.  Indeed the SCSI tender price index would suggest that contractors have been taking wage inflation into account in pricing work.<\/p>  <p>  I have received several representations on behalf of contractors operating under the public works contracts.  The correspondence has identified the difficulties being experienced by those contractors whose tender prices did not account for the increased cost of labour represented by the introduction of the SEOs.<\/p>  <p>  The conditions of the public works contract have been in general use since 2007 and industry is well aware of their fixed price requirement.  It must be assumed therefore that this issue has arisen due to a lack of awareness of the process that was being undertaken and this is something that I will bring to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200070#WRN03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":625,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200070#WRN03400"},{"type":"question","counter":626,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[24975\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200070#WRN03500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of the outstanding claim by community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors on their pension ex gratia claim; the progress being made on the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Learnings from the pilot, supported by an expert advisory group, will expand the initiative for the next budgetary cycle.<\/p>  <p> - The 10 year National Development Plan commits to &euro;91 billion of Exchequer capital investment over the period of the Plan (2018-2027), bringing public capital investment levels in Ireland as a % of national income to amongst the highest in the EU.<\/p>  <p> - The PEACE and INTERREG programmes have been a key element of the EU's continuing commitment to the process of peace building and reconciliation and support for the Good Friday Agreement.

The 2017 Provisional Outturn does not include any amount in respect of capital carryover spent in 2017.

At the beginning of 2015 the HSE Vote was disestablished, with voted funding for the HSE now provided from the Department of Health Vote.  As a consequence of this change, certain items, amounting to approximately &euro;1 billion in 2014, previously accounted for as appropriations-in-aid in the HSE Vote are collected directly as income by the HSE and reflected in the HSE accounts.  This impacts on the year-on-year change between 2014 and 2015.  Adjusting to allow a like-for-like comparison, the year-on-year change between 2014 and 2015 is 2.8% for gross voted expenditure.  REV 2018 saw a significant technical adjustment relating to the funding of domestic water services.  Following enactment of the Water Services Act 2017 all motor tax receipts are being paid into the Exchequer rather than the Local Government Fund and all State funding for domestic water services is now provided from voted expenditure by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.

In 2018, Skillnet Ireland has also established 5 new learning networks in sectors which are experiencing significant workforce development demand, including hospitality, recruitment, advanced electronics and manufacturing.  Skillnet Ireland now funds 67 networks.  <\/p>  <p>  The additional funding has also facilitated an increase in Skillnet Ireland's investment in its Future Skills Programme, whereby its learning networks develop new programmes that address emerging skills needs in areas such as artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing and global business services, MedTech, agriculture and retail amongst others.<\/p>  <p>  By the end of May 2018, Skillnet Ireland has received &euro;10m of their 2018 allocation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200072#WRP03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Skills Development","counter":749,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200072#WRP03400"},{"type":"question","counter":750,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[24313\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200072#WRP03500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the &euro;1 million allocated to new expenditure on regional upskilling and reskilling as outlined in budget 2018; the amount of the allocation that has been spent; the way in which the funds were spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":751,"content":"<p>The &euro;1m allocated to new expenditure on regional upskilling and reskilling as outlined in the Estimates for 2018 is being made available for Regional Skills Fora to support innovative new responses to skills requirements in the regions.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware the Regional Skills Fora are playing a crucial role in ensuring that planning for meeting key skills needs is informed and guided by information, evidence and assessments adopting a regional perspective.  <\/p><p>This is in keeping with the regional development and growth objectives highlighted in the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework that comprise Ireland Project 2040.

Parental preferences for each patron and language of instruction, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200072#WRP06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grants Data","counter":779,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200072#WRP06400"},{"type":"question","counter":780,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[24425\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200072#WRP06500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated cost of restoring higher education grant thresholds to pre-budget 2011 rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":781,"content":"<p>It is not possible to definitively estimate the &ldquo;cost of restoring higher education grant thresholds to pre-budget 2011 rates&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  To put it in context, in 2010\/11 there were 71,532 students who benefitted from grant support at a cost of &euro;355m, whereas in 2016\/17 there were 78,904 students in receipt of grant support at a cost of &euro;377m.  <\/p>  <p>  In the intervening years, we have centralised the student grant scheme (replacing four separate schemes and sixty six awarding authorities with one scheme administered by a centralised awarding authority), had a complete turnover of students, income levels have changed and numerous changes have been made to the annual schemes which affect eligibility criteria.

The closing date for receipt of any appeals in regard to SNA allocations is Friday, 28th September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  As this question relates to particular children and schools, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Works Scheme Applications","counter":856,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR00800"},{"type":"question","counter":857,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[24670\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an application by a school (details supplied) in County Westmeath for works to be carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":858,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has approved a resource room for the school to which he refers and the school authority has been advised accordingly.<\/p><p>With regard to the other matters referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied, my Department has advised the school authority to submit an Emergency Works Application for the works in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":859,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR01100"},{"type":"question","counter":860,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[24682\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the educational supports in place for children in the deaf community in County Mayo; the way in which this compares with other counties; his plans to provide extra educational supports for children in the deaf community; if not, the reason therefore; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":861,"content":"<p>My Department provides for an extensive range of supports to assist pupils who are Deaf or hard of hearing in all counties including Mayo.

Securing skills supply from the education and training to the construction sector is a major focus of my Department as part of broader Government actions to increase housing supply and roll out the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework.<\/p>  <p>  Construction related apprentice registrations increased from 1,713 in 2015 to 2,314 in 2016 which represents an increase of 35%.  This trend continued in 2017 with a further increase of 28% on the 2016 figure bringing the total number of construction related registrations to 2,963.  <\/p>  <p>  Apprenticeship is a demand driven educational and training programme, which aims to develop the skills of an apprentice in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market. Consequently, the number of construction related apprentices being registered is determined by employers within the construction sector. My Department and SOLAS are committed to supporting the registration of apprentices in the construction sector. Registrations on craft apprenticeships are forecast to increase further up to 2020.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, we are currently expanding the range of apprenticeships on offer to meet the identified skill needs of industry. Arising from our first call for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 an apprenticeship in Engineering Services Management, with the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) as industry lead, is currently being developed into a national apprenticeship programme.  In addition, we recently announced 26 new programmes, arising from last year&rsquo;s second call for proposals, to be further developed into national apprenticeships, including a scaffolding apprenticeship, again with the CIF as industry lead and a senior quantity surveyor apprenticeship with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland as industry lead. These new programmes, once developed, will add to and complement the range of apprenticeships currently on offer in developing the skill needs identified by the sector.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the wet trades, highlighted as areas of particular concern in the report, SOLAS in partnership with CIF and Waterford Wexford Education and Training Board (WWETB) operated a pilot initiative in the last year to test the viability of a shared apprenticeship scheme.  Following analysis of the pilot outcomes and in consultation with both the CIF and WWETB, I understand that SOLAS decided not to operationalise the pilot initiative more widely.  In particular, it was found that the pilot did not attract employers in sufficient numbers to suggest that the scheme had the potential to have a significant impact on apprenticeship recruitment.  However, I understand from SOLAS that they are currently in discussions with representatives from the construction industry to assess how the scheme could be made more viable.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to meet with the Construction Industry Federation in the coming weeks to discuss the report in question and I look forward to engaging with them on issues relating to employer engagement with the apprenticeship programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations Commission","counter":868,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR02000"},{"type":"question","counter":869,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[24723\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the entitlements of a person (details supplied) in circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":870,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.<\/p><p>In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Data","counter":871,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR02300"},{"type":"question","counter":872,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[24732\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the last new school planning area was added.","asker":"1304","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":873,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[24733\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR02500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the current system of school planning areas was initiated.","asker":"1304","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":874,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[24734\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way in which school planning areas take account of entirely new suburbs which did not exist when the original school planning areas were designed.","asker":"1304","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":875,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[24735\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the deviation in population that necessitates a new school planning area.","asker":"1304","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":876,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 345 to 348, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data in a way that takes account of the significant local and regional variations in demographic trends and enrolment projections, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas, of which some 40 are in Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  Using school planning area boundaries within my Department&rsquo;s Geographic Information System (GIS) allows data within those boundaries, including data for enrolments in schools, child benefit and other relevant data to be added to the mapping information, grouped and analysed.  The GIS records the number of primary and post-primary schools within each planning area, the combined enrolments for all of the schools within each area, including total enrolment and enrolment in each class group, together with child benefit data for the 0-4 age group relevant to the area. <\/p>  <p>  In most areas, school planning areas were based on traditional school catchment areas where all primary schools were assigned to a post-primary feeder area (typically a population centre or town), containing one or more post-primary schools.  The school planning areas were developed for use with the GIS in 2008 and with the introduction of Small Areas in Census 2011, these areas were amended to align with Census Small Areas. The current school planning areas take account not only of local groupings of schools, but also of natural boundaries, Census Small Areas and other local conditions. These school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area. <\/p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the recent demographic exercises, my Department engaged with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development, including additional residential developments arising from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF). <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Enrolments Data","counter":877,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR03200"},{"type":"question","counter":878,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[24736\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200074#WRR03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide the relevant departmental geographic information systems, GIS data, that is, enrolments and other relevant data which is mapped for the Finglas East, Ballymun, Dublin 11 school planning area.","asker":"1304","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":879,"content":"<p>A list of the schools in the Finglas East - Ballymun - Dublin 11 school planning area, and their enrolments, is available in the following tables.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><font face=\"Calibri\">Roll Number<\/font><\/th><th><font face=\"Calibri\">Official Name<\/font><\/th><th><font face=\"Calibri\">Address (Line 1)<\/font><\/th><th><font face=\"Calibri\">Address (Line 2)<\/font><\/th><th><font face=\"Calibri\">Address (Line 3)<\/font><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><font face=\"Calibri\">18038B<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">ST MARGARETS N S<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">ST MARGARETS<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">CO.DUBLIN.<\/font><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><font face=\"Calibri\">18682F<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">ST CANICES B N S<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">GLASANAON ROAD<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">FINGLAS<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">DUBLIN 11<\/font><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><font face=\"Calibri\">18683H<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">ST CANICES G N S<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">Seamus Ennis Road<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">Finglas<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">Dublin 11<\/font><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><font face=\"Calibri\">19208F<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">HOLY SPIRIT B N S<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">SILLOGE RD<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">BAILE MUNNA<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">ATHA CLIATH 11<\/font><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><font face=\"Calibri\">19209H<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">SN AN SPIORAID NAIOMH C<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">SILLOGUE RD<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">BALLYMUN<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">DUBLIN 11<\/font><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><font face=\"Calibri\">19430G<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">SCOIL AN TSEACHTAR LAOCH<\/font><\/td><td><font face=\"Calibri\">Br.

Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body.

In pursuance of this commitment, a new Community-based CCTV grant-aid scheme was launched by my Department in 2017 to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas. It is intended that the scheme will run for 3 years with funding of some &euro;1 million being made available each year.<\/p>  <p>  Under the scheme, eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000. Upon approval, applicants receive up-front payment of 50% of the grant with the balance to be paid when the system is fully operational.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that community CCTV is governed by section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006).  This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must-<\/p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,<\/p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant Local Authority, which must also act as data controller, and <\/p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of whether or not grant funding is sought from my Department to assist in their establishment.<\/p>  <p>  In establishing the grant-aid scheme, the Department sought to make the process as user-friendly as possible while respecting these statutory requirements.  <\/p>  <p>  Both the application process and documentation were updated and streamlined as compared to the earlier scheme administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department, to make them more accessible to all groups wishing to avail of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Further, the Department consulted broadly, including with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Attorney General and the Local Government Management Agency.   In that regard, I understand that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner's Office has again confirmed that it is not querying and does not have any current concerns regarding the legislative underpinning of community CCTV systems.<\/p>  <p>  Systems funded under this scheme will supplement the existing network of CCTV systems in operation in the State, namely the 35 Garda CCTV schemes in operation comprising in excess of 500 cameras; as well as the 45 Community-based CCTV schemes encompassing some 367 cameras to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have access, and which were established under the previous grant-aid scheme funded by my Department between 2005 and 2013. <\/p>  <p>  11 applications have been received to date and my Department has been informed that a further 14 applications will be submitted in the near future. <\/p>  <p>  4 applications under the scheme have been approved to date, with approved funding totalling almost &euro;120,000.  3 of these approved applications are in relation to systems in County Wexford and 1 is in relation to a system in County Wicklow.  A further 4 applications are under active consideration. The remaining 3 applications submitted to date have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to provide the information necessary to qualify for grant-aid.<\/p>  <p>  My Department receives enquiries regarding the scheme from a broad spectrum of the public, including in particular local authorities, as well as residents associations, ad hoc community groups as well as private citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website www.justice.ie  In addition, my officials are available to provide assistance and guidance to any interested party in relation to the scheme, with a dedicated email address available for that purpose - communitycctv@justice.ie<\/p>  <p>  I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, take advantage of the availability of this grant-aid scheme and I encourage any interested groups to make contact with my Department with any queries or if they require assistance in relation to the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200079#WRW06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equality Legislation","counter":1213,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1214,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[24444\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the penalties applying to the refusal of an establishment to allow entry to a customer or to ask a customer to leave on the basis of a mother breast-feeding; and his plans to update legislation in this regard.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1215,"content":"<p>Ireland has comprehensive and robust equality legislation in place &ndash; namely the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 and the Equal Status Acts 2000-2015 &ndash; which prohibits discrimination on ten specific grounds, including on gender and family status.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the legislation is designed to promote equality and prohibit discrimination and victimisation and it also allows for positive measures to ensure equality across the ten grounds.

This is due to data protection around provision of low count data.  Incident counts for Behaviour Orders (Children), Civil Orders (Adult)(LS) and Good Behaviour Contract (LS) are not shown as each incident type has a national count of less than ten per year in the period examined.<\/p><p>Of course, addressing local community concerns in relation to public order and anti-social behaviour is a key focus in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Community Policing Model and a range of strong legislative provisions are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard, including those under:<\/p><p>- the Criminal Damage Act 1991;<\/p><p>- Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994;<\/p><p>- the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and<\/p><p>- the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.<\/p><p>For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that a very substantial budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and &euro;98.5 million has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018, which inter alia supports Garda activity to tackle these types of problems.<\/p><p>The Government is also committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.

Significant progress has been made and I expect to bring proposals to Government in relation to this matter shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Crime","counter":1242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1243,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[24661\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the efforts being made to tackle rural crime in the north west; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the number of burglaries in counties Sligo and Leitrim area is up 30% while nationally the number of burglaries is up 3.6%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1244,"content":"<p>I want to assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the impact of crime on rural communities, including the serious damage done by organised gangs who target rural areas to engage in burglary and other property-related crime.  Such incidents cannot be tolerated in our society and this Government will continue to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the gangs, including mobile criminal gangs, who target rural areas, including counties Sligo and Leitrim.<\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  I can assure the Deputy that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that optimum use is made of these resources.  <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Sligo\/Leitrim Division on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available was 302.  There are also 17 Garda Reserves and 31 Garda civilian staff attached to the Sligo\/Leitrim Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, very significant resources have been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including an overtime allocation of almost &euro;100 million announced in Budget 2018, to support large-scale policing operations including Operation Thor. <\/p><p>The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property-related crime under Operation Thor has led to concentrated Garda activity.  As of 17 May 2018, 130,702 targeted checkpoints and 151,819 crime prevention patrols have been conducted nationwide.  To give you an idea of the impact of the operation, I can inform you that this concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 7,569 arrests and 8,613 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. <\/p><p>For its part, the Government remains totally committed to ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our society, which includes actions taken under Operation Thor.  Indeed, some &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018.  This is an increase of approximately 2% over the allocation for 2017.  &euro;98.5 million has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018 which represents an increase of &euro;10 million over the initial allocation for 2017 (which amounted to &euro;88.5 million).  In November 2017, the Minister for Justice and Equality secured a supplementary estimate of some &euro;42 million for Garda overtime, bringing the spend for 2017 to over &euro;130 million.  This compares to a spend in previous years of &euro;91 million in 2016, &euro;56 million in 2015 and some &euro;37.7 million in 2014. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations.  These include the well established Community Alert Programme, which receives annual funding from my Department, as well as the work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. <\/p><p>On 2 January 2018 I was pleased to announce that my Department will be providing an additional &euro;50,000 in financial support to Community Text Alert Groups as a further measure in this Government's support to crime prevention.  This is in addition to the &euro;100,000 which I announced at the National Ploughing Championships in September 2017.  The Rebate Scheme, which also ran in 2016, will allow Text Alert Groups registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply for funding to contribute towards their yearly running costs.  The Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and I would like to urge groups wishing to participate in the Scheme to contact Muintir na T&iacute;re for more information.  The website is<i>www.muintir.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>Other policing initiatives include Theft Stop which was launched by the Garda&iacute; and the Irish Farmers Association.  Theft Stop is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID (such as an EirCode) and then registered on a nationwide database. <\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country. <\/p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission Investigations","counter":1245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1246,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[24668\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he has examined the GSOC inquiry report on the death of a person (details supplied); the actions he is taking to address the issues raised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":1247,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[24730\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the actions being taken to address the comments made by GSOC in the report it concluded on 29 March 2017 on the complaints made by a person (details supplied) and in particular the reference to improved access to information for victims and their families; the actions taken to address this comment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":1248,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[24731\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the improvements that have been made or actions that have been taken to address the comments regarding a joined up system for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, courts and prison services to talk to each other in view of the comments on a GSOC report in relation to the death of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":1249,"qnumday":543,"qnumall":"[25593\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to improve the sharing of information between court districts and the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order that it would be clear that a defendant has revoked the provisions of bail of a previous court hearing and therefore should not be allowed further leniency as in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1332","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1250,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 483, 487, 488 and 543 together.<\/p>  <p>As the Deputies are aware, the GSOC report into complaints surrounding this tragedy was recently furnished to me.  A copy was also provided to the family of the young man who died in the road traffic incident and subsequently published by GSOC.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that I remind the Deputies that there is still an on-going GSOC investigation and I do not want to say anything that might be considered to prejudice or interfere with that investigation.<\/p>  <p>  The observations that have been provided in the report into improvements that could be made are currently being considered by my officials.  However, I can inform the Deputies that there have been developments already undertaken which should begin to address deficiencies identified in the report.  In relation to all Garda&iacute; being aware of the information which is available to victims, this has been clarified in the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017.  It specifies the list of information which all victims must be given by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when they first come in contact with a victim.  The Act also specifies a long list of information which a victim may opt to receive during the progress of a case. <\/p>  <p>  There is also an onus on the DPP to provide information where it is requested by a victim of crime, a family member of a victim in a fatal case, or a solicitor acting on behalf of either of the aforementioned.  In relation to requesting information from the DPP in respect of a decision not to prosecute, since late 2015 a person can ask the DPP for a summary of reasons for a decision not to prosecute through the Victim Liaison Unit.<\/p>  <p>  If that person is not satisfied with the reasons offered, they can ask the DPP to review the decision.  Such requests are limited to requesting information concerning decisions not to prosecute made on or after 16 November 2015 and in fatal cases, where the death occurred on or after 22 October 2008.<\/p>  <p>  On a general note, the Deputies should be aware that it is the role of the prosecuting authority to bring to the attention of the court any convictions, bail or court orders of which the court needs to be aware prior to reaching a decision on the case before the court. <\/p>  <p>  There is in place an information sharing platform between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service which transmits electronically the outcomes of District Court cases from the Courts Service Criminal Case Tracking system (CCTS) to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Pulse system.  There are plans in place to extend this exchange to other courts in due course.   <\/p>  <p>  As regards cross-border information sharing, the Deputies will be aware of the close relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI and the importance that is attached to cooperation and information-sharing, be it on a police-to-police basis or through other formal mechanisms.  Clearly that principle of the importance of information-sharing should apply to all situations where it is appropriate and practicable to do so.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will appreciate, the comments made by GSOC encompass a number of matters across many agencies.  These matters are being reviewed by officials from my Department and it is my hope that any deficiencies identified by the report will be addressed without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":1251,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1252,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[24695\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of personnel in Roscrea Garda station to date; the number of personnel that were stationed there five and ten years ago, respectively; if his attention has been drawn to the downgrading of the facility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1253,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister have no direct role in the matter.

As Minister I have no role in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength of the Tipperary Division was 398 of whom 20 are assigned to Roscrea Garda Station.  The strength of Roscrea Garda Station in 2008 and in 2013 was 20 and 19 resprectively.  There are also 16 Garda Reserves and 41 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division.

To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide of whom 44 members have been assigned to the Tipperary Division.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March, with a further 200 attesting this Friday.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years.  This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner recently launched a new recruitment drive with a closing date of 7 June.  Successful candidates from this new competition are expected to enter the Garda College in Q2 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, including the Tipperary Division as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":1254,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1255,"qnumday":485,"qnumall":"[24716\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in the determination of an application under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1256,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that, in response to a notification pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), written representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned.<\/p>  <p>  These representations, together with all other information and documentation on file, will be fully considered, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and all other applicable legislation, in advance of a final decision being made.   <\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March, with a further 200 attesting this Friday.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years.  This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment.  To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner recently launched a new recruitment drive with a closing date of 7 June.  Successful candidates from this new competition are expected to enter the Garda College in the second quarter of 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, including the DMR South Division as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Guardian Status","counter":1267,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1268,"qnumday":491,"qnumall":"[24795\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX06100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the position of a central registrar to maintain a record of statutory declarations of guardianship in Ireland can be created; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":1269,"qnumday":547,"qnumall":"[25615\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX06200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if consideration has been given to the establishment of a central register here to maintain a record of statutory declarations of guardianships; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1270,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 491 and 547 together.<\/p>  <p>There are provisions in place to facilitate non-marital fathers who have an ongoing relationship with their children to become guardians of their children.  Section 2(4A) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 (as inserted by section 43(c) of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) provides for joint guardianship for a father who is not married to the mother of the child and has cohabited with the mother for not less than 12 consecutive months.  This 12 month period must include a period, occurring at any time after the birth of the child, of not less than three months during which both the mother and father have lived with the child.  This provision came into operation on 18 January 2016. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a father who is not married to the child's mother and does not satisfy the cohabitation requirements may become a guardian if the parents jointly make a statutory declaration appointing him as a guardian.  It is also open to the father at any stage to make an application to court for guardianship of the child under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964. <\/p>  <p>  During the passage of the Children and Family Relationships Bill through the Oireachtas, my predecessor gave consideration to the establishment of a Central Register for Statutory Declarations of guardianship.  While considering that such a centralised repository may have some value, she was concerned that it should not become or be perceived as a necessary step in the acquisition of guardianship.  She considered that the existing statutory declaration mechanism to make certain parents guardians was readily accessible, cheap and straightforward, and the introduction of guardianship for fathers who satisfy the cohabitation requirement would widen the cohort of fathers who would have joint guardianship. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that there are issues concerning security, data protection, data management and the financial implications of creating a new registration system which would need to be addressed before such a centralised register could be established.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue that would require careful consideration is that if a system is created whereby failure to register a statutory declaration could mean that a person would not be a guardian, this could have the entirely unintended consequence of making guardianship more difficult to obtain than it is at present. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has responsibility for the Civil Registration Acts.  The Deputy may be aware that section 17 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 provides for the appointment of registrars in each registration area to carry out functions under that Act such as the registration of births and deaths.  The creation of a new post of a Central Registrar to maintain a record of statutory declarations of guardianship would require specific provision in primary legislation.  The creation of such a post would seem unnecessary in view of Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004, including providing for the taking and receiving of statutory declarations in relation to guardianship.  Section 27A of the Civil Registration Act 2004 (as inserted by section 97 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) provides that a registrar may, during the period of 14 days immediately following the date on which the birth of a child is registered or re-registered, take and receive a statutory declaration of guardianship made under section 2(4)(e) or 6B(4)(c) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 in respect of a child. <\/p>  <p>  No provision of Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 has yet been commenced.  Some sections cannot be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 relating to donor assisted human reproduction (DAHR) are brought into operation by the Minister for Health.  For example, statutory declarations cannot be made under section 6B(4)(c) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 in respect of children born as a result of DAHR until the provisions of the 2015 Act relating to DAHR have been commenced by the Minister for Health.  The commencement of other sections of Part 9 is dependent on provisions of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 being commenced.  My Department is liaising with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in relation to scheduling the commencement of these sections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200080#WRX06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Training","counter":1272,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200081#WRY00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1273,"qnumday":492,"qnumall":"[24856\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200081#WRY00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; in each district in the Dublin region who have completed the CBD level-three driving course in each of the years 2016 and 2017 and to date in 2018; when this course will be next run; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1274,"content":"<p>As you will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who has statutory responsibility for carrying on and managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including training and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

Support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address available for this purpose - communitycctv@justice.ie. In addition, the criteria for the installation and operation by authorised persons of the CCTV system in specified areas has been established. <\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Policing Authority, under section 38(11) of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, is required to issue guidelines to the Garda Commissioner concerning the supervision and control by the Commissioner of the monitoring of CCTV by authorised persons.  I can confirm to the Deputy that while the Authority has not issued guidelines under section 38(11) as yet, my Department is engaging with the Authority on the issue.<\/p><p>As mentioned above my Department has issued a Code of Practice For Community based CCTV systems which is available from our website at .

Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort, which could not be justified where there are other significant demands on resources. <\/p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that special arrangements are in place for prisoners who have been identified as being at risk, whereby they are placed in either a Safety Observation Cell or Close Supervision Cell on special observation and checked every 15 minutes. Prisoners who may have received bad news (for example a bereavement) are also closely monitored. There is a clear distinction between Safety Observation Cells which are used only for medical health reasons and Close Supervision Cells which are used for managing violent, disruptive or distressed prisoners.<\/p>  <p>  The restriction of a prisoner's regime can occur due to a number of factors, including the protection of vulnerable prisoners.  This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his\/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him\/her.<\/p>  <p>  Under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007 a Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that Caherciveen Garda station is open to the public from 9am to 5pm Monday to Sunday.  It is important to remember that while the Garda station in question has reduced opening hours to the public, it is a functioning Garda station on a 24 hour basis.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division which ensures local Garda management has the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational needs and address critical issues as they arise taking account of, amongst other factors,  the incidence of crime and crime trends in each District in the Division.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware Caherciveen forms part of the Killarney Garda District.  I am further informed that on 30 April 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available the strength of the District was 107, including one Superintendent District officer based in District Headquarters, in Killarney Garda Station, and 18 Garda&iacute; assigned to Caherciveen Garda Station.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. <\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 29 to the Kerry Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March, with a further 200 attesting this Friday. Furthermore, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 by 2021 will require some 1,600 more Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next two years. This is an ambitious programme of accelerated recruitment. To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner recently launched a new recruitment drive with a closing date of 7 June. Successful candidates from this new competition are expected to enter the Garda College in the second quarter of 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the investment in more Garda&iacute;, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute;. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda District, including the Killarney District as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Education Service","counter":1341,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1342,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[25098\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the participation rates of prisoners in education during their sentences by prison; the budget for the provision of such services in 2017 and to date in 2018; the access to education for prisoners on restricted regimes; the number of prisoners completing further or higher education; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1343,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that from 01 January 2018 to end April 2018, 31.85% of the overall prison population attended the prison education centres.

The group was tasked in particular to address the needs of children and families as highlighted in the report published by the Irish Penal Reform Trust entitled &lsquo;Picking up the Pieces: The rights and needs of children and families affected by imprisonment.&rsquo;<\/p>  <p>  A key element of this is the provision of appropriate child and family friendly visiting facilities.<\/p>  <p>  Prison Visitor Centres, which are partly funded by the Irish Prison Service, play a vital role in humanising the visiting experience of prisoner families through the provision of refreshments, befriending and child play services. There are visitor centres in the West Dublin, Mountjoy and Midlands campus and they are run by the St Vincent de Paul. <\/p>  <p>  The West Dublin Campus visitor centres provides a hospitality\/family support service which includes information provision on a wide range of issues. There are childcare areas which provide toys, arts and crafts. A similar provision is made at Mountjoy and the Midlands. <\/p>  <p>  Bedford Row operates a family friendly hospitality Centre at Limerick Prison. This is part funded by the Irish Prison Service and includes the dispensing of refreshments, the giving out of play material to children and also befriending and information provision. Targeted work with prisoners children is also a focus of the work of the Centre. <\/p>  <p>  Cork and Castlerea have smaller visitor centres which are run by local community groups.  Castlerea has recently constructed a new visitor area, which includes enhanced family visit spaces. <\/p>  <p>  All prisons have designated areas to facilitate family visits which include a family friendly space, round tables or family seating and access to play materials. <\/p>  <p>  In addition temporary release for access\/visits to children for family occasions is regularly approved in most prisons. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service targets family friendly training to &lsquo;front of house&rsquo; staff, which aims to improve staff awareness of the effects of imprisonment on families and allows staff to appropriately support families and children visiting prisons. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service also provide training in Children First to all staff, which ensures that any child protection and welfare concerns are dealt with appropriately.  Each prison has a Child Safeguarding Statement, as required under the Children First Act 2015 and one or more Designated Liaison Persons, who are the main point of contact in each prison for child welfare. <\/p>  <p>  All of our prisons facilitate visits on Saturdays to take account of the needs of families visiting persons in custody. Sunday visits are allowed at the two Open Centres and at Cloverhill. <\/p>  <p>  The Families and Imprisonment Group carried out surveys in 2018 at Visitor Centres and also engaged in Family Forums, in order to consult with families and children visiting prisons.  The learning from these will be used to further develop family and child friendly visiting facilities in all prisons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":1353,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1354,"qnumday":519,"qnumall":"[25112\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his views on the findings of a report (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1355,"content":"<p>The <i>Report of the Working Group to Report to Government on Improvements to the Protection Process, including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers,<\/i>also known as the Justice McMahon report, was published in June 2015. Its recommendations have implications for a number of Government Departments and services. <\/p><p>My Department has since published three progress reports on the implementation of its 173 recommendations; the first in June 2016, the second in February of 2017 and a third and final report in July of 2017. All three reports are available to view on my Department's website www.justice.ie.  <\/p><p>The final progress report shows that 133 recommendations have been reported as fully implemented and a further 36 are in progress or partially implemented. This represents a 98% full or partial implementation rate.<\/p><p>The Working Paper dated December 2017, referred to by the Deputy, acknowledges that considerable progress has been made, and in particular highlights as &ldquo;significant improvements&rdquo; developments such as the introduction of the Single Procedure in the International Protection Act, 2015; general improvements in living conditions; and the Government&rsquo;s decision to opt-in to the Reception Conditions Directive.<\/p><p>The improvements to living conditions for applicants for international protection have been significant over recent years. These include the implementation of self or communal catering arrangements in a number of accommodation centres. As a result of this initiative, over 1,500 residents are now able to prepare meals of their own choosing.  In addition, there have been improvements to a number of outdoor playgrounds and football pitches to provide for &lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; facilities and the introduction of teenagers rooms in centres to provide social areas for this age group.  Friends of the Centre groups have also been established in each centre.  This initiative aims to bring residents, community and voluntary groups together with a view to increasing integration opportunities and providing for the development of greater community linkages with the residents and the centre.<\/p><p>Following on from the McMahon Report, a Standards Advisory Group was set up in 2017.  The work of this group is to build on the recommendations of McMahon and to develop a set of standards for accommodation provided for those people seeking the protection of the State. The Standards will meet the minimum standards set out in the Recast Reception Conditions Directive and EASO Guidance on Reception Conditions: Operational Standards and Indicators and will also take account of national developments in the provision of services to those in the protection process. They will take due cognisance of the responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of  employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by policies and plans as defined by the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty. The group is comprised of members from a range of organisations supporting refugees as well as staff from a number of government Departments and will deliver a Working Document in September 2018 following widespread consultation.<\/p><p>The Government approved an opt into the EU (Recast) Reception Conditions Directive (2013\/33\/EU). The decision to opt-in to the Directive will bring Ireland into line with our EU partners and place the entire system on a legislative basis, which will be subject to EU oversight. This is a significant and positive measure, not only in addressing the issue of labour market access, but also extending to children&rsquo;s rights, rights for unaccompanied minors, vulnerable people, new appeals processes, healthcare and education provision. By opting into the Directive, another important recommendation of the Justice McMahon report will be implemented bringing Ireland into line with the European Union norms.  <b><i><\/i><\/b><\/p><p>I remain fully committed to working with all stakeholders, some of whom will have differing views on the extent of implementation of some recommendations, to ensure the continuing implementation of a wide range of reforms in this area, including those recommended by the Justice McMahon report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Data","counter":1356,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1357,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[25120\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of stolen firearms that were used in crimes in each of the years 2013 to 2017 and to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1358,"content":"<p>I have requested this information from the Garda authorities and I will contact the Deputy directly when the report is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Accommodation Provision","counter":1359,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1360,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[25127\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps he will take to preserve the courthouse building in Kanturk, County Cork: if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the building has been damaged by vandals in recent weeks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1283","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1361,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998 management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions. <\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has advised that Kanturk Courthouse was closed as a court venue in 2010.

Further, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in these matters. Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Reserve on the 30 April 2018 was 562, 27 of whom are attached to the Limerick Division. It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013. The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways: firstly, since 2014, 246 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, resources in both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Public Appointments Service (PAS) have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. <\/p><p>The &quot;Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures. In line with this, the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021. <\/p><p>With the plan to reach 15,000 Garda members well on track, it was possible for the Commissioner and the Public Appointments Service to undertake a new recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves last March. That competition attracted 2,394 applicants of whom 498 successfully completed the initial stages carried out by PAS. These applications are currently being processed by the Garda Appointments Office. The time frame for this can vary due to a number factors, including the length of the vetting process which may, for example, be more time consuming if the applicant has resided abroad or is deferred for medical reasons. It is expected that the first of the successful candidates will commence training in the Garda College in the coming months.<\/p><p>In conjunction with the major expansion of the Reserve over the next number of years, we must ensure that it is used optimally to support effective policing. To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority to be completed in the first half of the year as set out in the Policing Plan 2018. <\/p><p>As a first step, the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement. This is intended to ensure that its development and deployment is viewed more broadly through a community policing lens. This is a very welcome step as it is my strong view that the greatest dividend to be gained from the Reserve is in terms of a visible presence on the ground and engaging with local communities.<\/p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the tables the number of Reserves in each of the years requested by the Deputy in tabular form. I also include a table setting out the total number of Garda Reserves who have commenced training as a Garda Trainee from 2007 up to May 2018. Please note, that due to the moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 there was no recruitment of Garda Trainees from 2010 until 2014. <\/p><p><b>Garda Reserve 2006 -

(Capacity) Act 2015<\/td><td>The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the DSS to begin. The remaining provisions of the Act for which the Minister for Justice and Equality has responsibility have not yet been commenced.<br \/><br \/>The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides for a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.<\/td><td>The key preparations are being put in place to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. The Director, who was appointed in October 2017, is also working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the Decision Support Service can be up and running as quickly as possible. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations.  <br \/><br \/>Every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible. The Department has received an outline implementation plan from the Director which contains monthly milestones for realisation of the objective of an active DSS.  As time goes on, every effort will be made by all sides to achieve tightening of the timeframes where possible and the situation will continue to be monitored closely by the Steering Group.\u3000<br \/><br \/> <br \/><br \/>While it is not possible at the moment to provide an exact timeframe for the full commencement of the 2015 Act, every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Children and Family Relationships Act 2015<\/td><td>Parts 2 and 3 of the Act (Sections 4 to 42 inclusive) which provide for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR). <br \/><br \/>Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR have not yet been commenced as they are linked to Parts 2 and 3.  <br \/><br \/>Part 9 of the Act (sections 92 to 99 inclusive) provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  No provision of Part 9 has yet been commenced.  <br \/><br \/>Part 11 of the Act (Sections 101 to 134 inclusive) in relation to adoption has not been commenced. This Part of the Act was repealed by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017.<br \/><br \/>Section 177 of the Act in relation to amendment of the Adoptive Leave act 1995<\/td><td>The commencement of Parts 2 and 3, relating to donor-assisted human reproduction, is a matter for the Department of Health.<br \/><br \/>Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR have not yet been commenced as they are linked to Parts 2 and 3 and cannot be commenced until those Parts are commenced.<br \/><br \/>Some sections of Part 9 cannot be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 are brought into operation.  Other sections are dependent on provisions of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 being commenced. The Department is liaising with the Department of Social Protection in relation to scheduling the commencement of these sections.<br \/><br \/>Part 11 relating to adoption has now been repealed by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017.<br \/><br \/>Following adoption of the 34th amendment to the Constitution and its subsequent legislative changes, my Department identified a lacuna in the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 that prevents male same-sex married couples from availing of adoptive leave and benefits.<br \/><br \/>To address this lacuna, my Department has prepared draft legislative proposals that will amend the Adoptive Leave Act and will afford the same entitlements to adoptive leave and benefits to all couples who are married, co-habiting or who are in a civil partnership, irrespective of gender.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Civil Debt (Procedures) Act 2015<\/td><td>Entire Act <\/td><td>Commencement requires systems to be put in place in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to handle deductions from social welfare payments, and Rules of Court to enable the District Court to deal with the enforcement of court orders (abolition of imprisonment for debtors) and in respect of the processes for attachment of earnings and for the relevant District Court hearings under the Act.  <br \/><br \/>Contact is being maintained with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in relation to commencement matters.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017<\/td><td>Whole Act<\/td><td>Enacted on 15 November 2017. <br \/><br \/>Rules of Court have to be prepared in relation to the provisions of the Act regarding periodic payments orders before they can be commenced.

These arrangements include, inter alia, piloting and testing the DNA Database System for international data exchange and obtaining EU Council approval before personal data can be provided to other Member States. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) (Amendment) Act 2015<\/td><td>Sections 24 and 34 (in so far as S. 65(4A) of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 (15\/1994) inserted by that section relates to S.60D of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 (7\/2008))<\/td><td>Both sections refer to the provision of financial penalties.

At Report stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann the section to increase the penalty for incest by a female was deleted. The General Scheme of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2018 provides that the penalty for incest for a male and a female be equalised at 10 years. Part 5 will not be commenced until the provisions of this Bill have been considered by the Oireachtas.<br \/><br \/>This section provides for an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act 2010 and is consequential to Part 5 of the Bill relating to incest.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Criminal Justice (Suspended Sentences of Imprisonment) Act 2017<\/td><td>Entire Act<\/td><td>District Court Rules required to facilitate commencement of the Act are being finalised.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Data Protection Act 2018<\/td><td>Section 7(3) (insofar as it relates to the revocation of the Data Protection Act 1988 (Section 5(1)(d)) (Specification) Regulations 1993 (S.I.

Put simply, it is not an option for a Member State to unilaterally prohibit a category of processing activities which might otherwise be lawful under Article 6.1(f). Since commencement of Section 30 could, therefore, give rise to a substantial risk of infringement proceedings against the State pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, I have requested my Department to clarify the matter with the European Commission.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Domestic Violence Act 2018<\/td><td>Whole Act<\/td><td>Enacted on 8 May 2018.<br \/><br \/>Rules of Court have to be prepared in relation to the provisions of the Act regarding civil domestic violence orders before they can be commenced.

Under this programme the Government pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State including through the recently announced IRPP Humanitarian Assistance Programme (IHAP), which will provide for the admission of up to 530 immediate family members of Irish citizens, persons with Convention refugee or subsidiary protection status and persons with programme refugee status.  <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the IRPP for resettling Syrian refugees requires a high level of coordination among service delivery agencies at both national and local level.  Service provision is mainstreamed and all the main statutory service providers such as Government departments, the HSE, Tusla and Local Authorities are represented on the national Taskforce which oversees delivery of the programme.  In general, coordination is ensured via the IRPP which is part of the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) within my Department. OPMI is the primary entity responsible for delivering resettlement via a range of statutory and non-statutory agencies. It has overseen the humanitarian resettlement programmes run by Ireland since they were established in 2000.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is mobilising European Union Funding under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) in support of Ireland's resettlement efforts, including to fund supports provided through local authorities to the refugees.  Local authorities play a critical role in ensuring the success of each resettlement through the provision of housing and the implementation of a process carried out by an \"implementing partner\" with expertise in community integration and relevant supports.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the Irish Red Cross which was assigned responsibility by the Government for administering public pledges of support, especially in the area of accommodation.  Its case workers and support team work closely with IRPP and refugees to find suitable accommodation options.  <\/p>  <p>  Programme refugees have the right to work in Ireland.  Supports are provided under the auspices of the programme to enable them to be in a position to secure employment.  These include:<\/p>  <p>  - The IRPP liaises with the Department of Education and Skills and the local Education and Training Board in each catchment area to ensure that groups receive a Language Training and Cultural Orientation programme and to facilitate access to education.   <\/p>  <p>  - Free childcare is provided wherever possible to allow the adults to attend the Language and Orientation programme in their Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC). <\/p>  <p>  - Local service providers, volunteers and NGOs visit the EROCs to provide services and information and to support and befriend the asylum seekers or refugees. <\/p>  <p>  Increasingly, the IRPP is focusing on initiatives which assist with labour market activation for refugees and is working with the Irish Red Cross and other bodies to facilitate access to employment. Various initiatives are also developing in the educational sphere.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to integration more generally, the Migrant Integration Strategy, which was published on 7 February 2017, offers a blueprint for Government action to promote the integration of all migrants who are legally in the State, including refugees, for the period to 2020.  It sees integration as a two-way process involving action by migrants and non-migrants alike.  The Strategy comprises 76 specific actions under a number of themes to be implemented by Government Departments and Agencies, the business sector, employers, local authorities and community and voluntary sector organisations.  The Employment and Pathways to Work theme contains actions designed to enable migrants, including refugees, to participate in employment.  Among other actions, the Strategy requires Government Departments and agencies to address integration in strategy statements; to ensure appropriate, regular engagement with NGOs representing migrant groups; and to provide intercultural awareness training. <\/p>  <p>  The strategy includes targeted initiatives to promote migrant entrepreneurship, to encourage migrants into the Civil Service and onto State boards and to improve English language provision in education and training.  It is accompanied by a Communities Integration Fund which provides funding for 131 initiatives by community organisations aimed at promoting migrant integration and facilitating social inclusion at the local level.  <\/p>  <p>  The strategy is available on the website of the Office for Promotion for Migrant Integration at www.integration.ie. <\/p>  <p>  It is my firm intention that the model of integration and support is one which will evolve and develop over the coming months and years with a view to offering refugees increasing opportunities to enhance their own lives.  It is for this reason I am examining initiatives such as community sponsorship to support the long-term integration process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":1372,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1373,"qnumday":526,"qnumall":"[25227\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in respect of an appeal for a visa by a person (details supplied); when a decision is likely to be finalised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1374,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned was refused a long-stay Join Family Visa on 04 April 2018, and an appeal was received in the Visa Office in Dublin on 05 June 2018.<\/p><p>Appeals are processed in the order in which they are received in order to be fair to all applicants.

Appeals in respect of negative first instance protection recommendations are considered by the statutorily independent International Protection Appeals Tribunal, which replaced the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).<\/p><p>The fact that scheduling times have lengthened in the IPO can be attributed to a number of reasons. <\/p><p>Firstly, as part of the transition arrangements for the new single procedure process, the IPO was required to take responsibility for the processing of over 3,000 cases which were not finalised by the former ORAC or RAT. These applications reverted for processing under the transitional provisions of the 2015 Act and added significantly to the IPO caseload. All of these transitional cases had to be contacted individually by the IPO to inform them of the relevant provisions of the 2015 Act and how the transitional provisions would affect their applications. All applicants received comprehensive documentation including a new Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) which, on return, had to be translated and associated with the relevant files. This process meant that the IPO was not fully up and running in terms of interviewing until the second quarter of 2017. The concentration on the elimination of the inherited backlog, in line with the system of prioritisation agreed with the UNHCR, has also reduced the ability of the IPO to address more current cases.<\/p><p>Secondly, there was a 30% increase in applications for international protection in 2017 (including EU relocation applicants) which has put additional pressure on the processing system. In addition, applications for international protection have also increased in 2018 (to end May) by over 30% as compared with the same period in 2017.<\/p><p>Thirdly, the 2015 Act substantially changed the processing arrangements for the consideration of applications for international protection and for permission to remain decisions by introducing a more comprehensive single procedure. On the one hand, this development has, of course,  resulted in a more streamlined system enabling all the grounds for a person to remain in the State to be determined as part of one process in the IPO. However, compared with the jurisdiction at first instance of the former ORAC, which considered applications for refugee status alone, caseworkers in the IPO are required to investigate applications on the basis of three comprehensive elements namely; whether the applicant is a refugee or, if not; whether the applicant is eligible for subsidiary protection or, if not and thirdly, are there grounds to grant a person humanitarian permission to remain in the State.  While considering all aspects together does, of course, create economies of scale in investigating applications as part of a more streamlined single procedure process, the level of investigation required is more comprehensive and consequently more time consuming.  <\/p><p>In terms of progress to date, I can inform the Deputy that considerable work has been undertaken to get the new process up and running. For example, in terms of scheduling of interviews, the IPO scheduled over 2,400 single procedure interviews (including in respect of EU relocation cases) in 2017. In 2018 (to end May), some 1500 interviews have been scheduled.<\/p><p>In relation to recommendations\/decisions, some 1,780<b><\/b>recommendations\/decisions in respect of international protection and permission to remain were made by the IPO in 2017. This included some 750 recommendations in respect of the grant of international protection<i>.<\/i>In addition, some 1,634 recommendations\/decisions have been made by the IPO in 2018 (to end May 2018).  This includes international protection recommendations (including EU relocation cases), permission to remain decisions and permission to remain reviews. For 2018, there were some 572 international protection grants and over 100 grants of permission to remain made by the IPO. All 2018 figures are provisional.<\/p><p>Based on current predictions, the IPO is in line to make some 3,500 recommendations and decisions in 2018. <\/p><p>Considerable additional resources have and are being allocated to the IPO to assist it in undertaking its statutory functions with a view to processing the volume of cases on hands as soon as possible. As at the beginning of June 2018, the current staffing complement in the IPO is 135. In addition, there are some 55 serving members of the IPO Case Processing Panel. To enable the IPO to carry out their functions to optimum effect and to assist in the reduction of caseloads, the current Case Processing Panel is being further expanded at the present time on the basis of public advertisement.<\/p><p>The resources assigned to the IPO, as well as work processes in that organisation, are being kept under ongoing review and additional resources will be allocated as these become available so that the cases on hand, both those applications preceding the commencement of the 2015 Act and the increased volume of new applications, are dealt with as quickly as possible and waiting times for those applying for international protection are reduced to the greatest possible extent. <\/p><p>It is recognised that currently many applicants for international protection are waiting longer than they should for their first instance interviews in the IPO and to have their cases decided.  While the structural causes of delays have been removed with the commencement of the International Protection Act, 2015, the main challenge now faced is the need to quickly eradicate the substantial number of cases carried over from the previous system.  As I indicated, these challenges are being addressed by deploying increased resources and a continual assessment and reform of the use of those resources and, having due regard to the requirements of the International Protection Act 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1390,"content":"<p>Question No. 532 answered with Question No. 514.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":1391,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ05700"},{"type":"question","counter":1392,"qnumday":533,"qnumall":"[25461\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200082#WRZ05800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that have been injured in the line of duty; the number of injuries and types of injuries in each of the years 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1311","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1393,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for carrying on and managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I, as Minister have no direct role in the matter.<\/p><p>I know the Deputy will agree that we should never underestimate the difficulties and dangers the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na face on our behalf and the courage required to face down criminals in dangerous circumstances.

The Lisbon Treaty extended this competence to cover foreign direct investment, as well as making the European Parliament a co-legislator alongside the Council on trade matters.  The European Commission acts as lead negotiator on behalf of all EU countries regarding trade agreements with non-EU countries.  Member States (in Council) approve negotiating directives (or mandates) before negotiations begin, are kept informed of developments as the negotiations proceed and have final approval at Council.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is currently negotiating a trade agreement with the four founding members of Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay).  If concluded an EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement would be the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date, four times the size of the trade agreement with Japan.<\/p>  <p>  As with any Free Trade Agreement negotiations, Ireland, like all Member States, has defensive as well as offensive trade interests.  We are mindful of the cumulative impact of EU FTAs on specific sectors like agriculture and the challenges they face.  Officials from my Department continue to be engaged, through the Trade Policy Committee, in highlighting the importance of maintaining the balance between the EU&rsquo;s defensive and offensive interests.  Equally, when the Commission has reported on progress in these negotiations to Trade Ministers in Council, I have set out Ireland&rsquo;s key interests.  Furthermore insofar as our defensive interests in agriculture are concerned, both An Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine have also engaged with their counterparts.  <\/p>  <p>  The Commission may present some EU trade agreements as 'EU-only' meaning that all the policy areas they cover fall under the sole responsibility of the EU institutions.  Other agreements may be presented as 'mixed' where they have areas of shared responsibility between the EU and Member States.  Only at the conclusion of negotiations and when the Commission presents an Agreement to Council can an agreement be determined definitely as being 'EU-only' or &lsquo;mixed&rsquo;.  Were a deal to be concluded between the EU and Mercosur in 2018, the relevant text would proceed to so-called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo;, and translation, a process which can take up to two years to complete.  The ratification process regarding individual trade agreements must be taken on a case-by-case basis depending on the issues comprehended in the final agreement.  Where appropriate, my Department seeks legal advice on the appropriate ratification process to follow in each case.<\/p>  <p>  Mixed agreements enter into force only once each individual EU Member State has approved it in line with its own National procedures.  As this process may take several years, the Council can decide to provisionally apply an agreement ('provisional application').  Provisional Application generally applies to those parts of the agreement over which the EU has exclusive competence.  The extent of EU only competence was addressed comprehensively in the 2017 Opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the EU-Singapore FTA case.  Provisional Application requires the agreement by Council and ratification by the European Parliament. <\/p>  <p>  As regards the more general issue of the benefits and opportunities arising from Free Trade Agreements, my Department is currently in the process of undertaking a comprehensive study which will examine in depth the economic impact and opportunities of existing and forthcoming EU Free Trade Agreements, including with Mercosur.  The analysis from the study will inform the Department and relevant agencies in setting the policy framework required for Irish businesses to take full advantage of concluded trade agreements and preferential trade access, and to prepare for future opportunities; including Mercosur.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200084#WRBB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Programme for Government Implementation","counter":1474,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200084#WRBB01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1475,"qnumday":564,"qnumall":"[24570\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200084#WRBB01900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of the implementation of the programme for partnership Government as it applies to her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1476,"content":"<p>A key objective of the Programme for Partnership Government, from the perspective of my Department, is to provide a supportive environment for enterprise and employment and to deliver sustainable full employment. In the Programme, my Department was tasked with supporting a leap forward in the capacity and performance of our enterprise sector and delivering an environment that is conducive to the creation and maintenance of quality employment. We have set a target of 200,000 extra jobs by 2020, with 135,000 of these to be in locations outside Dublin. The latest statistics show that employment continues to grow strongly:<\/p>  <p>  -  97,500 jobs were created between Q2 2016 and Q4 2017, bringing total employment to 2,225,100.<\/p>  <p>  -  Full time employment increased by 7.8% (from 1,632,900 to 1,761,800) from Q2 2016 to Q4 2017.<\/p>  <p>  -  Unemployment decreased nationally from 204,900 in Q2 2016 to 151,500 in Q4 2017, with the monthly unemployment rate now at 5.8% in May 2018. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to regional employment, the statistics are encouraging:<\/p>  <p>  -  From Q2 2016 to Q2 2017, employment outside of Dublin grew by 3.0% compared to a growth of 1.3% in Dublin.  <\/p>  <p>  -  Employment increased in all eight regions over the twelve month period to Q2 2017.<\/p>  <p>  -  The unemployment rate decreased in all regions from Q2 2016 &ndash; Q2 2017.<\/p>  <p>  -  Labour Force Survey data shows that 84% of the increase in employment in the year to Q2 2017 was outside Dublin.<\/p>  <p>IDA Ireland continues to work to attract foreign direct investment to Ireland. The agency created 10,684 net new jobs over the course of 2017, with every region in Ireland posting net gains in jobs.  At the end of 2017 there were 210,443 people working in IDA Ireland client companies, the highest in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s history.  This figure surpasses the five-year target of 209,000 which was set in 2015 in the &ldquo;Winning: Foreign Direct Investment&rdquo; strategy. The IDA is continuing to work towards other objectives set out in this strategy, especially that of increasing the level of investment by between 30% and 40% in each region outside Dublin by 2019. Strong progress was made in this respect in 2017, with 45% of IDA Ireland supported jobs created located outside Dublin. Through its Regional Property Programme, the IDA is also developing appropriate property solutions in designated regional locations to attract overseas investment.<\/p>  <p>  In the indigenous sector, 2017 was a very strong year for job creation among Enterprise Ireland clients with 19,332 new jobs created. 2017 resulted in the highest client employment in the history of the agency, highest net job creation in the history of the agency and the lowest number of job losses since 1998. There was positive net jobs growth in every county across the country, with 65% of new job creation outside of Dublin. Employment in Local Enterprise Office client companies now stands at 37,485 with 3,760 net new jobs were created in 2017. <\/p>  <p>My Department is focused on addressing the challenges that Brexit poses for business, and we established a dedicated Brexit Unit in 2016 to lead on the coordination of the Department&rsquo;s policy and operational responses to Brexit, including our approach to the negotiations within the EU and bilateral relations with the UK. In November 2017, we published &ldquo;Building Stronger Business: Responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and trading&rdquo;. This paper summarises impacts of Brexit across key policy areas within the Department and outlines the policy and operational measures underway and planned by the Department and its Agencies to respond to Brexit, including supports available to companies to help them prepare for Brexit. The recently launched Agile Innovation Fund, launched in 2017, helps companies use innovation to mitigate risks posed by Brexit. Companies are already seeing that such initiatives increase business resilience and add value, whatever the full impacts of Brexit may be. We also provide regular input and advice to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on key issues for Ireland in the context of the negotiations including exit issues, transition, arrangements for framework for the future relationship.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Trade, according to CSO merchandise trade and balance of payments data, total exports have increased by 58 percent since 2012 to &euro;283.7billion in 2017.  The Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo;, supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification as well as ambitious targets for trade and investment. These include increasing our indigenous exports to reach &euro;26 billion by 2020 &ndash; up by 26% from 2015, generating 30,000 more jobs in tourism by 2020 and &euro;5 billion in overseas tourism revenues by 2025, and securing 900 new foreign direct investments in the period 2015-2019. In relation to Brexit, the target is to intensify and diversify 80% of indigenous export growth to 2020 to be outside of the UK market and maintain exports of at least &euro;7.5 billion to the UK. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched its Eurozone Strategy as a key element of its supports to help companies diversify their export markets. In particular, it aims to increase exports to the Eurozone by &euro;2bn per annum by 2020, equivalent to 50 percent increase. This would represent one of the most significant shifts in Enterprise Ireland supported client exports into the Eurozone and is particularly important in the context of Brexit.  More recently, Government&rsquo;s Enterprise 2025 Renewed strategy published in March 2018 sets out targets for export growth and diversification within the indigenous exporting base, with ambitions to increase exports as a percentage of total sales of Irish owned companies from 52 percent to between 55 and 60 percent by 2020 and increase Enterprise Ireland client exports beyond UK markets from &euro;14.1 billion to &euro;17.4 billion by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government commits to alleviating pressures on household budgets and, in this context, the work of the Personal Injuries Commission, established in January 2017, will play an important role in helping to address the cost of motor insurance in Ireland, complementing the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group. The first report of the Commission was published in December 2017 and work is progressing on the Commission&rsquo;s final report, which will focus predominately on benchmarking of Irish motor insurance personal injury awards with those in other jurisdictions. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also focusing on the introduction of a number of additional supports for business. A Taking Care of Business event was held in Dublin Castle in November 2017 at which nearly 500 members of the business community &ndash; including SMEs, start-ups, entrepreneurs and business students &ndash;engaged face to face with 30 state agencies, offices and services to learn about the broad range of advice and support that are available for their business. A number of representative bodies from industry also came together to support the event. A further regional event is planned for 25th September in the Mid-West. A new Employment Permits Online System was launched in September 2016, achieving a 95% take-up rate in the first two weeks. This high rate of take-up has continued since then.  Under the new system, the application to decision time can take as little as 5-7 working days to complete, an excellent timeframe by international comparison. <\/p>  <p>  In April, my Department published its Statement of Strategy for the 2018-2021 period and this outlines the many areas where my Department will maintain focus over that timeframe to deliver on our commitments under the Programme for Partnership Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200084#WRBB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","counter":1477,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200084#WRBB02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1478,"qnumday":565,"qnumall":"[25139\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200084#WRBB02200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if options for the promotion of second level schools for international students through Enterprise Ireland will be examined; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1267","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1479,"content":"<p>My colleague Richard Bruton TD, Minister for Education, has policy responsibility for the International Education Strategy for Ireland, 2016 - 2020.

This followed the expiry of temporary exemptions granted to the EU in respect of the original Presidential Proclamations imposing these tariffs from the 23rd March 2018.  The measures were introduced following an investigation by the US Department of Commerce into the effect of those industries on US national security.  Ireland is deeply disappointed by the US decision to end the temporary exemption tariffs on steel and aluminium which had been granted to EU.  <\/p>  <p>  The EU is of the view that these tariffs are unjustified and in conflict with WTO rules.  Over the past number of months, the EU, Ireland and other Member States have engaged with the US at all possible levels and with other partners to find a solution to the problem of overcapacity in the steel sector.  These were issues I raised with Commerce Secretary Ross during my recent visit to Washington in May.  I regret that these efforts, by the EU Trade Commissioner, Ireland and other Member States have not resulted in the EU being provided with a permanent exemption from US tariffs.  The EU has continually indicated its openness to discuss ways to improve bilateral trade relations but has been clear that any talks must be preceded by a permanent exemption.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the EU Commission in its determination to fully protect the EU&rsquo;s commercial interests from US steel and aluminium tariffs, in a WTO compatible manner.  This includes the launching of proceedings against the US at the WTO, the imposition of rebalancing tariff measures (i.e. withdrawing tariff concessions on a number of imports from the US) and the possible imposition of safeguard measures (import quotas or tariffs to shield EU producers from a sudden influx of steel or aluminium into the EU market that would have ordinarily been destined for the US market).  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the company referenced, its main activity is the production of alumina which is then exported for further processing to aluminium. I understand that the company does not directly export to the US and that the tariffs in question may therefore have limited immediate direct impact. However, it may be the case that customers of the firm could be affected. The IDA is therefore closely engaging with the company to determine the potential scope of any impact and we will continue to closely monitor the situation as it evolves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200084#WRBB04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Science Foundation Ireland Staff","counter":1502,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200084#WRBB04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1503,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[25667\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200084#WRBB04800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if Science Foundation Ireland has filled the post of head of international within the agency; if not, when this post will be filled; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1504,"content":"<p>Science Foundation Ireland has filled the post of Head of International.

In its conclusion it stated that as a\u00a0first step current voluntary initiatives\u00a0by industry should be allowed to develop further so as to provide a list of ingredients and nutrition declaration. The Commission invited\u00a0industry to present a self-regulatory proposal that would cover the entire sector of alcoholic beverages. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission\u00a0would then\u00a0assess the industry's proposal\u00a0and\u00a0if it was considered that the self-regulatory approach proposed by industry was unsatisfactory, the Commission\u00a0would then launch an impact assessment to review further available options, in line with Better Regulation principles.<\/p>  <p>  On the 12 March 2018,\u00a0the alcoholic beverage industry submitted a self-regulatory proposal to the Commission which consisted of a joint self-regulatory proposal from the European alcoholic beverages sectors on the provision of nutrition and ingredients listing. \u00a0The proposal includes guiding principles and separate labelling proposals for each beverage sector, i.e. spirits drinks, wine, beer, cider and fruit wines.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal does not contain a harmonised approach across all alcoholic beverage sectors and suggests that in certain cases some information could be provided &ldquo;off label&rdquo;, i.e. on websites or other electronic platforms. The matter is currently being considered by the Commission to determine if EU regulation will be proposed rather than the voluntary labelling programme.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At a more global level, under the auspices of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, there are indications of some preliminary work being considered on alcohol beverage labelling. \u00a0The most recent meeting of the Codex Committee on Food Labelling (CCFL) took place in October 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Following a discussion paper presented by the World Health Organisation, the Committee\u00a0identified a number of areas for potential future work and included in the list was\u00a0alcoholic beverages labelling.\u00a0\u00a0A concern expressed was that similar overlapping work is underway in other international organisations. \u00a0The Committee, therefore, agreed that information would be sought from member countries, via a Circular Letter (still to issue), on current practices, issues in alcoholic beverages labelling and allergen labelling; and identify in Codex where provisions already exist and any potential further role for CCFL.<\/p>  <p>  The CCFL agreed to develop a\u00a0discussion paper on alcoholic beverages labelling. \u00a0This will be prepared by the Russian Federation with assistance from EU, Ghana, India and Senegal and future work will be subject to approval from the\u00a0Codex Alimentarius Commission, at which Ireland will be represented.<\/p>  <p>  My Department welcomes efforts at EU and other international levels to improve the requirements for the labelling of alcoholic beverages.\u00a0 While such efforts may be in keeping with Ireland&rsquo;s national policy on the consumption of alcoholic drinks, it will be some time before agreement on international proposals is reached. \u00a0In the interim, my Department will pursue the proposals already outlined in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, as I believe this is in the best interest of public health.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of labelling of alcohol beverages, the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill reflects the work of Codex in this area. \u00a0The labelling provisions in the Bill will ensure that consumers can make informed choices about their drinking.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the following information on the label of an alcohol product: <\/p>  <p>  -  A warning to inform the public of the danger of alcohol consumption;

The Department of Health was represented on the Strategy Committee that developed the NSWG, and is also represented on the Committee overseeing its implementation. which has met on three occasions since the NSWG launch, on 13th July and 26th September, 2017 and 25th January, 2018. A further meeting is scheduled for 13th June, 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is principally involved with implementation of Objective Two of the NSWG; \"Advance the Physical and Mental Health and Wellbeing of Women and Girls\". <\/p>  <p>  Action 2.1 of the NSWG commits to \"Strengthen partnership work with the National Women's Council of Ireland (NWCI) in identifying and implementing\u00a0 key actions to address the particular physical and mental health needs of women and girls in order to advance the integration of their needs into existing and emerging health strategies, policies and programmes through an action plan for women's health\".<\/p>  <p>  Under this Action, the Department and the HSE are working with the NWCI, and, potentially, additional relevant organisations, including others in receipt of funding from the HSE, such that an advanced partnership approach can be developed to support the implementation of existing actions and needs outlined in the NSWG. <\/p>  <p>  The Healthy Ireland Framework provides the over-arching context for  progressing actions with regard to the health and wellbeing of women and girls. Healthy Ireland takes a whole of Government and whole of society approach to improving health and wellbeing, with a focus on prevention, reducing health inequalities and keeping people healthier for longer. <\/p>  <p>  Within the context of Healthy Ireland, there are currently a number of issues  where\u00a0 improvements in the health and wellbeing of women and girls could have significant impacts; these are set out in the NSWG. <\/p>  <p>  These  include improving awareness and supporting healthier choices in terms of smoking cessation, safer alcohol consumption, improving uptake of the  HPV vaccine, increasing physical activity participation rates in younger women and improving rates of folic acid consumption and breast-feeding.<\/p>  <p>  The Healthy Ireland approach is that many organisations have a role to play in achieving the goals of Healthy Ireland and in implementing the  various strategies and plans under the Healthy Ireland aegis. Hence, the Department of Health and the HSE will continue to work in partnership  with the NWCI and other relevant organisations, to support women and  girls in improving their health and wellbeing.<\/p>  <p>  The NWCI have been funded for work in the area of gender and health since 2011. This work has evolved to scope the development of the Women's Health Action Plan in partnership with the HSE in 2018. A number of engagement meetings have taken place in 2018 between representatives of the NWCI and the HSE in order to advance this work.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While the work is at an early stage of scoping, it is clear that there are a number of key programmes across the HSE\u00a0which currently target and engage successfully on women's health; these include the Early Childhood Programme and the Tobacco Programme, the Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme, the Perinatal and Mental Health Programme and the Maternity and Infant Health Programme as well as significant work under the Primary Care and Social Inclusion areas. <\/p>  <p>  The scoping work will include gathering existing data on women's health and commitments in existing policies that support women's health and wellbeing. This work is underway but is at an early stage. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health will continue to support the HSE and NWCI in furthering their aims regarding women's health and in developing the Women's Health Action Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200085#WRCC03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Screening Programmes","counter":1558,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200085#WRCC03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1559,"qnumday":593,"qnumall":"[24325\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200085#WRCC04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when it is likely that there will be a change in regard to which labs are used to analyse smear tests for the CervicalCheck programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1560,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to introduce HPV testing as the primary screening method for the prevention of cervical cancer as soon as possible.

All nursing homes are required to have written policies on the ordering, receipt, prescribing, storing and administration of medicines and on restraint.\u00a0Providers must keep detailed records of all occasions on which restraint is used.

The National Dementia Strategy recommends that the HSE develop guidance material on the appropriate management of medication for people with dementia, and in particular on psychotropic medication management, with material to be made available in all relevant settings, including nursing homes. To address this action, the HSE&rsquo;s National Dementia Office has convened a national interdisciplinary steering group to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines for healthcare professionals\u00a0on the use of psychotropic medications in people with dementia, with a particular focus on antipsychotics.\u00a0The guidelines will be submitted to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee to be implemented as national clinical guidelines.

<\/p><p>- delay the initiation of alcohol consumption by children and young people; <\/p><p>- reduce the harms caused by the misuse of alcohol; and<\/p><p>- reduce alcohol consumption to 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per person per annum by 2020.<\/p><p>One of the measures through which the Bill aims to achieve its objectives is through the introduction of Minimum unit pricing.<\/p><p>Minimum unit pricing targets cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the price is determined by and is directly proportionate to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink. This means that the price of individual products will depend on their strength. <\/p><p>A ban on below cost selling based on the invoice cost price of the alcohol product to the retailer does not target strong, cheap alcohol. It does not address the health harms associated with the harmful consumption of strong cheap alcohol products. This is because products that are cheap relative to their alcohol content will continue to be sold at a level that represents a serious threat to public health.<\/p><p>Research carried out by the University of Sheffield indicates that a ban on below-cost selling would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption or related harms as many of the cheapest alcohol products are already priced in or around excise duty plus VAT. <\/p><p>In addition to Minimum unit pricing the Bill provides for the making of regulations prohibiting or restricting price-based promotions which, either alone, or in tandem with minimum unit pricing would be effective in reducing alcohol consumption, related harms and associated costs.<\/p><p>The Government Decision approving Minimum unit pricing acknowledged the need for this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland to act simultaneously in order to allay concerns about impacts on cross-border trade. I recognise that it will be most effective if an equivalent measure is introduced in Northern Ireland at the same time. However, Minimum Unit Pricing is an important measure and on that basis I will reflect further, after the enactment of the Bill, before deciding on the timing of the commencement of this provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Data","counter":1796,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1797,"qnumday":671,"qnumall":"[24621\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the average height of children here aged between 6 to 18 years of age according to Irish data or comparative international data which his Department has access to by age bracket and gender in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1798,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question has been forwarded to the HSE as the Department does not have this data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Sales Legislation","counter":1799,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1800,"qnumday":672,"qnumall":"[24622\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the rationale for the selection of a 1.2 metres separating barrier contained under section 22 of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015; if this was developed using scientific best practices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1801,"qnumday":673,"qnumall":"[24623\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the reason a 1.2 metres separating barrier contained under section 22 of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 will reduce the visibility of alcohol to children in view of the fact that the height of the barrier equates to the height of a seven year old according to recent UK statistics (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1802,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 672 and 673 together.<\/p>  <p>  Section 22 of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill introduces a statutory framework for the separation and visibility of alcohol products and advertising in mixed retail outlets and is designed to address the relationship between alcohol and children by reducing the likelihood that they will be exposed to alcohol products and advertising in their daily lives. <\/p>  <p>  As drafted, the Bill required that alcohol products were not \"readily visible\" in mixed retail outlets.

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.\u00a0The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.\u00a0Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis. Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Data","counter":1834,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1835,"qnumday":685,"qnumall":"[24665\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of community registered general nurses working in the community (details supplied); the number of vacancies for such posts; the number of unfilled positions; if the national rolling recruitment campaign is being availed of in the region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1836,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to revert to the Deputy with the details sought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Provision","counter":1837,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1838,"qnumday":686,"qnumall":"[24666\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) for a home care package; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1839,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services","counter":1840,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1841,"qnumday":687,"qnumall":"[24684\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG05500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to implement new measures to allow faster access to the child and adolescent mental health services in order to tackle increasing waiting lists such as permitting advanced nurse practitioners to carry out initial assessments to the service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1842,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Cervical Screening Programme","counter":1843,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG05700"},{"type":"question","counter":1844,"qnumday":688,"qnumall":"[24693\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG05800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 381 and 382 of 15 May 2018, the laboratories which were the subject of site visits in 2011 and 2014.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1845,"content":"<p>I am advised by the HSE in 2011, site visits were carried out at\u00a0Quest Diagnostics, Teterboro, New Jersey,\u00a0and CPL, Austin, Texas, United States of America.<\/p><p>I am further advised that in 2014, site visits were carried out at Medlab Pathology, Dublin, Ireland, Quest Diagnostics, Teterboro, New Jersey\u00a0United States of America and The Coombe Women and Infants Hospital, Dublin Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061200089#WRGG05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1846,"content":"<p>Question No. 689 answered with Question No. 597.<\/p>"}]
