I do not believe that schedule is in the best interests of finalising the debate.  The legislation should be included in tomorrow's business.<\/p><p>I want to raise an issue with the Leader that has dominated the media for the past 24 hours - the refusal by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, to come before the banking inquiry which starts today.  This is an inherent weakness in the deliberations of the banking inquiry which has already generated enormous controversy about the political motives behind its setting up by the Government.  Many people feel the inquiry will be a witch hunt against Fianna F&aacute;il and very little else will emerge.  The process is completely flawed if the person who represents the European institution which is to blame for this country incurring &euro;65 billion in bank debt refuses to attend.  The Irish Government should adopt some method to change this situation.  I am echoing here the sentiments expressed this morning by a Minister of the Government, Deputy Coveney.  He said the institution should be compelled before the inquiry.  To suggest that the European Central Bank, on which we sit through the representation of Professor Honohan, is answerable only to the European Parliament and not to a national parliament is, in my opinion, a national insult.  It is yet a further indication of how far European institutions have become disconnected from the ordinary people of Europe.<\/p><p>The ECB is a powerful institution which continues to have a very important and significant impact on the lives of every citizen in this country.  The ECB, under Mr. Draghi's predecessor, Mr. Trichet, forced this country and its Government into incurring a debt that will hang around the Irish people for the next couple of decades.  I call on the Government to issue a very stern response to Mr. Draghi's intransigence and convey to him that his refusal is completely and totally unacceptable.  I ask the Taoiseach to come here today to explain exactly what the Government's response will be to Mr. Draghi.<\/p><p>I also ask that the Taoiseach will come here to make a statement on the growing and developing crisis in Northern Ireland.  He and the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, came, looked, saw and left Northern Ireland last week.  I was bitterly disappointed with the Taoiseach's rapid departure from these important talks.  He seems to have gone to Belfast for a photo opportunity with Mr. Cameron and then left.  We have a frail peace process but he has left Northern Ireland in limbo.  I have questioned on repeated occasions in this House the Government's commitment to engaging in Northern Ireland issues.  It is as if they are up there and we are down here, which is totally unacceptable.<\/p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Taoiseach come before this House today to address those twin issues which are of vital importance, not only to this economy but in the context of what is or is not happening in Northern Ireland.  This matter is of vital importance to the national economy and to the island economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700003#B00100","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1418812200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Yesterday's news of the appalling massacre of more than 140 people, including in excess of 130 children, by the Taliban in Pakistan means that again today we must express horror at this appalling outrage and despicable massacre of children, and I am sure others will join me in that.  The Taliban has reached a new low in its series of atrocities in other countries over some years.  Other colleagues have spoken before of the Taliban's targeting of Christians.  The Taliban has targeted children in education and yesterday it targeted the most vulnerable victims - children in a school.  It is an appalling atrocity.<\/p><p>In terms of children's rights, I compliment Senator van Turnhout on the motion she tabled in the House which all colleagues have signed up to.  I refer to No. 58, motion 14, which calls for adequate funding to be provided to Childline to ensure its night-time service is continued.  I wish to inform colleagues, in particular Senator Mooney, that I have written to the Taoiseach enclosing a copy of the motion and explaining that the issue was raised when I was Deputy Leader in the House last Thursday.  This is a good sign of the way the Seanad works and shows how Members come together on such issues.<\/p><p>In terms of the banking inquiry, like Senator Mooney I express my real concern at the ECB's refusal to come before the banking inquiry.  I wish all of our colleagues on the banking inquiry well in their work as it commences its public hearings today.  Their work is hugely important and they have worked extremely hard already in getting the ground set for public hearings.  It is very disappointing that the ECB has taken this decision.  I agree with Senator Mooney about that and the Government will send a strong message to the ECB on its decision.  Senators may have heard the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine express in very strong terms the Government's view on the matter.<\/p><p>In terms of the Northern Ireland talks, I would like to see us debate the matter in the new year.  The talks are continuing this week in Stormont and we all hope we will see some resolution of the outstanding issues.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, went to Belfast on Friday.  I assure the House that Ministers are still engaging and the Irish Government is still very much engaged in the talks this week.  It is very important that parties reach a timely resolution this week, and I know others said the same yesterday.<\/p><p>I ask for a debate on collective bargaining.  Yesterday, the Government approved collective bargaining legislation.  The Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Gerald Nash, yesterday announced Cabinet approval to legislate for this long overdue legislation.  Its aim is to provide for an improved framework for workers who seek to better their terms and conditions where an employer does not recognise a union.  This is a hugely important issue for many workers across the State and for the trade union movement.  A number of Supreme Court decisions have undermined collective bargaining rights in this country.  In the programme for Government in 2011 it was promised that the law would be reformed, in particular to ensure it is in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights in respect of rights to collective bargaining.  I ask the Leader that we might debate the matter in early course in the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700003#B00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1418812200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>It is very hard to contribute today without paying attention to the banking inquiry.  There is little doubt that the two previous speakers have drawn attention to the inquiry.  Let us not focus on blaming the ECB for not sending somebody as the only purpose.  A great deal can be achieved by the inquiry and the Seanad is well represented on it.  I hope we will be able to achieve what we set out to do.<\/p><p>I was very impressed by the reports about the President's visit to China.  Before he went, there was a doubt he might use his visit in a manner which would damage the relationship between Ireland and China.  Ireland is so tiny compared with China that is so huge.  We know that President Higgins has strong views on human rights and there was a danger he could say something that would endanger the relationship between both countries.  I believe his visit has achieved a huge amount.  I believe the relationship between himself and the President of China is very strong which will help to develop our economy and our relationship in many other ways.  I congratulate him on what he has achieved during his visit.<\/p><p>I raised concerns a month ago about the postal service and the danger posed by a movement towards other forms of communications.  It is a joy to see there is no danger.  Either the Government listened to us or already had planned to do the following ahead of time.  It has established a business development programme to develop businesses in the post office.  At this time of the year the post office is busy although there may not be as many postcards.  A great deal more shopping seems to be taking place online which has led to an opportunity to develop services for parcels and other messages.  I believe there is an opportunity for business in the post office.  As I mentioned before, in France, other work was found for the postal service, particularly postmen visiting lonely people or people living on their own.  The postmen have developed and provide that service.  I think the business development programme set up by the Government will provide us with opportunities as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700003#B00300","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1418812800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I wish to raise an issue concerning a member of the Defence Forces, Lieutenant Paul Giblin, who is stationed in the Army barracks in Renmore in Galway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700004#C00100","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1418812800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I remind the Senator that we do not mention on the record of the House people who are not here to defend themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700004#C00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1418812800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Senators may be aware that this has been widely reported in the media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700004#C00300","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1418812800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>It does not matter.

This is so serious that I urge the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance to summon an EU Commission summit to discuss this.  The ECB banking system was a disaster and when we needed Europe most, it turned its back on us and forced the former Minister for Finance, the late, great Brian Lenihan, to do its bidding in this country to protect the banks.

This is a serious issue, yet there are billions involved in the issue concerning the ECB.  The Europeans who are supposed to be our partners are ignoring the demands from Ireland.  If it is possible, the Leader might explore whether a European arrest warrant could be issued to bring the European authorities here by hook or by crook.  Let them answer questions.  What are they afraid of?  Is there something they might say that would expose Europe such that it might have to compensate Ireland for the billions of euro it put in to support the banks?

The banking crisis was a Europe-wide issue.  It hit Greece, Portugal, Spain, Cyprus and other countries, yet the European authorities are ignoring this.  Perhaps if they came here and gave answers we could move on and learn lessons from the appalling, disastrous position they put us in as a nation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700004#C00800","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1418812800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I welcome the granting of planning permission for a new greenway or cycleway between Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel.  This has been funded through the national infrastructure package of Exchequer funding to the tune of &euro;1.9 million.  It presents a great opportunity for part of the south east to develop a new tourism product.  It is most welcome in an area that has a strong tradition of cycling as it is the home of Se&aacute;n Kelly, who was the number-one cyclist in the world for many years.  Contrary to some reports, the funding is actually national funding and does not come from \"that crowd over in Europe\", as said in other fora.  It is actually coming from the Irish Exchequer, which is investing money to create a tourism product in the south east which, it is hoped, will create 80 direct jobs and many more indirectly.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House after Christmas to discuss the tourism product in the south east.  When we examine the figures for 2013, we see that Kerry alone had 877,000 overseas visitors, while the whole south east, including Carlow, Kilkenny, south Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford, had only 846,000.  Therefore, there is a definite need to promote tourism in the south east.  The cycleway is a good start but the Leader should request the Minister to come to the House in the new year to consider a strategy for the south east.

The motion was tabled on the Order Paper on 12 November requesting the Government to initiate legislation as a matter of urgency to provide for a constitutional referendum to reduce the voting age to 16 for all elections.  I decided to propose my amendment in light of the Cabinet's announcement yesterday to hold a referendum next May on same-sex marriage and on the reduction of the age of candidates eligible to run for President.  We have not yet got any indication as to when the referendum on reducing the voting age to 16 will take place.  This issue is very topical at present.  Government sources confirm that the decision to hold a referendum on reducing the age of presidential candidates is part of a drive to make the Presidency more relevant to younger people.  That is important but extending the voting franchise to younger people is also important.  We need an indication as soon as possible as to when the referendum in this regard will take place.<\/p><p>In recent days, it was announced that the voting age in Scotland is to be lowered to include 16- and 17-year olds after Mr. David Cameron offered to introduce speedily new electoral powers for the Scottish Parliament.

I fear that it will not be provided for in time for the next general election, perhaps next year.  Alternatively, it might not be possible to work out in time the logistics of ensuring young people are able to register for the next general election.

Approximately 20% of Irish people now live in rented accommodation and that number will increase in the future.  There are too many loopholes in the current legislation allowing for people to be economically evicted.  The legislation does not allow for reasonable rent increases and does not allow tenants to make their homes in the rented sector.

I do not believe we should have had to take on that debt.  As Senator O'Donovan has said, if we are able to extradite somebody from Brazil for &euro;80 million of outstanding debt, the least we should expect is for the president of the ECB and the former president of the ECB - the president at the time - to attend the properly constituted banking inquiry that is being held by the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>I agree with the Senators who have said the Taoiseach should come into the House to give us an update on the discussions concerning Northern Ireland.

The Estimate provides for funding in a number of areas that will support our athletes at home and as they travel abroad to compete on the world stage.  Some &euro;1 million has been allocated for the purchase of equipment by the national sporting governing bodies.  Another &euro;1 million has been provided to fund the preparation programmes of high-performance athletes who are preparing for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.

My colleague, Senator Mooney, has now asked that the Taoiseach come before us to outline the position.  I completely support the Senator's call in this regard.  What happened at the recent talks was tantamount to fraud.  Prime Minister Cameron did not have the patience to await developments and left the talks at 10 a.m. on Friday last.  On the basis of the information I have received, I understand that if he had put his shoulder to the wheel for that day, the relevant issues would have been resolved.  I have no difficulty placing on record the fact that Brian Feeney of the <i>Irish Republican News<\/i>places the blame for this shambles at the feet of the proconsul.  I am surprised by the cheek of Prime Minister Cameron in offering those in the North &euro;25 billion of their own money to be repaid over 25 years at normal interest rates.  That is farcical.

I set out my reasons for this on previous occasions.  I do not think that engaging in such an inquiry is a job for politicians.  I also do not believe that there will be public satisfaction with regard to its outcome.  That said, I do not approve of the complete disregard the European Central Bank and others have displayed towards the Irish parliamentary process.  This issue highlights the new power relationship that exists between Ireland, as a small member state of the European Union, and the European bureaucracy.<\/p><p>I wish to raise the issue of the new personal data collection rules proposed by the Department of Education and Skills in respect of primary schools.  A number of primary school principals have brought to my attention their concerns regarding the scope of the information being collected and whether this will be shared with other organisations.  At present, primary schools collect certain data relating to the age, addresses, PPS numbers, etc., of students.  This information is used for identification purposes.  The Department is proposing that primary school principals should collect new data on students and record this on the proposed primary online database system, which can be viewed by departmental officials.  There will be different categories of personal data held.  These will include personal data shared between a school and the Department, as is currently the case; and sensitive personal data shared between a school and the Department - this is a new category which will include information on students' race and religion and those of their parents.  Previously, the only organisation which recorded such information was the Central Statistics Office in the form of the highly confidential census.  Now a Department of State is proposing to collect and store this information.<\/p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has defended the proposal by stating that it will use pupil data in categories 1 and 2 for planning, policy and statistical purposes.  While I support the legitimate collection of information for such purposes, a number of major questions relating to this matter remain unanswered.  For example, with what other State bodies will the Department be sharing the sensitive data of primary school students and for what purpose?  Why is the Department proposing to retain personal data in categories 1 and 2 for each pupil up to the period of the pupil's 30th birthday?  I would like to hear from the Minister for Education and Skills on this matter.<\/p><p>I will not be requesting a debate on the most recent comments of the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, on abortion.  All I will say is that it is sad to see this political change of tack on his part.  I am also saddened by the fact that the Minister is lending his support to what are really destructive elements in our society.  This is an unwelcome development but, thankfully, the people will be required to have their say on any change in this area.  The much-maligned Eighth Amendment to the Constitution at least ensures that we are in a situation where only the people can decide.  When unprincipled politicians continually shift their ground - under the guise of compassion - it is just as well that the people must be consulted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700007#F00300","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1418814600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Senator Mooney referred to the fact that we will be taking Committee Stage and Report Stage of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill today.

This is regrettable and, in my view, completely unacceptable.  An appearance by representatives of the ECB at the inquiry is essential.  As Senator Hayden indicated, the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, will give evidence to the inquiry.  Professor Honohan was involved with the ECB at the time of the bank guarantee.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, indicated in very strong terms earlier this morning that the ECB should send representatives to appear before the inquiry.  The Chairman of the inquiry has indicated that he will be writing again to Mr. Draghi asking him to reconsider his position.  I am sure the Government will be making strong representations in order to have Mr. Draghi attend the inquiry.  Senator Keane suggested that there might be ways for Irish MEPs to obtain answers from Mr. Draghi.  I do not believe anything would be as appropriate as his appearing before the inquiry in order to answer questions posed by its members.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney and others referred to the Northern Ireland talks.  The Government is fully engaged with those talks, in which both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, have been involved.

I assure the House that the Government is fully engaged with the Northern Ireland talks process and that this will continue to be the case.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik referred to the massacre of children in Pakistan.

I agree with him that the visit was successful and I hope that great benefits will accrue to both countries as a result of it.

The Senator also welcomed the proposed development of business opportunities for the postal service.  It is extremely important that post offices nationwide should remain open and viable.<\/p><p>Senator Naughton encouraged more donors - those who might donate bone marrow, etc. - to come forward.<\/p><p>Senator O'Donovan also referred to the ECB.  The word &quot;extradition&quot; may be too strong to use in respect of Mr. Draghi.  However, I agree with the general sentiments expressed by the Senator to the effect that Mr. Draghi should come before the banking inquiry.<\/p><p>Senator Landy welcomed the granting of planning permission for the new greenway between Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel and the tourism benefits to which this development will give rise.  The Senator claimed that Sean Kelly is a Tipperary man but I assure him that Mr. Kelly is a good Waterford man from Carrickbeg.  Mr. Kelly comes from a place on the right side of the river and he is very proud of that fact.  We can certainly arrange time for a debate on tourism, particularly in the context of the strategy for the south east, in the new year.<\/p><p>Senator Reilly moved an amendment to the Order of Business - which I do not propose to accept - to the effect that the No. 58, motion 10, which relates to a referendum on reducing the voting age to 16, be taken today.

They also congratulated the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, on his success in the negotiations on fisheries.  I understand these were very tough negotiations and what the EU was proposing was absolutely crazy.  We now have an increase in prawn catches and a benefit in regard to whitefish, cod and haddock.  The outcome of the negotiations has been welcomed in general by all involved in fisheries.  Senator Mullins also referred to the plight of an Irish citizen who is being held in an Egyptian prison.  The Government has appealed to the Egyptian authorities on this case and I am sure that appeal will be renewed into the future.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell referred to the forthcoming debate on the Water Services Bill 2014.  I assure him the legislation will not be rushed through the House in any way.  We will give as much time as necessary tomorrow to complete Second Stage and we will have all day and night on Friday for Committee Stage.  Several Members on the other side of the House have asked why we are not taking Committee and Report Stages on Friday.  There is a difference of opinion on this.  However, we will have ample time again on Monday to deal with Report Stage.  We will give the same attention to this Bill as we give to all legislation that comes before us.

What we have endeavoured to do, including when debating this yesterday, was to bring some fairness into the process and try to reverse some of the changes, which go right back to 2009.  It was unfortunate that the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, chose yesterday not to answer some of the specific questions I put to her.  However, one thing I said to her was that I agreed that the changed Social Welfare Act in 2009 was not helpful at all and has led to some of the problems with regard to Aer Lingus.  Nonetheless, the changes since have further exacerbated the situation.  The Social Welfare Bill last year and the State Airports Bill, which was enacted extremely quickly, effectively give the trustees unilateral power to make any changes they want and to go ahead with a section 50.<\/p><p>There is one point I would ask the Minister to consider.  It is constantly said that it is the trustees who made the decision, and I know that, legally, that is the case.  However, the reality is that the Government was complicit in this because it brought forward the legislation to enable the trustees to make these changes.  In addition, the Government - that is, the taxpayer - is a 25% stakeholder, and the taxpayer voted to make these changes at the Aer Lingus EGM on 10 December.  Everything was teed up, all the way along the line.<\/p><p>I want to correct a point made by the Minister yesterday, when she referred to long-standing mismanagement of the scheme.  While I would agree with that, I would ask the Government to reflect on the reason that deficit in the pension scheme doubled in nine months.  I will explain why that happened.  It doubled because, 18 months ago, the Minister flagged what was going to happen with pension schemes and gave employers like Aer Lingus and the DAA the opportunity to change, whereupon they actually stopped paying new contributions into the scheme, starved the scheme of money and ran it down so it was insolvent.  That is effectively what happened and it is what is going to happen all over the place.  I would ask Members of the Oireachtas, and the Minister of State, to watch this because it is going to happen; in fact, it is happening already.  Unfortunately, what this Government in particular has done is that it has, for the first time, legislated to change a specific private pension scheme through the State Airports Act, which it brought forward.<\/p><p>There is an irony here.  All of us welcome the agreement reached with the Waterford Crystal workers, who were very badly done by.  Let us not forget this was a double insolvency, meaning it was an insolvent company and an insolvent pension scheme, so something had to give.  I am delighted the workers have got some recourse.  In the instance of the IASS, however, there is a profitable employer and an insolvent pension scheme, yet many of these workers will be worse off than the Waterford Crystal workers.  While this is not to put one worker against another, how is it that the Waterford Crystal workers' extra payments, which they are due and entitled to, are going to be paid for?  They will be paid for - the T&aacute;naiste was on radio about this - through a levy on defined benefit pension schemes.  Anyone looking at this will see that the people in the IASS are effectively paying a levy in order to pay for the Waterford Crystal workers' additional pension rights and entitlements.  That is what is happening.<\/p><p>The whole manner in which this has been done is questionable.  If there is a social welfare Bill next year under this Government, I would sincerely ask the Minister of State to look at some of the recommendations we put forward in good faith.  I know that, at times, things have got heated during debates with the T&aacute;naiste but I feel very passionately about what is happening to these people.  It is not just a piece of legislation.  These changes that have been made in recent weeks, and which are being rejected here, are all having a real effect on people.  From 1 January on, 70, 80 and 90 year olds are going to lose six weeks pay from their pensions and, on a point Senator Norris is very familiar with, people who are due to retire with 37 or 38 years of service are going to have their pension entitlements cut by 60%.  No one can tell me that is fair.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, for being attentive to these matters when he has been in the House.  This is not the end of it.  The State will end up in court over this.  To move away from that specific scheme, given what is being done here, we will see employer after employer moving along the lines in order to be able to wiggle out of pension liabilities and reduce costs to their companies, thereby making the companies more profitable.  All of this is going to happen and it is happening already in pension schemes.  I am aware from my previous life that people are saying: &quot;Why would I have this type of scheme?  I will wind the scheme down, put people into an inferior scheme and write off whatever I owe.&quot;<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for his attention.  I am very disappointed with the fact we have not been successful but it is not the end of the matter.  I know people will be taking legal advice on their own positions.  Next year, probably, we will have another judgment from Europe with regard to how these 15,000 workers were treated by this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700016#Q00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1418817900,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I support Senator Darragh O'Brien.

It was a rare example of clear political thinking and leadership and I think he deserves great credit for it.  He managed to take a complex issue, distil away a lot of the emotion, and talk about the hard issues we will have to discuss without bowing to the whims of extremists on either side.  I salute the Minister for it.<br\/>I will slightly disagree with the Minister, however, when he said that clearly something would be necessary to replace the eighth amendment.  The Constitution ticked along very nicely for 46 years or so before the eighth amendment to the Constitution was introduced.  My own belief is that if the will was there and if the will of the people was simply to remove it from the Constitution, to repeal it, there would probably be some fine-tuning with certain aspects of legislation which were formatted after the amendment came into effect and reflecting the strictures placed on them by the amendment, but in general these should be legislative rather than major constitutional issues.  This does not mean that I am pro-abortion, anti-life, pro-choice or anything of the kind.  It merely states that the appropriate form for very nuanced, often technically, scientifically, medically and ethically complicated issues is in well-contrived legislation.  I do not feel there is any reason that should not be the goal that we are aiming for and that people of goodwill, who are occupying what I believe is the genuine middle ground on this, would actually see this.<br\/>With respect to the business at hand, it is one of those funny things that people say not to be too personal when doing stuff in the Chamber, but because of my day job, I do actually see examples of things which I have the opportunity to highlight in a legislative forum, and this is one of them.  It has become apparent to me that there has been an appropriate and increasing scrutiny of the cost of drugs used for various illnesses, and not just drugs but also treatments and tests, and an appropriate degree of scrutiny on things like cost-benefit analysis, quality, adjusted life years, incremental costs and effectiveness ratios.  I totally understand this.  I have written on health economics.  I am not one of these naives who believes doctors operate in an economic vacuum and that there is not an opportunity cost on some other part of the health service for every penny that we spend on care for cystic fibrosis or cancer or diabetes.<br\/>That said, I do believe there are a number of remediable dysfunctions in the way the private insurance market is interacting with the question of procurement of drugs.  I have seen it most specifically in cancer drugs, but I believe it happens in other areas.  There are certain drugs which are approved by some companies and not approved by others.  One could state that in a competitive market, with a truly informed class of customers, this should not be a problem.  People will elect to purchase product A versus product B.  The reality, however, is that this is not the way these things are decided.  People do not know in advance that a particular cancer drug, cystic fibrosis drug or drug for macular degeneration may not be available to them on the insurance.  As a result, it is a distorted market.  Completely distorting the market is the reality that there are two public entities which, in effect, become competitors of some of the private companies in this respect.  One of them is their obvious competitor, the Voluntary Health Insurance, which is basically back-stopped by the State and for which the Minister acts, as he pointed out the other day, as the sole shareholder.  As well as that there is the State itself, because the companies can withdraw from the emotional aspects of the debate about a potentially life-prolonging and life-saving drug by saying they will not get it, often in situations where the State will do it.<br\/>My own sense is that when people pay extra money for health insurance in addition to the money they pay in their taxes which subsidise the general health system of the entire country, perhaps they should expect that they will be given at least the same standards of care and the same access to newer treatments and technologies as they would have if they were to go through the public system.  This strikes me as being an extraordinary example of the ability of the companies to cherry-pick in a very subtle way.  They have these two distorted competitors who act at a certain disadvantage to them because they, unlike the private insurance companies, will have a degree of public accountability and public answerability.<br\/>For that reason, I ask the Minister to consider this amendment.  This is not a <i>carte blanche<\/i>for any doctor to prescribe any drug to any patient.  This is very specifically an attempt to make sure there is an equal playing field on access to some of these new treatments and that there is not, in fact, an incentive on two companies to decant patients' demands back either to the VHI, if it is a non-VHI policyholder, or back to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700018#S00800","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1418818800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, carries out health technology assessments for pharmaceuticals in Ireland and aims to provide impartial advice to help decision-makers provide the most effective, safe and value for money treatments for patients.  In Ireland, once a product is licensed for use in the public health system, the relevant company can make an application for reimbursement to the HSE.  As part of the reimbursement process, the NCPE carries out an assessment and makes recommendations to the HSE.  The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision-making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and drug companies.  When considering any application for a new product on the reimbursable list, the HSE considers a wide range of criteria.  In addition to the NCPE findings, the HSE will also consider the overall health needs of the public and the proposed benefits and risks of the product as well as the resources available to the HSE.<\/p><p>Minimum benefit regulations made under the Health Insurance Acts ensure that consumers obtain a minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase.<\/p> <p>Beyond the minimum benefit, cover for medical expenses, including medication, under a customer's health insurance contract is a private contractual matter between the customer and the insurer.  Any requirement for insurers to cover a particular medication could have the effect of increasing costs and premiums.  It is not the role of the Minister to direct private health insurers as to which services or facilities they should cover.  That is a commercial decision for the insurers themselves.<\/p><p>While I understand the Senator's point it is important to bear in mind that the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, can approve lots of different medicines, even ones that have a similar effect.  It makes sense to allow insurers reimburse the cheaper one and not the more expensive one, if it is just as good.  Alternatively, if there are several approved therapies available, it should be up to the insurers to tender and ask the different companies to tender for the supply of the medicines.  This amendment would effectively require insurers to reimburse any medicine approved by the NCPE even if it was a more expensive or less effective one. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700018#S00900","speaker":"948","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418819400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I disagree with the Minister because there are situations where there is no other competing treatment.

I can give the Minister specific examples - and I have been somewhat critical of the methodologies used by the NCPE &ndash; of drugs that the NCPE has approved as being sufficiently cost-effective but that insurance companies have rejected.

In the example he gave, somebody is refused cover and is therefore sent back to the State, if I interpreted what he said correctly.  Do we have a mechanism that states one is entitled under those three criteria to purchase health insurance in the market and should not be turned down because there is open enrolment lifetime cover, which covers people getting sick as they get older, and community rating charging everybody the same price?  If Senator Crown has found loopholes where people are refused treatment and go back to the Exchequer for finance the amendment might assist in that regard, within the context that health insurance companies should get the best bargain.

I am a great believer of models such as the ones that exist in Germany, Israel and several of the other countries of north-west Europe of dependence on a model of social insurance where the profit motive is not what drives the insurance companies but where there is a more efficient link between activity and reimbursement.  It is called money following the patient.<br\/>As a society we are all in it together and I believe people should have a level playing field when it comes to accessing health insurance.  For that reason I am a major supporter of community rating.  We should not be able to charge people more if they are older and less if they are younger.  We should not be able to charge people differentially according to their family history.  People cannot pick their genetic background.  These are the cards one is dealt by genetics and chronology.<br\/>However, there are some things that people can pick regardless of any other circumstance in their lives.  The very extreme example is smoking.  People can choose to become smokers or not to become smokers.  People who choose to become smokers overwhelmingly become addicted as children if they remain smokers during their adult years.  I believe there are very few rational adults, armed as we are with the health risks associated with smoking, who would make a decision while adults to take up the habit for the first time although it does happen.<br\/>However, I do not believe it is contrary to the spirit of community rating to allow health insurance companies to analyse, perhaps with some type of ministerial oversight or some type of commission oversight the issue of wholly avoidable bad health behaviours.  It should allow people to be incentivised.  It would not only make sense from the companies' point of view, but would make sense from society's point of view to allow people to be incentivised by giving them a smaller health insurance premium if, for instance, they were non-smokers.<br\/>I know that with some of the other risk factors that are avoidable it is a bit trickier and I know there are nuances in it.  Certainly if the principle were introduced, it would not be contrary to the principle of community rating and it would allow us to have a powerful tool in the public health sphere and also one that would be rational from the point of view of health economics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700020#U00100","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1418820000,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I second what Senator Crown has said.

Therefore, they were able to give a reduction in their insurance charges for those people who ceased smoking.  There were other steps in regard to obesity and those who joined health clubs.  In other words, there are aspects of our health that we can influence ourselves.

Community rating is a fundamental cornerstone of the Irish health insurance market.  Everyone is charged the same premium if they have a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender, genetics or the current or likely future state of their health.  This means that the price of health insurance for all persons reflects the principle of intergenerational solidarity that the entire community of insured persons should contribute towards the higher cost of claims of older people and less healthy people.<\/p><p>In a risk-rated market which is being suggested here, at least in part, insurers would charge higher premiums to higher risk individuals and lower premiums to low risk individuals.  To adopt an approach along those lines whereby insurers could reduce premiums for some people who avoid certain activities, with known negative health affects, would undermine and dilute the existing system of community rating.  I appreciate that all Senators spoke in favour of community rating in principle.  It is worth pointing out that, in so far as I understand it, South Africa and the United States do not have community rating; it is very much risk-rated.  I think I am correct in saying that Senators are not proposing that model but are proposing that premiums should be higher for certain modifiable behaviours and so on, such as smoking, taking exercise or obesity.  There may well be some merit in it but I would be very careful about departing from community rating in any way without thinking it through and knowing exactly how we would do it.<\/p><p>One Senator said that it would be easily verified.  I am not sure how easy it is to verify it.  For example, what test would the insurer perform on its customer to see if he or she is not smoking?  Would it carry out alcohol-blood level tests?  Would it take hair samples to check what drugs a person may have taken?  Would the insurance company start weighing people and doing a BMI and call people back a few months later to check whether their BMI had gone down a little?  Would it put pedometers or some type of electronic tag on customers to check whether they are getting the right type of exercise?  I am not sure it is verifiable and, therefore, it is an issue that needs to be thought out much better before I could it.  The nature of insurance is that the premiums that come in have to slightly exceed the claims.  Therefore, any proposal to reduce premiums for anyone must also mean an increase for others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700021#V00400","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1418820300,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I thank also the most thoughtful legislator on the Government benches, Senator Colm Burke, for his contribution although I politely disagree with him.  We are not proposing additional regulation by legislation.  We are looking at existing regulation by legislation and proposing to loosen it because at present under the interpretation of the strictures of community rating, the Minister could not do what we are proposing.  My sense is that we are loosening the thoughtless bonds of unthinking unnuanced regulation and allowing something which makes economic sense and which would be socially productive.<\/p><p>In terms of the verification question raised by the Minister, there are ample precedents for this in life insurance where there all types of loadings based on people's life insurance policies and whether they smoke.  I am sure methodologies exist to determine whether people had or had not been compliant with assertions they made when applying for life insurance that they were or were not smokers.  <\/p><p>In a hypothetical scenario, somebody who came into the hospital having benefited from a lower premium because they maintained that they were a non-smoker but was found to be a smoker would not lose their cover, but they might be asked to pay back the difference for which they had been in arrears over the years when misrepresenting themselves as non-smokers.  In terms of the issues across generational solidarity, I stress I am a huge believer in community rating.  If there was not a large element of personal choice in continuing to smoke - I firmly believe that this is a personal choice which is heavily modified by addiction, tragically addiction which usually occurs before people have come to the age of reason - in terms of intergenerational solidarity, old people and young people are just as entitled to smoke or to give up smoking and this is in no sense undermining any aspect of community rating.  Where community rating is critically important is on age and on secondary issues such as genetics.  Once cannot change one's family, although I must admit that in the event that Senator Feargal Quinn wishes to adopt me I probably will not say no.  The reality, and I mean no disrespect to my mother, is that one cannot change one's genes or one's age but one can change whether one's smokes.  This would be a very powerful message and I urge the Minister to accept it.

I do not wish to personalise the matter or make it too readily identifiable but an entire category of medical treatment has effectively become unavailable throughout the private sector in Dublin recently because of a decision made with respect to the reimbursement for a group of procedures by one of the major players in the insurance market.  It is a little hard for me to escape the conclusion that a major engineering decision was made by the company in an attempt to corral this particular treatment back into the public sector and deciding that this is not a treatment to be covered in the private sector at all.  This has the potential to cause chaos for the solitary unit in Dublin which currently provides this type of treatment, as there will be a major increase in demand and waiting lists for a procedure that is already over-subscribed and under-provided.  It is very neatly allowing the insurance company off the hook in this regard.  It has struck me that perhaps a little bit of Government oversight into some of the secondary and unanticipated consequences of certain reimbursement procedures could be brought to bear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700023#Z00100","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1418821200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I will follow Senator Crown's comments, although not on the same issue.

My understanding is that insurance companies would pay out approximately &euro;300 every time somebody would go to hospital for this procedure but the same cover is not given when a GP is prepared to do the procedure for &euro;100.

We need to make sure our electoral system is robust and fit for purpose and begin to develop trust in our political system.  Speaking after the Cabinet reshuffle, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, stated: &ldquo;Next year we will bring forward legislation to establish an electoral commission to ensure best practice and probity in our election processes.&rdquo;  As we move towards the final days of this political year, we need assurances that this area of political reform will not slip away from us.<\/p><p>The establishment of an electoral commission has been in the programme for Government since 2011.  It states: &ldquo;Government is too centralised and unaccountable. We believe that there must also be a real shift in power from the State to the citizen.&rdquo;  It also states that it will &ldquo;establish an Electoral Commission to subsume the functions of existing bodies and the Department of the Environment&rdquo;.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor did absolutely nothing about this.  I congratulate the new Minister on his recent appointment as this is the first time we have met formally in the Seanad.  The electoral commission cannot be pushed aside for a later time or deemed to be of less value than it is, however.  Failures of the political system over the past decade were a key contributor to the financial crisis this country is recovering from.  We need the political reform we were promised over three years ago. <\/p><p>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government commissioned a study on the establishment of an electoral commission in Ireland in 2008.  The report took as its starting point the commitment in the programme for Government to establish an electoral commission and envisaged five core tasks it should be responsible for: take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight; implement modern and efficient electoral practices; revise constituency boundaries; compile a new national rolling electoral register; and take over the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission.<\/p> <p>My colleague, Senator van Turnhout, who will second this motion, will talk about voter registration and encouraging young people to vote earlier in their lives.<br\/>The 2008 study recommended: <blockquote>That an Electoral Commission should be established through the enactment of an Electoral Commission Act.  This Act would establish an Electoral Commission, with its own corporate legal personality, a Chief Electoral Officer who would be civil servants of the State and a budget. <\/blockquote>This piece of work still stands as the core research or blueprint for establishing an electoral commission in Ireland.  Therefore, I do not think we need any more research, commissions or studies.  The Minister and his Department have the information to hand.  I want him to tell me how he intends to establish an electoral commission.  We have the knowledge and the tools to move on this matter.  We have done our homework and the issue has been left on a shelf in his Department since 2008.<br\/>There are many benefits if Ireland established an electoral commission.  As the body charged with managing the electoral process, it would play a proactive role in encouraging voters by providing education and driving up voter turnout.  It would produce timely and clear announcements and literature to make sure that there is no confusion, particularly with regard to the wording of ballot papers.  When this House was on the chopping block many complaints were made about the complex and awkward wording used on the ballot paper.  Senators will remember that we were asked to vote &quot;Yes&quot; for the Seanad but &quot;No&quot; in the referendum.  An electoral commission would ensure that wording would not be a problem going forward.<br\/>An electoral commission would be charged with modernising the electoral process.  It would manage voter registration.  It would devise strategies and practice to make our elections and referenda as efficient as they could and should be.  It would bring the work currently split between county councils to one place and provide one point of contact and central administration.  We cannot wait for a commission any longer.  We need a more modern and cohesive electoral system with a body at the helm that we can trust.Importantly, an electoral commission would be independent of Government.  I do not think that the Minister of the day should be in charge of elections.  It is an extraordinary undemocratic paradox.<br\/>In the 2008 study I referenced earlier, it was suggested that an Irish electoral commission would have the power to conduct or commission research, and would play a strong role in monitoring the behaviour of political parties.  It would make particular note of party funding practices because it would have the power to cancel the registration of a political party if it determined that the parties, through its officers or anyone authorised to act on its behalf, committed serious or repeated breaches of the obligations imposed by electoral law.  Accountability in democracy is key and, therefore, we need an electoral commission established as soon as possible.<br\/>We can look at several examples of international best practice for electoral commissions.  As the Minister will know, the United Kingdom's electoral commission describes itself as working to support a healthy democracy where elections and referenda are based on the principle of trust, participation and no undue influence.  Its objectives are well run elections, referenda and electoral registrations along with transparency in party and election finances with a high level of compliance.  It hones in on how the referendum questioning is worded and run public awareness campaigns in the run up to elections and referendum to make sure that people know when the polls are taking place and by what date and when people need to register in order to be able to vote.<br\/>Senator van Turnhout and I sat in here and went toe to toe with the Minister's predecessor during a debate on a very inane piece of work - the narrowing the registration of voting.  Both the officials and the Minister decided to vote against our amendment.  Its aim was to ensure that when an election is called there is a period to register at least up to three weeks before an election.  Technology is so good now that people should be able to register to vote seven working days before an election.  Our amendment was voted down and the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, as they are now, were not even in the Chamber when we called a vote.  There is an extraordinary sense of developing and encouraging distrust among citizens when it comes to elections which is not good or healthy for a modern 21st century democracy.  I am not saying that the majority of Irish people are not engaged or do not understand the systems in place.  However, it is important that we make the process as clear cut as possible.  People's lives are busy and it is easy for a referenda to creep up with voters left feeling inadequately informed or prepared.<br\/>The ridiculous fact is that we are all rushed to register people last November for a possible referenda on marriage equality next May.  Everything seems to be predicated on ifs and buts which is not the way to encourage electoral participation or voter participation.<br\/>The Constitutional Convention held last year proposed, by a majority vote, the establishment of an electoral commission.  The Minister has a lot of support and encouragement for doing so.  I ask him, when he addresses us, to outline what discussions have taken place on this topic since he took up office.  The former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, was a disaster when it came to participation, democracy and developing trust.  I am not asking the current Minister to comment on my view but ask him to outline his priorities, since his appointments, in regards to this issue.<br\/>The Government committed to responding to the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention.  The T&aacute;naiste highlighted the subject only two months ago so there must be some structure or ideas in place.  I ask that this House be made aware of what is proposed and that a real commitment is made on the Minister's part to follow through.We need to hear specifics before this year comes to a close and that time is now.  The people are becoming disillusioned with the political process.  They are regularly confronted with news of parties at loggerheads and having a lack of co-operation.  People are jaded, particularly by the events of the past few months.  The establishment of an electoral commission is a real opportunity for this Government to act on its promise to conduct political reform.  We need specifics and I ask the Minister to give them to us today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700024#BB00600","speaker":"1167","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418822100,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for taking this Private Members' business.<\/p><p>When my colleague, Senator Mac Conghail, said he had selected this issue for his Private Members' time my first thought was that everybody agrees we should have an electoral commission.

In 1999 the National Youth Council of Ireland recommended that the establishment of an electoral commission in Ireland be explored.  The recommendation was made 15 years ago but nothing has been done since.  In that time the level of non-registration of young people has doubled.  We were concerned about non-registration 15 years ago and now we can see that figure is growing.<\/p><p>A few months ago NYCI published the results of a survey which found that the levels of non-registration of young people aged between 18 and 25 years is now at 30% and among the 18 to 21-year olds the level is 43%.  From such data we estimate that up to 138,000 young people are not on the electoral rolls which clearly demonstrates that the current electoral registration system is broken and in need of repair.<\/p><p>I know the staff in local authorities work extremely hard to maintain and update the electoral register.  The problem is that the current system is outdated and is not fit for purpose.  Some local authorities conduct door to door surveys but others do not due to staff and funding shortages.  That means the level of registration and its accuracy depends on where one lives.  <\/p><p>The current system is a 19th century system because it is based on the premise that the vast majority of people never leave the locality in which they were born and raised.  However, we know that 51% of second level school leavers attend third level.  Not to mention that many more leave home at 17 and 18 years of age to pursue further education, training or to take up work.  These young people fall through the voter registration cracks and as a result are not registered at home or at their place of education, training or work because their lives are very transient.  If we take an average 12 months of a young person's life one will realise he or she will live in many locations during that period.

They cannot understand why in 2014 that they have to print and fill in forms, get them stamped at a Garda station and post them to their county and city councils when in almost every other aspects of their lives it can be done online.  Effectively, we are putting obstacles and barriers in their way rather than supporting them to get registered.  <br\/>Organisations such as the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Union of Students of Ireland and <i>SpunOut.ie <\/i>have organised voter registration drives among young people.  Their most recent was the voter registration day 2014, which centred around the 30 October deadline and focused on online and offline engagement to get young people registered to vote.  I commend the organisations on what they did in that campaign.  They were excellent and commendable initiatives but we should not be relying on civil society organisations with limited resources to ensure that young people can vote.  We also need to point out - this was brought up at the Constitutional Convention when we examined lowering the voting age - the importance of including electoral voting, in particular, in school programmes.<br\/>On a more general note, I have heard it said in this House that often when somebody is seeking representation, TDs will check to see if somebody has voted.

This is important for the democratic process.  It is not just about setting up the commission, we need to give it the staff, the resources and the time to reform.  We are working with a 19th century system in the 21st century.  We need everybody to be registered to vote.<\/p><p>An issue that came up recently when I was consulting some young people on lowering the voting age was that they said that referendums affect the future of their life.  We have tried but failed in our efforts to make amendments here to lower the voting age to 16 for the European and local elections and a referendum was not required.  There is a greater onus on the State with referendums announced for next May and we must ensure that young people are registered to vote and that they are informed about what they are voting on.  An electoral commission is the key body to play this role.  I encourage the Minister to establish it without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700026#DD01000","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1418822700,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this Private Members' motion.  I compliment the Independent Senator on tabling the motion.  Even though the establishment of an electoral commission is outlined in the programme for Government, it is no harm to remind the Government what is in that programme to ensure that it is implemented.  The establishment of an electoral commission is an integral part of that.<\/p><p>Since 2011, the Government has demonstrated a commitment to political reform having implemented many of the reform policies outlined in the programme for Government but obviously it is not possible to do everything at once.  We have embarked on an ambitious programme of political reform.  Six referenda have been put to the people and two more referenda were announced yesterday, which I welcome.  We had the children's rights referendum and the establishment of a Court of Appeal.<\/p><p>The Constitutional Convention has been a huge success, acting as a platform for political ideas and debate.  It has brought citizens closer to the heart of policy formation and that is very much what is required.  Citizens feel disengaged and disenfranchised and they may be at the heart of the problem of why people, in particular young people, do not turn out to vote. Members of the public have been brought much closer to the legislative process but a great deal of work needs to be done.  The Oireachtas committees have been reformed somewhat but not enough.  The reform with regard to the pre-legislative stage allows members of the public to have an input when laws are being drafted and that is good but more needs to be done.  I would welcome the establishment of an electoral commission.<\/p><p>The Government has a series of D&aacute;il reforms but often they are a one day wonder and then forgotten about.  The expenses of Deputies and Senators are now vouched, and there has been 20% reduction in ministerial salaries, and Ministers no longer have drivers.  We have more transparency.  There has been a reduction in the number of those in the public service.  There has been a good deal of local government reform.  The Government has added an additional 74 D&aacute;il sitting days during its first two years in office but, as I said, that is a one-day wonder.  Much reform has taken place and it must be acknowledged, but reform in terms of the establishment of an electoral commission needs to take place rapidly.<\/p><p>The newly introduced system of Topical Issues provides a much better framework for TDs to raise matters.  Independent TDs have introduced some good Private Members' Bills, some of which have been accepted in this House.  Reform must continue in the Seanad and it can lead the way.  We have had the introduction of a gender quota and I welcome that.  It is the first in our history and hopefully we will see more women being elected to Parliament.  <\/p><p>As outlined by the previous speakers, a report of 2008, commissioned by the Department of the Environment, recommended the establishment of an electoral commission.  It outlined a range of functions the commission would be expected to perform and in which those functions would be vested simultaneously or, if not, the sequence of transfer of functions to it from, perhaps, the Standards in Public Office Commission or the amalgamation with it.<\/p><p>A variety of approaches have been recommended in that report and they are worth consideration.  There were three or four options put forward in it.  It would be a new body and all the functions it would be intended to perform from the beginning would be conferred on it.  Obviously that would require legislation, but if that were delayed, it might be worth looking at SIPO to see if it could be taken as a basis for the new electoral commission and the necessary amendments could be made to confer a complete set of new functions upon SIPO.  It would have to be an independent body with the functions of SIPO looking at the constituency commission, the referendum commission and the registrar of political parties.  All these functions would be transferred from the Department to this independent body.  Proper management of the electoral process, as the other speakers have spoken about, requires attention to a wide range of matters in the lead up to every election with reviews of the constituency boundary - some counties have done very well on that but some have fallen down badly - and maintaining the register of electors.<\/p><p>A recommendation to be put forward is that one could register to vote online seven days before an election, but we have seen that abuse can happen here and in other countries with people trying to outdo the system.  Steps would have to be taken if an online system was put in place to ensure that could not happen and that the system would be one person, one vote.  The candidate nomination process, scrutinising broadcasting coverage during the election campaign, managing the vote process on polling day, the election counts and the reporting of results would have to come within the remit of this new body, as would the monitoring of the revenue-raising and expenditure of the parties.  The Government has made many changes in that area and in ensuring that there is transparency in revenue-raising among the political parties, which was not there previously.<\/p><p>In more than two thirds of the world's democracies, the bulk of these activities are carried out by an electoral commission that operates independently of government, thus ensuring a high level of electoral integrity.  This has been recommended since 2008.  The Government has it as a commitment in the programme for Government.  The Government is totally committed to establishing it, I understand it will be established and I hope the Minister will commit to a date for its establishment today and that it will be reformist and progressive.<\/p><p>Ireland is behind the curve internationally in having the management of our electoral process dispersed across the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the 31 local authorities and a clutch of agencies, including the Standards in Public Office Commission, the registrar of parties, the constituency commissions, referendum commission and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  I am sure I have omitted some.  The electoral commission should be given the widest possible remit.  As I alluded to, and as recommended in the 2008 report, the renaming of SIPO and adding a few additional functions is not sufficient.  <\/p> <p>That would be unacceptable, not that I have heard it coming from anybody, but that is my personal view of what the electoral commission should look like.  It should not be the job of the commission to oversee these roles, working in conjunction with the local authorities.  Following best international practice, as in Australia and New Zealand, the commission should play a key role in modernising our archaic registration and voting process and encouraging turnout at elections.<\/p><p>Some other speakers referred to the proposal of giving the vote to those aged 16 years.  That will help them to engage in the process.  We need to ensure the citizen is central to democracy and we need to encourage participative democracy.  I would like to see more of it at local authority level.<\/p><p>The Minister has previously stated in response to a parliamentary question in the D&aacute;il that the Government legislation programme for autumn 2014 provides for the publication of an Electoral Commission Bill in 2015.  We have not long to wait.  I welcome that the Department remains committed to following through on a programme for Government objective and I thank the Minister for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700026#DD01100","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418823300,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I commend the Independent Senators for tabling this motion which the Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports.  Establishing an electoral commission was a key part of the programme for Government and the pre-election promises of both Government parties.  The Constitutional Convention further advocated the need for an independent commission and as part of the broader need for political reform an independent commission can play an important role in overseeing fully functional free and fair elections.  Establishing a new commission will bring Ireland into line with best international practice.  Research published by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance based in Sweden shows how increasingly out of step Ireland is in not having an independent commission.  Of the 156 countries they examined, Ireland is one of only 32 countries in which elections are still managed by government.<\/p><p>Let me give some background information.  The establishment of an independent electoral commission was part of the programme for Government under the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Administration.  In 2008 it commissioned a detailed report that examined these issues and a considerable amount of additional work was done in the Department on foot of this report, although I understand that details are not in the public domain.  The Minister may have some updated information on the follow on of the Sinnott report.  In short, we would argue that much of the ground work necessary to establish an Irish electoral commission has been completed, all that is lacking is the political will to take the necessary action.  Some of the issues they could look at would be proactively managing the process of modernising the electoral register.  Since the abolition of domestic rates back in 1977, and with the rather sad decline in the active membership of the main political parties, who monitored on an ongoing basis the comings and goings in their various cumann or branch areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700027#EE00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1418823300,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Both dead and alive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700027#EE00300","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1418823300,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Those of us in rural areas - I am sure the situation is exacerbated in urban areas - are finding it increasingly difficult because of the transient nature of our population in the past 12 to 15 years, where the population of the country has significantly increased.  There are people who one finds during the canvass are not on the register every time an election comes round.  It is a citizen's responsibility to put his or her name on the register but unfortunately not all citizens take their civic duty as a matter of importance.  That is human nature.  There needs to be some sort of overarching commission that would oversee this in conjunction with the local authorities.  There is no question but that there is a flaw in how the electoral registers are drawn up.  Even in this day and age of modern technology, it is extraordinary that at every election one finds that people are not on the register.  Urgent work is required to look at this and see how we can address it.<\/p><p>In fairness to citizens - I am sure it is echoed by colleagues on all sides of the House and by the Minister himself - people want to vote.  I have found that when people discover they are not on register they are very disappointed.  Of course, the commitment of the Irish people to the democratic process is regularly confirmed by the significantly high turnout that we have across all of our elections.  Sadly, there has been a dangerous decline in the turnout of the vote in referenda on the constitutional amendments.  This should be addressed by making issues more clear.  The referendum commission is set up especially to address that at the appropriate times.  A permanent electoral commission would be able to establish the reasons that people do not vote or if the question that was put to the people was not framed properly.  The commission could do this work.<\/p><p>There is the question of rigorously policing party finance even though we have the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  Would there be a continuing need for an organisation such as SIPO if one were to establish a permanent electoral commission?  Rather than having a list of quangos that are looking into the lives, times and activities of politicians and those who engage in the political process that one specific organisation could do that work.  There is also a need to promote research on key questions relating to such matter as how to improve turnout and so on.<\/p><p>The appearance of our ballot papers have changed significantly over the years.  The basic structure is unchanged even though there has been changes made, including the introduction of party logos and candidate photographs.  There are counting rules.  We would argue that the procedure of counting votes owes more to convenience than fairness, a criticism that we have made of the system when we proposed to replace it in 1968, but it was not successful.  <\/p><p>I acknowledge that we have set up boundary commissions on a regular basis but it is interesting that the 1937 Constitution specified a minimum of three seats per constituency and while initially district magnitude varied between three and nine seat constituencies, large constituencies were soon discontinued.  I can remember in a previous Seanad when we were debating some similar subject that I went into detail along with colleagues on all sides of the Houses about the historical precedence that had been set by our founding fathers where, at the foundation of the State, there were seven seats in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency.

I am amazed that this attitude should prevail among the public.  There is no acknowledgement among this group that successive political parties in this country contributed enormously to the development of this country from the foundation of the State in 1921.  It is as if there is a blank sheet pulled down over all the democratic structures of the State.  Let us start again with a clean sheet because all else has failed.  To me that is not only a narrow and dangerous view of history but it is totally at odds with the reality.  Perhaps it is incumbent on us as politicians to fight the good fight and defend the democratic structures and institutions of this State.<\/p> <p>The systems that have served the country well should continue, albeit with change to personnel.

I believe in saying that out straight.  There is no point in discussing it, it was emphatic.  In April the Taoiseach confirmed what we are discussing today that it was a priority.  The recommendations will be brought forward.  <\/p><p>In examining this issue we will have to consider a number of areas.  We will have to consider practices in other jurisdictions.  I despise the phrase &quot;best practice&quot; because I believe there is just practice and learning.  No model fits the same in two different areas but we have to learn from it.  We will have to consider the structure of the commission, to whom it reports, or if it reports to somebody, I presume it has to report to somebody, its relationship with other bodies currently involved in electoral administration, as we cannot create a giant organisation, a filtration system across to the other organisations, the approach to be followed in regard to extensive legislation that will be required and practical matters relating to staffing, financing, funding and so on.<\/p><p>We all know the current position on which I will not elaborate.  All the Senators have spoken about it previously in respect of returning officers across the various electoral areas, local authorities trying to maintain registers of electors for local elections and the regulation of political funding, the role of SIPO, the role of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, the whole issue of the constituency commission and the referendum commission.  It is only when one sits down and looks at them that one realises the scale of the issue.  It is underpinned by a significant amount of law.  This is an area where we have to be circumspect because there are building blocks in place.  When unravelling the building blocks one has to be careful and ensure it is done rigorously and appropriately.  That is something that is being worked on.<\/p><p>I have been asked deliberately by Senators what aspects the commission would look at.  I think it should look at everything that has been stated and I would not rule anything out - registration of voters, postal voting, voter education programmes, schools, the school curriculum, the idea of sending out cards to 18 year olds is a great except by then it could be 16 year olds.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700028#FF01200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1418823900,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Even better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700028#FF01300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1418823900,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700028#FF01400","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1418823900,"counter":180,"content":"<p>We do not know yet.

It is a source of huge regret that an area beside me, Borrisokane, Ardcroney, a part of the county has gone to Offaly.  If elected, I would still represent them because I feel duty bound.  That whole issue probably needs us to think outside the box.  I recall the last time I had to canvass an area of Offaly in the Tipperary constituency.  To be honest, the people there did not want to be in Tipperary and I can understand that.  We need to look at all of those issues.<\/p><p>I will not get into the issue of the counting of surplus vote transfers but we all know what we are talking about.  The examination and design of ballot papers was diligently discussed.  There is also the whole issue of running a party in relation to winning elections, political standards and how we are going to ensure all of this can be rigorously brought into a commission which can function and have the powers and ensure nothing is outstanding or left in other areas and that it can all work as one.  I agree with Senator Keane that it is not just a case of extending SIPO.  There might be a process whereby the legislation across the board, and particularly that regarding SIPO, can be helpful but it is not just that.<\/p> <p>It may be helpful in certain areas but it is not the commission we will use.  <\/p><p>I have spoken previously about international experience.  If one looks at certain countries in Europe, one will see that they have achieved a lot of change, particularly our neighbours across the sea.  Significant change has happened there from which we can learn.<\/p><p>I was asked specifically to talk about where we go from here.  I am the type of person who prefers to address a question directly rather than beating around the bush and reading a ten-minute speech to the House.  Perhaps enough did not happen in the past.  I am not going to criticise but that is a possibility.  We have been edging this along and it is my intention to ensure that this issue is dealt with during my tenure, assuming the Government remains in office.  I am very passionate about this and hope I am showing that by my reflection on the issue.  It is not something that I treat as tokenism.  This is critically important and is fundamental to everything we do in this State.  This is the engine oil that ensures probity and that the electoral system is working.  It is the engine behind democracy.  We need to ensure that it is 100% solid.<\/p><p>In edging forward over recent months, we have put together a consultation paper on the issues involved.  I have a copy of that paper here and will be presenting it to Government in January.  Once that is agreed by Government, I will send it to the Joint Committee on Environment, Community and Local Government to be discussed over a number of weeks or months.  I will define the timescale for those discussions because I do not think they should go on forever.  I will be open to the views of the committee on the paper but I do not want to set the timescale until the committee has seen it.  Once that is done, it will come back to the Department and we will work to consolidate it, based on the views of the committee.  Following that, it is my intention to develop the heads of a Bill by the middle of next year.  Then, as the T&aacute;naiste has said, by late 2015 or at the very latest early 2016, we will bring the legislation forward and move it through the Houses.  Had I started in this job in 2011, this may have been done earlier.  However, there was a lot going on and there still is.  I am giving this House a commitment that this is the way I want this to go and I am prioritising it on that basis.  It is something on which I feel I need to deliver.  I am making a commitment in this House today that I will put it to the Government in January, send it on to the joint committee and then, on the basis of the committee's response, which I cannot prejudge, I will publish the heads of the Bill.  They will be open for scrutiny and discussion, perhaps in this House.  Subsequent to that, we will bring the legislation forward.<\/p><p>I am quite open on this issue.  I do not think there is any monopoly on knowledge on the issue.  In fact, there are different arguments around it but there is no monopoly on knowledge.  I would say to members of the Opposition that their contributions on this are as valid as anyone else's in the sense that this legislation is for us all.  It should be politically independent, so to speak.  I was very taken by Senator Mooney's contribution.  It was very fair and balanced and he adopted the right tone and attitude with regard to what we need to do here.  We need to ensure that it is rigorous and is done properly to achieve the best result.  At the end of the day, how we run our elections is the engine behind our democracy.  Indeed, it ensures that we have a real democracy and that must be protected at all costs.<\/p><p>I apologise for the fact that I have to leave the House now but there is a little Bill going through the other House for which I am responsible and which will be discussed in this House tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700028#FF01700","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418824500,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I am delighted that this motion was tabled for discussion.  I compliment my colleagues on tabling it because I believe this debate needs focus.  There is not a day in the Seanad where some issue does not arise which is relevant to an electoral commission but because of the nature of debate, we just move on to a new subject.  I agree with the Minister that an electoral commission should deal with all relevant issues.  There is much we can learn from other countries.  We are one of the few remaining countries - one out of 32 which were examined - where the Government directs the elections.  The independent nature of the democratic system is especially important and it must be cherished, acknowledged and activated.<\/p><p>One could go through a whole list of items that are relevant, as other speakers and the Minister himself have done.  Taking the issue of the electoral registers, when one receives copies of the electoral register from the local authorities, one realises that the methodology used to build those registers has not been examined for a long number of years.  It is particularly important that the system is seen to be fair, independent and above question.  I am not referring to any specific issue with electoral registers but I am aware of many complaints about them.<\/p><p>The methodology for voting is also important.  We made an attempt to use electronic voting in the past and it is interesting to note that the issues which jettisoned that system were not major.  In fact, when the system was first tested, it seemed to have worked pretty well.  The arguments put forward for retaining the current system included tradition and the role of the tally.  That is fair enough but there are more intrinsically important issues involved.  There was talk about the excitement created at the count centres and about the result hitting a candidate between the eyes, as we saw on television during the experiment.  All of these issues can be considered, but I would still maintain that the central tenet must be the democratic system itself and how fair and successful it is.<\/p><p>The constituency boundary issue is also hugely important, although it has already been debated and settled for now.  The Minister referred to Tipperary which is the one case where one has a divided county, north and south.  Really and truly, though, they are as different as chalk and cheese.  It is only at hurling time that Tipperary is one county.  I am not saying that is wrong or right but sometimes one will find that a county is almost disenfranchised because of the breaking of boundaries.  Perhaps the jury is still out on that or perhaps it has been settled for all time but I would like to see it independently examined by an electoral commission.<\/p><p>It is not a good idea to delay this for too long.  We must get it right - of that there can be no question.  There is no point in just jumping at it, as it were, but as I understand it, the electoral commission does not just deliver a report.  It continues to work as a watchdog, monitoring and overseeing our system.  In the context of international best practice, we are way behind.<\/p> <p>Out of the 156 countries examined, we are one of 32 which do not have an independent system of that kind.  The reason I welcome this debate, and I know it is short one and we need to focus specifically on the motion, is that in preparation for the establishment of an independent electoral commission, I would like if the debate on it could be dealt with in sections and that if we had a shopping list of 20 items to be considered, that the Seanad could be used to have a detailed debate on those.  Preparatory work needs to be done for that, given that we are different type of public representative because of the methodology used to elect us.  We are talking here about the constituencies for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I am not suggesting that it should not also consider Seanad elections but it places the Senators in a particularly credible position to have that debate.  My experience of these types of debates is that they are very seldom politically partisan.  I am not saying that everybody is high-principled and that they want what is best for the country but in the main there are people on the ground who know the strengths and the weaknesses of the system.  Those weaknesses have been discussed over and over again.  <br\/>Much of our system of counting of votes is based on tradition but the main issue is whether we can genuinely say it is fair.  There have been many hiccups in counting votes.  We need only recall the many recounts there have been generally due to there being a small margin of votes between two candidates, but when a recount took place it was amazing how the figures changed not only once but often twice and I know in two constituencies where it happened three times.  There may have been a small margin of error involved but nevertheless it was the difference between a person representing and not representing a constituency.  I doubt if that aspect has been discussed.<br\/>Certainly we have had no conclusions about that and that is where an electoral commission would come in.  The Government promised such a body would be established within a certain period.  I am not here to question why it has been done and I do not believe any of us want to score political points on an issue of this kind.  If an electoral commission comes into existence, that practice will continue well into the future.  If we talk about a democratic revolution and whatever that may mean, it is because people want a democratic revolution.  I do not think they have a shopping list in that respect.  Sometimes individuals have an issue in this respect and others may have two issues but the only way we can bring all the issues together and focus on them and give people the feeling they had ownership over their own democracy is if there is a methodology and <i>modus operandi<\/i>for putting forward issues in a reasoned and balanced way, and currently there is not.  Many citizens have question marks over our system.  We often hear complaints made in discussions and many of them are groundless but, regardless or whether they are groundless, the mere fact that there is no way to put them to bed is not good for democracy.  <br\/>I hope this is only the start of a debate on this issue and that there will be other opportunities to debate it.  If there are, I would like it to be broken down into sections and that two or three sections could be debated in one sitting.  I compliment the Senators who tabled the motion because they are genuinely interested and concerned about our system.  Life, society and everything have changed in the past 15 or 20 years.  We need to have a priority for ensuring that we harvest people's ideas and complaints through an electoral commission that has been promised and which everybody wants to see established.  That is what would satisfy all the citizens and not only those in public life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700029#GG00200","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418825100,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, to the Seanad.

To give some context, an electoral commission is something about which there is a great deal of consensus.  It was promised in the programme for Government in 2007 to 2012, as pointed out by Senator Mooney.  The then Minister, John Gormley, commissioned the report that many of us have commented on and read.  The Preliminary Study on the Establishment of an Electoral Commission in Ireland by political scientists and lawyers from UCD, was submitted to the Department of the Environment in November 2008 but at that time unfortunately the report was perhaps overshadowed by other political events.  The report makes very clear recommendations for reform for the establishment of an electoral commission through legislation, on which others have commented, through the enactment of an electoral commission Act, with the functions currently performed by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, and the registrar of political parties being combined within this single body but that it would also take on a range of other functions including, the registration of political parties, the compilation of the electoral register, and others have commented strongly about the current difficulties in its compilation, the delimiting of constituencies, the administration of elections, party and election funding and research and promotion.  Senator van Turnhout commented on the referendum commissions and a commission is established at each referendum.  The <i>ad hoc<\/i>establishment of them has given rise to problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700030#HH00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1418825100,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Yes, it is <i>ad hoc<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700030#HH00500","speaker":"1167"},{"type":"speech","time":1418825100,"counter":190,"content":"<p>That is a function an electoral commission should capably be able to take over.  The independence of an electoral commission would be key.<\/p><p>Others have also commented on the Constitutional Convention, of which I was proud to be part.  In May and June 2013 the convention debated the issue of D&aacute;il reform and as part of that, considered the question of an electoral commission.  There was a 97% vote in favour of the establishment of an electoral commission and very clear guidelines were given to the convention by Professor Michael March from Trinity, in particular, on how one can establish an electoral commission.  Others spoke about the practice in other jurisdictions.  He pointed out that the Australia electoral commission is a good model.  It takes on those functions that the UCD political scientists and lawyers talked about.  I was interested to note it is under the overall direction of a retired judge, who is the chairperson, and the Australia electoral commissioner has tended to be an academic or public servant and a non-judicial member, usually from the Australia statistics office - it is a tripartite function.  It is an interesting model and seems particularly strong.<\/p><p>The UK model is somewhat different.  It keeps the administration of elections effectively under local control, something which the UCD report of 2008 examined.  One should not seek to reform things that do not need to be reformed.  There is a strength, as the UCD report points out, to having some local role in the administration of elections.  We have had some good and strong administration locally over the years.  When one is critical of issues around us, for example, the distribution of surpluses and recounts, about which I have had personal experience, one should also recognise that we have a great level of expertise at that level in local authorities.<\/p><p>In terms of registration of parties, that is an issue in which I have a particular interest.<\/p> <p>I represented a political party that took an appeal under the very archaic existing system.  Others, including the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, have spoken about the 19th century model of voter registration.  The statutory framework for the registration of political parties was set up in 1963 but it is quite archaic.  The registrar of political parties, who is <i>ex officio<\/i>the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, makes the initial decision, but there is an appeal board to which I appealed on behalf of my client.  Unfortunately, we lost.  A judge of the High Court takes an appeal and he or she has to consider whether the political entity which wishes to consider it a political party is organised, has at least 300 recorded members and fulfils a number of other criteria.  The party I represented was the Cannabis Legalisation Party.  I was a barrister in practice representing it.  It was decided that the group was not sufficiently organised to qualify as a party.  There is a question mark over why one needs to have such a procedure in place.  There are cumbersome aspects to the process of voter registration but, similarly, if one starts to look at any of the many other aspects about which an electoral commission should have jurisdiction, one finds equally cumbersome and probably unnecessary impediments exist.  There are many complex areas we must examine.<br\/>In terms of voter registration, I did love the idea of the 16th birthday or 18th birthday card reminding the individual citizen he or she is entitled to vote.  Others questioned whether that could be done.  Of course the President currently sends a card to everyone who reaches his or her 100th birthday, so perhaps that is the model we should consider.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, has reminded me that Australia has compulsory voting.  That is something I do not personally support but, again, if we were to consider the wholesale reform envisaged in the introduction of an electoral commission, that is something that could form part of the debate.  We could have a very good debate in this House.  The Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, has said he will come to all issues with an open mind.  However, I do not see anyone clamouring for compulsory voting in this country.  The establishment of an independent electoral commission to take on the functions that are outlined in the 2008 report and that have been so wholeheartedly endorsed by the Constitutional Convention and by the Minister today would have cross-party and general societal support.  I am delighted to support the motion and that we can all work together to ensure it happens, all going well, by the end of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700030#HH00600","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418825700,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, to the Seanad.

We need to play a proactive role in encouraging voters and in providing education and research.  We need to manage voter registration in a way that is technologically efficient and that is quick and easy.  We need to make voting as easy as possible for citizens.  That is essentially what all of us in this Chamber this evening have agreed upon.  The only way to deliver all of those things is through an independent electoral commission.  We are all in agreement on that point.  I welcome the cross-party support for the motion, which is about increasing trust and participation in our democracy.

As already indicated on Second Stage and Committee Stage, Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting the Bill.  However, that does not mask our deep concern - I am sure this is shared by the Minister of State and others in Government - to the effect that there is a great deal of economic disadvantage among the more vulnerable in society.  I hope that the message which will emanate from this debate will be that the increase of &euro;5 per month in child benefit is a welcome but modest step which perhaps heralds a new thinking on the part of the Government as we enter 2015.  I also hope that when the time comes to frame next year's budget, recognition will be given to those sectors in society that have unquestionably suffered as a result of &euro;1.6 billion in cuts to the social welfare budget.  I am grateful to the Minister of State for correcting me in respect of the figure I provided in this regard on Committee Stage.<br\/>The perception - I would argue that it is also the reality, although the Minister of Stage probably differs with me in this regard - is that the most vulnerable have been hit hardest by the cuts that have been introduced and that those with more money and greater disposable income have managed to get off lightly.  It is said that perception is all in politics.  The Minister of State and I could argue back and forth about the merits or otherwise of budgetary policy and he would point out the positives from the Government's perspective.  I am not attacking the Government, <i>per se<\/i>, I am actually seeking to reflect a concern for the body politic in this country.  If people believe that there is no longer any hope for our democratic institutions and if that perception is fuelled by a certain section of the political class which emerged in recent years and which - as I noted during the debate on Private Members' business - has no respect whatsoever for the institutions of the State and is only interested in toppling them, then we must remember that democracy is a very fragile flower and we all have a responsibility to ensure it is nurtured and protected.  I think it was Churchill who famously observed that democracy is a flawed concept but it is the best one we have.<br\/>The Minister will understand the point I am trying to get across.  I am sure there will be an acknowledgment that if the economy is turning around - I hope it is - and if surplus funds are available, then it is time for such funds to be allocated, in a selective way, where they are needed.  I would be the last person to argue that we should just throw money at social problems.  Doing so is not always the answer.  Creating proper structures and providing support for NGOs and individuals is the responsibility of Government.  The Government must also ensure that it manages the money the people contribute through taxation in a prudent and efficient manner.

Whether that is true or whether it will be the case that the budget will be introduced next October as usual, I ask the Minister of State to ensure carers will be taken into consideration either way.  Carers are the only people in receipt of social welfare who are obliged to work for their money.  If we broke down the payment they receive on a per-hour basis, we would see that the amount involved is miserable.  These people are saving the country a fortune by ensuring that their loved ones and others for whom they care can remain at home.  If the economy and public finances continue to improve, then carers should be given priority when it comes to giving something back to the people.<\/p><p>One matter to which consideration should be given is that which relates to the telephone rental allowance for carers.  It is vital for carers to have contact with those for whom the provide care in situations where they do not live in the same house.  I am also of the view that the respite care grant should be revisited.  The latter gives carers a break and God knows they need it.  The grant ensures that carers can either place their loved ones in care or pay someone to care for them at home while they take a well-earned break.<\/p> <p>It is a clich&eacute; to say, \"Give something to the carers\", but I would ask that they would be made a priority in future budgets.  I thank the Minister of State for coming in.  I welcome the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700032#KK00500","speaker":"1132","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418826900,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, and his officials.

The Members of the House appreciate it.<\/p><p>It is good to be in a position to be supportive of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill and to see some changes.  However, I reiterate the point I made on Second Stage that we need to look at how we ensure positive outcomes and that our policies are focused on the outcomes.  Throughout the recession we were told that cash transfers were not the answer and investment in services and supports were how we could better address the issue.  I would look to the UNICEF report which I cited on how badly children fared in the recession in Ireland by comparison with those in other OECD countries going through a similar recession.  If we are to look at policies, can we look at the outcomes?  Can we look at children in poverty and ask what is the best way?  The best way is in putting it into education and health, and in putting those supports in place in order that families will have both hope, the need for which was correctly pointed to by Senator Mooney, and security.  Families should know their services are secure and it is not trying to make ends meet.  I encourage the Minister of State to continue in this way and I thank him for his engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700033#LL00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1418826900,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I, too, thank the Minister of State and the officials in the Department.  This is welcome legislation.  It is the first budget in seven years where we have started to give back what was taken from the citizens due to the mismanagement of the previous Administration.  The increase of &euro;5 in child benefit will impact on more than 600,000 families.  It is the start of what I believe will be the end of the sacrifices that families have made over the past three years.  The increase of &euro;9 in the living alone allowance, the partial restoration of the Christmas bonus and allowing families to retain the full qualified child increase of &euro;29.80 per week per child for 12 months after parents return to work and 50% thereafter are all important measures that will help get people out of the difficulties they are experiencing, as is, in particular, the &euro;2 million investment in the school programme.  All of these measures are to be welcomed.  It will be the start.<\/p><p>We really are on the road to recovery.  Unfortunately, it is more on a macro than a micro level.  This is the start of people feeling the impact of the progress that the Government has made over the past three to four years.  I thank the Minister of State for his time here in the Seanad.  It has been most constructive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700033#LL00300","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1418826900,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for their contributions over recent days.  I am sorry I am a little hoarse but I am well on the way to recovery.  It is a little like recovering from a cold where a person does not believe it until they are over it.  The public listen to Members in this House talking about recovery and things getting a little better, but they have not felt it yet in their pockets or in the expenditure.  They have not seen improvements in services.  They are asking where is all this recovery that we are talking about.  We have gone through seven years of difficult budgets and, as two Senators mentioned, this is the first budget where we have not taken any money away from people and we have given a small amount back.  I note those who are more interested in protest than in people will say it is mere crumbs, but in percentage terms, it is quite substantial.<\/p><p>The &euro;5 increase in child benefit is welcome.  We will be able to pay it in January due to the Bill being passed this evening.  The Bill will probably be signed on Christmas Day and the increase in child benefit will be paid in January.  For many families, that will be the first sign that some money is coming back into families.  Likewise, I was talking to some pensioners last week who told me that the 25% Christmas bonus meant &euro;50 to them.  However, it was very welcome because, they said, it is a sign of recovery.  It is when a person sees the &euro;1 in their hand, purse or pocket.  For many years, many pensioners were not in a position to buy a Christmas present and now that they will have that additional money coming into Christmas, as many Senators will agree, it makes a significant difference to those families.  That is why I get so annoyed sometimes with reports which pull in these sectoral areas and state that the middle-income group was not really squeezed as much as the lower-income group or the higher-income group was not squeezed, and pensioners got off much easier than everybody else.  That is not the case.  Everybody has suffered over the past seven years.  One can cite the proportionality of it, but if one talks to individuals, they only see the pain that they have suffered over the years or how their families have suffered.<\/p><p>I hope this is the beginning of what we would see as putting money back into people's pockets and a little light at the end of the tunnel.  The only true way out of poverty is ensuring people get back into employment.  There is &euro;1.1 billion in labour activation measures and that will help families.  There is nothing better than for a child to see his or her parents going out to work.<\/p><p>I support strongly Senator van Turnhout's position on services.  The area-based childhood, ABC, programme, where it is being trialled, is excellent.  Those are areas that we should work at and enlarge and we should look at how we can assist those.  The additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme is excellent.<\/p><p>Senator Moloney made good points about carers and I take them on board.  On the telephone allowance, similar to the respite care grant, carers have also suffered no matter what their income.  Commentators will state the benefit is not means-tested, but during the good times, it was an acknowledgement of the amount of work that carers carry out for society.<\/p><p>I sincerely hope this will be the start.  I hope we will be able to improve on it in the next budget and that future Governments will be able to re-establish many benefits.  I hope we will move away from the scattergun approach and make evidence-based interventions because in the past there was an idea that one should throw money at it and it would be okay, and that has always been the answer when there has been money around.  We must be more targeted.  We must look at early years intervention where children are concerned.  We must look at the weaker and more vulnerable members of society.<\/p><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and I thank the Senators for their contributions and I wish them and their families a very happy Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700033#LL00400","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418826900,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1418826900,"counter":205,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700033#LL00600","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1418826900,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700033#LL00700","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adjournment Matters","time":1418827500,"counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700034#MM00050"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Communications Surveillance","time":1418827500,"counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700034#MM00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1418827500,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald back to the House.

I am thankful the Minister herself is here.  The issue I have raised has been in the news during the last number of weeks.  We have heard of wire-tapping, underwater cables and mass surveillance and we would have to be forgiven for thinking it could be a spy film.  However, it is not the upcoming James Bond film.  I am talking about the revelations that the British spy agency GCHQ has been monitoring virtually everything transmitted via the Internet in Ireland.  I, like many others, am deeply worried by the actions of the agency.<\/p><p>This matter on the Adjournment has to do with the actions by British Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ, its operation and the unashamed power it has, and is wielding, to go through online communications.  Documents released by the whistleblower Edward Snowden outlined how a series of underwater cables connecting Ireland to the global telecoms network, or grid, are being tapped.  The files listed the cables of the British Government Communications Headquarters has accessed or sought to access and identifies the commercial owners of the cables by code names.<\/p><p>Of particular concern to me and something about which I am deeply troubled is the minimal response there has been to what Dr. T.J. McIntyre, a lecturer at UCD School of Law and chairman of Digital Rights Ireland, has said, which is that the activity outlined in the documents amounts to mass surveillance and that everything being transmitted via the Internet in Ireland was being monitored.  I have tabled this matter on the Adjournment to get the Government's response to these revelations and to garner further information on how the signing of statutory instrument No. 541 of 2014 relates to this.  <\/p><p>Since the revelations came to light, the British investigatory powers tribunal, IPT, found that the British security services may, in principle, carry out mass surveillance of all fibre optic cables entering or leaving Britain, but the tribunal has asked for more submissions on whether receiving bulk intercepted material from foreign intelligence agencies has been lawful up until now.  This decision has been criticised as it could mean that not only can the British intercept communications in and out of its own territory on a mass scale but it can provide those private communications to foreign governments with very few restrictions.  <\/p><p>The absence of privacy protections or safeguards for individuals when conducting surveillance puts at risk the privacy and freedom of expression of human rights activists across the world.  It is important that countries uphold human rights obligations and respect a citizen's right to privacy and freedom of expression as enshrined in Articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  On foot of the decision in Britain, human rights groups have said they will appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg against the overall finding that the surveillance and information sharing is legal.<\/p><p>Where I am going with all this and why I am referencing the statutory instrument, the Snowden leaks and the decision by the British IPT is to do with the fact that the signing of the statutory instrument has been criticised for, perhaps, essentially, giving legal effect to such interceptions.  It is deeply worrying for people who are concerned with civil liberties and privacy.  There has been much outrage within the circles of those who have been paying attention to this issue about the fact that, rather than being outraged as a nation, the Government seems to be retroactively legalising it.  This matter has been tabled in order for the Government to put on record its response to these spying revelations and how the statutory instrument relates to this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700034#MM00300","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1418827500,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for coming in personally to give her response to this. I also thank Senator Reilly for sharing time with me.<\/p><p>It is amazing that we have a situation in which mass surveillance is taking place on telecommunications from this State.  Like Senator Reilly, I am amazed that there seems to be no concern about another government surveying everything that goes out of this country.  If the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Irish Defence Forces was doing it, or the Minister's Department was sanctioning the surveillance of Irish citizens - any one citizen or a journalist - there would be outcry and outrage, and we would hear about it all day every day.  There are 6 million people on this island and every communication that is going out of this country, as we understand it, is being monitored, scrutinised and is under surveillance.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why, when it is on this scale, there is nothing, not even a whisper, in response.  It is perhaps part of a post-colonial stress disorder which we may be suffering that the thought of a revelation by a whistleblower, Edward Snowden, which was revealed in the German newspapers, created nothing in terms of outcry by the entire population, and not only by the population, the media did not seem to be concerned about it.  I am certain that if the Irish State was surveying the same citizens, there would be an outcry.  For some reason, because it is a foreign entity, it seems to be acceptable.<\/p><p>I am also concerned that some operators, cable and wireless, are getting millions of pounds in compensation because of this programme with the Government Communications Headquarters in Britain.  They are profiteering from this.  Vodafone and other commercial entities, under legislation, have to co-operate.  Yet, there is no right of appeal and we do not know what they are being asked to hand over.  I am concerned and I would like to hear the Minister's response on this, because it is blanket surveillance.  The argument will be made that we have a friendly neighbour.  Friendly neighbours do not spy on each other.<\/p><p>On a different matter, I thank the Minister for taking the issue of the hooded men to the European court.  This is an issue that is of equal relevance today as it was when it was taken nearly 40 years ago.  The ruling of Europe on the hooded men was used as a justification for torture in Iraq and Afghanistan.  That decision in Europe has to be reversed.  Only Ireland can do it.  I hope the Minister succeeds in that regard because there are innocent people, now and in the future, relying on the Minister succeeding in that case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700034#MM00400","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1418827500,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for raising these important issues and for the opportunity to respond to the points made.  There has been much confusion around the commencement of Part 3 of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008.  The 2008 Act gives effect to the EU Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters.  It applies only to mutual assistance in criminal matters and does not provide for assistance for intelligence gathering purposes.  I want to be absolutely clear about that.  The need to commence Part 3 at this time arises from the changes brought about to the structure of the EU as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon.  In accordance with that treaty, instruments providing for co-operation in police and criminal justice matters have to be implemented within 5 years of the Treaty coming into effect, that is by December 2014.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, these measures, including the EU convention, have been brought within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice from 1 December 2014.  In order to accede to the convention, which we have done, all parts of the 2008 Act had to be brought into force.  Therefore, had Ireland not commenced Part 3 by 1 December, it risked infringement proceedings and potential fines.<br\/>The 2008 Act is the basis for Ireland's mutual legal assistance arrangements with other EU member states and has worked well since the other parts of the Act came into force.  Part 3 of the Act deals with mutual assistance co-operation on the lawful interception of communications.  What it means in practice is that where a lawful interception order is in place in one EU state for the investigation of serious crime, it can be given effect in another state but only in accordance with the domestic law.<br\/>In Ireland the relevant domestic law is the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, the operation of which is overseen by a designated judge of the High Court.  The provisions are reciprocal so the Garda can request this type of assistance from other member states.  Members will appreciate that, given the international nature of crime these days, there is an absolute need for this type of co-operation.<br\/>There has been media comment, some of which was somewhat exaggerated, about the provision for <i>in camera <\/i>court hearings for a failure by a company to comply with directions issued by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources under the 1983 telecommunications Act.  The provision arises because, obviously, it would not be appropriate in open court to disclose who might be the subject of an interception order in the investigation of a serious crime.  That would amount to a criminals' charter to frustrate lawful investigations.  We could not allow that.<br\/>There have been recent media reports on the GCHQ in the UK.  I would like to state clearly at the outset that there is no question of any form of mass surveillance being carried out in Ireland.  It is important to point out that the implication was that it is happening within the UK's jurisdiction.  However, it is very clear that every country makes its own legal arrangements for lawful interception.  I would expect that any such measures, if they were ever in operation, would have a proper legal basis and that the level of interference would be proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved, in any given country's legal approach.  <br\/>My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has been in contact with the British Embassy.  He repeated the point that friendly relations between states include acceptance of the principle that the privacy of communications must be fully respected.  This is a principle Ireland has outlined in international fora and in policy statements.  The need to protect people from terrorist and other criminal threats is acknowledged. <br\/>However, it is always necessary to ensure that the information is properly obtained and subject to appropriate safeguards.  I would expect the UK and other states to follow these principles.  As I have already stated, in this jurisdiction, such matters are governed by legislation and there is no question of any form of mass surveillance here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700034#MM00500","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418828100,"counter":214,"content":"<p>The Minister said no surveillance is being carried out in Ireland, but obviously the issue is that GCHQ is monitoring communications from Ireland.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should ask for a report from the British Government, outlining whether there is truth behind what Edward Snowdon revealed.

My question concerns the Law Reform Commission report of December 2011, which set out recommendations on the legal aspects of professional home care.  This followed a report in 2010 in the media that people providing professional home care were monitored.  In a similar manner to what happened in &Aacute;ras Attracta, we saw people who were paid to provide home care for one hour stayed for only 15 minutes.  The Law Reform Commission report also recommended that there be amending legislation.  I have taken the time to have a Private Members' Bill published on the matter.<\/p> <p>I want to know if the Minister and the Department intend to deal with the recommendations in the Law Reform Commission report.  I know the HSE brought in clear guidelines about how people would be employed in the area of home care but those guidelines are not within a proper regulatory framework.  Because I believe there is a need for amending legislation, I introduced the Health (Professional Home Care) Bill 2014 last week and I am anxious.  I do not want there to be a scenario in 12 months' time whereby we will have another TV broadcast going back over same ground as 2010 and saying the Department and the HSE are powerless to take any action in the matter.

We seek to facilitate this through various community-based supports aimed at ensuring older people receive timely, safe and appropriate care and treatment at the lowest level of complexity.  Services can be provided by the HSE, voluntary agencies or private operators.  Government for National Recovery 2011-2016<i><\/i>commits to developing and implementing national standards for home support services, which will be subject to inspection by HIQA.  Nursing homes have been registered and inspected by HIQA since 2009, as the Senator knows.<br\/>During the course of this Government HIQA's function has extended to residential services for those with disabilities and child protection services.  However, primary legislation and resources will be required for the introduction of a statutory regulation system for home care services.  This will be progressed, but in the context of overall legislative and resource priorities and will take into account the points the Senator has made about the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  Many of the commission's recommendations have informed current standards and will continue to inform our deliberations on the regulation of home support services.  I would like to emphasise, however, that statutory regulation or licensing is only one way of improving quality and safety.  Earlier this month the national policy and procedures for safeguarding vulnerable adults<i><\/i>was launched.  This builds on the existing elder abuse policy.  It applies to all statutory and publicly-funded non-statutory service providers who are providing health and social care services to vulnerable persons.  It is underpinned by a number of principles including respect for human rights, person-centredness, culture, advocacy, confidentiality, empowerment and collaboration.<br\/>Staff training and awareness will be vital aspects of the implementation of this policy and since 2007, about 39,000 people have received training on elder abuse.  The HSE has progressed a range of measures - with which the Senator is familiar - to improve home care provision overall, to standardise services nationally and to promote quality and safety.  The home help service is monitored on an ongoing basis mainly through the public health nursing service and the home help co-ordinators in each area.  Monitoring involves an assessment of the needs of clients on application for the service as well as an ongoing evaluation of the time allocated and the care provided to each client.  Staff receive training in areas with which the Senator will be familiar.<br\/>In 2012 the HSE as part of a procurement process introduced standards of care for all external providers of enhanced home care.  They are monitored through service level agreements with the HSE to ensure that standards are being met.  They have to provide a prescribed range of information and they are supervised through regular local operational meetings and care plan reviews.  Audits are completed and quarterly reports are requested and reviewed.  However, the HSE is currently undertaking a full review of home care services with a view to improving services generally and the executive has developed national quality guidelines<i><\/i>for home help services for older people which will apply to all home support services.  The guidelines will set out what a quality safe service should be with underlying criteria showing how the service can be judged.  One has to take all of these measures together because they are aimed at ensuring that a safe and high-quality service is delivered nationally across the home support service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014121700036#OO00200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1418828700,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  It is, in fairness, a very comprehensive reply, but I think it is important when the Law Reform Commission produces a report that we take on board the recommendations.  This is going back to December 2011 which is three years ago at this stage.  Part of that was the legislative process.<\/p><p>Everyone is well aware of  the need for long-term planning.  We are going to go from having 585,000 people over 65 at the moment to over 990,000 by 2030.  The provision of home care is going to be even more important because it will no longer be physically possible to provide the current level of support in nursing homes.
