The draft RDP was formally submitted to the European Commission on 3 July 2014, a number of weeks in advance of the regulatory deadline.  The Commission's formal response to the draft RDP containing a total of 266 observations was received on 20 October 2014.  Since that time, detailed and intensive negotiations have been ongoing between my Department and the Commission to secure agreement on the new RDP.  These bilateral negotiations have recently concluded and Ireland's draft RDP has now been formally resubmitted to the European Commission where it has entered the Commission's final round of inter-services consultation.<\/p><p> While the formal approval process for the RDP has still to be completed, I am aware of the importance of the roll-out of RDP schemes.  Accordingly, officials from my Department sought at an early stage to establish a very clear understanding with the European Commission as to the shape of the new GLAS, its priorities, the actions that should be applied and the rates of payment.  Having reached this level of agreement, as an interim measure and to allow maximum time for farmers to prepare their GLAS plans, I launched GLAS on 23 February.  Commissioner Hogan has recently announced that the Commission will issue letters of comfort to member states as RDPs complete the bilateral negotiation process, but formal adoption of the RDP will be delayed by amendments to the multi-annual financial framework.  This letter of comfort will ensure that the launch of RDP schemes will not be held up by the formal approval process at EU level and will facilitate the earlier implementation of RDP schemes and supports.<\/p> <p> When the Commission&rsquo;s final round of inter-services consultation is complete and the letter of comfort has issued, the schemes and supports contained in Ireland&rsquo;s RDP will be rolled out in line with the annual budgetary process.

It is already playing its part, but the targets I am setting for agriculture are related to the emissions intensity of what we do.  If Ireland is producing milk at the lowest carbon footprint in the world relative to other countries, does it make sense, in terms of a global climate change challenge, for the country that is doing the best job in producing milk at a low emissions intensity to reduce its herd size and produce less to allow other countries, that are producing at a higher emissions intensity, to produce more?  The markets are going to demand more anyway.

We will use science, innovation, breeding and grazing programmes, feed conversion efficiency management and all the other elements we are applying on Irish farms.  In addition, we will audit and measure the performance on our farms.  Every farming organisation in the country has signed up to all dairy farms in the country having a sustainability audit system on farms.  Currently, we are measuring the greenhouse gas emissions from the herds on 48,000 beef farms.  Ireland is the only country in the world doing this.

Those accusations do not recognise the extraordinary work that Ireland has undertaken in the past three or four years on the sustainability agenda, including auditing sustainability on farms, processing facilities and so on.  The Origin Green programme is what makes the Irish food production system different from most of our competitors.  By the end of next year we hope that all food and drink exported from Ireland will be from companies and farmers, who are responsible for the primary production of that food, that have signed up to the Origin Green programme - in other words, that have invited audits in respect of the sustainability of how they produce that food.

There is no challenge in that.  The challenge for the globe and for Ireland, in terms of giving leadership in this area, is finding a way to produce more food while reducing the overall emissions footprint of our production systems.  It has to be all about the emissions intensity of a litre of milk or a kilo of beef.  Ireland has to find ways of doing that and we are investing heavily in this area.  This is why we have the new beef genomics scheme, for example.  The idea is that we can breed better animals which grow faster and are slaughtered earlier.  As a result, emissions during their lifetime are lower because they are killed at 20 or 22 months rather than 30 or 32 months.  That is the approach that I have taken from a sustainability point of view.  Essentially, An Taisce seems to be suggesting that the way in which agriculture must play its part in terms of the global climate change challenge is by simply reducing our herd size.

My Department has submitted a pay and staff numbers strategy to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for consideration in respect of the State bodies that operate under the aegis of the Department, including Teagasc.

It is not good enough that they have been left since then and that we have not had some sort of response until now, especially as we are coming into April.

We have already had a discussion on it.  When the Food Harvest 2020 targets were set and the policy was put in place by the previous Government, the three buzzwords were smart, green and growth.  This is fundamentally what we are trying to do in agriculture.  We are trying to get growth while ensuring it is based on innovation and new and better ways of doing things and in a way that is green and protects the environment, watercourses, biodiversity, rural life and rural incomes in the best way we possibly can with regard to reducing the emissions intensity of food production systems.<\/p>  <p>  We are the only country in the world that is auditing farmers and how they run their farms from a sustainability point of view.

This is a sustainability audit system which has international certification.<\/p>  <p>  We are planning growth and expansion between now and 2020.  A group of people is planning for growth between now and 2025 to replace the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  The sector constantly needs a ten-year horizon for ambitions so that we all know where we are going and what we are trying to finance with regard to growth and strategy.  By the middle of the summer we will launch a new 2025 strategy for agrifood expansion and growth and technological advancement.  A major part of the challenge is sustainability.  People should not simply state that as our target is to reduce emissions by 20%, agriculture must apply that 20% reduction.  It is a much more complex argument than this.  I assure the Deputy we will do everything we can and we will be a global leader in finding ways to reduce the emissions intensity of our food production systems, but we will allow the country to fulfil its full potential in terms of the volumes of food we are capable of producing from the national resources we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100014#M00400","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1427811600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

That has a significant carbon sink value and should compensate for emissions coming from herds in other parts of agriculture.  If targets are to be set for agriculture, those targets have to factor in agriculture and land use.  They have to factor in the positives as well as the negatives with regard to emissions and carbon sinks, etc.  Before Christmas, we successfully got that wording into the European Council decision on the setting of targets.

This year we have estimated about &euro;20 million, because we know we are not going to be accepting people approved into GLAS until about September, so farmers will only be getting payments for the last few months of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100017#P00500","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1427812500,"counter":125,"content":"<p>How much of the &euro;1.4 billion relates to GLAS?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100017#P00600","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1427812500,"counter":126,"content":"<p>The Deputy can do the numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100017#P00700","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1427812500,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Deputies Martin Ferris and Se&aacute;n Kyne are not present, so I now call Deputy Naughten.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100017#P00800","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427812500,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 157 to159, inclusive, replied to with Written Answers.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Administration","time":1427812500,"counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100017#P00950"},{"type":"question","time":1427812500,"counter":130,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[12670\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100017#P01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to address the concerns of old young farmers regarding the distribution of entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

When he informed the House of the Garda Commissioner's resignation, the Taoiseach did not mention that he had sent the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to the Commissioner's house.

It does state that a person may not go into the content of the evidence given, but no one has asked that the Taoiseach do so.  As I understand it, the Taoiseach was only asked if he been recalled by the commission or if he appeared before it a second time.  It is clear from comments made by the commission spokesperson, who is a solicitor, and the law itself that there is nothing stopping the Taoiseach confirming whether he was called to appear before the commission a second time.  It is important that a Taoiseach does not cite something that is not true.  It is not true for the Taoiseach to say it is an offence for him to confirm whether he appeared before the inquiry a second time.

He was hospitalised a second time with further lacerations and bruising to his upper body, arms, abdomen and legs.

Given that his memory is normally pretty good, I was surprised that he failed to recall it.<\/p>  <p>  In 2012, a garda went to see the Taoiseach in Castlebar and told him about serious malpractice by a certain superintendent in the Athlone area.  He told the Taoiseach, \"If you don't do something about him, you will be reading about him in the papers\".  The Taoiseach expressed shock at that time about what this gentleman told him.  However, later that year the Taoiseach gave approval for the promotion of this superintendent to chief superintendent.  This same chief superintendent is now the subject of three different investigations.<\/p>  <p>  That same garda contacted the Taoiseach again in November 2014, which is why I was particularly surprised that he did not remember him in January.  Even though the garda highlighted more malpractice by the same gentleman, he has since been moved to Phoenix Park to work in the implementation of the Garda Inspectorate report.<\/p>  <p>  What hope is there for reform as long as the old hierarchy remains in place?  Surely the Taoiseach must realise this is part of the problem and not the solution.  It is more than a year since the Taoiseach got rid of the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan.  At this stage I am beginning to wonder why he bothered.

I will tell the Taoiseach what they are facing: harassment, bullying, intimidation, cover up, denial and delay.  In one internal investigation, the garda about whom complaints had been made is being kept informed while those making the allegations are being harassed - all under the watch of the new commissioner.  The same internal investigation has been going on for 11 months.  It appears as if they are trying to break the man and I think they might.<\/p>  <p>  Why would any garda be a whistleblower if it means being isolated and harassed for doing the right thing while the person about whom he is complaining gets promoted?

In fairness to Deputy Keating, he has raised the matter each year since 2011.  He has been consistent in doing so.  It is not the first time this has been suggested but the absence of all-party agreement is the deterrent or obstacle.  Article 40.2.1&deg; of the Constitution clearly states that titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State.  The last attempt to do something about this was by my predecessor, former Deputy Bertie Ahern.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of schemes run by the State whereby the State recognises and rewards merit, distinction or bravery in particular cases.  These include the President's Award, Gaisce, for young people.  That is a scheme where young people are challenged to use their leisure time for positive development and the betterment of their communities.<\/p><p>Gold, silver and bronze medals are presented by an tUachtar&aacute;n as a recognition of that achievement.  That scheme has not been established on a statutory basis.<\/p> <p> The second is the Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad.  This was introduced in 2012.  The distinguished service award is presented by an tUachtar&aacute;n to persons who live abroad.  Primarily, these are Irish citizens who are entitled to Irish citizenship or persons of Irish descent who have made a sustained and distinguished service to Ireland or to Irish communities abroad.  A total of ten awards are made each year.  I understand you have attended a number of these, a Cheann Comhairle.<\/p> <p> The third is Aosd&aacute;na, the national scheme to honour artists whose work has made an outstanding contribution to the arts in Ireland.  It offers to those who need it a basic level of financial security to enable them to devote their energies fully to their particular art.<\/p> <p> The fourth is the National Bravery Awards awarded by the Deeds of Bravery Council.  The council awards medals and certificates for deeds of bravery.  A deed of bravery is defined as an effort to save human life involving personal risk.  The council awards gold medals, bronze medals and certificates.  It may also pay compensation to recipients or their dependants.  Another example of this type of award is the Scott Medal awarded annually by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for bravery.  The gift is presented by the Garda Commissioner but awarded by the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p> <p> The fifth is the Volunteer Ireland awards.  These are presented in recognition of people who are unsung heroes and who have given time volunteering throughout Ireland.  Nominations are forwarded by members of the public.  The categories include arts, cultural media, sports and recreation, health and disability, children and young people, campaigning and awareness raising, community education and training, social work, animals and environment, and international development.<\/p> <p> There are commercially sponsored awards ceremonies as well which recognise contributions to sport, business, charities etc., for example, the Rehab People of the Year awards, the Irish Film and Television Academy awards, the Irish Times InterTradeIreland awards, which are for young innovators and small businesses, the RTE Sports Person of the Year award, and the Entrepreneur Of The Year award, which is presented in three categories: engineering, industrial and international awards.  There are 24 finalists and the winner goes on to participate in the World Entrepreneur Of The Year.<\/p> <p> I know Deputy Keating has done some research on the matter.  If he wishes to converse with me about it I would be pleased to do so.  He may wish to engage with the leaders of the other parties with a view to this.  Within the constraints of Article 40.2.1&deg;, under which nobility and titles are not awarded by the State, we have a range of opportunities to reward people for exceptional performance and so on.

We need to be careful.  I have always had an open mind but, as a republican, I have a view that there is always a question mark around the State bestowing honours on people.  Unfortunately, in Britain we have seen the system there abused by political parties.  The system was brought into disrepute for electoral and political gain and there were allegations of fund-raising in respect of honours being bestowed on people.  That is a significant issue as well.<\/p>  <p>  We discussed this last as an Oireachtas or as a country in 1997, if I am not mistaken.  The political parties discussed the matter at the time.  Several awards, including the Gaisce and Aosd&aacute;na awards as well as a number that are independently decided upon, are outside the political or State system.  There are set criteria, particularly for the Gaisce award for young people.  Has the Taoiseach looked at reviewing the Gaisce award?  It is an excellent awards system that challenges young people to achieve certain objectives in certain disciplines and areas.  It is a quiet, understated awards system that has significant benefits for the young people concerned as well as for communities of young people who engage in various challenges to attain either the bronze, silver or gold medal.  We should not shy away from celebrating or supporting the Gaisce award and ensuring it is well-resourced in terms of the management and administration.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept the basic principle that those responsible for our Constitution took a deliberate decision?  They did not want the State to have a direct awards scheme.  Does the Taoiseach accept that principle?

The system he had in mind was the Order of the Legion of St. Patrick, of whom there would be 25 commanders, foreign persons chosen by the Executive Council to be honorary commanders, with not more than 50 to be officers and not more than 100 chosen by the Executive Council to be members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100022#U00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1427815500,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Was that the official Blueshirts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100022#U00300","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1427815500,"counter":198,"content":"<p>In January 1946, the Government decided that the then Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, should examine the question of an honours list, as they put it, in the light of the relevant provisions of the Constitution and of the practice in other countries.  A draft memorandum setting out those general lines for a State declaration of honour was circulated to the Departments of Finance and External Affairs for observations.  The system they proposed comprised An Chraobh Ruadh and An t&Oacute;rdan Feibhe.  The Taoiseach was to make proposals to Government.  An Chraobh Ruadh - the Red Branch - would be limited to 25 persons, with An t&Oacute;rdan Feibhe, first class, limited to 100 persons, and second class limited to 250 persons, and distinctions to be conferred by the President on the advice of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  In 1948, the draft memorandum was brought to the attention of the new Taoiseach, Mr. Costello, who decided that while the matter should not be abandoned entirely, it should be deferred for the time being.  In 1953, a revised draft memorandum, based on the 1946 version, was brought to the attention of the then Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, who, having consulted his Cabinet colleagues, decided that the time was \"not opportune\" for the institution of an honours system.  In May 1956, the Minister for Defence submitted a memorandum to the Taoiseach, Mr. Costello, who decided that the question should be left aside for further consideration at a later time.<\/p>  <p>  In November 1959, following more public discussion, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, indicated that the matter should not be pursued actively until such time as there emerged evidence of widespread public interest.  The following January, the Department of External Affairs suggested the establishment of an interdepartmental committee to examine the matter.  This was not pursued in view of the Taoiseach's decision the previous November.<\/p>  <p>  In 1963, the Government, following consideration of a memorandum from the Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, approved in principle a proposal that a State declaration of honour be instituted.  It authorised him to consult with the Opposition leaders in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with a view to securing their acceptance in principle of the proposal and agreed that if the concurrence in principle of the Opposition parties was obtained, the details of an appropriate scheme would be settled by a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Taoiseach wrote to the leaders of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  The Labour Party responded that before it could agree even in principle to the proposal, it would prefer to have talks on the type of scheme envisaged, while the Fine Gael party simply indicated that it would not be expedient at that time to proceed with this proposal.  In view of this, the matter was not pursued.<\/p>  <p>  In March 1991, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, wrote to party leaders inviting them to exploratory talks on the introduction of an honours system.  All party leaders responded, saying they were willing to meet the Taoiseach.  The leader of the Workers' Party felt it was not a priority and, if a system was established, it should be free from political patronage and should not be hereditary or of monetary value.  The leader of the Fine Gael Party asked that the Taoiseach outline the system he had in mind, while the leader of the Labour Party simply accepted the invitation.  However, these talks did not take place, as the political climate was not right.  The issue was viewed as low priority and there was a lack of public demand.<\/p>  <p>  In April 1994, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Reynolds, wrote to Opposition party leaders asking for their views on the introduction of an honours system.  The only reply he received was from the Fine Gael Party leader, who stated that he supported the concept in principle and was willing to participate in an exploration of the idea.  He explained and suggested mechanisms for selecting people.<\/p>  <p>  In September 1999, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, initiated consultations with other party leaders.  He asked the Government Chief Whip to represent the Government at a meeting with representatives of the other party leaders.  Senator Manning, representing Fine Gael at the time, subsequently wrote to the Chief Whip indicating that, having consulted with the Front Bench, the overwhelming majority felt the question of an honours system should not be pursued further.  The Taoiseach accepted the views expressed and decided not to do so.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2007, the Taoiseach again wrote to the party leaders, inviting them to discussions.  Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in responded favourably, while the Labour Party indicated it would bring proposals before the parliamentary party.  The last Taoiseach, Mr. Cowen, did not pursue the matter with the other party leaders, indicating in a response to a parliamentary question that the timing of any consideration of this matter would have to take into account other political priorities.<\/p>  <p>  There has been, therefore, an 80-year consideration in this regard.  Article 40.2.1&deg; still stands in that the State shall not award titles or nobility.  I take the point made by Deputy Martin in respect of abuse of this in hereditary or monetary terms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100022#U00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1427815500,"counter":199,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach deserves an award for his answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100022#U00500","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1427815500,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Deputy Keating is part of what is a very long line of prestigious comments made in the House over 80 years.

It is in that sort of context that I say this could be the first toe-testing, if one wants to put it that way, of a President's honours list - not an award but rather a President's declaration of particularly productive contributions to the people of Ireland.

To be honest, the stories we have received from throughout the country are astonishing in terms of the acts of bravery performed by people we never read about.  The biggest problem we have is to try to get people to make submissions.  One particular case that will always stick in my mind is that of two young guys who, while on their way home after celebrating their leaving certificate results in Fermoy, noticed smoke coming from the upstairs window of a house.  They broke down a door and went in, through thick smoke, risking their own lives.  They pulled out somebody who was unconscious, brought him out and resuscitated him on the footpath.<\/p><p>The person told them there was another person inside.  One of them took off his jacket and went back in - there were flames at this stage - and dragged out the second person.

We present the awards in Farmleigh each year and the amount of goodness that happens that we never hear about is incredible.

Central to all this was the establishment of a Cabinet committee which was pompously titled the Economic Management Council.  An army of advisers spent countless hours talking about the importance of the EMC, themselves and their political bosses.  The reality is that the EMC has been a way of making the Cabinet and Government less relevant and far more centralised than the Constitution ever envisaged.  The Constitution is very clear about the role of Government, that is, that it should be responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  It is a fact that the EMC has never produced a fiscal strategy.  There has been no new fiscal strategy for three years.  It has never published a full economic strategy.  If one listened to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, the Ministers, Deputies White and Coveney, and others, one would find it has been a way of keeping normal discussions away from Government and the public.  The water debacle was a classic illustration of that.  It provided for the &euro;500 million for water meters, devoid of any accountability.<\/p>  <p>  On the forthcoming campaign event, which has been called the spring statement, will the Taoiseach say whether the EMC will be taking the lead role on that?  The spring statement is due to involve civil servants in writing the document.  The Taoiseach has confessed that the document is primarily about setting out Fine Gael and Labour Party policies beyond the next election.  Will he outline on what legal basis he is using significant amounts of Civil Service time to write a document which has no formal status?  It is not a White Paper or Book of Estimates, it contains no financial resolutions and will be immediately superseded by the budget.  Will he confirm that is the case?<\/p>  <p>  For most of last year we had weekly exclusive stories on tax cuts about to be handed out by a very generous Government.  Will the Taoiseach confirm the status of those stories?  We read about them every day.  Are they cleared by the Taoiseach and the EMC before being released?  Is he keeping a list of them or will it be like last year where the leaks went far beyond anything that subsequently materialised in the budget?<\/p>  <p>  The EMC decided four years ago to end the practice of providing detailed distributional impact information for budgetary proposals.  It seems to me that the reason it did that was to save the Labour Party's blushes due to Fine Gael's very regressive approach to budgetary and fiscal changes and the unfair policies that were allowed to dominate.  One would argue that this is very basic material.  The Department of Finance has all that material and historically has always produced it.  Will the EMC lift a ban on its publication when the spring statement is issued?  Will we be allowed to see the full impact of the announced policies rather than just the ministerial spin?<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that by law all budget proposals should be prepared in light of an analysis and recommendations from the Fiscal Advisory Council.  It is a legal position.  Will the law be followed, for example, for the spring statement?  If it is not, it will be transparently and purely an electoral event and Fine Gael and the Labour Party should be asked to reimburse the taxpayer for the costs.  Article 28.4.1&deg; of the Constitution states: \"The Government shall be responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.\"  Instead, the D&aacute;il is treated essentially as a rubber stamp in all this.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach outline to the House the position of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, on the EMC?  She pouted a lot prior to becoming T&aacute;naiste and leader of the Labour Party about not being on the EMC and not being given access to its work.  Some Ministers, such as Deputies Varadkar and White, have complained publicly about the role of the EMC and their lack of engagement with it.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, did previously but has gone rather quiet on the issue.

I choose to devote one day per month to them.  For instance, yesterday I started at 8.30 a.m. and finished at 7 p.m.  I went through a range of ministerial responsibilities, programmes and policy issues that need to be moved on by individual Departments or where there is a relationship between Departments and Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  The EMC was set up for a very good reason.  Given the scale of the economic crisis that faced the Government when it was appointed, it was necessary to have a focused entity that could regularly examine the evolving and changing economic landscape.  As the Government comprised two parties, we believed it was important that there be that level of contact, as required, between the leaders or Ministers of the parties, as would apply.<\/p><p> The overall mandate of the Government was to fix the public finances and get our country back to work.  The Economic Management Council, EMC, has in my experience allowed for very regular contact between the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on issues arising every day of the most serious import.  They concerned matters relating to the European Central Bank or questions about bailout negotiations etc.  These discussions also concerned budgets in very difficult financial circumstances.  The EMC is not the Government and there has not been a case where any discussion taking place at an EMC meeting suddenly became Government policy.  It is necessary for its members to go before the Cabinet so that these matters can be discussed and formal agreement can be given if required.  It is often the case that a view reached by the EMC might not emerge from the Cabinet at the end of the day, as other views might have been expressed.<\/p> <p> Given the scale evident of where we were, this was a very important entity.  As Deputy Martin is aware, the number of meetings we have had this year is smaller than the number we would have had per year in the middle of this crisis.  I genuinely believe the EMC has an important value in keeping the Government focused on the central remit, which is to continue to secure the recovery, achieve full employment by 2018 and allow for constant changes in the way business is done and the kind of environment in which business can operate.<\/p> <p> The spring economic statement is not a mini-budget and it is not a case of using the occasion for the purpose of making announcements that apply to the budget.  It is an important entity for the Government to be able to set out its views about the challenges that lie ahead, the kind of business environment we would like to see and the strategy the Government will set out that it intends to follow as far out as 2020.  Deputies are aware that national programmes are set by and in conjunction with the European Commission that are published in or around May each year.  These are normally low-key programmes but the spring economic statement allows for the inclusion of these kinds of programmes in setting out the general environment and challenges we see up ahead.  As I said, the EMC is not the Government.  It meets as appropriate, depending on the issues that arise.  The EMC will meet representatives of the banks in due course in regard to an agenda dealing with mortgages and rates etc.<\/p> <p> To respond to Deputy Martin, the spring economic statement is not a budget or a litany of announcements about matters being implemented.  It is to set out for everybody the opportunity to engage themselves in where our country is headed in the time ahead.  The strategy will consist of the announcement of the spring economic statement, followed by a consultation and engagement with elements of the public and other sectors before the drafting and presentation of the budget in October.  It is good that there are definite dates set for the implementation of budgets so people know those timelines.  That has been of value.  That will be the process following through the spring economic statement, leading to consultation and the presentation of the budget.<\/p> <p> The independent fiscal council is an important entity.  It is a watchdog independent in its analysis and views.  The Government is not bound to take those views into account but it is an important entity in its own right.  People can see the opinions and views of experts in the financial field, including what they would consider important to implement.  The view of that economic council in terms of fiscal adjustments would have been more severe in some cases than what the Government did.  It is for the political process to assess what decisions have to be made and how best they might be implemented in the interests of working towards full and sustainable employment, continuing to reduce our debt and making serious progress to wipe out our deficit, as well as having full employment by 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100023#V01700","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427816700,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Will the fiscal council be consulted on the spring statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100024#W00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1427816700,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I do not believe there is any formal engagement but on the run-in to the preparation for the budget-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100024#W00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1427816700,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I am talking about the spring statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100024#W00400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1427816700,"counter":226,"content":"<p>-----the independent fiscal council will have all the information available to it.

That will be discussed and published here, with the information pertaining to that made available to people so they can have the opportunity to have their say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100024#W00500","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1427816700,"counter":227,"content":"<p>One of my questions is about the Taoiseach giving us a view on the continuation of the Economic Management Council and the suggestion that it should not be retained after the period of the fiscal crisis.  Another question relates to frequency of meetings with banks.  I accept entirely what was read to us.  It is interesting to note that in several newspaper reports earlier this month, the Minister for Finance was quoted as telling a Fine Gael parliamentary meeting that the Economic Management Council discussed the question of insolvency legislation and mortgage arrears.  It appears there is no difficulty briefing the Fine Gael Members or the media of discussions within the EMC but we in the D&aacute;il cannot be briefed on these matters.<\/p><p>Having made that point, my main question is whether this management committee should be retained.  It has been described, variously, as autocratic and dictatorial.  The Taoiseach has stated this is not the Government but it has been described as a government within the Government.  That is not coming from us but people within the Government parties.  Others have stated it undermines the role of Ministers and the Cabinet while enhancing the power of unelected civil servants and party advisers.  Mr. Pat Leahy, in his book, <i>The Price of Power<\/i>, identifies one key reason for its existence.  He argues that one senior Minister put it to him that the Cabinet &quot;leaks like a sieve&quot;, so perhaps it is about preventing leaks and control.  Last November, one of the Taoiseach's backbenchers, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, called for the disbandment of the EMC and suggested its operation might even be unconstitutional.  A Minister, Deputy Alex White, warned that the council should not become a fixture of the political system.  He specifically called for the role of the Economic Management Council to be re-examined.  Has this been considered by the Government?<\/p><p>Last month, the Taoiseach reported that the Economic Management Council met representatives of the banks on three occasions, which were in November 2011, February 2012 and June 2012.  That means it has been almost three years since the EMC last met representatives of the banks.<\/p><p>Given the central role that the banks must play in any fair economic recovery, is it right that there were no meetings for three years?  We all know about the number of mortgage accounts which are in arrears and the pressure on householders, which is rising and will continue.  Many times, I have raised with the Taoiseach the problem with banks not lending enough money to small and medium enterprises.  Is it not a glaring fault that the Taoiseach did not meet with the banks on this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100024#W00600","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427817300,"counter":229,"content":"<p>It is not about control, but focus on the challenges and issues that must be addressed and the kinds of views that should be presented to the Cabinet for its consideration so that we can make decisions on them.  I have never favoured holding endless meetings without a focus in which everybody throws in opinions just for the sake of it.  While I am not suggesting this happens at Cabinet meetings, it is far more efficient to set out a number of views, identify the challenges we face and discuss how we will deal with them.  The spring economic statement, which will be led by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, will include a stock take of economic performance, a discussion on the developments taking place in the public finances and how this will fit in with the stability programme update, which is a requirement under European legislation.  The statement will set out what the Government feels are the challenges that lie ahead during the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues is that the Government has set out to reduce our deficit below 3% this year - it will be well below 3% - and to eliminate it by 2018.  This means we need to create 40,000 jobs this year and 40,000 next year and in 2017 and 2018, respectively, to recover all the jobs that were lost during the recession.  Tomorrow, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, will publish the live register, and we hope the positive trend will continue.  Deputies will be able to contribute to the focus on economic and financial challenges, including the potential risks and challenges that lie ahead.  This is where we want the spring economic statement to be focused.  Given the progress the country has made, and the sacrifices people have had to make, we do not want to lose the momentum.  Our intention is to set out the parameters and secure the future and the recovery so that people all over the country can benefit from it.  This will be important in the sense of setting out where we are.<\/p>  <p>  We hope, in 2015, to exit the excessive deficit procedure, look ahead to 2020, hold a public consultation, present our budget, let the independent Fiscal Advisory Council present its views and publish the information leading up to the budget so people can assess its impact and put forward alternative proposals.  While the spring economic statement is technical in many ways, it is also political and financial in its setting out of the strategy the Government will follow and our intention not to go backwards but to secure the recovery and move forward.  Around the country, in the different sectors, what I see is very encouraging.  As I have said on many occasions, the credit goes to the people.  However, it is the Government's responsibility to secure the momentum and progress, and this requires clarity and clear decisions.  For this reason, I am a very strong supporter of the concept of the EMC.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin asked whether the T&aacute;naiste attends the EMC.  She does attend, and contributes very worthily to it.  Arising from the meetings, people have a better perspective on the decisions the Cabinet must make.  I repeat, it is not a mini Government but a process of streamlining work so the Cabinet can make decisions.  The EMC will meet the banks in the period ahead.  We have already committed to bringing in a number of changes to the situation in so far as mortgages are concerned.  The Government will deal with it in April.  The Government has put together a suite of options, including the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI.  Although the ISI may not have dealt with as many cases as people might like, banks have reached acceptable and satisfactory conclusions in more than 100,000 cases.  These settlements had been vetted by the Central Bank, and the vast majority are working satisfactorily.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the process that lies ahead will prove successful and that Deputies on all sides will contribute to it in a way that will make it worthwhile.  Everybody will have an opportunity to comment on it.  Following it, there will be a process of public consultation, during which people will be entitled to send their views and observations as the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform set out their views regarding the budget, which will be presented by the Minister for Finance.  Some time before the summer, the Government must reflect on the capital programme for the coming years, given that there are serious infrastructural deficiencies in various places around the country.  There are other programmes that need to be followed through, such as the building of schools and primary care centres.  These matters will come before the Government for decision and we hope to deal with them before the summer so everybody can have his or her say and we can discuss the budget in October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100025#X00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1427817300,"counter":230,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach said the EMC was established for a specific reason and that it allowed for very regular contact.  This seems a very poor reason for the establishment of the EMC.  The Taoiseach can have this regular contact with the T&aacute;naiste whenever he wants to.  Some two thirds of the measures needed to reach the 3% deficit target had been taken by the previous Government before the EMC was established.  The rationale for it has never been fully articulated, given its quasi-constitutional status.  Although the Taoiseach would have voted against all the budgetary measures taken by the previous Government, he now takes credit for them and their contribution to getting the deficit below 3%.  The four-year plan that the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, produced was done without any EMC.  The full Cabinet participated in it without any emergency fiscal council.  The funding arrangement with the troika, which provided the funding for three years of the plan, was done and dusted before any EMC had been established.  The Taoiseach would agree with these facts.<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult to ascertain the role of the EMC and the Cabinet in the episode detailed in Pat Leahy's book, when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, had proposed to burn the bondholders.  We were all sitting here in the D&aacute;il when the Minister for Finance arrived in 20 minutes late because he had received a phone call from the then Governor of the European Central Bank, Mr. Trichet, who had told the Minister that if he tried to burn any bondholders, a bomb would go off, not in Brussels but in Dublin.<\/p><p>The Minister had to back down, it seems, unilaterally and on an individual and solo basis.  He might have told the Taoiseach or whatever but it seems quite a number of Ministers who were sitting in the House waiting were taken by surprise that his statement on that occasion did not include any reference to the burning of bondholders.  It perhaps exposed the falsehoods that were perpetrated before the election that the bondholders would be burned and they were not but, again, there has never been any accountability about that.<\/p> <p> Equally, the assertion has been made that the EMC is about keeping issues under control and avoiding leaks, as was pointed out in Mr. Leahy's book.  It is extraordinary that &euro;500 million in expenditure was approved by the council for the installation of water meters with no accountability to the House in any shape or form.  The House was told that because Irish Water was a semi-State entity, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government did not have to answer questions and, therefore, we can find out nothing about the awarding of the contracts for the installation of meters because that is all considered to be confidential for alleged commercial reasons.  It is an extraordinary fact that the central role of the EMC in the water meter story has been to keep it all hidden from public view.  As a result of the mechanisms adopted, such as using NTMA money as a borrowing instrument, which was approved by the council with no questions allowed in the House, no questions have been answered in respect of any aspect of that.  One is led to the conclusion that the role of the council is to ram through measures about which people, even within the Cabinet, might ask awkward questions.  They did not get the opportunity to do so.  We are aware of the battle that ensued in respect of water services subsequently.  There were approximately 13 U-turns with legislation rammed through the House in 24 hours twice to deal with the issue.  By any yardstick or objective assessment, the EMC did not cover itself in glory on that issue, notwithstanding the fact that its role has been over hyped by a Government that was focused on spin rather than reality<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach has stated the spring statement will not be a budgetary statement and further stated, \"It is an opportunity to engage ourselves in where the country is heading\".

The big issue at the moment is what type of recovery we are experiencing.  While I listened to what the Taoiseach said, it is also patently obvious that this is a two-tier economic recovery.  He just glossed over the big issue, which is the fact that he has not met representatives of the banks for three years and the fact that they have a veto over citizens' mortgages.<\/p>  <p>  When I tried to unravel the issues around Irish Water and the &euro;85 million in taxpayers' money given to private consultants, I could not get to the bottom of who took the decisions.  There are not even records of minutes of meeting between the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and the chairwoman of Bord G&aacute;is.  I understand what the Taoiseach is saying about the need for focus and we all have examples of meetings that did not have focus but the EMC appears to me to be almost a subversion of the Cabinet's collective responsibility for governance on the crux issues facing people.  It is easier to control a small group such as this to take decisions and then, in an ongoing atmosphere of crisis, to push them through.  The big issue around Irish Water and other matters I have raised is there were no proper debates in the House.  The guillotine was used time out of number and sensible amendments tabled by the Opposition parties, including by Sinn F&eacute;in, were totally ignored or voted own by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach ignored my question, which is a suggestion from others, including those in the Government.

We made changes last year to the structures of Cabinet committees but one thing we did not change was the retention of the EMC.  It is an important element of running government efficiently.  It is not a government in itself.  It is not only a way of focusing on the challenges we face but also a way of setting out the options for the Cabinet to consider and make decisions on.<\/p>  <p>  The decisions that are the subject of valid discussion and accountability in the House were made by the Cabinet in respect of Irish Water and, in some cases, by the regulator which is independent in its duty.  The value we see of having more than 600,000 meters installed is in allowing people to beat the cap but also in identifying 30,000 leaks that need to be fixed.  The statistics in this regard were released earlier.<\/p>  <p>  The banks will meet with the EMC in the next period and the Government will bring forward a number of changes to the mortgage regime in April.  Nobody wants to see anybody lose a house where that is humanly possible and that is why we want the best range of options and opportunities for people to deal with this issue.  A total of 100,000 have been sorted out successfully.<\/p>  <p>  The taxation system is an issue for the budget and the Minister for Finance will consider all these issues.  We expect that up to 500,000 people will be taken out of liability for the USC in the October budget if we can continue the progress made.<\/p>  <p>  The spring economic statement will not be a general election document and it will not be a series of announcements about things that are happening.  It will be an opportunity for the D&aacute;il to discuss the financial position and economics of the country and, as both Deputies said, the direction we are headed and where we want to be in five years.  Where we want to be is in a country with full employment, a well managed economy, jobs for everybody who wants one with the opportunity for people to come back home and powering ahead as an energetic, committed country where innovation and research change the frontiers ahead.<\/p>  <p>  In 2013, there were quite a number of guillotines in the House.

He said to me on a number of occasions that he was finding it difficult to have the then Government respond to the alarm soundings he was putting out there.  Clearly, the catastrophic decisions made by that Government at the time were indicative of parties being unable to talk to each other.

Will the Government engage in the widest consultation to ensure the battlefield site, that is, all of Moore Street and the lanes of history, is properly developed?  When will the national monument Bill be published?<\/p>  <p>  We have been told, week in, week out, that the review of the fair deal system is on its way.  This morning, there were 501 citizens on trolleys and again in Our Lady of Lourdes yesterday there were 54 and today 52 citizens on trolleys.  In February, 9,600 people were on trolleys.  We all understand that the provision of additional bed capacity and the reform of the fair deal nursing home scheme to facilitate the resolution of problems with delayed discharges are key to resolving this issue.  Given the older population and the number of citizens who are dependent on care provided by nursing homes, this delay is baffling.  Last month, the Minister said the review was on the Secretary General&rsquo;s desk.<\/p><p>That was last month.  When will it be published and will the Government allocate time to debate it?<\/p> <p> Last week the Government published the heads of the international protection Bill, which is intended to reform the direct provision system through the creation of a single application procedure.

The Taoiseach previously told me the report by the working group chaired by Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon will be published by Easter.  It is only a few days before Easter.  Will it be published before then?  When will the report be given to the Minister?  Will the Taoiseach commit to a debate in the D&aacute;il when it is published?

I met Mr. Justice McMahon recently at a function.  He and his group have been working exceptionally hard on this matter, which is quite complex.  The report is not completed yet but I fully accept what Mr. Justice McMahon has stated, that he will produce it as quickly as he can.  I commend him on his efforts to date with his group.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health along with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has made some resources available which should ensure the fair deal waiting list is down to approximately four to five weeks which would be acceptable in all circumstances.  The review will be presented by the Minister.  I cannot give the Deputy an accurate date for it but it is his intention to deal with it.<\/p>  <p>  The national monuments Bill is for publication later this year.  With regard to the question on Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street, it is a national monument.  Attempts have been made to deal with the issue over the past dozen years, but it is not all within the remit of Government as the Deputy is aware, as it also involves Dublin City Council and various owners, planning permission, objections and court cases.  I am glad to say it was possible, with the assistance of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to be able to purchase the site and put it in public ownership where it can be dealt with comprehensively as a national monument.  This does not deal with the statutory responsibilities of Dublin City Council, planning authorities and the area around it, which is very important given the history of 1916 and what happened there.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht will lead this and she will discuss how best to present what will become public ownership of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street, where the decision was made to effect a surrender, and how it will be made available for members of the public and visitors and in what format given that it is a protected structure and will be publicly owned as a national monument.  The question of the battlefield is being discussed and I am quite sure the Minister will be willing to listen to propositions about it, but for now this is a clear decision in respect of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street, which is a national monument and is becoming a publicly owned national monument.  I thank the very many people over the years who have consistently made the case that this is an important building and a seminal moment in Irish history.  I am glad it has been possible for the Government to put it in public ownership and discuss how best it can be presented for the next 100 years as the location where those who rose and fought and were executed made the decision to end the 1916 Rising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100028#AA00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1427819100,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Is the Taoiseach aware that ESB Networks has contacted all electricity meter readers telling them that in future contracts will be awarded for large geographical areas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100028#AA00300","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1427819100,"counter":284,"content":"<p>All of that is very interesting but what legislation is it on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100028#AA00400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1427819100,"counter":285,"content":"<p>The energy (miscellaneous provisions) Bill.

It is a beautiful town located on the River Blackwater and has a fabulous four-mile beach, the best salmon fishing in Ireland, and so on.  For many decades we have turned our backs to the sea.  I am glad to note that the Wild Atlantic Way has been a huge success.  Unfortunately, it does not extend to east Cork.  Despite the fact that east Cork is also on the Atlantic coast, the Wild Atlantic Way ends in Kinsale.  West Waterford is also on the Atlantic coast.  However, that is another day's work.<\/p>  <p>  The abolition of the travel tax and the retention of the reduced VAT rate applicable to the hotel and tourism sector were positive measures, as a result of which tourism continues to grow.  The recently launched strategy People, Place and Policy: Growing Tourism to 2025 is also a very positive initiative.  There is massive potential in marine tourism.  In this regard, I reference the study by Carina Ginty in 2010 entitled Marine Tourism Business Sector in the West of Ireland - Capabilities, Performance and Contribution to the Regional Economy, in which she points to a number of issues, including the fact that in terms of tourism policy, there is no lead agency in Ireland responsible for marketing and product development of the marine tourism business sector.  In this regard, a person wishing to establish a marina is directed to the tourism section of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, only to be told it is a matter for the marine section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  When the person then seeks to take up the matter with that Department, he or she is directed to the local authority, Tourism Ireland or F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  There is no one agency responsible for marine tourism.  I suggest that the Minister take this issue on board in the context of the establishment of the tourism leadership group.  He might also take on board what has been done in Newfoundland in this regard, which initiative has been a great success.<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Minister that we have neglected the marine sector for many decades.  The Wild Atlantic Way is a first step towards addressing that neglect.  The CEO of F&aacute;ilte Ireland stated recently that with sound and sensible development there is no reason Ireland should not aspire to increase its marine tourism revenue by 2020 and, ultimately, treble its revenue earnings to &euro;1.5 billion.  What I would like to know from the Minister this evening is the point of contact for a person wishing to develop a marina and other ancillary marine facilities in a place such as Youghal or another similar area around the country.  Youghal has a lot going for it.  There are 7,000 people living in Youghal town and it has great heritage and history.  As I have said here previously, Youghal was once so busy it was the second busiest port in the British empire.  It is an amazing place, yet there are no berthing facilities there for visitors.  Many boating enthusiasts and other people have asked me to whom they should speak in this regard.  There is no one agency with responsibility for this.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister needs to get together with other Ministers and the agencies to ensure the establishment of one agency with responsibility for the development of marine tourism.  Ireland is an island.  It is surrounded by water, which is our greatest asset.  We have seen what the Wild Atlantic Way has done for the west.  It has been a tremendous success.  The Minister should, perhaps, give a medal to whoever came up with that idea.  Youghal straddles west Waterford and east Cork and, as such, is caught between two counties.  Nothing is happening there.  How can we make things happen?  What can the Minister do to help?  Will he consider proposing to his Cabinet colleagues the establishment of a lead agency to deal with marine tourism?  At the very least, can the Minister facilitate bringing all the agencies around the table to discuss what can be done, if not nationally, for Youghal, which is a beautiful, picturesque, historic town.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100032#EE00300","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1427820900,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this matter.  The short answer in regard to who should deal with this matter is reflective of the broader challenge we face in terms of how we market and develop a tourism proposition for the city and county of Cork.  In February this year a group, consisting of representatives from the Cork county and city local authorities, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and various stakeholders in tourism, was formed to examine how a single tourist offering and brand for the county and city of Cork could be developed.  I will write to the group on the specific point raised by the Deputy and ask that marine tourism form part of its work.  That is the best way of addressing the issue raised by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that work is under way in relation to the development of a new marketing framework for the south and east of the country, taking into account the success of the Wild Atlantic Way, how Dublin is marketed and how all the facilities in the Deputy's county and constituency, and the county and constituency of Deputy Regina Doherty, can be pulled together into a single framework through which we can market all that that part of our country has to offer.  This framework will be ready for launch to the trade at the end of April.  I believe this is the mechanism through which the facilities about which the Deputy spoke could be better marketed.  <\/p>  <p>  In regard to the Deputy's question regarding who is responsible for the development of new marine infrastructure for Youghal, I will communicate that information to the Deputy.  I can say, however, that all costs in this regard are eventually borne by the taxpayer through either a State body or my Department.  To justify the spending of such moneys, we need to have a business case to underpin it.  For this reason, I believe the best way to address the issues raised is by way of the group established in February.  This group is a response to the challenge of developing a good marketing strategy for Cork.  It is the right way to go.  On foot of this discussion, I will contact the group and ask that the marine tourism sector be integrated firmly into its work plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100032#EE00400","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1427820900,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  While what the Minister has proposed is excellent, as are the other initiatives taken in this area, the situation about which I am speaking is different.  We need to focus specifically on the marine sector.  For many years now we have turned our backs on the sea and ocean surrounding Ireland.  With the advent of liners coming into Cobh and other places, there is huge potential in this area.  The south coast of Ireland is on one of the busiest sea routes in the world.<\/p><p>In the UK, France and Spain, there are marinas with hundreds of boats and yachts tied up.  Why can we not do the same?  It is because we did not have a focus or a plan.  I am concerned that if it is considered on a county-wide basis the marina will again be sidelined and forgotten.  I ask the Minister to consider focusing specifically on the marine element.  I am certainly not suggesting ignoring the rest, but we need a specific focus on matters marine and marine tourism.<\/p> <p> On the development of marinas, I take the point that it needs a business plan and a cost-benefit analysis, but that has all been done; the Marine Institute has carried out several studies.  I understand - the Minister might correct me if I am wrong - the section in the Marine Institute that dealt with that no longer exists, which, if true, would concern me.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to talk to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Coveney, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and others.  He should look at what has been done in Newfoundland and other places.  Can we have one agency dealing with matters to do with marine tourism?  At the moment, if one goes to the local authority one is referred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which refers one on to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, which in turn refers one on to the F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  One is going around the houses, with nobody responsible.  We want one agency to pull it all together, with one head who will take this on, one person who will have the passion and drive to make it happen.  As I said in my initial contribution, the potential is huge, but we have turned our backs on matters marine for a long time.  We are beginning to focus on the Wild Atlantic Way and we can see how much it has yielded and the fantastic thing it is.  There is so much more we can do, but we need leadership and drive.  I admit that it will cost money, but it will yield multiple amounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100032#EE00500","speaker":"978","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427821500,"counter":470,"content":"<p>A Chathaoirligh, if I may, I wish to ask a question of Deputy Stanton for clarification.

I ask the Minister to endorse and support the campaign that has been mounted by cyclist organisations, cycle clubs and even some of our professional cyclists in recent times.  If he is not aware of it, I will give some background.<\/p>  <p>  The Stayin' Alive at 1.5 campaign seeks to pursue the adoption of a new law requiring motorists to give cyclists 1.5 metres of clearance when they are being overtaken from the rear.  It is a two-pronged campaign that is being undertaken on Facebook and other social media, and more importantly through lobbying individual Deputies.  Through that medium it was brought to my attention, and I carried out some research.<\/p>  <p>  The current law in the Rules of the Road only suggests that a driver should give extra space when overtaking a cyclist and makes no mention of minimum clearance.  The aim of Stayin' Alive at 1.5 is to have this distance clearly defined as 1.5 m and to replace the word \"should\" with the word \"must\".  The current law on dangerous overtaking only states: \"A driver shall not overtake, or attempt to overtake, if to do so would endanger, or cause inconvenience to, any other person.\"  However, I am not sure that the driver of a 40-foot truck or a very large bus has full cognisance of how intimidating the vehicle is to a cyclist on the road.  The very small distance that is currently being observed between drivers of very large vehicles, and even some cars, and cyclists on the road is causing such fear among cyclists that they have mounted this campaign.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to look at how infringement of the current law is being policed, for want of a better word.  I do not believe it is being policed in any meaningful way.  I cite a very personal example.  I suppose all politics is personal, because it does not affect one until it comes into one's home.  A few weeks ago an incident happened involving my husband, who is an avid cyclist, and a very large bus.  He felt extremely vulnerable one evening.  When they caught up with each other at traffic lights and he went to take a photograph of the bus, the driver of the bus got out and was exceptionally aggressive both verbally and physically with him.  That makes the cyclist even more vulnerable.  It brought home to me that the drivers on the road do not have the respect for cyclists that they should have.  While we are not talking about all people, many people do not see cyclists as legitimate road users.  This campaign is aimed at making people realise that cyclists are legitimate road users.  They are not just adults; many of them are children, and we need to recognise that they have a right to be on the road.  They do not have any less of a right to be on the road just because they do not pay road tax.<\/p>  <p>  We need to recognise that cyclists are vulnerable.  The Minister could make a clear statement by changing the law to define the minimum overtaking distance as 1.5 m and to change the word \"should\" to \"must\".  It would be a clear indication from Government that we respect cyclists and appreciate that they are vulnerable, given their position, and that we will do everything we can to ensure they can use the roads safely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100033#FF01000","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1427821500,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter with me.  As she will be aware, last year 12 cyclists died on our roads.  This compares with five in 2013 and eight in 2012, which is absolutely unacceptable.  I am very much in favour of promoting the wider use of cycling.<\/p><p>The Deputy is entirely correct that a cyclist on the road is a legitimate road user with the same expectation of safety and respect as somebody in a car.  Whether they have paid car tax is not the issue.  They are using a road with the expectation of being able to commute safely.  That is a right which should be respected and upheld.  The other side of the coin is that they have responsibilities, as do other road users.  I am confident that the overwhelming majority of cyclists are aware of those responsibilities and discharge them very well.  I certainly agree with the Deputy that the cyclist on the road is a legitimate road user who should be conferred with the same respect as any other road user using any other type of vehicle.<br\/><br\/>There is no single measure which, alone, will work to ensure cyclists' safety.  However, the provision of cycle lanes and how we delineate space for cyclists on roads are still a major contribution to responding to some of the issues the Deputy raised.  The Road Safety Authority is engaged on an ongoing basis in promoting safe cycling.  This involves providing information and campaigning on issues such as the wearing of helmets and high visibility clothing, and campaigns designed to raise driver awareness of cyclists.  In that regard, its campaign includes a specific reference to drivers leaving a 1.5 m clearance when overtaking cyclists.  Campaigns include information in schools, booklets, advertising campaigns and engaging with cycling groups during the annual bike week.  Indeed, I met representatives of <i>cycling.ie<\/i>a number of weeks ago to discuss this and other matters with them.<br\/><br\/>I am familiar with the &quot;Stayin' Alive at 1.5&quot; campaign, which campaigns for the adoption of a law requiring motorists to give cyclists a minimum of 1.5 m clearance when passing from the rear.  Currently, the law states that a driver shall not overtake, or attempt to overtake, if to do so would endanger or cause inconvenience to any other person.  Dangerous overtaking is an offence carrying a fixed charge penalty of &euro;80, with three penalty points on payment of a fixed charge and five on conviction in court.  The regulations do not specify overtaking distances in respect of any kind of vehicle, be it a car, pedal cycle, motorcycle or otherwise.  Depending on the circumstances, a motorist overtaking a cyclist in dangerous proximity or hitting a cyclist while overtaking could be charged with dangerous overtaking.<br\/><br\/>I am aware of the campaign referred to by the Deputy, as was my predecessor.  However, I am not convinced of the benefits of fixing a passing distance in law.  The reason is the difficulty of enforcing it if enshrined in primary legislation.  Such a law would only be enforceable in circumstances where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na witnessed a car overtaking a cyclist at a dangerously close distance.  Even then, it would be difficult to prove the specific passing distance.<br\/><br\/>On foot of the Deputy raising this issue, I would be happy to meet the group with the Deputy to respond on the issue.  There are genuine difficulties in respect of implementing what the group is seeking, but given that the Deputy has raised the matter I will meet the group with her in the coming months to explain these challenges and to see if there are other ways to deal with this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100033#FF01100","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427822100,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I appreciate that and I will take the Minister up on his offer.

However, we have the same situation, if not worse, with the current law.<\/p>  <p>  I am sorry to be personal about this, but the person I am discussing made the complaint to the Garda and was told that unless somebody saw that there were only inches between the cyclist and the bus, it was irrelevant.  The fact that the bus driver got out and made the cyclist feel more vulnerable is not breaking the law; it is just a bit of argy-bargy.  Until we define what is acceptable practice clearly in the law, so we can make people aware of acceptable practice and change their current practices, there will continue to be vulnerable cyclists on the road.<\/p>  <p>  The cycle lanes, greenways and anything we can do to encourage people to get more active, be it on the road or for pleasure, are wonderful.  I know the Minister truly supports that.  I will take him up on the offer of the meeting.

It might not be in the immediate future, but we will meet in the coming months about this.<\/p>  <p>  My overall concern is the difficulty of enforcing a law which might well give a short-term benefit, because it would likely lead to a rise in awareness of the matter if such a law were to be implemented, but in the medium to long term that could be diluted by challenges in enforcing it.  The Deputy made the point that the Garda said it could not respond to the incident the Deputy described because it needed a witness or proof.  Unfortunately, that illustrates the type of difficulty we face when we seek to implement primary law.  Once something is enumerated in primary law, the burden of proof is high.  That is why there is a challenge with this matter, which we can discuss.<\/p>  <p>  The \"Stayin' Alive at 1.5\" campaign makes reference to a law which was implemented in Queensland from the middle of April 2014 for a two year period.  This puts in place a minimum distance of 1 m when passing cyclists in a 60 km\/h or less speed zone and 1.5 m when the speed limit is over 60 km\/h.  This law is the first of its kind in Australia and it might well be appropriate to look at the impact of that law and see what evidence it has yielded.  The Road Safety Authority has indicated that it will examine practice in this area in other countries.<\/p>  <p>  I see that Deputy Cannon is present and I am aware that he is very interested in this matter.

The Minister's predecessor was also involved in this issue.  I hope the Minister will agree that it is regrettable that yesterday's discussions broke down because, one way or another, this issue must be resolved.  The bus workers have legitimate concerns about what might happen where 10% of routes are privatised, notwithstanding the fact that Dublin Bus, in the case of Dublin, can apply and will no doubt win some of those routes.  The point is that the worker is faced with the threat of a change of employer and issues about their pensions, pension rights and so forth.<\/p><p>There are other issues as well.  We should be concerned and avoid getting into the situation where these talks are now going.  SIPTU and the National Bus and Railworkers Union are in discussions about a ballot on strike action.

It is regrettable that the National Transport Authority is pushing ahead with the privatisation agenda without the agreement of the unions concerned.  The NBRU has set out a clear position.  It has identified that section 52 of the 2008 Act gives exclusive rights to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to operate existing routes and, therefore, any privatisation can only be on new routes.<\/p>  <p>  It is highly regrettable that a representative body finds itself with no alternative but to resort to the protection of the courts to vindicate its rights.  It is particularly disturbing a time when the Labour Party forms part of the Government.  The Minister will recall that in the formation of the current Administration the Labour Party sought and achieved a Minister of State portfolio with responsibility for public transport.  Sadly, the Labour Party realised that it was losing the battle and allowed that post to be shelved when the then Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, was promoted to a full Cabinet position.  That was all done rather quietly but not without the recognition, in particular by the people who work in the public transport sector, that the Government had in effect turned its back on public transport workers.  This is especially disturbing with the Labour Party still at the Cabinet table.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the Minister is a fair-minded individual and someone who has a balanced approach to all aspects of public transport.  He has not seemed to push the right-wing privatisation agenda of some in his party.  I appeal to the Minister to talk to the NTA, ask it to postpone its agenda of putting routes out to tender and try to get consensus among the worker representatives.

Since this is such an important matter I am pleased to have the opportunity to brief the D&aacute;il.  It is disappointing that unions have withdrawn from discussions being facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission.  I understand the discussions had been progressing with several employee concerns being addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority has the statutory responsibility under legislation for judging how best to balance direct award and tendered public service obligation bus services.  The NTA decided in late 2013 that 10% of the existing PSO bus market should be tendered following a wide-ranging consultation process.  The NTA was proceeding with the public procurement process while participating in an LRC-facilitated process to address CIE employee concerns on the implications of this market opening.  The talks have been adjourned following the threat of litigation by the NBRU and trade union withdrawal yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that there has been intensive engagement for some time on employee issues.  It is the Government view that these LRC discussions would allow employee concerns to be addressed satisfactorily.  Indeed, there has been a particular focus on facilitating existing employees to remain in either Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann if either company did not succeed in the tendering process.  I understand that strenuous efforts were being made within the talks process to facilitate as many existing employees as possible to stay in their respective companies, arising from forecast growth in the PSO market under the Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann direct award contracts.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of competitive tendering has the potential to save taxpayers' money, encourage cost competitiveness and enhance service quality.  The international experience indicates that competitive tendering is beneficial in providing subsidised PSO bus services or socially necessary non-commercial bus services.<\/p>  <p>  This year, 2015, for the first time since 2008, the level of PSO contribution for bus and rail services is being maintained at the same level as the previous year.  Moreover, I secured &euro;110 million for public transport as part of the 2014 Supplementary Estimate.  Improved public transport, whether new services or increased frequencies of existing services, will require additional funding.  Our support for improved services should be given in conjunction with an appropriate degree of competitive tension within the market in the interests of quality and cost-effectiveness for commuters.  This is why I am committed to the 10% tendering of bus routes.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise, however, that trade unions have concerns about the impact of our existing legislation post-2019 when the direct award contracts granted to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are due to expire.  I am advised that the legislation, which was enacted by the previous Government, was carefully crafted in accordance with EU law.  This legislation has recently allowed the NTA to renew the direct award contracts of Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus subject to arrangements being made for the tendering of 10% of the PSO bus market.  However, in light of trade union concerns, my Department has recently agreed to seek legal advice on specific aspects of the compatibility of our legislation, in particular with regard to the post-2019 scenario, with the provisions of EU law.  Despite this agreement, the NBRU decided to withdraw from the talks yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA is satisfied that it has the necessary powers under existing legislation to continue with the tendering process and will defend any threatened litigation by NBRU as necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100035#HH00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1427822700,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Notwithstanding what the Minister said at the end about the process going ahead, my principal concern having spoken to the various trade union representatives is that we are allowing or could allow a situation to evolve in which we will have an unnecessary strike or a cessation of Dublin bus services over something that is avoidable.  Anyone with knowledge of industrial relations would understand that unless the parties concerned are talking to each other, there will not be progress.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that this process has gone on for some time, although not for too long in the overall context.  It is part of the European process.  Notwithstanding that, for the National Transport Authority to state casually that it is going ahead with the tendering process is, in layman's terms, like a red rag to a bull.  We can understand the reaction from workers and their unions.  They see a situation in which they are going to be forced into a position where they have to make a stand.  That should be avoided.  That is my principal case to the Minister.  That should not be allowed to unfold.  Sometimes strikes happen by default.  No worker wants to go on strike; they are not always beneficial.  No one should be put in that situation.  A strike is always a last resort for people in trade unions.  Again, I urge the Minister to do whatever he possibly can.<\/p>  <p>  I have taken note of Deputy Dooley's contribution.

I did that because I recognise the very important role public transport has to play in responding to and meeting the needs of passengers, in many cases where the private sector will not do so or is not in a position to do so.

Given the situation Egypt, this should not be just Minister to Minister.  The Taoiseach needs to intervene with the Prime Minister and the President to demonstrate beyond any doubt that the Irish Government is doing its utmost to get released an Irish citizen in a foreign prison.<\/p><p>I do not know how many Irish people are in foreign prisons at the moment but I certainly do not think sufficient of what needs to be done is being done by the Government.  A man's life is in danger.  Ibrahim has been tortured, whipped, electrocuted and shot in the hand.  The stress on his mother is enormous.  She has had to move to Egypt to visit him, and she was eventually allowed to see him on Saturday.  He has been moved to the prison of Wadi al-Natrun, which is a notorious torture chamber.  He said to her on Saturday: &quot;Mum, take me out of here, they are killing me here&quot;.  I cannot emphasise enough that if the Government does not intervene at the highest level, we could have a tragedy on our hands.<\/p><p>What I am asking the Minister to do is this.  So far, it would seem the Minister has been making representations to the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Mr. Shoukry, and he has done this three times, as reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today.  The Irish ambassador in Cairo has also taken an interest in the case.  All that is not disputed.  However, what has been asked by the Minister is for a review of Ibrahim's case or for him to be given a fair and separate trial.  There is no fair and separate trial possible in this situation.  It is a mass trial of 500.  They will not take out one person and give him a fair trial.  We need the Irish Government to recognise he should not be in jail because he does not have any case to answer, as has been well-investigated and documented.<\/p><p>What is being done is not working.  This is a dictatorship, not a normal Government.  One month ago, a presidential decree was submitted by lawyers for Ibrahim but, one month on, nothing has happened.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, report back to us?  The Taoiseach himself has to act on this presidential decree because that is the only way it will move from the prosecutor's office to the Prime Minister's office.  It will only be done if there is a push and pressure at the highest level.  This is how Peter Greste, the Australian who shared a cell with Ibrahim, was released.  This is how the Canadians and the Turkish have had their citizens released.<\/p><p>I would finish by raising a question mark.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, is responsible for the diaspora abroad.  Are there two tiers of citizenship in this country?  We have given citizenship to many people.  Ibrahim was born, bred and educated here.  He has played GAA, in which the Minister of State has an interest.  He is as Irish as anyone else.  Are we serious about the new Irish or do we just think that Irish people are homogenous and only white and Catholic?  That is a very serious issue.  The family feel, and I certainly feel, that if his name was Paddy or Mick and if he was white, a lot more would have been done.  I ask the Minister of State to put aside any concerns about the beef trade or any other concerns he has about the Egyptians and to please get the Taoiseach to intervene.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100036#JJ00300","speaker":"1195"},{"type":"speech","time":1427823300,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Coppinger for raising this matter.  I also welcome the sisters of Ibrahim to the Visitors Gallery.  If I get an opportunity, I will speak to them afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  I am replying to this Topical Issue matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  Any suggestion that the Minister or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are failing to act because of Ibrahim Halawa's name or because of his Egyptian heritage is unfair and unfounded, and is completely contradicted by the record of actions to date in this case.  Such suggestions are utterly untrue and entirely without foundation, and I would like to put that on the record of the House before taking this opportunity to update the House more generally.<\/p><p> The postponed preliminary hearing of the case involving Ibrahim Halawa took place in Cairo on Sunday, 29 March.  Officials from Ireland's embassy attended, including our ambassador Ms Isolde Moylan.  This hearing was different from previous postponed hearings.  All the defendants were present and the judge indicated that he would accept oral or written submissions from the lawyers present on behalf of their clients.<\/p> <p> Ibrahim Halawa's lawyers formally presented an application for his release on bail and specifically referred to his youth, student status and Irish nationality.  Among the documents submitted was a formal diplomatic note from the embassy confirming the support of the Government for the application and other documents supporting the application that had been sourced with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The fact that the Irish ambassador was present in the court was noted.  The trial was then adjourned until 26 April to allow for consideration of the petitions made.<\/p> <p> I was genuinely horrified over the weekend to hear the reports in the media that Ibrahim Halawa was being tortured.  The welfare of an Irish citizen imprisoned abroad is a matter taken extremely seriously by the Government and immediate action was taken by the consular division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the embassy in Cairo.  The ambassador, Ms Moylan, made an urgent consular visit to Ibrahim Halawa yesterday.  She met prison officials and had a visit during which Ibrahim Halawa was able to talk to her freely.<\/p> <p> While imprisonment abroad is traumatic for any young Irish citizen, based on the facts established by the ambassador through direct contact with the citizen, the reports of torture were discovered to be unfounded, nor had he been housed in a death penalty cell as had been suggested in some reports over the weekend.  Unfortunately, these inaccurate reports may also have been damaging to our ongoing efforts in this case as they attributed to the Egyptian authorities a level of maltreatment and abuse that is not accurate.<\/p> <p> Where Irish citizens are charged with offences abroad, it is the foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release.  Just as politicians here cannot interfere with legal cases ongoing before the Irish courts, Ireland cannot directly interfere in cases before foreign courts.  Given that a petition for release is currently being considered by the Egyptian courts, the Government does not intend to make further extensive comments on this case at this time.  I encourage all Deputies to be similarly judicious in their comments.  However, we continue to give all appropriate support to Ibrahim Halawa, as we would to any Irish citizen in his situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100036#JJ00400","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427823900,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Everyone is glad that the Irish Government had a representative at the so-called trial.

I do not know why the Minister of State is making that claim but he has said it in the Official Report, and therefore it is quite serious.  The Reprieve organisation in Britain, which follows up the cases of prisoners, said that Wadi el-Natrun is known as the torture prison in Egypt by activists and prisoners.  Many deaths have occurred as a result of people being in it.  Amnesty International, which is well-respected, has said his life is in danger.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is suggesting that there is an over-the-top reaction.  This young boy was 17 years of age, a child in legal terms in our country.  In case there is any suspicion of anything, for people from Egypt to go back there to visit and then participate in a protest is absolutely and utterly natural.

We had extensive engagement on many of these issues on Committee Stage and I look forward to further discussion now.  I am afraid I am not in a position to accept this amendment.  The material change of circumstance provisions have been criticised as being too restrictive and I agree with Deputy Fleming that there are limited circumstances where a material change of circumstances has not occurred, yet a ratepayer is suffering a significant inequity.<\/p>  <p>  A classic case quoted by the Deputy and one I have quoted is the bypassed service station.  In response, a new discretion is included in the Bill to deal with cases of exceptional inequity which need to be addressed even when there is no material change of circumstances.  This new discretion, together with a rolling revaluation, is the answer.  Many of the difficulties that have been experienced by businesses have been the result of a lack of regular revaluation.  Moving to a regular rolling revaluation is the answer.  This is where we are heading.  We are making progress and this Bill will help to add to that.<\/p>  <p>  As is the case for every other Member of the House, I would prefer to get there quicker, but I do not favour the alternative which is a break with the model which means we will never achieve rolling revaluation and could potentially have chaos instead.<\/p><p> As the Deputy indicated, the amendment was discussed on Committee Stage.

The Bill as passed by the Seanad includes an additional circumstance where a property either becomes licensed or ceases to be licensed under the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2011.<\/p> <p> I understand the Deputy's intention is to widen the material change of circumstances in order that the valuation of a property can be altered between revaluations to take account of economic factors.  This would undermine a fundamental tenet of the rating system as it currently applies to both the revaluation of entire local authorities and the revision of valuation of individual properties.  It could mean, for example, that properties in Dublin city which were recently revalued by reference to the difficult market conditions and rental levels prevailing on 7 April 2011 would now have their valuations revised and perhaps increased because of general improvements in Dublin's rental levels that have taken place in the meantime.

As the Deputy pointed out, there is a weakness in the current legislation and in what is proposed in the Bill as it stands.

I am not breaking the six-month period into two months and four months, as a period of 40 days must be allowed for representations.

The first proposed amendment would result in limiting the discretion by limiting the period within which the function could be exercised.  This could inadvertently be very unfavourable to ratepayers.  If there is a concern that the new discretion will not be used, I recall stating in my closing comments on Second Stage in the House that the commissioner very much welcomed the new discretion.  As the holder of that office, he has an overriding concern in ensuring the valuation list is equitable and uniform, and this new discretion will not be low on his list of priorities.  It would be very much regretted by a ratepayer if an anomaly that could be corrected but was not acted upon in the two-month period envisaged by this amendment found himself or herself back in a previous position.  I know that is not Deputy Fleming's intention but it could be an inadvertent outcome of the acceptance of this amendment.<\/p>  <p>  The second part of the amendment is also problematic.  Where the commissioner exercises the discretionary power, it is essential that it is exercised according to the timelines and other existing provisions in section 28 of the 2001 Act, as amended, including 40 days to make representations to the revision manager.  Ample time must be provided to research the case details and the applicable grounds, which may include a physical inspection of the property.  An adequate period in which to consider representations made must also be allowed.  Taking more than 40 days from a two-month period leaves no time for the work of the valuer, which again would cause difficulties.

This deals with what is commonly known in the business as the &quot;tone&quot; of the list.  It broadens the issue with respect to the annual value of property and it deals with other properties in the same rating authority.  Under this, I will refer to the point we also raised on Committee Stage with regard to the Irish Wind Energy Association.  Since Committee Stage I am sure its representatives have contacted the Minister of State's office, the Valuation Office and others.  They gave me a presentation earlier today, because time has been very tight, and informed me that wind energy contributes &euro;1.9 million in rates in County Donegal, which is approximately one third of Donegal's rates take.  This seems extraordinary, and I would like to know how it gels with the tone of the list relative to other businesses.  I am told that wind energy contributes up to &euro;3 million in rates in County Cork.  On Committee Stage, we quoted the exact examples of cases in County Limerick in which people's revaluations have resulted in a 280% increase in their rates bills.<\/p><p> I have told the Irish Wind Energy Association that I will ask the Minister to consider delaying the finalisation of the legislation to allow time for these and other relevant matters.  The legislation was published in 2012 and there have been delays along the way to allow submissions to be considered.  Given that the new valuations and rates bills arrived in Limerick only last year, long after the Bill commenced its passage through the House, people were unaware of the industry and the issue has come up late in the day.  I am upfront and have told IWEA that I am not a fan of some of its members and what they have tried to do in the midlands in particular.  That said, its point that this is undermining the financial model of the industry is valid.  Some of the companies are in receipt of a public service obligation levy which is meant to be a contribution to the industry.  However, if the rates increase at the rate they have done in Limerick, the value of the PSO levy will be negated.  It makes no sense for the State to give a levy to an industry on the one hand and to take it back through rates.  When we discuss a rateable area in a local authority, this is a valid area to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100038#LL01400","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427825100,"counter":518,"content":"<p>We have discussed at length the issues to which the amendment refers.  Given that the overriding principle of rates is the occupation of the physical structure being valued, not the economic buoyancy or otherwise of the business carried out in it, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.  However, I am pleased he has raised the issue of wind energy, given that on Committee Stage I made a commitment to revert to it on Report Stage, and I welcome the opportunity to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The large increase in rates for wind farms, arising from the revaluation of all commercial property in Limerick, and the implications of this level of increase for the wind energy sector, were discussed on Committee Stage.  While I accept the wind energy sector is not seeking a complete exemption from rates, it was hoping to propose amendments to the Bill.  There were no related amendments on Committee Stage and there are none on Report Stage.  However, I undertook to consider this and my officials have engaged with interested stakeholders on the issue.  The points I made during the debate on Committee Stage still hold true and, for the benefit of the House, I will summarise what I said.<\/p>  <p>  Like all revaluations, the Limerick revaluation redistributed the rates burden based on contemporary property values.  A revaluation can cause significant shifts in rates liabilities between different sectors, particularly where a considerable period has elapsed since the last exercise.  We want this process to ensure more regular revaluations.  From experience of revaluations to date, up to 65% of ratepayers can experience a reduction in their rates.  Given that the total revenue from rates is capped after a revaluation, the reductions enjoyed by the 65% will result in increases for the other 35%.  The Limerick revaluation has led to large increases in the valuations of wind farms which will, subject to appeal, see their rates rise in some cases by 200%.<\/p>  <p>  The increases experienced by wind farms as a category of rateable property are on the higher end of the scale across the board.  In recent revaluations, some individual properties in certain categories have also experienced very significant rate increases.  Limerick is the first revalued rating authority with a significant number of wind farms.  The ten Limerick wind farms which have recently been revalued are modern, have large generating capacities and date from approximately 2008 onwards.  They comprise some of the latest technology in a rapidly developing area.  This contrasts with the position heretofore.  The first wind farm valued by the Valuation Office for the purposes of rating was developed in the early 1990s in County Mayo.  The valuation assessed on this first wind farm set the basis for valuing all other wind farms that subsequently came on stream, including the Limerick wind farms before they were revalued.<\/p>  <p>  All the wind farms were valued under the revision provisions of the current legislation.  This reflected the state of wind energy technology in the early 1990s and the financial and economic conditions that prevailed in Ireland in the late 1980s.  The valuations now assessed on the wind farms in Limerick, like all other rateable properties in Limerick, reflect the economic conditions which prevailed in late 2012.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his function and the Valuation Act does not accord the Minister any function in the valuation of a property or an appeal.  However, the legislation provides for a number of avenues of appeal.  There is an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation, a subsequent appeal to the Valuation Tribunal and an appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  It is important to allow for the independent process of valuation and appeal to take its course without knee-jerk policy reactions before it concludes.<\/p>  <p>  Although I hear the Deputy's point on the potential delaying of the Bill, I do not accept it.  I am not saying the sector does not have an issue, and I acknowledge its willingness to pay rates, even increased rates.  However, the situation and the impact on the sector cannot be fully analysed until the results of the appeals process have been concluded.  Delaying the Bill to allow a full analysis of the impact of current legislation, not the impact of the Bill, on one sector is not an option.  The main purpose of the Bill is to introduce measures to accelerate the revaluation programme throughout the country.  It would not be fair to ask ratepayers in counties that have yet to be revalued to delay the introduction of measures to accelerate the revaluation process while we consider at length the implications of the current legislation on one sector.  However, a decision not to delay the Bill does not mean, nor should it be interpreted as, closing the door on a partial exemption.  If, after full consideration of the facts, we decide that this is the best route to take, another legislative vehicle can be found to introduce a change to the Valuation Act 2001, if this is what is most appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  We should allow the appeals process to take its course.  A number of appeals are under active consideration.  Let us see what arises from them and fully assess the impact.  If there is a need for a policy change, let us consider it.  As Minister with responsibility for the legislation, I need the revaluation process to get under way.  The Deputy has rightly made the point that it is going too slowly.  Ratepayers have a right to have appropriate valuations attached to their properties that reflect modern reality.  A number of people would benefit from the Bill, including local sports clubs and elements of the child care sector.  I want to push on with the Bill.  I am not closing the door to a partial exemption and we will allow the appeals process to run its course and see where we stand from a policy point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100039#MM00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427825100,"counter":519,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1427825100,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I move Amendment No. 7:<blockquote>In page 28, line 32, to delete &ldquo;subparagraph (b)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;clause (b) of subparagraph (2)&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>This is a technical amendment.

I proposed a similar amendment on Committee Stage and I spoke about public versus private ownership, group schemes and impacts.  In this amendment, I have been more specific and have homed in on Irish Water.  The Water Services Act 2014 amended the Valuation Act 2001 to allow approximately &euro;59 million to be paid in lieu of commercial rates by the Department.  This is State aid by the taxpayer through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  If Irish Water is a legitimate, stand-alone, commercial semi-State body, like Bus &Eacute;ireann, CIE, the ESB or Bord G&aacute;is, it should pay rates like every other body and should not have them paid by the taxpayer through the back door.  The legislation provides State aid, and it should not happen.  I am against Irish Water to start with, and it is a further insult to the people to ask them to pay the rates bill of Irish Water, a body with which people are not happy.  The principle I am establishing here is very clear.  I am opposed to special treatment for Irish Water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100039#MM00600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1427825100,"counter":523,"content":"<p>The arguments on Irish Water have been well-rehearsed in this House, the other House and in public.  If the intention of Deputy Fleming's amendment is to make Irish Water rateable, I am advised that it would not succeed in doing so, even if passed.  Schedule 3 sets out classes of property that are regarded as relevant property for the purposes of valuation.  Schedule 3 describes property in very general terms and includes all types of buildings, mines, networks, rights to drill for petroleum, tolls, advertising stations and so on.  All rateable property is described at a high level in just two pages in Schedule 3.  Given that Schedule 3 does not need specific references to owners or occupiers such as Irish Water, the amendment would duplicate what is already provided for.  Irish Water's property, be it buildings, land or networks, is already captured in Schedule 3.  The amendment proposed would not make Irish Water rateable.  Exemptions for the rates are provided for in Schedule 4 and the exemption from rates for Irish Water is provided for in subsection 21 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001, as inserted by section 12 of the Water Services Act 2014, as the Deputy said.  The reasons for making this exemption have been well-rehearsed and were fully debated when the Water Services Act 2014 was making its way through the Oireachtas.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015033100039#MM00700","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427825100,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"}]
