The core intention of the Agreement which emerged from the Council is to break the business model of the people smugglers who are profiting from the suffering of the vulnerable. In particular, it aims to discourage the victims of people smugglers from risking their lives and dangerous sea journeys. The very significant decline in the number of people attempting to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to the Greek Islands since the agreement entered into force suggests that it is achieving its aims.<\/p>  <p>  The need for the agreement to comply with EU and international law was a key concern for very many EU Member States, including Ireland. The legal advice of the EU institutions and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office was that the terms of the Agreement were not in breach of EU or International law. <\/p>  <p>  The EU and Turkey have agreed that there will be no blanket returns.  Each migrant has the right to apply for international protection in Greece and to have their application assessed on an individual basis in line with international law, including with a right to appeal. Part of this assessment process includes ascertaining whether Turkey can be considered a safe country given an irregular migrant or asylum seeker&rsquo;s individual circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  Turkey has provided formal guarantees as part of the EU-Turkey Agreement that Syrian refugees returned to Turkey will be granted temporary protection upon return. Non-Syrians in need of international protection who are returned to Turkey, will also be able to apply for and receive protection there. The European Commission reported on 4 May that Turkey has received all those returned from Greece in accordance with the Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The EU is also committed to assisting Turkey deal with the enormous challenge of hosting some 2.7 million refugees and to improve the situation for these refugees. To this end, the EU has established a &euro;3 billion Facility for Refugees in Turkey. This Facility aims to support Syrians and other refugees by providing access to food, shelter, education, and healthcare. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of recent reports by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, including testimony from migrants and witnesses that some Turkish border guards have used violence against Syrians.  These reports are very worrying and will require a full investigation by the Turkish authorities. While Turkey has a right to secure its border with Syria, all actions on the part of Turkey must be in line with international law.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, the issue of human rights in Turkey has been raised by the Taoiseach at European Council and continues to form an integral part of the country&rsquo;s enlargement process, which we, along with our European partners keep under close review.  At the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 May, I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in respect of the rule of law, human rights and freedom of the media in Turkey and the need to hold Turkey to account to the core European values inherent in the accession process. <\/p>  <p>On 10th   September 2015 the Government agreed to establish the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and to accept up to 4,000 persons in total under the EU&rsquo;s resettlement and relocation programmes. It is expected that these numbers will be augmented further by family reunifications. The figure of 4,000 includes approximately 2,600 asylum seekers to be taken from Italy and Greece under the EU relocation programme and 520 refugees which the Government has committed to taking in by the end of 2016 under Ireland&rsquo;s refugee resettlement programme.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 2015, 276 people have been resettled and a further 10 relocated  to Ireland. A further 11 people were resettled on 17 May, while an additional 138 are expected in June and a further 108 September 2016. 31 people are expected to be relocated to Ireland from Greece in the coming weeks, and the State has pledged to take a further 40 on relocation from that country shortly afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  The relocation and resettlement programmes are specific EU orientated programmes. They are separate to the ongoing acceptance of refugees who make applications for asylum in this jurisdiction or decisions made from time to time to accept groups of refugees from specific regions of the world. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600039#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Question No. 13 answered with Question No. 8.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Reports","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600039#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[11951\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600039#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has received a briefing from the Irish ambassador in France on the Nuit Debout movement of young persons and trade unionists which has emerged in response to the attempt by the President of France, Mr Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, to change the country's labour laws; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1281","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>The Irish Embassy in Paris reports continually on all significant political and economic developments in France, including the question of labour law reform.

Violations of international humanitarian law preventing access to communities in need of assistance compound this challenge. Ireland continues to work with our partners to respond actively and effectively. Last year, we provided some &euro;140 million in humanitarian assistance.   Earlier this week, world leaders, civil society and representatives of the private sector gathered at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, which was called by the UN Secretary General to address the scale of humanitarian crisis. President Michael D. Higgins and I led Ireland's delegation to the Summit.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen the scale of the humanitarian crisis first-hand in Europe over the last year as increasing numbers flee conflict in desperate need of safety. 60 million people worldwide are now displaced their homes. Over 4.8 million people have fled from Syria alone. Many millions more &ndash; in Syria, Iraq, South Sudan and Nigeria &ndash; have sought safety within their own countries. <\/p>  <p>  Providing safe havens within conflict zones is extremely difficult, especially where the warring parties do not prioritise the protection of civilians. Such safe havens require a mandate from the UN Security Council as well as robustly equipped peacekeeping personnel.<\/p>  <p>  As UN Secretary-General Ban has stated:  &ldquo;Peace operations can and have succeeded when they are an expression of strong and unified international political will. &hellip; To deploy them in the absence of a political strategy for resolving the conflict is to risk lives and money in pursuit of a peace that will likely remain elusive.&rdquo; <\/p>  <p>  In many of today&rsquo;s conflicts, this political will is lacking, including from some on the UN Security Council. However, in other places, the UN is active and there are more than twice as many UN peacekeepers deployed today as there were 15 years ago.

I deplore in the strongest terms the attacks against medical facilities, and the removal by the Syrian authorities of medical supplies from convoys en route to besieged areas. There must be legal accountability for these crimes, and in 2014 Ireland co-sponsored a resolution calling for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.<\/p>  <p>  Conscious of the difficulties in securing humanitarian access, I am determined that Ireland&rsquo;s funding for Syria will support those organisations which are best placed to reach those in need, including in besieged areas. In 2015, Irish Aid provided a total of &euro;1.75 million to support the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC). Both have succeeded in recent months in negotiating access to besieged towns for convoys of food and other humanitarian supplies.<\/p>  <p>  Against the background of this appalling conflict, and its tragic humanitarian consequences, the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul earlier this week was an important opportunity to galvanise the international community in ensuring more effective and responsive humanitarian action. Ireland&rsquo;s delegation to the Summit was led by President Michael D. Higgins, and Joe McHugh T.D., Minister of State for the Diaspora and Overseas Development Aid. Civil society organisations had a strong and valued presence. Ireland shares their outrage at violations of International Humanitarian Law, and their conviction that the international community must do more to enable refugees to rebuild their lives.

I made clear the Government&rsquo;s readiness to work together with the Executive and the Assembly, in the months and years ahead on the important issues facing our island, North and South, including the full implementation of the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements.<\/p>  <p>  I also held discussions with the Commissioner for Victims and Survivors, Ms. Judith Thompson, and UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, Mr. Pablo de Greiff on issues arising from the legacy of the past, including how to progress the establishment of the institutions provided for under the Stormont House Agreement. Following the recent Assembly elections, it is now crucial that the outstanding issues relating to the legacy of the past are resolved and the necessary political agreement achieved. <\/p>  <p>  I was pleased to have the opportunity to meet with the Chief Commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, Mr. Les Allamby. Our discussion focused on the human rights commitments contained in the Good Friday Agreement some of which are still outstanding. As a co-guarantor, the Government is determined to work to ensure the full implementation of the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements. <\/p>  <p>  I visited the Houben Centre in the grounds of the Holy Cross monastery in North Belfast, to meet with community representatives and to show my solidarity with them as they work to improve their local area in the face of considerable challenges.  While there, I met with the widow of Michael McGibbon, who was murdered earlier this month, and expressed to her my condolences and those of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  I also met with Mr. Jim Shaw, the President of the Irish Football Association, ahead of the participation by both the Ireland and Northern Ireland teams in the Euro2016 championships.

Those objectives, as previously reported to the House, are to seek the release of this citizen at the earliest opportunity so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland, and to provide consular assistance to the citizen and his family while he remains in detention.  In support of these objectives, the Government has engaged extensively with the Egyptian authorities and repeatedly underlined the importance which we attach to this case. I have had numerous discussions with my Egyptian counterpart and HRVP Mogherini about this case, and officials in my Department remain in close contact with the Egyptian authorities in Dublin and in Cairo. The Taoiseach has also discussed the case directly with the Egyptian President on two occasions.   Furthermore, my Department has consulted with other countries who have had citizens in similar situations in order to inform our approach and ensure that any actions taken are in this citizen&rsquo;s best interests. The information we receive from all of our contacts is carefully considered and we retain the flexibility to adapt our strategy as necessary.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has noted the recent media commentary on correspondence between the Egyptian Government and the UN in 2015. Last summer, petitions were filed on behalf of this citizen by their legal representatives with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism.<\/p>  <p>  On 14 August 2015, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers; the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment wrote jointly to the Egyptian Government presenting  a number of allegations made on behalf of the citizen and seeking that Government&rsquo;s views.

As part of the follow-up to that initiative, in November 2013 the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group focussed on the issue of Irish Sign Language. This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the NDA, the Deaf Community and other relevant stakeholders, who reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard, in particular to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language, including in service provision. The Group also examined mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and address practical implications for service users.

The Government is therefore committed to reforming the Direct Provision system, with particular focus on families and children. The report of the Working Group to Government on Improvements to the Protection Process, including Direct Provision and Supports to Asylum Seekers, otherwise known as the McMahon Report, has set out a blueprint for a number of reforms in this area including a number which focus on the Direct Provision system itself.  <\/p>  <p>  The McMahon Report indicated a two-way approach towards improving the life of persons within the protection process by (i) improving the application process and thereby reducing the length of time spent by applicants in State provided accommodation and (ii) improving the quality of life of those in accommodation through improvements of services within the accommodation system itself but also the supports available through other agencies and bodies.  That Report documented some 173 recommendations covering a broad spectrum of services and supports, including those relating to direct provision accommodation. To date, many of these recommendations have been implemented including an increase to the direct provision allowance for children, improvements in child protection supports and linkages with Tusla, and access to third level education for children five years in the direct provision system. <\/p>  <p>  Major improvements are anticipated in the length of time that applicants spend in RIA accommodation once the International Protection Act 2015 has been commenced.  Also, the efforts made to address the situation of those  who have been in the system for more than five years, another key recommendation in the Report, is already impacting positively on the numbers of persons in accommodation centres. The Citizens Information Board, supported by a range of other State agencies, has provided information sessions within RIA centres to former asylum seekers who have permission to stay in the State and who are now moving out of the Direct Provision system.<\/p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency is currently working to implement remaining recommendations.  While the Reception and Integration Agency continues to explore ways in which accommodation services can be improved, a number of the more relevant recommendations in this area are complex. This includes access to cooking facilities and additional living space for families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600040#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Statute of Limitations","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600040#WRB03550"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[12308\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600040#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she will reinstate a three-year statute of limitations period for families who have to fight for inquests into maternal and baby deaths, given the absence of legislation regarding a statutory duty of candour for clinicians and until such time as such legislation is introduced and given the inordinate length of time for which families have to fight for these.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>The previous Government gave its approval in November 2015 to the drafting of provisions to support open disclosure of patient safety incidents, for inclusion in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill.

how he will address these concerns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":149,"content":"<p>The European Commission's 2016 Country Report makes a range of comments in regard to the Irish tax system including those highlighted by the Deputy. In addition, the accompanying Country Specific Recommendations for Ireland include a number of recommendations concerning the Irish tax system. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the ratio of tax revenue to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), on this measure, Ireland has a relatively low tax burden by European standards according to the latest data. In 2014 total taxes amounted to 30.5% of GDP compared to the EU-28 average of 37.1%. However, given the exceptional gap between GDP and Gross National Product (GNP) in Ireland, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) have argued that a more appropriate measure of fiscal capacity is a hybrid measure taking GNP plus 40 per cent of the gap between GDP and GNP.\u00a0 On this basis, the tax take share rises to 33.2%. <\/p>  <p>  If social security contributions (SSC) are excluded from the comparison (given the stronger insurance character of these systems in other EU countries compared with Ireland), the tax take at 24.7% of GDP is marginally below the EU-28 average of 25.6%. As a percentage of the IFAC measure this rises above the EU average to 26.9%.<\/p>  <p>  The April 2016 Stability Programme Update indicates that the tax burden is forecast to fall to 28% of GDP in 2016 from 29.2% of GDP in 2015. Comparing 2015 and 2016, the reduction in the tax to GDP ratio can be primarily attributed to the growth in nominal GDP from &euro;214,625 million to &euro;230,950 million rather than the change in tax revenue from &euro;62,675 million to &euro;64,650 million.<\/p>  <p>  The progressivity of the tax system should be looked at in conjunction with other elements such as welfare and public expenditure which in combination give a more comprehensive picture. Although this is more difficult to do, the ESRI's Social Welfare and Income Tax Changes (SWITCH) model captures the main changes in the income tax and welfare system on equivalised household disposable incomes. The Social Impact Assessment (SIA) of Budget 2016, published by the Department of Social Protection and contributed to by my Department used this approach. It showed that the greatest percentage gains in household income were for the second income quintile at 2 per cent, followed by the first quintile (the bottom 20% of households by\u00a0income) at 1.8 per cent. The 3rd, 4th and 5th quintiles gain just below the average, at around 1.5 per cent.<\/p>  <p>  However, this SWITCH analysis is a static analysis. Separately SWITCH calculates Marginal Effective Tax Rates (METRs) which measure what part of any additional earnings are \"taxed away\" through the combined effect of increasing tax and decreasing benefit. The Social Impact Assessment found that over three quarters of people employed are estimated to experience a reduction in their METR as a result of Budget 2016. To the extent that individuals take up employment as a result of reduced METRs they would be better off than the distributional analysis indicates.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish income tax system remains highly progressive. The most recent data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) for 2015 shows Ireland has the most progressive income tax system of the EU members of the OECD and is the second most progressive of all members of the OECD. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the elements of the Commission's 2016 Country Report highlighted by the Deputy did not feature in the Country Specific Recommendation for Ireland. These emphasised the importance of an efficient and growth friendly tax system as well as broadening the tax base as the most important issues for the Irish tax system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600042#WRD03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Relief Availability","counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600043#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":152,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[12259\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600043#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if sections 74, 81D and Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, of the Finance Act 2014 dealing with relief for certain leases of farmland have come into force yet if not, when they will; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":153,"content":"<p>One of the recommendations of the Agri-taxation Review was that stamp duty relief be given in relation to certain leases of farmland to encourage more productive use of land.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of Section 74 of the Finance Act this recommendation is now reflected in Section 81D of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.

The production qualification threshold for microbreweries, and the maximum amount that may be claimed by them, is set by each Member State, but is subject to an upper annual production and claim threshold of 200,000 hectolitres under the Directive.<\/p><p>In Ireland, the production threshold is 30,000 hectolitres in the prior calendar year. The maximum quantity of beer on which relief is allowed for any qualifying brewery in any calendar year is 30,000 hectolitres. Following review of the scheme by my Department in 2014, these thresholds were increased from 20,000 hectolitres in Budget 2015. In Budget 2016, I introduced a further measure to allow the relief to be claimed upfront from January 2016. This measure is intended to reduce the cash-flow burden on microbrewers who, until this point, could claim by repayment only.<\/p><p>The production threshold limit of 30,000 hectolitres in the prior calendar year is set at that level to ensure that the relief\u00a0can only be claimed by small undertakings.\u00a0 This gives these small indigenous businesses\u00a0encouragement and assistance\u00a0to compete with larger breweries who enjoy the benefits offered by scale.<\/p><p>The production thresholds for qualification as a microbrewery vary across Member States. Beer brewed in qualifying microbreweries in other member states and brought into this State for consumption is eligible for the same relief as that which is produced in the State. Therefore, increases in the production threshold for microbreweries in this State will increase the volume of qualifying beer imported from other member states that is eligible for the relief also.<\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioners<b><\/b>have published an information leaflet on the microbrewery relief on their website that can be accessed at the following link:<b><\/b><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The Commissioners inform me that, in the period from 2011 to 2015, the number of claimants for microbrewery relief increased from 17 to 73.

Changes since then have given people more choices for what to do with their pension savings.  This is called the flexible options at retirement regime.  These choices include taking a cash payment, subject to income tax, investing in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or investing in an approved minimum retirement fund (AMRF).<\/p>  <p>  Until he or she is 75, a person can only take the whole amount of their savings as cash or put it in an ARF if he or she has a guaranteed pension income of &euro;12,700 or more.  If these conditions are not met then he or she can buy an annuity or put a certain amount of the funds, called the \"set aside\" amount into an AMRF.  The maximum \"set-aside\" is &euro;63,500 or the remaining value of the pension funds, after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum, if less than &euro;63,500.  These requirements have been in place since the introduction of the flexible options at retirement regime and are therefore of long standing.<\/p>  <p>  The funds in an AMRF can be used at any time, in full or in part, to buy an annuity.  This includes the option to buy an annuity which is large enough to give the owner a guaranteed income of &euro;12,700.  If the owner does this he or she will then have access to the rest of the funds, as their AMRF then converts into and ARF with discretionary access to the funds, subject to tax at their marginal rate.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that a person without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension \"safety net\" to provide for the latter years of his or her retirement.  However, every year to age 75, the owner of an AMRF can access 4% of the funds in the AMRF.<\/p>  <p>  If an individual meets the requirements to be able to access the full amount of the funds in an AMRF and chooses to do so then it is taxable in the hands of the recipient as income for the tax year in which it is paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600044#WRF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600045#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[12460\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600045#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding insurance premiums.","asker":"1295","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation. \u00a0The ability of the Government to influence insurance pricing is limited as insurance companies are required under European law to price in accordance with risk and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing or the provision of insurance products. <\/p>  <p>  Insurance companies consider a number of risks when determining the premium for a proposed insurance policy and\u00a0the premium\u00a0will take account of\u00a0the actuarial calculation of risk. <\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has informed me that motor insurers\u00a0in deciding\u00a0on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply to cover use a combination of rating factors, such as the age of the driver, the type of car, claims record, driving experience, number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.\u00a0Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, prices vary across the market, and consumers are free to choose.<\/p>  <p>  While the provision and the pricing of insurance policies is a commercial matter for insurance companies, this does not preclude\u00a0the Government from\u00a0introducing measures that\u00a0may,\u00a0in the longer term, lead to a better claims environment\u00a0that could facilitate a\u00a0reduction in claims costs.<\/p>  <p>  The question of the cost of insurance is a complex one involving a number of Government Departments, State Bodies and private sector organisations.\u00a0I have asked my officials\u00a0to examine the\u00a0factors which contribute to increasing\u00a0the cost of insurance.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This work\u00a0is part of an overall review of policy in the insurance\u00a0sector which my Department is carrying out in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments, Agencies and external stakeholders.\u00a0 The objective of the Review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.\u00a0The Review of Policy in the Insurance Sector\u00a0will continue over the coming months and is expected to be completed by the end of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600045#WRG00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Relief Availability","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600045#WRG00350"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[12486\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600045#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax relief and allowances in place for persons employing au pairs given that the contracts are deemed to be normal contracts of employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>There are no specific tax reliefs or allowances provided for in the Taxes Acts with respect to the employment of au pairs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be concerned with regard to the obligations of parents employing au pairs to register as an employer and deduct PAYE, USC and PRSI from payments to such au pairs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In this respect, under regulation 9 of the Income Tax (Employments) (Consolidated) Regulations 2001 (S.I.

With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives. In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities. <\/p>  <p>  The intention has always been that a Technological University would be distinctly different from traditional universities and institutes of technology by virtue of their mission relating to graduate formation, applied research and scholarship, dissemination of knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise with a very strong regional focus.<\/p>  <p>  Regional Focus:   There will also be a specific focus on the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located.  The development of technological universities has the potential to deliver greater opportunity to students in these regions, to staff working in the institutions, and to the broader local economy and society.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Strategy, the Higher Education Authority in 2012 published a four-stage process and criteria for applicant groups of institutes of technology wishing to apply to become technological universities. <\/p>  <p>  The designation process consists of four stages as follows<\/p>  <p> - an expression of interest,<\/p>  <p> - the preparation of a plan to meet the criteria,<\/p>  <p> - an evaluation of the plan, and<\/p>  <p> - an application for designation.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently four consortia engaged with the process to become designated as TUs.  These are TU4Dublin (Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Tallaght, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown), Technological University for the South-East (TUSE &ndash; consisting of Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow), Munster Technological University (MTU &ndash; consisting of Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Tralee) and the Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA &ndash; consisting of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology). <\/p>  <p>  Status of Consortia:<\/p>  <p>  At the end of 2014, two consortia successfully passed stage 3 of the four-stage process.  These are the TU4Dublin consortium and the Munster Technological University consortium. <\/p>  <p>  In early 2015 the Connacht-Ulster Alliance also expressed an interest in merging and in applying to become a technological university.  This application was approved to proceed to the next stage. In line with the process for designation as a Technological University, Stage 2 of this process involves the preparation of a plan by the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, to meet the criteria for designation as a Technological University.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Technological University for the South-East, consisting of Institute of Technology, Carlow (ITC) and Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT), following the publication of the Kelly report, a preliminary facilitation process which was underway since September 2015, has recently been completed and a Report of the process was received by my Department on 13 May 2016. There was strong engagement in the process by both parties.  This facilitation process has been an important building block in terms of building trust between the parties and in developing a strong working relationship between the Presidents and Chairs of both institutions.  As part of this process, the Presidents of the two institutions, have jointly developed an initial work plan to support the development of a joint TU proposal.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, both Institutions made a recent joint presentation and submission to the Higher Education Authority, seeking funding to underpin the next phase of engagement.

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the Scheme is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, housing authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income.<\/p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of the tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants can be included, as can the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner\/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them. <\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.  This is necessary to ensure that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant. <\/p>  <p>  The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.

Therefore, tenants of local authority houses who wish to participate in the scheme must provide the relevant certificate from Irish Water, in order for the sale of the house to be completed.<\/p>  <p>  Under the confidence and supply arrangement agreed in the context of facilitating a minority government, the Government is committed to introducing and supporting legislation in the Oireachtas, within six weeks of its appointment, to suspend domestic water charges for a period of nine months from the end of the current bill cycle.

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by-weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.<\/p>  <p>  During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria. <\/p>  <p>  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then for a limited time.  The vast majority of such contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired.  In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline further over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price.  However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions toward the cost of the collection of waste from certain households.  Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area.  Such expenditure means that these local authorities divert funding from other areas to support these waiver provisions.<\/p>  <p>  With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste and the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between service provider and customer and the services offered vary across the country.  In that regard, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a national waiver scheme could not be imposed in the context of an open market for waste collection.<\/p>  <p>  However, under pay-by- weight charging for household waste collection, there is an opportunity for everybody to have more control over their waste charges and to minimise their waste costs by preventing waste and segregating waste through using the food waste and recyclable waste bins properly.  In this regard, a pay-by- weight awareness campaign, launched on 18 May, will be rolled out at national, regional and local levels in the coming weeks and will give invaluable advice to householders on minimising their waste management costs under the new charging regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600047#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Reform","counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600047#WRJ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":295,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[12404\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600047#WRJ02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to introduce legislation to restore the former Drogheda borough council and the Dundalk and Ardee urban district councils in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":296,"content":"<p>The Programme for a Partnership Government includes the preparation of a report for Government and the Oireachtas by mid-2017 on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy, including the issue of town or borough council status.

The Housing Agency reported to my Department on 22 April 2016 with a comprehensive analysis of the operation of the Direction.

Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness, disability and caring schemes, can take longer to process. <\/p>  <p>  The details attached to your question raise the question of reviews of ongoing carer&rsquo;s allowance payments when a child who is receiving domiciliary care allowance reaches the age of 16.  All social welfare claims are routinely reviewed to ensure continued entitlement.  These reviews are essential to ensure value for money and that payments are targeted only to those who are entitled to them.  CA payments may be reviewed at any time to confirm that the means test is still satisfied and that full-time care and attention is still required and is being provided.  It is important to note that payment of CA continues while a review is underway which ensures that any delays in the department do not unduly inconvenience the customer. <\/p>  <p>  Reviews of CA are not directly linked to when a care recipient reaches the age of 16 but, in certain cases, the Department considers this to be an opportune time as some child care recipients becomes more independent as they grow older.  If it is found that a person no longer satisfies the conditions for continued entitlement to CA, they are notified of the decision in writing along with the reasons for it and they are offered the right of review and appeal. <\/p>  <p>  Applicants for carer&rsquo;s allowance, which is a means-tested scheme, are experiencing some delays currently.  This primarily is due to an ongoing increase in new claim intake over the past few years to this scheme and the complexity attached to processing of these applications.  In addition, there is sometimes a reluctance on the part of applicants to give full information at application stage thereby slowing down the processing of their application and in some cases necessitating a visit by an Departmental investigative officer. <\/p>  <p>  Reducing these waiting times is a priority for my Department.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented by my Department in recent years.

As can be seen from the data in the table provided below, schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.

Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  Delays can also arise if information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions and where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  Work on clearing backlogs in some scheme areas, such as carers allowance and invalidity pension has temporarily distorted the time taken to clear claims due to the high level of reviews and appeals following backlog clearances, but the progress made will be reflected in processing times in the coming months.

A UNP is a once-off payment made to persons who would not normally qualify for SWA but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or an alternative is not available at that time. <\/p><p><b>Number of Exceptional Needs Payments and Urgent Needs Payments in each month for the past two years to date:<\/b><table><tr><th>Month<\/th><th>Number of Payments<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>May 2014<\/td><td>8,995<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>June 2014<\/td><td>7,907<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>July 2014<\/td><td>8,819<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August 2014<\/td><td>7,965<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September 2014<\/td><td>8,882<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>October 2014<\/td><td>9,664<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>November 2014<\/td><td>9,578<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>December 2014<\/td><td>10,506<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>January 2015<\/td><td>8,258<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>February 2015<\/td><td>8,463<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>March 2015<\/td><td>8,662<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>April 2015<\/td><td>7,928<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>May 2015<\/td><td>8,098<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>June 2015<\/td><td>8,203<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>July 2015<\/td><td>7,921<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August 2015<\/td><td>6,421<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September 2015<\/td><td>7,616<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>October 2015<\/td><td>7,634<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>November 2015<\/td><td>8,167<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>December 2015<\/td><td>8,841<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>January 2016<\/td><td>7,178<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>February 2016<\/td><td>7,453<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>March 2016<\/td><td>7,918<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>April 2016<\/td><td>7,484<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600050#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exceptional Needs Payments","counter":375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600050#WRM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[12464\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600050#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if, and when, he will arrange a special needs payment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>The person concerned applied for assistance towards payment for a central heating installation on 27\/04\/2016.

However, Ireland has a unique perspective and interest in the outcome of the referendum which extends to our business sector and our mutually beneficial trading relationship.<\/p>  <p>  We trade around &euro;1.2 billion of goods and services every week between our two countries and the business sector has made its voice heard in terms of their desire to maintain and grow further the healthy business relationship between Britain and Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The general consensus is that a British exit from the EU would be bad for business between Ireland and the UK.  At the very least there would be a protracted period of uncertainty which could impact on the very positive trading relationship we enjoy with our nearest neighbours.  The value of sterling, an important factor for those doing business across the border or across the Irish Sea, is expected to fall considerably following a leave outcome, having a serious knock-on effect on Irish exporters - in particular in the short term.<\/p>  <p>  A number of reports on the economic impact on Ireland, should the UK vote to leave the EU, have been commissioned by the business sector here in Ireland.  All of these point to a downturn in economic activity for Ireland, an increase in the administrative burden and a reduction in the number of jobs sustained by the trading relationship.<\/p>  <p>  It is projected that a &ldquo;Leave&rdquo; scenario would result in a negative impact of between 1% and 5% in the UK&rsquo;s GDP and research by the ESRI indicates that for every 1% drop in UK GDP, there would be a corresponding drop of 0.3% in Irish GDP. A very recent study by the UK Treasury forecast that the economic &ldquo;shock&rdquo; caused by a UK exit would involve a loss, in the short-term, of over 500,000 jobs in the UK.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the active engagement and outreach being undertaken on the part of business groups such as IBEC, the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce and the Irish Exporters&rsquo; Association, both with linked organisations in the UK, and in Northern Ireland.  Many of the Irish business organisations based in the UK such as the Irish International Business Network (IIBN) are also actively engaging with their membership, encouraging them to register to vote and making them aware of the implications for Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In the past year, I have engaged directly with most business organisations on the UK referendum, including at the Government&rsquo;s Export Trade Council which I chair as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I, the Taoiseach and other members of the Government have also spoken at events organised by Irish business organisations and also by their UK counterparts.<\/p>  <p>  I am coordinating a series of Ministerial visits to the United Kingdom between now and the referendum on 23 June.  During these visits Ministers will have an opportunity to engage directly with Irish communities in Britain and my Department will work closely with the various business organisations and networks, and Irish community organisations, when developing the programmes for these visits.<\/p>  <p>  There are approximately half a million Irish born people living in the UK and many millions more of Irish descent.  In addition there are some 120,000 British citizens living in Ireland who are entitled to vote in this referendum.  The European Movement Ireland is currently running a campaign to encourage all those entitled to vote to ensure that they are registered.  This campaign &ndash; &ldquo;Phoneafriend&rdquo; - encourages those living in Ireland to contact their friends and relatives in the UK to remind them to exercise their franchise.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a group of Irish people living in the UK have formed an independent group, &ldquo;Irish4Europe&rdquo; to encourage the Irish community living in the UK to register to vote, and to vote to remain in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  While respecting that this is a decision for the people of the United Kingdom, every effort will be made in the intervening weeks to ensure that the unique Irish perspective is articulated and understood across a range of sectors including the business community here and their counterparts in the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600051#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":383,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600051#WRN00450"},{"type":"question","counter":384,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[12320\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600051#WRN00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"to press for the persecution of Christians and other minorities in the Middle East to be formally declared as genocide; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":385,"content":"<p>I have repeatedly condemned the horrific crimes by ISIS against religious and ethnic minorities in Syria and Iraq.

First, to see this citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland as soon as possible, and, second, to provide every possible consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.<\/p>  <p>  The Egyptian Government is fully aware of the priority the Irish Government attaches to the welfare and interests of our citizen. There has been sustained engagement at all levels with the Egyptian authorities.  I have been in regular contact with my Egyptian counterpart, Minister Shoukry, and the Taoiseach has twice met with President el-Sisi, making clear the Irish Government&rsquo;s concerns and objectives in this case.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this dialogue with the Egyptian authorities, the Government has also been engaging on an ongoing basis with European and international partners and with the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Government representatives have worked with this citizen&rsquo;s legal team in Egypt and supported petitions to the court when asked to do so, including providing formal Government support for an application under Decree 140 and an application for release on bail.  Representatives of the Embassy have attended each of the court hearings to date and will be present at the next scheduled hearing on 29 June.

The Department has arranged numerous consular visits to this individual in prison since his arrest, the most recent undertaken by Ambassador Damien Cole on 17 April.

The complexity and cross-cutting nature of global challenges demand a coordinated approach, in particular at the international level.  Ireland&rsquo;s support for a fairer, more just, more secure and more sustainable world through our development programme, human rights policies, peacekeeping, disarmament and security policies, finds expression in our active engagement in the development of the European Union&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy and our participation in the work of the United Nations.  Regional organisations are also playing an ever more important role.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said many times, these crises will continue if the root causes of conflict - political instability, inequality, and poverty in countries of origin - remain unresolved. Ireland will continue to play its role in responding to crisis and emergency situations, while not ignoring the underlying factors. Investment in conflict prevention and an increased focus on post-conflict reconciliation and other forms of peacebuilding demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s more nuanced approach to achieving sustainable peace.<\/p>  <p>  Promoting stability and supporting efforts towards peace and security in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East continue to require and receive major international attention. UN-authorised peacekeeping missions have a major role in stabilising former and current conflict zones throughout both regions and in protecting vulnerable populations.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a long-standing tradition of contributing to UN and EU peace-support missions. Ireland currently participates in seven UN peacekeeping missions. The majority of the 365 Irish UN peacekeepers currently deployed overseas are serving at the three UN missions in the Middle East while smaller numbers are deployed to missions in Africa and Eastern Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The EU also takes a leading role in peacekeeping operations, conflict prevention and in the strengthening of international security in support of the United Nations, through the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Crisis management missions are established under the CSDP in order to prevent the initiation or renewal of conflict and to help societies or fragile states to recover from violent conflict. At present, the EU operates 17 CSDP missions across Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the Common Security and Defence Policy since its inception. We currently deploy both military and civilian personnel to a total of 8 CSDP mission across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. My Department currently seconds 11 Experts to 6 civilian CSDP missions.<\/p>  <p>  The UN is very active in the area of child soldiers, particularly through the work of the UN Secretary-General&rsquo;s Special Adviser on Children and Armed Conflict, Leila Zerrougui. Since the launch in March 2014 of the &lsquo;Children, Not Soldiers&rsquo; campaign, significant steps have been taken toward the goal of ending and preventing recruitment of child soldiers.<\/p>  <p>  The United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325, on Women, Peace and Security, and six subsequent bolstering resolutions, have brought increased focus to issues such as sexual violence in conflict, and women&rsquo;s participation in decision making. Ireland&rsquo;s second National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security reflects the importance of these issues and has ensured that gender perspectives have been incorporated in Ireland&rsquo;s work in humanitarian and development aid, peace-keeping, post-conflict activities and interventions.<\/p>  <p>  Almost 60 million people are now displaced globally, half of them children, and the great majority of them living in situations of conflict.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these emergencies, this year the El Ni&ntilde;o effect has also had a significant impact in many countries, most notably in Africa, leading to threats to food security and a spike in humanitarian need. UN Agencies and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund are key in providing humanitarian assistance. The EU also has mechanisms to respond to the crises through the European Development Fund and the EU humanitarian budget.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to working with a range of partners including non-governmental and UN organisations, and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The development of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Initiative, established to support the broader Humanitarian Reform Process in 2006, is an operational tool to supplement these efforts. The Rapid Response Initiative consists of two key elements- the Rapid Response Corps, a roster of highly experienced and specialised personnel for deployment at short notice to emergency situations; and stockpiling, the pre-positioning and transportation of essential humanitarian stocks through the UN Humanitarian Response Depots (UNHRD) network.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland pursues a strategic and comprehensive approach to countries in Africa facing challenging humanitarian, conflict, or human rights situations.  Informed by the Africa Strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and One World, One Future, our policy for international development, this approach encompasses political and diplomatic engagement, humanitarian assistance, support for peacekeeping operations, and development cooperation programming.  Engagement at the international level, in particular through the UN, regional bodies and within the EU, is at the heart of this approach.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to supporting the recovery efforts and successful transition of countries emerging from conflict or significant and protracted humanitarian crises.  The announcement in 2013 that Sierra Leone would become one of Irish Aid&rsquo;s key partner countries is a testament to this commitment.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s total humanitarian assistance to global crises reached some &euro;140 million in 2015, and four of the five countries receiving the largest share of this aid were in Africa. When the first ever World Humanitarian Summit took place in Istanbul earlier this week, President Higgins, who led the Irish delegation, with my colleague, Minister of State McHugh, spoke passionately on Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to humanitarian action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600051#WRN01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600051#WRN01150"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[12367\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600051#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the international community brings pressure upon the authorities in Nigeria to curtail the activities of Boko Haram; the number of women and children deemed to be held captive by Boko Haram; the extent of negotiations between the United Nations and European Union authorities and if progress will be achieved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":395,"content":"<p>The Government has consistently condemned the acts of violence being perpetrated by Boko Haram, which have resulted in thousands of deaths and the displacement of an estimated 2.2 million people. The brutal activities of Boko Haram continue to represent a serious threat to the peace and security of Nigeria, and to the wider region, including Cameroon, Chad and Niger. They also involve the clear and persistent abuse of human rights, especially of women and girls, and a direct threat to education and education facilities.<\/p>  <p>  While it is difficult to identify the exact numbers of people being held captive by the group, in recent months the Government of Nigeria has made substantial progress against Boko Haram, progress that has been verified by a number of independent sources. Since his election in May 2015, President Buhari has made the fight against Boko Haram one of his policy priorities. Today the security situation has improved in many parts of the North East allowing much needed humanitarian assistance to reach isolated communities for the first time. There are daily reports of the rescue of woman and children from Boko Haram and while numbers cannot be confirmed, there are indications that the Nigerian security forces are making progress forcing the group deep into the Sambisa Forest. However, this is not to underestimate the persistent grave humanitarian situation, and in particular the continuing abuses being perpetrated against women and girls.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland, with our EU partners, has continued to support the Nigerian Government in its efforts, and reiterated the need for a regional approach to tackling the issue. The EU High Representative, Ms Federica Mogherini, attended the Security Summit in Abuja on May 14th.  During her visit, she met with regional leaders and with the leaders of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign and representatives of the international human rights groups, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. She announced, with the African Union Commission, &euro;50 million to further the operationalisation of the Multinational Joint Taskforce to which Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad are contributing a total of 8,700 troops.  The EU has also funded technical assistance to the Office of the National Security Advisor of Nigeria to support the implementation of counter-terrorism legislation and capacity to tackle radicalisation.  In June 2015 the EU provided &euro;21 million in humanitarian funding to the four main countries affected by this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The issue has also been discussed at the UN on many occasions. In January 2016, UN Special Rapporteurs on health, the sale of children and contemporary forms of slavery visited Nigeria to assess the reintegration of women and children affected by the conflict. In February, UN Experts called on the Nigerian Government to make liberated areas truly safe for returnees. Most recently, the UN Security Council, meeting on May 13th, condemned again the activities of Boko Haram, and urged the MNJTF to further enhance regional military cooperation and coordination, particularly to consolidate military gains, deny safe haven to Boko Haram, allow humanitarian access and facilitate the restoration of the rule of law in liberated areas.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has provided humanitarian relief for those affected by Boko Haram attacks. In March 2015, we arranged for the airlift of 87 tonnes of humanitarian relief supplies for distribution by the NGO Plan to an estimated 13,000 Nigerian refugees in Cameroon. In October last year, we provided &euro;500,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross\/Red Crescent for its humanitarian operations in Nigeria.

I have repeatedly made clear, including to UN Secretary-General Ban and UN Special Envoy de Mistura, that Ireland strongly supports the efforts of the UN to reach a negotiated agreement.  I call for all parties to return to the UN-sponsored talks and work sincerely for a comprehensive agreement to end the conflict. <\/p>  <p>  I share the views expressed by UN Under-Secretary General Stephen O&rsquo;Brien in his statement of 4 May 2016, specifically concerning Syria, in which he stated that all parties must finally and unequivocally live up to their obligations under international humanitarian law and the demands of the Council&rsquo;s resolutions. <\/p>  <p>  It is my position that the United Nations, and in particular the UN Security Council, has the authority to act to protect civilians from violence.  I have welcomed efforts by the UN and UN Security Council resolutions, including resolution 2254 of December 2015, to promote a political solution to the Syrian conflict, ensure humanitarian access for those in need and end the violence.  The UN has also set out a basis for international action to counter the threat to the populations of Syria and Iraq from Daesh and Al-Qaeda terrorism under Security Council resolution 2249.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s call for an end to impunity for those committing war crimes and our support for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court by the UN Security Council.  The International Criminal Court is the only means to ensure accountability for such crimes against civilians. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of addressing the wider refugee crisis globally in a more positive way, the UN General Assembly will host a high level summit meeting to address large movements of refugees and migrants on 19 September 2016, with the aim of bringing countries together behind a more humane and coordinated approach.  It is widely acknowledged that large forced displacements of populations is now a global crisis that requires a collective effort by the international community.  In February the president of the UN General Assembly appointed Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to the UN David Donoghue and his Jordanian counterpart to serve as co-facilitators of the 19 September meeting.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will engage constructively in the forthcoming inter-governmental negotiations to agree an outcome for the Summit, which we are confident will be a strong statement of the collective will of the international community to address the ongoing crisis in a humane and effective manner.<\/p>  <p>  On 18th March the European Union reached a political agreement designed to end the irregular migration from Turkey to the EU in the form of an EU-Turkey statement agreed by the Heads of State or Government.  Turkey agreed to readmit from Greece all irregular migrants and to protect them in accordance with international standards; to tackle people smugglers and to help prevent new migratory routes to the EU opening up.   For its part, the EU agreed to resettle Syrians currently in Turkey on a &ldquo;one-for-one&rdquo; basis where other Syrians are returned from Greece.  The core intention of the agreement is to break the business model of the people smugglers who are profiting from the suffering of the vulnerable, and to stop migrants attempting the treacherous journey across the Aegean Sea.  The need to comply with international humanitarian law on the protection of refugee rights was a key aspect of the agreement with Turkey.  The legal advice received by the EU institutions is that there is such compliance.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, any irregular migrant coming from Turkey who applies for asylum in Greece will have their application processed on a case by case basis in line with international and EU law.  Under the Statement there will be no blanket and no automatic returns of asylum seekers.  New national legislation has recently been adopted in Greece and in Turkey to support the implementation of the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the EU-Turkey agreement, the EU has established the Turkey Refugee Facility (TRF), which will be used exclusively to provide support to Syrian refugees in Turkey.  It will focus on six main priorities for support: humanitarian assistance, migration management, education, health, municipal infrastructure, and socio-economic support (e.g. supports to enter the labour market). Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Turkey Refugee Facility from 2016-2018 has been set at &euro;22 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600052#WRO00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Enlargement","counter":415,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600052#WRO00900"},{"type":"question","counter":416,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[12375\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600052#WRO01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if Turkey&rsquo;s application for membership of the European Union is being progressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":417,"content":"<p>Ireland has long been a supporter of the enlargement policy of the EU, which is widely regarded as one of the most successful policies of the EU in promoting stability, peace and prosperity.

It does this primarily through the UN Security Council which has, under the UN Charter, &lsquo;primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security&rsquo;.  The Council&rsquo;s ability and political will to fulfil this responsibility is dependent on the degree of common approach to conflict situations displayed by its fifteen members.  The Security Council has a variety of tools at its disposal to address threats to international peace and to contribute towards the settlement of disputes and conflicts.  It has the power to authorise military action, deploy peacekeeping and political missions, and to impose sanctions against non-compliant States. <\/p>  <p>  The most tangible expression of UN&rsquo;s role in addressing conflict is the deployment of peacekeeping operations.  Peacekeeping operations receive their mandate directly from the UN Security Council and there are currently sixteen peacekeeping missions deployed worldwide.  The UN also invests significant resources in conflict prevention and mediation.  The UN Department of Political Affairs&rsquo; Mediation Support Unit (MSU) is an instrument which works across the spectrum of conflict-affected countries, with local and national governments, as well as with other organisations to plan and support mediation efforts in the field.  The Unit works to identify key mediation challenges in a particular country setting and to ensure that the right expertise is provided at the right time. <\/p>  <p>  In recent years however it is true to say that the United National Security Council has been divided over responses to various conflicts, ranging from Syria and Israel\/Palestine in the Middle East, to Burundi and South Sudan in Africa.  Even when the Council has agreed to authorise intervention, for example in Libya in 2011, the results have not always been positive.  While the UN undoubtedly has a central role to play in addressing conflict, ongoing crises in the Middle East and Africa serve to underscore the need for the UN to be much more effective.  UN structures and systems are in need of reform and Ireland has been a strong supporter of efforts to improve them.        <\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the UN Secretary General initiated three major review exercises which were aimed at improving the overall effectiveness of the UN&rsquo;s response to conflict.  The findings from the high level policy reviews on (1) UN Peace Operations, (2) Peacebuilding Architecture and (3) Women, Peace and Security were published and are in the process of being implemented.  Each of the reviews offered recommendations on how the UN can improve and reform its functions and structures particularly in relation to the global challenge presented by conflict and war.  Ireland engaged fully with all three reviews, calling for the recommendations to be discussed and implemented as part of our broader calls for UN reform.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also called for UN Security Council reform and has consistently stated that the Council needs to become more representative, more transparent and more efficient.  In New York, Ireland has called for an expansion of Security Council membership and for the veto of the five permanent members of the Council to only be used in very extreme situations.  Ireland is a member of ACT, the &lsquo;Accountability, Coherence and Transparency&rsquo; group in the UN, that calls for a more accountable and transparent UN system.  We are a strong supporter of the ACT Code of Conduct which calls on all member states, including the permanent members, to support timely and decisive action by the Security Council aimed at preventing or ending genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to advocate for reform of the UN to ensure that it is equipped to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century and fulfil its critical role in the maintenance of international peace and security.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600052#WRO01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600052#WRO01500"},{"type":"question","counter":422,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[12378\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600052#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if demands for humanitarian aid continue to rise at various locations globally; if the international community is adequately addressing the cause in all cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":423,"content":"<p><font color=\"#004080\"> <\/font>The international community is currently challenged by an unprecedented scale of humanitarian need globally.

Over 60 million people have been forcibly displaced from their homes, the highest number since the Second World War.  This year the El Ni&ntilde;o weather effect has also had a significant impact in many countries, most notably in Africa, leading to a spike in humanitarian need.<\/p><p>In announcing its 2016 global appeal in December 2015, the United Nations requested $20.1 billion in humanitarian funding to meet the needs of over 87 million people, a significant increase on its request for $16.1 billion in 2015.  With no sign of an end to many of the largest humanitarian crises &ndash; in Syria, in South Sudan, in Yemen &ndash; the gap between needs and funding is a matter for serious concern.  Ireland continues to work with our partners to respond actively and effectively to global crises, providing some &euro;140 million in humanitarian assistance last year.  Ireland&rsquo;s largest humanitarian response is to the Syria crisis, and by the end of 2016, Ireland's funding will total &euro;62 million.

These brutal activities continue to represent a serious threat to the peace and security of the region, and involve the clear and persistent abuse of human rights, especially of women and girls.<\/p>  <p>  Together with our EU partners Ireland has continued to reiterate the need for a regional approach to this challenge.  At the Security Summit in Abuja on 14 May, High Representative Mogherini announced, with the African Union Commission, &euro;50 million to further the operationalisation of the Multinational Joint Taskforce (MNJTF), to which Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad are contributing a total of 8,700 troops.  The EU has also responded to the humanitarian consequences of Boko Haram activities, providing &euro;21 million in humanitarian funding in June 2015 to the four main countries concerned.  The EU Trust Fund will also support projects in the region while Ireland last year provided &euro;500,000 in humanitarian support for Nigeria through the International Committee of the Red Cross.<\/p>  <p>  Boko Haram has also been discussed regularly at the UN with the Security Council issuing a further condemnation earlier this month.  The Council commended territorial advances made by the MNJTF and called on it to enhance regional military cooperation and coordination.<\/p>  <p>  In the last number of months the Government of Nigeria has made substantial progress in combatting Boko Haram, progress that has been verified by a number of independent sources.  The security situation has improved in many parts of the North East allowing much needed humanitarian assistance to reach isolated communities for the first time. <\/p>  <p>  The Government fully supports the removal of the threat to international peace and security posed by Daesh, consistent with international law.  Ireland supports a coordinated regional response and political solution to the crisis in Syria.  Our approach is fully in line with relevant UN Resolutions.<\/p>  <p>  UNSCR 2249 grants authority for States to take all necessary measure to suppress and eradicate terrorist acts by Daesh in territory under its control within Syria and Iraq and to eradicate the safe haven they have established inside Syria and Iraq.  Any action undertaken under this resolution must be in compliance with international law, in particular the UN Charter, as well as international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law.<\/p>  <p>  At the UN Human Rights Council in September 2015, Ireland made a number of statements in which we condemned Daesh's barbarous treatment of civilians, its campaign of violence against religious and ethnic minorities in Syria and Iraq, and its treatment of women and girls.<\/p>  <p>  Daesh has also regularly featured in discussions at EU level, most recently at the Foreign Affairs Council on 23 May at which detailed conclusions on the Regional Strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the Daesh threat were adopted.<\/p>  <p>  The conflict in Syria has had immense humanitarian consequences and Ireland is playing its part in alleviating the suffering of those affected.  This year Ireland will provide a total of &euro;20 million in humanitarian support for the Syrian people, bringing the total Irish contribution for the Syrian crisis since 2012 to &euro;62 million.<\/p>  <p>  Al-Shabaab continues to pose a serious threat in Somalia, with frequent attacks against peacekeepers, security forces and civilians, with the latter often specifically targeting Christians.  It is also responsible for perpetrating sexual attacks on women and girls, particularly those that are internally displaced.<\/p>  <p>  The EU provides funding to the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia, AMISOM; and supports the Somali National Army through the EU Military Training Mission.  The EU is also supporting programmes that aim to address the root causes of violent extremism through the EU Trust Fund for Africa.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the UN Security Council visited Somalia in May 2016.  The UN Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) supports peace and reconciliation and the state formation process in Somalia.  A number of UN agencies also respond to the humanitarian challenges created by the actions of Al Shabaab and other militant groups in the region, and Irish humanitarian funding to Somalia last year totalled over &euro;5.5 million. <\/p>  <p>  More generally on human rights, Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief.  We attach great importance to combatting all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  Ireland and the EU consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council. <\/p>  <p>  In my address to the UN General Assembly last October I highlighted the alarming rise in attacks on Christians.  More recently, Ireland delivered statements addressing the importance of freedom of religion or belief during the thirty-first session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2016.  We will continue to raise the issue of the persecution of Christians at the United Nations and as part of EU efforts to support and promote freedom of religion or belief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600052#WRO02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Partnership for Peace","counter":431,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600052#WRO02500"},{"type":"question","counter":432,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[12413\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600052#WRO02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if Ireland has a permanent office in Brussels to handle engagements with NATO's partnership for peace programme; and the cost of running this office in 2015.","asker":"1309","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":433,"content":"<p>Ireland has been a member of the Partnership for Peace since 1999.

Where flood defences are constructed to provide protection to areas which have previously been subject to flooding, the insurance industry has made clear its position that the defences should be designed and constructed to protect against a flood event with an Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) of 1% (commonly referred to as a 100-year flood event).  OPW flood defence schemes are generally designed and constructed to protect against a 1% AEP flood event for fluvial flood events and 0.5% AEP flood event for tidal floods.

Information on excess costs of HCAIs such as prolonged hospital stay, further treatments required, attributable mortality and other complications can be difficult to retrieve as they require complex evaluation, particularly to confirm that they are directly linked to HCAI episodes and not to other factors. National HCAI surveillance systems at European level are, however, in place and EU Member States collect routinely-generated antimicrobial susceptibility testing data in invasive infections and report to the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) through its European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net).  <\/p><p>The ECDC assesses this data along with estimated costs of increased hospital stays and treatments. European estimates indicate that approximately 4,100,000 patients are estimated to acquire a HCAI in the EU each year with 37,000 attributable deaths annually and HCAIs also contributing to an additional 110,000 deaths. The burden of HCAI is also reflected in significant financial losses. According to the ECDC these infections account for approximately &euro;7 billion per year. The ECDC 2011-2012 Point Prevalence Survey of HCAIs and AMR use in European hospitals estimates that Ireland had 494 patients with a HCAI. This equated to a mean of 9,554 beds occupied per day. (A Point Prevalence Survey gives a snapshot picture of the number of patients with a HCAI in hospital at a particular point in time).<\/p><p>The National Clinical Guideline 'Prevention and Control Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus<\/i>(MRSA)', endorsed by the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) in 2013 estimated the cost of HCAI in Ireland for 2011, extrapolated from national (HSE) and international sources, at &euro;118, 257,312 with 29,388 patients acquiring a HCAI.  <\/p><p>Management and reduction of Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) is made very challenging by the rise in antimicrobial resistance world wide. The World Health Organisation (WHO) states that the rise in antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest potential threats to human and animal health at global, European and national levels with possible serious consequences for public health, animal welfare and the agriculture and food sectors. <\/p><p>A wide range of initiatives has been put in place in the Irish health system over several years to address HCAI and AMR including improved surveillance of infections and prescribing, infection prevention and control processes, antimicrobial stewardship initiatives, public and professional awareness raising and with a significant emphasis on the education and training of healthcare professionals. Ireland also fully supports the WHO Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance and through the Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee, established by the Chief Medical Officer of this Department and the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Department of Agriculture, and endorsed by both Ministers for Health and Agriculture, Food and the Marine respectively, is addressing the WHO's requirement for all countries to have in place an Intersectoral Mechanism to develop a national action plan against AMR to address both the human and animal sectors, agriculture and the wider environment. <\/p><p>Ireland also supports and has actively engaged on the European Commission's Draft Council Conclusions on AMR which will be presented for adoption to the Ministerial meeting of EPSCO (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs) on 17th June 2016; this document will call on Member States and the European Commission to develop a new and comprehensive EU Action Plan on AMR. Ireland is fully committed to and engaged in addressing resolution of the problem of AMR and will continue to collaborate at international, EU and national levels to this end. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600056#WRS00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Expenditure","counter":535,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600056#WRS00550"},{"type":"question","counter":536,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[12325\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600056#WRS00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the average sums the Health Service Executive paid for a typical course of fidaxomicin, vancomycin and other drugs used for persons infected with Clostridium difficile and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, in hospitals under its control, by patient, in each of the years 2011 to 2016 to date, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[12326\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600056#WRS00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the sums the Health Service Executive paid for fidaxomicin, vancomycin and other drugs in treating patients for infection with Clostridium difficile and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, in hospitals under its control in each of the years 2011 to 2016 to date, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":538,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.<\/p><p>As these are service matters, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

I&rsquo;m committed to working with all players in the sector here to address these issues and ensure that we have a sustainable dairy sector going forward.  Regarding the specific issue raised by the Deputy, the facility to phase the final superlevy payment over three years has already been previously introduced by the EU Commission last year at Ireland&rsquo;s request. Farmers availing of the facility must pay at least one third of the bill in each of the first two years (2015 and 2016) with the balance to be paid in 2017. The Department implemented the scheme nationally and 3,741 farmers (out of a total of 6,109 farmers who incurred the levy) deferred repayments of &euro;35.6 million in superlevy liability, (out of a total national levy liability of &euro;71.2 million).<\/p>  <p>  The mechanism required the Exchequer to pay the superlevy liability to the EU in full in 2015, and to recover the levy from farmers over the three years from 2015 to 2017. A wide process of consultation in the design of the scheme was undertaken with farm organisations and co-ops and it was agreed that once the initial farmer instalment was paid in 2015, the optimum repayment model for the balancing payments would involve ten equal instalments from the months of May-September in 2016 and 2017. These payments will be interest-free.<\/p>  <p>  These amounts will be deducted by co-ops from a farmer&rsquo;s monthly milk cheques to coincide with the peak milk supply months of April to August. The co-ops will then forward the money each month to the Department. This approach was also agreed as part of the sanction given by the Minister for Public Expenditure Reform.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the discussions in the run-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016.

Progress was made on the two texts on regulatory cooperation and good regulatory practices.  Substantial progress was achieved on the SME chapter and on the provisions of Customs and Trade Facilitation which would simplify customs procedures and reduces fees and charges to the benefit of SMEs in particular.  There was also progress in consolidating textual proposals on Sustainable Development, which includes labour and the environment, and on Investment.  Extensive discussions also took place on public procurement.  The parties also discussed regulatory cooperation in the nine industry sectors under consideration and the EU presented its first proposal for the pharmaceuticals sector.  The parties also discussed mutual recognition agreements for professional services and significant progress was made on the consolidation of the text.<\/p><p>Both the EU and US are aiming to make substantial progress in 2016.  A number of intersessional meetings between the parties will take place before the next full negotiation round, which will be scheduled before the summer break, most likely in July.  <\/p><p>The proposed EU-US agreement is one of a number of new style trade agreements the EU is negotiating that not only covers tariffs, services and investment but also includes regulatory coherence and cooperation.  An EU-US agreement would be the world&rsquo;s largest bilateral trade and investment deal, and a successful conclusion is expected to benefit Ireland more than any other EU Member State.  As Ireland continues to rely on external demand and international markets for sustainable growth and market access, regulatory cooperation and reduced tariffs are essential to grow our exports.  <\/p><p>Owing to our position as a small open economy, Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.  An independent study commissioned by this Department, carried out by Copenhagen Economics, estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole.  It suggests a boost to GDP of 1.1%, growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5%, and an increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs.  The findings are backed up in an interim independent report contracted by the EU Commission, carried out by Ecorys Consultancy <\/p><p>() and published on 13th May 2016, which estimates that an EU-US free trade agreement would boost Irish GDP by 1.4 per cent.<\/p><p>The opportunities of an agreement will be especially valuable for SMEs, given that trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms, which have fewer resources to overcome them than larger firms.  In fact, the Copenhagen Economics study reported that an EU-US free trade agreement would have a more significant positive impact on SMEs than on other types of business.  The final agreement will have an entire chapter exclusively dedicated to SMEs aimed at addressing those specific constraints that might otherwise limit SMEs taking full advantage of the improved EU-US trade agreement market access.<\/p><p>In relation to agriculture, Ireland, like other Member States, has some sensitivity in the agriculture sector.  But we also have offensive interests for example in access to the US dairy market.  As part of the Copenhagen Economics Study preparation, meetings were held with a range of stakeholders from the agri-sector.  This study finds that EU-US trade agreement will see a likely increase to Irish agriculture exports by 2% to 3% or &euro;230-&euro;270 million relative to 2013.  The study also underlined the sensitivity in the beef sector.  <\/p><p>Ireland strongly supports these negotiations and is working to ensure that our interests, both offensive and defensive, are fully reflected in the texts of the negotiations.  I look forward to continuing to work to ensure we achieve a comprehensive and balanced trade agreement that delivers real economic potential for our country and the EU without lessening of our high standards particularly regarding health, consumer rights and the environment.I look forward to continuing to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests are both promoted and defended to the fullest extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600062#WRY00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Enterprise Offices","counter":713,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600062#WRY00550"},{"type":"question","counter":714,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[12350\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600062#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if a person (details supplied) can avail of start-up financial assistance directly or through a local enterprise office to facilitate a small enterprise in the services sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":715,"content":"<p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own business.<\/p><p>In the first instance, the LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant state supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, Credit Review Office, Microfinance Ireland.

As the matter is sub judice, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600062#WRY02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":738,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600063#WRZ00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Costs","counter":737,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600063#WRZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":738,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[12485\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600063#WRZ00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she is concerned at the recent decision of the Workplace Relations Commission on au pairs confirming that these are normal contracts of employment; if this will have a detrimental effect on the provision of child care; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":739,"content":"<p>Issues relating to the Workplace Relations Commission and au pair contracts are a matter for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) is not aware of whether the Workplace Relations Commission decision will reduce the numbers of families who rely on au pairs for their child-minding requirements. In relation to the provision of childcare, the report of the Interdepartmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare found that au pairs or nannies comprise a small percentage of childcare arrangements. The 'Growing Up in Ireland' longitudinal study indicated in December 2011 that one percent of nine-month-olds, and one percent of three-year-olds are cared for by au pairs\/Nannies.<\/p>  <p>  Parents are encouraged to make contact with their local City or County Childcare Committee (CCC) if they require advice or support with childcare choices. CCCs are available in 31 locations across Ireland. Childminding Ireland may also be able to assist in finding a registered childminder.<\/p>  <p>  The DCYA administers a number of programmes to assist parents in accessing affordable childcare. These programmes are predominantly available through formal childcare settings only (creches or pre-schools) but in some instances are available through Tusla notified childminders who meet contract requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The largest scheme operated by my Department is the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which from September 2016,  will make free pre-school available, 15 hours per week, to all children from the time they turn three, until they go to school, entering at three points in the year, September, January and April. On average, from September 2016, children will benefit from 61 weeks, up from 38 weeks. It is estimated that access to the average 61 weeks of ECCE can reduce the cost of childcare by &euro;4000 per child. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also operates the Community Childcare Supplement (CCS), the After-School Childcare (ASCC), Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS), and Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programmes which subsidise childcare for eligible parents. In 2017 my Department plans to replace these with a single and simplified programme that will be available through community (not for profit) and private childcare providers. This programme, when developed, will provide a framework thorough which any further investment in the subsidisation of childcare can be delivered. Some subsidised childcare places through the Community Childcare Supplement (CCS) programme remain available and low income parents are encouraged to make enquiries regarding their possible eligibility for CCS with their local City and County Childcare Committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600063#WRZ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":741,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600063#WRZ00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Operations","counter":740,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600063#WRZ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[12327\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016052600063#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the role the Defence Forces have played in security arrangements at Shannon Airport in County Clare; the cost of such arrangements in each of the years 2003 to 2016 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":742,"content":"<p>The Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have primary responsibility for the internal security of the State.
