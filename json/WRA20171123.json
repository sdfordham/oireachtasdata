This plan focuses on our responses to the range of challenges and opportunities arising as a result of Brexit, including those of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs).<\/p><p>The LEOs are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business in Ireland.  They aim to promote entrepreneurship, foster business start-ups and develop existing micro and small businesses, especially those with export potential.  Financial supports are provided to new start-ups and businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities.<\/p><p>As stated in the plan, I secured an additional &euro;4m in capital funding for the LEOs this year which has, and will continue to fund, a range of measures put in place to supplement LEO supports.<\/p><p>An additional &euro;4m in capital funding has also been allocated to the LEOs in 2018, and this will ensure that a suite of LEO Brexit supports are available to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide.  These supports, which are aimed at strengthening the capacity of micro and small businesses to better cope with the changing external environment, especially Brexit, include: <\/p><p>- Access to the &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo; online tool where micro and smaller businesses can self-diagnose their readiness for Brexit; <\/p><p>- A &lsquo;Technical Assistance for Micro-enterprises&rsquo; grant designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling companies to explore and develop new market opportunities; <\/p><p>- A &lsquo;Lean for Micro&rsquo; programme available nationwide to help small businesses become more efficient and competitive; <\/p><p>- A &lsquo;LEO Innovation and Investment Fund&rsquo; pilot programme to support innovation in micro-enterprises and to help them become investor ready so that they can scale their businesses; <\/p><p>- Tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges;<\/p><p>- Targeted training on specific Brexit challenges, including financial aspects and capability building in innovation, competitiveness and opportunity diagnosis; and <\/p><p>- Continued information, advice and guidance across all 31 LEOs and regionally.<\/p><p>The LEOs will also:<\/p><p>- prepare and disseminate a suite of online information addressing practical issues aimed at micro-enterprises. <\/p><p>- conduct a survey of locally trading businesses to better understand the exposure and opportunities arising from Brexit amongst this cohort. <\/p><p>- continue to be proactive in identifying client businesses that are exposed to Brexit and to help them to plan their response, including exploiting new opportunities and leveraging the suite of LEO supports available. <\/p><p>- seek to leverage the Regional Competitive Funds to drive collaborative initiatives and peer-to-peer networking amongst micro and small businesses in certain sectors and activities.<\/p><p>In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.\u00a0 The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully.<\/p><p>These initiatives supplement the core services provided by the LEOs to the micro and small business sector.  These services include advice and guidance, training and mentoring, a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; and referrals service to other State supports, as well as financial assistance to micro-enterprises in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector.  For example, LEO Dublin City is running a series of Start Your Own Business courses over the coming months and LEO Fingal have scheduled a number of training courses addressing issues such as website development and the use of social media to promote a company.<\/p><p>Events such as the National Enterprise Awards and the County finals of the Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur competition showcase the range and quality of LEO clients and provide avenues for LEOs to promote their suite of services to stakeholders.<\/p><p>Finally, the majority of LEOs currently have a full staff complement, and arrangements are at an advanced stage for the filling of the small number of existing vacancies.  The first phase of the LEO Graduate scheme is coming to an end, and it is intended that the next scheme, which will provide for a placement in most LEOs, will be in place during Q1 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300078#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ticket Touting","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300078#WRA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[49574\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300078#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to introduce legislation to combat ticket touting; and her views on the Sale of Tickets (Sporting and Cultural Events) Bill 2017.","asker":"1327","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>My predecessor as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Mary Mitchell O'Connor T.D., published a consultation paper on the resale of tickets for entertainment and sporting events on 20 January 2017 along with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the then Minister for Tourism and Sport.  The 24 responses to the consultation were published on the Department's website on 9 May 2017. <\/p>  <p>  As evidenced by the different responses to the consultation, the matter is neither simple nor straightforward, and, while it would be relatively easy to enact legislation on the issue, it is much more difficult to ensure that such legislation would be effective and enforceable.<\/p>  <p>  For example, although it is sometimes assumed that all of the tickets to entertainment or sporting events go on general sale to the public, this is not typically the case.  Tickets for entertainment events are commonly made available to a range of parties &ndash; including performers and their managements, members of performers&rsquo; fan clubs, venues and members of their clubs, corporate sponsors, holders of some credit cards, customers of some telecoms services, record labels and media organisations &ndash; prior to going on general sale.  Estimates from the US and the UK suggest that half or more of tickets for concerts by top acts may be allocated or sold prior to the commencement of the general public sale. \u00a0For major sporting events, all of the tickets may be allocated to affiliated clubs and boards or to subscribers with multi-year or season tickets with none available on general sale. <\/p>  <p>  If a proportion of tickets for high-demand events are not available for general sale, potential purchasers&rsquo; chances of obtaining tickets on the primary market are correspondingly reduced.  Pre-sales and pre-sales allocations also go some way to explaining why tickets for some events can be offered for sale on secondary marketplaces within minutes of their going on general sale or, in some cases, even before the start of the general sale.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that a high proportion of ticket resales appear to be made by individuals who have bought a small number of tickets legitimately and then proceed to resell them.  For some events, most resales (sometimes up to 90 per cent of resales) may be accounted for by private sellers.<\/p>  <p>  Since receipt of the public consultation submissions, my Department has engaged in follow-up discussions with sporting bodies, event promoters, consumer bodies, primary ticketing service providers and secondary ticket marketplaces.  My\u00a0Department is also pursuing enquiries with public authorities in European Union member states with laws that prohibit or restrict ticket resale on the experience with, and effectiveness of, these laws.\u00a0\u00a0The results of these discussions as well as the responses to the consultation are being analysed with a view to identifying possible measures aimed at helping ensure that ticket markets work better for consumers. <\/p>  <p>  The outcome of this process will inform both me and the Government on the approach to be taken on this matter, including the approach to the Deputy&rsquo;s Private Member&rsquo;s Bill entitled Sale of Tickets (Sporting and Cultural Events) Bill 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300078#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300078#WRA01000"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[49461\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300078#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if studies (details supplied) are on target to be completed before the end of 2017; the timeframe for the findings to be made available; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>In advance of the UK Referendum, my Department conducted a contingency risk assessment of the potential impacts of Brexit across policy areas of the Department.  We have refined our analysis post-referendum and have been working with Agencies to put in place actions to mitigate risks and maximize opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department is conducting a number of research projects to build an understanding of the possible implications of Brexit on Ireland for enterprise, consumers and trading relations. <\/p>  <p>  These studies\u00a0examine a range of scenarios and will provide an evidence base to inform Ireland&rsquo;s policy positions as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU and will further assist with the continued development of mitigation measures to respond to Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is also engaged in extensive consultation with stakeholders across all sectors of the economy.  Such consultation provides direct input to the more formal research studies but also represents a strand of research in itself, facilitating direct engagement between policymakers with those most significantly impacted by Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  Many of the challenges facing our economy and our enterprise base reflect longer term global trends. <\/p>  <p>  Brexit, however, is acting as a catalyst, bringing these challenges into sharper focus, expediting the need for firms to respond and adapt.  This in turn behoves my Department, and indeed the entire Government system, to continue to develop effective policy responses to support enterprise. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge, however, that the majority of policies and interventions that are already in place to support enterprises and to help them grow and diversify remain relevant.  In this context, the ongoing review of Enterprise 2025, offers a value opportunity to take stock and ensure that these policies are Brexit proofed. <\/p>  <p>  The challenge now, is to identify the additional specific policies that are required to address Brexit and emerging global challenges and opportunities.  Whilst identifying new actions to support our companies, we must also ensure we fully utilise all of the existing supports that are in place. <\/p>  <p>  The various studies currently underway will provide a valuable resource as my Department&rsquo;s policy response continues to evolve.

It is intended that this report will be published\u00a0within the coming weeks<\/p>  <p>- The study by the CCPC and the ESRI on the &ldquo;Financial impact of Brexit on consumers in Ireland&rdquo; is expected to be completed by the end of 2017.

By fostering cooperation earlier in the regulatory process, the Forum will enhance information sharing between Canadian and EU regulators, facilitate the development of more compatible regulatory measures, resulting in fewer barriers to trade, and making it easier for the EU to do business in Canada. <\/p>  <p>  The Regulatory Cooperation Forum will be a voluntary cooperation mechanism and any initiative entailing a change in EU regulations can only be introduced and pursued outside CETA, in compliance with the ordinary EU legislative procedure. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the ratification of CETA, It is important to note that the provisions relating to investment protection and the Investment Court System (ICS) are excluded from provisional application.\u00a0 Member States will not be bound by these provisions until they are ratified by all Member States in accordance with their national procedures.\u00a0 In this regard, I have no immediate plans to ratify the Agreement given the Opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the EU-Singapore case and the recent request by Belgium for an opinion from that Court on the compatibility of the Investment Court System with the European Treaties. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300078#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Schemes","counter":29,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300078#WRA02800"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[49576\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300078#WRA02900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the initiatives her Department is putting in place to help support and grow current businesses and attract new enterprises to the areas designated by the CSO as unemployment black spots.","asker":"1327","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":31,"content":"<p>According to CSO,\u00a0the number of people in unemployment in October\u00a02017 was 131,300, a decrease of 26,800 from the same month in 2016, a decrease of 17%.

The approach \u00a0is to minimise risks and maximise opportunities by ensuring the growth and resilience of Irish enterprise post-Brexit working across four pillars:<\/p>  <p>  - Helping firms to\u00a0compete: We are working across Government to create the best environment\u00a0 for business to grow, export and create jobs.  Key elements include:ensuring that firms have access to finance; ensuring that our tax regime\u00a0and infrastructure spend promote national competitiveness; and that the\u00a0Agencies are appropriately resourced to help business focus on\u00a0competitiveness at firm level.<\/p>  <p>  - Enabling firms to\u00a0\u00a0innovate: As part of our strategy to become a Global Innovation Leader, we are targeting R&amp;D funding through our Agencies.  We want to support\u00a0\u00a0innovation in new products and processes which firms will need if they are\u00a0to compete, grow and invest in the pipeline of the next generation of\u00a0innovators through a new postgraduate researcher programme.<\/p>  <p>  - Supporting firms to\u00a0trade: We are supporting firms to: start exporting; grow their exports in\u00a0existing markets; and diversify into new markets and regions.  We will\u00a0continue to attract overseas investment while working with EU partners to\u00a0expand the portfolio of Free Trade Agreements.<\/p>  <p>  - Negotiating for the best\u00a0possible outcome: We are working across government to ensure we get the\u00a0best outcome possible for business from Brexit negotiations.  DBEI is\u00a0leading a range of Brexit research projects which will provide an extensive evidence base to inform and guide Ireland&rsquo;s position within the EU-27.<\/p>  <p>  Northern Ireland accounts for about\u00a0 twelve percent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for about eight per cent of imports.\u00a0 Given that the population of Northern Ireland makes up less than three per cent of the UK total, this shows the closeness of the economic ties between the two jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  It is therefore very important that we understand the implications of Brexit on this trade and that we have a strong evidence-based analysis to inform policy decisions. \u00a0Accordingly, in partnership with InterTrade Ireland, the cross border body which my Department co-funds, we have initiated a major research project, with the analysis being undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute.<\/p>  <p>  Phase 1 of this analysis used data on WTO baseline tariff rates, sectoral price elasticities and non-tariff barrier costs, to generate estimates on the range of possible impacts for the type of products currently being traded.\u00a0 It considered a range of tariff and exchange rate scenarios.  The results presented,\u00a0show a very significant adverse impact on levels of cross border trade, especially in the Agri-food sector.\u00a0 It is important to note that these\u00a0are the worst case scenarios if no trade agreement is in place.  Obviously, our stated Government intention is to ensure negotiations mitigate these impacts.\u00a0 This report was published\u00a0 in July last.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The second\u00a0 phase of the research, currently nearing completion, is examining the concentration of North-South trade, how the structure changed over time, the patterns of intermediate inputs and final products, the frequency with which new products are introduced, and how product composition compares to other markets. \u00a0The third phase, to commence shortly, \u00a0will look at issues relating to services trade between both jurisdictions as opposed to goods trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300078#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300078#WRA03400"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[49515\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300078#WRA03500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will address the fact that the south-east region returns just 45% of the PAYE income tax per head (details supplied) as per the south-east economic monitor; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>This Government and my Department value an evidence based approach as part of our efforts to ensure that work pays.\u00a0 In that context I note the findings of the South East Economic Monitor as referenced in the Deputy's question in relation to examining\u00a0income tax returns as a proxy for job quality and employment levels.

In addition, as the Deputy is aware,\u00a0issues relating to income tax are a matter for the Minister for Finance.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the core issue raised however, it is the case that delivering sustainable employment and higher standards of living for all is the\u00a0central objective of enterprise policy as set out by my Department in Enterprise 2025.  This means creating the environment for quality jobs, enabling flexibility without exploitation, and a regulatory environment that remains attuned to changing work organization and society over the coming decade.<\/p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland (EI), together with the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are focused on the creation of quality employment, taking into account the multidimensional aspects that define quality: ensuring opportunities for advancement that includes workplace learning and development; ensuring that people are educated and trained to meet the needs of industry; and recognizing the opportunities presented by entrepreneurship as an alternative career path.<\/p>  <p>  IDA is targeting a minimum increase in investment of 30 to 40 percent in the South-East region over the period of its strategy to 2019.

In addition, the Regional APJ Implementation Committee is working with the South East Regional Skills Forum to assess and respond to the skills needs of industry and prospective employees in the region.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of a focused collaborative approach and a range of reforms, there has been a substantial improvement in the South-East region since the commencement of the National Action Plan for Jobs in 2012, with an additional 33,600 in employment in Q2 2017 compared to Q1 2012. <\/p>  <p>  There are now 13,000 more people in work in the region since the launch of the Regional Action Plan initiative in Q1 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The sectors which showed the highest employment growth since 2015 were Construction, Professional, scientific and technical activities and the Hospitality sector.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the unemployment rate in the South-East region has fallen from 12.8% in Q1 2015 to 8.1% in Q2 of this year<\/p>  <p>  However, there is still work to be done: the unemployment rate in the South East is still over 1 percentage point higher than the (Q2 2017) national average of 6.4%.<\/p>  <p>  To complement the Regional Action Plan for Jobs process, Enterprise Ireland, with the support of my Department, in May, launched a Regional Enterprise Development Fund of up to &euro;60 million to grow and sustain jobs across the regions over a four-year period.

CSO figures show that the unemployment rate in Wexford\u00a0has decreased from\u00a016,170 in 2011 to 11,478 in 2016, a reduction of almost 5,000 people. <\/p>  <p>  This overall\u00a0positive employment\u00a0trend is reflected\u00a0by the levels of\u00a0FDI-driven employment in the County.  There are currently 17\u00a0IDA Ireland\u00a0clients\u00a0based there, employing a total of 2,630 people.\u00a0 Moreover,\u00a02016 witnessed\u00a0an increase\u00a0of 6% in IDA client company\u00a0employment over 2015.\u00a0 The longer-term trends in Wexford\u00a0are also encouraging: since 2009 there has been a 22% increase in total in employment in IDA Ireland supported companies.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2012 there have been 717 newly created jobs by IDA Ireland supported clients in Wexford, this resulted in 244 total net new jobs bringing the total employed in IDA Ireland supported companies to 2,630 in 17 supported companies. <\/p>  <p>  Examples of successes in the County Wexford include Clearstream Technologies Limited, a medical devices manufacturer, who announced at the end of 2014 the completion of a 50,000 sq. ft. extension to its existing facility.\u00a0 Since its acquisition in 2011 by CR Bard Inc., the US-based medical device manufacturer, has added 160 jobs to its workforce, bringing its current headcount to approximately 400 people.\u00a0 The completed expansion which is expected to support growth through 2019, will give the company the potential to accommodate up new positions as required.<\/p>  <p>  Other positive examples of existing employers in the County include, Lake Region in New Ross employing approximately over 700 people, and Waters Technology, Wexford town &ndash; employing approximately 250 people.  In addition, service operations such as Equifax (Rosslare), BNY Mellon (Drinagh) and Indos Financial (New Ross) all form a positive employment framework in Wexford employing between them in the region of 350 people.<\/p>  <p>  Looking ahead, IDA Ireland is targeting - as part of its 2015-2019 strategy -\u00a0an increase of investment in all regions outside Dublin, including the South East, of 30% to 40% by 2019.  To achieve this,\u00a0the Agency will continue\u00a0to draw the attention of potential investors\u00a0to the region's particular strengths.  These include the South East's accessibility, its ports and its existing cluster of medical technology firms.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The provision of available property solutions is also very important from an FDI perspective and in this respect there are three IDA Ireland sites and one private finance facility available to market in Wexford. \u00a0In 2016 there were seven site visits to Wexford with a further five to date this year. IDA Ireland\u00a0continues to highlight the benefits of\u00a0expanding or locating in the regions to its client base and it makes every effort to ensure that\u00a0FDI is spread as widely as possible across the country.  It is important to\u00a0remember, however,\u00a0that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the company concerned.  It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA Ireland client companies.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While FDI can play a huge role in increasing economic activity and reducing unemployment it is important to recognize it cannot form the sole economic development strategy for Wexford.\u00a0 Indigenous companies also have a strong\u00a0presence in\u00a0Wexford.\u00a0In 2016, Enterprise Ireland supported companies in the County employed 4,816 people.  Enterprise Ireland has also funded two Community Enterprise Centres there which\u00a0serve as\u00a0important enterprise hubs.  Local enterprise also continues to perform well and the Wexford Local Enterprise Office successfully secured funding for five projects under Enterprise Ireland's Competitive Fund for LEOs.  Two other\u00a0projects from within the county were also awarded funding under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Community Enterprise Initiative Scheme 2016.

I believe that the Commission has rightly addressed the concerns raised.\u00a0 Their proposal is for\u00a0an independent investment\u00a0system, consisting of a permanent tribunal and an appeal tribunal competent to review decisions of the tribunal.

The ICS system is composed of a first instance tribunal and an appeal mechanism based on clearly defined rules and operating on similar principles to the WTO Appellate Body, with qualified judges and transparent proceedings.  The ability of investors to take a case before the Tribunal is precisely defined and limited to cases such as targeted discrimination on the base of gender, race or religion, nationality, expropriation without compensation, or denial of justice.

Given that the EU&rsquo;s initial negotiating position is now clear, all of Government is intensifying its focus on the economic implications of Brexit, including on domestic policy measures to reinforce the competitiveness of the Irish economy, to protect it from potential negative impacts of Brexit, and to pursue all possible opportunities (e.g. foreign direct investment) that might arise.  My Department is central to the Government wide effort to prepare our economy to respond to Brexit<\/p>  <p>  On 9 November, I published &ldquo;Building Stronger Business: Responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and trading&rdquo;.  This paper sets out work underway, and planned, by\u00a0my Department and its Agencies in response to Brexit.  The paper summarises the impact of Brexit across key policy areas within\u00a0my Department and outlines the policy and operational measures underway and planned by\u00a0my Department and its Agencies to respond to Brexit, including supports available to companies to help them prepare for Brexit, regardless of the deal that emerges from the Brexit negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  Building Stronger Business\u00a0also describes the research programme underway in DBEI\u00a0to inform that response, as well as new structures put in place to ensure a coherent approach across the Department and its Agencies. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the\u00a0research projects underway in my Department,\u00a0studies\u00a0are being done to enhance our\u00a0understanding of the possible implications of Brexit on Ireland for enterprise, consumers and trading relations.  These studies\u00a0examine a range of scenarios, including a hard Brexit scenario, and will provide an evidence base to inform Ireland&rsquo;s policy positions as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU and will help us to continue to develop further mitigation measures to respond to Brexit.  These studies include a study to understand the implications of a number of Brexit scenarios on our trading patterns, and another study considering the implications of Brexit for our most exposed sectors.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these studies, the\u00a0Action Plan for Jobs and Enterprise 2025 are part of a range of policy documents setting out our overall approach to enterprise policy.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 sets out a long-term ambition and strategy to encourage and facilitate enterprise growth and job creation.  This document addresses the broader enterprise environment and also sets out the rationale for a range of enterprise supports.  As part of DBEI&rsquo;s overall response to Brexit, a review of Enterprise 2025 is currently underway to determine the extent to which the policy framework and priorities set out in Enterprise 2025 remain robust in light of recent significant and potentially disruptive changes in the global environment, with a particular focus on Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs has been an essential tool from a competitiveness perspective and has been successful in driving coordinated actions to improve job creation, broaden the export and enterprise base, and enhance competitiveness.\u00a0 APJ 2018 will provide a\u00a0platform to develop and implement immediate, short terms actions to support enterprise and address the challenges which firms are already facing as a result of the UK&rsquo;s decision to exit the EU.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 contained some important pro-business measures to help companies compete in the face of Brexit including:<\/p>  <p>  - New &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme for Business;<\/p>  <p>  - Doubling of additional DBEI Brexit related agency staff to 100;<\/p>  <p>  - New &euro;25m Regional Fund Competitive Call from Enterprise Ireland;<\/p>  <p>  - Tax package to support Enterprise and investment to attract jobs to Regions;<\/p>  <p>  - Investment in PhD &amp;amp; Research Masters Programme to meet enterprise skills needs;<\/p>  <p>  - SFI Research Centres to increase from 12 to 17 with new Capital funding; and<\/p>  <p>  - Ireland to become a member of European Southern Observatory in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  I also secured an additional &euro;3 million in current funding in both 2017 and 2018 to recruit up to 100 additional staff, specifically to assist in the response to the evolving Brexit situation.  As well as supporting Brexit-related staffing within\u00a0my Department, these resources have been distributed across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority.  These additional resources will be assigned to both overseas offices in markets that are growing and have scale and markets where we are already well-established but with potential for further growth.  Irish based posts will address a range of Brexit issues, including the support for internationalisation activities, a strengthening of the LEOs ability to respond locally to help micro-enterprises, and enhanced support for innovation. <\/p>  <p>  It is essential that Government supports are definitively targeted at vulnerable, but viable companies.\u00a0 My Department\u00a0is developing specific supports for companies to mitigate these impacts.  In response, working in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, DBEI has secured Budget funding for a Brexit Loan Scheme which aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to businesses with up to 499 employees at a proposed interest rate of 4 per cent.  The scheme is open both to State Agency clients and those businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies.  The finance will be easier to access, more competitively priced, and at more favourable terms than current offerings. <\/p>  <p>  Additional measures compatible with the EU State Aid framework are also under active consideration: <\/p>  <p>  - A longer-term investment loan guarantee scheme which would focus on Business Development to allow SMEs to invest for a post-Brexit environment and to address potential disruption that might arise (i.e. new market entry and development costs, trade facilitation requirements, new trading arrangements and possible tariffs, transport costs and trans-shipment costs, changes to regulations and standards and border controls and certification).

EI will achieve these ambitious objectives by: <\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the levels of diversification of EI client companies into new export markets, with two thirds going beyond the UK; <\/p>  <p>  - Improving the competitiveness of EI client companies through Lean programmes; <\/p>  <p>  - Driving the innovation in Irish enterprise through new supports to reach a target of &euro;1.25 billion in R&amp;D expenditure per annum by 2020; and <\/p>  <p>  - Inspiring more companies to have Global Ambition.<\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is constantly engaged with clients across its entire portfolio and in the months leading up to the UK referendum it engaged with clients and prospective clients in relation to the potential impact of BREXIT.\u00a0 The IDA has a Team involved in strategic scenario planning, which continues to work on ensuring that the Agency&rsquo;s strategy is fit for purpose in light of the referendum results in the UK. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0IDA Ireland will:<\/p>  <p>  - Continue to engage with current and prospective clients on Brexit and the potential implications of the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU for their investment decisions;<\/p>  <p>  - carry out updated analysis and research on the FDI risks and opportunities associated with Brexit.  This will include assessing new feedback from IDA clients on issues relating to Brexit;<\/p>  <p>  - continue to hold events in key international locations, to promote Ireland as an attractive investment destination in the post-Brexit environment.<\/p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland provides a targeted portfolio of programmes to help businesses, especially SMEs, develop capacity in the areas of science, technology &amp;amp; innovation and sales &amp;amp; marketing.  Given its role in promoting and supporting North- South commerce, ITI is especially well-positioned to help businesses both prepare for and address challenges that Brexit may present for cross-border trade.  With that in mind, the Department has put in place two specific ITI Brexit initiatives. <\/p>  <p>  - The Department funded a research project undertaken by the ESRI for InterTrade Ireland.  This study provides useful data on the extent and concentration of cross-border trade, including information on this trade by product, firm types and barriers to trade. <\/p>  <p>  - Additional funding was provided to ITI to undertake a range of initiatives for SMEs in the Republic of Ireland who are trading with Northern Ireland, to help them adapt to the changed circumstances following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  In May, InterTrade Ireland utilised this funding to launch a new dedicated &lsquo;Brexit Advisory Service&rsquo;.  This Service offers businesses a number of supports, including vouchers (valued at &euro;1,000 allowing them to fund specialist advice), technical and commercial advice, information on currency hedging and an interactive information tool explaining the technical language related to Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, ITI is establishing a Sectoral Advisory Panel, consisting of experts with hands-on exporting experience in specific sectors, to help ITI assess the impact of Brexit changes on particular sectors as negotiations evolve.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the\u00a0research projects underway in my Department,\u00a0studies\u00a0are being done to enhance our\u00a0understanding of the possible implications of Brexit on Ireland for enterprise, consumers and trading relations and will take account of potential changes to\u00a0the conditions facing exporters and importers.  These studies\u00a0examine a range of scenarios and will provide an evidence base to inform Ireland&rsquo;s policy positions as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU and will help us to continue to develop further mitigation measures to respond to Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  These studies include a study examining the Import Content of Irish Exports: Implications of Brexit for Inputs and Competitiveness and the extent to which Irish firms source intermediate inputs from the UK.  This research will provide empirical evidence on the import content of Irish firms&rsquo; exports, how firms may be exposed to changes in the trading environment after Brexit and the impact of Brexit on inputs, and competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these studies, the\u00a0Action Plan for Jobs and Enterprise 2025 are part of a range of policy documents setting out our overall approach to enterprise policy.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 sets out a long-term ambition and strategy to encourage and facilitate enterprise growth and job creation.  This document addresses the broader enterprise environment and also sets out the rationale for a range of enterprise supports.  As part of DBEI&rsquo;s overall response to Brexit, a review of Enterprise 2025 is currently underway to determine the extent to which the policy framework and priorities set out in Enterprise 2025 remain robust in light of recent significant and potentially disruptive changes in the global environment, with a particular focus on Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs has been an essential tool from a competitiveness perspective and has been successful in driving coordinated actions to improve job creation, broaden the export and enterprise base, and enhance competitiveness.\u00a0 APJ 2018 will provide a\u00a0platform to develop and implement immediate, short terms actions to support enterprise and address the challenges which firms are already facing as a result of the UK&rsquo;s decision to exit the EU.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 contained some important pro-business measures to help companies compete in the face of Brexit including:<\/p>  <p>  - New &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme for Business;<\/p>  <p>  - Doubling of additional DBEI Brexit related agency staff to 100;<\/p>  <p>  - New &euro;25m Regional Fund Competitive Call from Enterprise Ireland;<\/p>  <p>  - Tax package to support Enterprise and investment to attract jobs to Regions;<\/p>  <p>  - Investment in PhD &amp;amp; Research Masters Programme to meet enterprise skills needs;<\/p>  <p>  - SFI Research Centres to increase from 12 to 17 with new Capital funding; and<\/p>  <p>  - Ireland to become a member of European Southern Observatory in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  I also secured an additional &euro;3 million in current funding in both 2017 and 2018 to recruit up to 100 additional staff, specifically to assist in the response to the evolving Brexit situation.  As well as supporting Brexit-related staffing within\u00a0my Department, these resources have been distributed across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority.  These additional resources will be assigned to both overseas offices in markets that are growing and have scale and markets where we are already well-established but with potential for further growth.  Irish based posts will address a range of Brexit issues, including the support for internationalisation activities, a strengthening of the LEOs ability to respond locally to help micro-enterprises, and enhanced support for innovation. <\/p>  <p>  It is essential that Government supports are definitively targeted at vulnerable, but viable companies.\u00a0 My Department\u00a0is developing specific supports for companies to mitigate these impacts.  In response, working in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, DBEI has secured Budget funding for a Brexit Loan Scheme which aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to businesses with up to 499 employees at a proposed interest rate of 4 per cent.  The scheme is open both to State Agency clients and those businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies.  The finance will be easier to access, more competitively priced, and at more favourable terms than current offerings. <\/p>  <p>  Additional measures compatible with the EU State Aid framework are also under active consideration: <\/p>  <p>  - A longer-term investment loan guarantee scheme which would focus on Business Development to allow SMEs to invest for a post-Brexit environment and to address potential disruption that might arise (i.e. new market entry and development costs, trade facilitation requirements, new trading arrangements and possible tariffs, transport costs and trans-shipment costs, changes to regulations and standards and border controls and certification).  It is intended that the Scheme will operate under the State Aid General Block Exemption Regulation. <\/p>  <p>  - A rescue and restructure scheme was pre-notified to the Commission at the end of August.  It is envisaged that this scheme would apply to all SMEs in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sectors, as well as to the fisheries and aquaculture sector, and SMEs engaged in processing and marketing in the agricultural sector.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, it is proposed that a Business Advisory Hub be established which would focus on business development to allow enterprises to position them for a post-Brexit environment.  This would build on the existing supports available and on work being undertaken by Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300080#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[49777\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300080#WRC02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which she has identified the sectors most likely to be negatively impacted by Brexit; the steps taken to alleviate such an impact; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>My Department\u00a0and its enterprise agencies are focused on assisting companies to prepare for\u00a0the UK's withdrawal from the EU.

This paper summarises the policy measures already taken, outlines future initiatives we intend to take forward and details\u00a0the steps the Department has taken already\u00a0to ensure that we can work as efficiently as possible to support our companies. <\/p>  <p>  To inform policy, develop effective\u00a0mitigation strategies and help prepare Ireland&rsquo;s position on our trade priorities, DBEI had already published a number of reports and is currently engaged in a suite of studies.  A significant amount of this analysis is undertaken at sectoral level.<\/p>  <p>  Completed research includes the outputs from a series of structured engagements with companies (of different sizes, across different sectors and across the regions) and from a survey of a thousand SME business owners to \"Understand the Implications of Brexit for Irish SME&rsquo;s\" which my Department published earlier this year.  Additionally, a study analysing the \"Potential Impact of WTO Tariffs on Cross-Border Trade\" was published by InterTrade Ireland in conjunction with my Department in June.  This study provides an understanding of the impact of different trade and tariff regimes which might be imposed following Brexit and\u00a0includes a\u00a0sectoral focus.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of ongoing research commitments, the Department is currently working on: <\/p>  <p>  - A\u00a0\u00a0major study examining the \"Strategic Implications arising from EU-UK Trading Patterns\".  This study will provide an evidence base on key trade and investment questions to inform Ireland&rsquo;s position as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU.  It will  quantify the possible impact of a range of Brexit scenarios on trade and investment.  The study will provide in-depth analysis of key sectors.\u00a0 It will decompose the potential trade and investment impacts for key sectors and in each scenario identify which elements contribute to the results (i.e. tariffs, non-tariff barriers, transit costs, other trade costs), leading to sector-by-sector understanding of solutions. <\/p>  <p>  - A study examining the \"Sectoral implications arising from Brexit\" focused on 18 sectors most exposed to the UK is underway and is due to be completed by end 2017.  This research examines the implications at firm-level for Ireland&rsquo;s most exposed enterprise sectors of the UK being outside of the European Single Market and Customs Union.  The study is expected to be completed by end 2017.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - A study examining the \"Import Content of Irish Exports: Implications of Brexit for Inputs and Competitiveness\" and the extent to which Irish firms source intermediate inputs from the UK has just commenced.  This research will provide empirical evidence on the import content of Irish firms&rsquo; exports, how firms &amp;amp; sectors may be exposed to changes in the trading environment after Brexit and the impact of Brexit on inputs, and competitiveness. <\/p>  <p>  - A\u00a0study examining the \"Skills needs arising from the Potential Trading and Regulatory Implications of Brexit\" has commenced &ndash; with a  particular focus on sectors such as logistics and freight.  This research is being undertaken in my Department on behalf of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. <\/p>  <p>  The outcomes of this research will inform policy decisions relating to the immediate support for enterprise, developing effective mitigation actions and preparing our longer term desired outcomes from the negotiations. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Our State Agencies are already very active in taking forward projects aimed at helping businesses in Ireland prepare for the post-Brexit commercial environment. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs are steadily working with companies to make sure that they are better prepared to respond to the challenges that Brexit will bring.\u00a0 These are the medium term, strategic actions that I know that companies are calling for &ndash; things like helping them to drive down costs, diversify into new markets and innovate in the way they do business.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been systematically engaging with its 1,500 clients that export to the UK and is providing information and guidance, market diversification support and competitiveness and market development support to help companies prepare for the future trading relationship with the UK. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland launched the 'Prepare for Brexit' campaign, which features the SME Scorecard tool.\u00a0 The Scorecard is an interactive online platform which can be used by all companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit and areas they may need to consider preparing further on in the context of Brexit.  EI has also introduced a &lsquo;Be Prepared Grant&rsquo; which offers up to &euro;5,000 in funding to support exporting client companies develop a Brexit Action Plan.  The 'Prepare for Brexit' campaign aims to encourage more SMEs to prepare for Brexit and start putting in place detailed plans to mitigate risks and leverage opportunities that may arise, now that Brexit negotiations have begun.  Additionally, InterTrade Ireland, has introduced a scheme to help SMEs avail of expert advice on Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  While progress is being made in helping sectors to prepare, we know much more work remains to be done.  That is why we will remain absolutely focused on our Brexit-related initiatives and will continue to explore new avenues and means of helping our companies plan for the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300080#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300080#WRC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[49778\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300080#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which innovation remains an integral part of this country&rsquo;s campaign to maximise its industrial impact in terms of effective trading, efficiency and modernisation with particular reference to competing on EU and world markets; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>A key objective for Ireland is to deliver growth that is sustainable, led by strong export performance and underpinned by innovation, productivity and competitiveness. \u00a0As the Government continues to place innovation at the heart of enterprise and jobs policies, my Department has developed Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology, and Enterprise 2025, Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise policy, side by side. \u00a0As set out in Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s ambition is to become Global Innovation Leader, driving a strong sustainable economy, underpinned by a strong innovative and internationally competitive enterprise base, growing employment, sales and exports.\u00a0 Recognising that innovation must be at the core of stimulating growth, sustainability and company resilience, the strategy sets out actions to increase enterprise engagement in innovation to assist companies in developing new, higher value-added products and services, and more efficient processes. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 sets a roadmap for long-term enterprise development and resilience, with the ambition to achieve a step-change in the performance of our enterprises, to build a real and distinctive competitive edge sector-by-sector and to excel in creating a jobs-fit environment with top-three competitiveness ranking. \u00a0Enterprise 2025 is currently being reviewed to ensure that our policy framework and priorities are robust and remain current. \u00a0This review is being undertaken in the context of global changes that are likely to have an immediate impact on Ireland's enterprise development, and specifically Brexit and potential policy changes under the new US administration.<\/p>  <p>  In March of this year, the Government published a new Trade Strategy, Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World, a whole of government commitment to our openness to trade, to strengthening our international relationships and to deepening our enterprise resilience.

Since 2012, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs has set out a comprehensive set of measures to improve our competitiveness performance.  Ireland&rsquo;s improving competitiveness performance over the period 2011-2016 has been central to the recovery in employment and economic growth.  Ireland&rsquo;s relative international competitiveness as measured by a range of international indices has improved.  Ireland moved from 16th to 6th in 2017 in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook.  In addition, the World Bank&rsquo;s most recent &ldquo;Doing Business 2018&rdquo; report shows Ireland is now ranked 17th out of 190 countries, an improvement of 1 place on last year. <\/p>  <p>  Our improved performance is reflected in strong employment growth across sectors and regions.  The most recent Quarterly National Household Survey data from the CSO shows there was an annual increase in employment of 2.4% or 48,100 in the year to the second quarter of 2017, bringing total employment to 2,063,000.  Employment increased in eleven of the fourteen economic sectors over the year.  CSO data shows that since 2012, the numbers employed in Industry have increased by 12% to 260,100 with the numbers employed in the Services sector increasing by 8.6% to 1,539,000 persons employed.  This increase in employment growth is testament to the competitiveness of Irish enterprise.<\/p>  <p>  However, there is no room for complacency.  We need to continue to improve the environment for doing business in Ireland and remain vigilant to the very significant challenges in the external environment, particularly, Brexit.  The challenges posed by Brexit provide urgent impetus to pursue policies that enhance competitiveness.  I agree with the assessment of the National Competitiveness Council that we need to improve structural factors such as innovation capacity, the quality of infrastructure, costs of doing business and productivity across all economic sectors.  The Government is working to reduce the administrative burden that regulations create can improve the business environment by reducing costs, minimising the time businesses spend fulfilling regulatory requirements and increasing productivity.  Ensuring that the State does not place undue administrative burdens and costs on entrepreneurs and business owners is critical to competitiveness, productivity and job creation. <\/p>  <p>  The immediate challenge for Ireland is to ensure growth is sustainable, enterprises are resilient and as a small open economy Ireland is best positioned to withstand shifts in economic fortunes.  My objective is to ensure the economy is resilient at sectoral and firm level to deal with imminent competitiveness challenges and to build further on the progress we have made.  As set out in Budget 2018 my Department is intensifying its focus on the economic implications of Brexit, including on domestic policy measures to reinforce the competitiveness of the Irish economy, to protect it from potential negative impacts of Brexit, and to pursue all possible opportunities that might arise.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I will shortly bring the Competitiveness Council's annual Competitiveness Challenge report to Government and we will ensure the required actions to address emerging issues are addressed as part of the Action Plan for Jobs process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300080#WRC05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Staff Data","counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300081#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[49815\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300081#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the staffing levels at the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority; if she is satisfied with the levels of staffing; if the authority is in a position to fulfil its functions effectively with existing resources; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":155,"content":"<p>The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) currently has an approved staff complement of 43.\u00a0 At present, 24 staff are in place, with recruitment of additional staff underway and plans to commence a further recruitment campaign.\u00a0 Through these recruitment campaigns, the Authority is working towards having a full staff complement in situ at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  The Authority, in common with many other State organisations, faces significant challenges in the recruitment of high quality professional staff to deliver on its remit of supervising and promoting high quality financial reporting, auditing and effective regulation of the accounting profession. <\/p>  <p>  IAASA has the necessary budget to meet all costs associated with the functions conferred on the Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300081#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300081#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[49827\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300081#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when the Second Stage of the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill as referenced in the autumn legislative programme for 2017 is due to take place.","asker":"1221","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>The draft heads of the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill were approved by Government last year.

Negotiations are led by the EU Commission on behalf of Member States.<\/p>  <p>  An EU-Mercosur FTA would be the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date, and is four times the size of the trade agreement with Japan.  It aims to eliminate trade tariffs between the EU and the Mercosur region.\u00a0 Irish exporters are currently subject to trade tariffs, barriers and restrictions, when exporting to Mercosur,\u00a0while imports from Mercosur, particularly in Agriculture, are currently subject to high tariffs.  The proposed FTA should make\u00a0exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase demand for Irish products. <\/p>  <p>  Within the region, Brazil is Ireland&rsquo;s main trading partner with total exports from Ireland of &euro;715 million and total imports of &euro;634 million in 2014.\u00a0 Brazil has been highlighted as a &lsquo;High Growth Market&rsquo; in the Enterprise Ireland Plan 2016, with Enterprise Ireland client&rsquo;s companies&rsquo; exports value increasing by 84% from 2012 to 2014.

While all Free Trade Agreements include agriculture tariffs, agricultural market access and TRQs (Tariff Rate Quotas),\u00a0TRQs provided under such agreements are not always fully utilised by our trading partners.  Equally, most Member States tend to have sensitives in relation to certain goods or services to be comprehended under an FTA.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has continued to highlight the cumulative impact of agricultural market access in relation to all trade agreements.

Furthermore, it is only one of a number of reasons why SMEs decide to seek finance.  The most recent published Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey, covering the period October 2016 to March 2017, reports only 1% of the SMEs that did not seek credit stated this was because it was too expensive to borrow.

In May of this year, the Supreme Court overturned a High Court decision deeming MIBI liable for the claims in respect of Setanta.\u00a0 The consequence of this is that the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) has been deemed responsible for the payment of claims subject to the limits set out in the Insurance Acts (65% or &euro;825,000 whichever is the less).<\/p>  <p>  The Review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation in Ireland was completed in June 2016 and was approved by the Ministers of Finance and Transport, and noted by Government in July 2016. Its key recommendations were that:<\/p>  <p>  - Coverage of the ICF would be extended to include third party motor\u00a0insurance claims in the event of a liquidation of an insurer;<\/p>  <p>  - The level of compensation from the ICF for third party motor claims\u00a0to be increased from 65% to 100% \u00a0in line with that currently\u00a0provided by MIBI ;<\/p>  <p>  - The increased coverage of the ICF to be funded by a direct\u00a0contribution to the ICF from the motor insurance industry via the MIBI to\u00a0the value of 35% of the third party motor insurance claims;<\/p>  <p>  - Administration of the ICF to be transferred from the Accountant of\u00a0\u00a0the Courts of Justice to the Central Bank of Ireland;<\/p>  <p>  - To provide for a more formal role for the State Claims Agency in\u00a0the event of a failure of an insurance company resulting in a draw on the\u00a0ICF.<\/p>  <p>  To implement these recommendations, heads of the Insurance (Amendment) Bill were approved by Government in July and then sent to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) for priority drafting and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  My Department continues to work closely with the OPC and other relevant stakeholders to progress the drafting.  This legislation will provide greater certainty for both consumers and industry and will ensure that 100% of third party personal injury motor insurance claims are covered ( for property claims it will be 100% up to a limit of &euro;1,220,000) by the\u00a0ICF in the event of any future insurance company failure.<\/p>  <p>  At an EU level, it is important to note that the regulatory framework, underpinning the operation of insurance companies, has been strengthened with the introduction of Solvency II from 1 January 2016.  This is a much more risk sensitive and demanding system, with increased capital requirements, which are consistent across all Member States.\u00a0 The role of supervisory authorities is also significantly enhanced, including provision for more cooperation between Member States. <\/p>  <p>  These measures, at national and EU level, should make any similar failure of an insurance company in the future less likely, and provide certainty\u00a0that if such an event were to occur, then 100% of third party motor personal injury motor insurance claims would be covered by the ICF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300082#WRE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300082#WRE01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Projects","counter":229,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300082#WRE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":230,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[49680\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300082#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will report on the partners from the commercial sector of the economy that are involved with the Office of Public Works in the plans for the development of the children&rsquo;s science museum exploration station proposed for the Earlsfort Terrace, the National Concert Hall and the Iveagh Gardens site.","asker":"1294","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[49681\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300082#WRE01900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will report on the process by which the Earlsfort Terrace, the National Concert Hall and the Iveagh Gardens site was selected by the OPW as the most suitable for the development of the children&rsquo;s science museum exploration station; if the OPW received representations from third parties regarding the choice of site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1294","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[49683\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300082#WRE02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will publish a schedule of those philanthropic donors, foundations and corporations which have to date committed to supporting the OPW&rsquo;s proposed national children&rsquo;s science centre\u00a0exploration station to be developed at Earlsfort Terrace, the National Concert Hall and the Iveagh Gardens.","asker":"1294","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":233,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 to 89, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The information sought by the Deputy is currently being addressed.

In November 2016, my predecessor, Minister Flanagan, raised concerns about the appalling humanitarian situation in Yemen, and about attacks which have directly impacted on civilians, with the Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Nizar bin Obaid Madani, in November 2016.  Following this, he also raised these concerns with the UAE Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, both in the UAE and more recently here in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  More recently, when senior officials from my Department met with the Saudi Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires earlier this month, they reiterated these concerns, and re-stated Ireland&rsquo;s view that there can be no military solution to the crisis in Yemen.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland does not have an arms industry and is not therefore an exporter of conventional weapons.  Ireland has signed and ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) and we consider ourselves in full compliance with the Treaty.  As one of the ATT&rsquo;s early signatories, Ireland continues to be one of its strongest supporters, given its potential to directly impact and reduce fatalities and injuries caused by conventional arms.<\/p>  <p>  I share a deep concern about violations of human rights in Yemen.  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, I decided that Ireland should join a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution on Yemen.  This Resolution establishes a group of international experts, who will establish the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground.  This group will report back to the Human Rights Council, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access to those in need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300083#WRF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Expenditure","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300083#WRF02600"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[49755\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300083#WRF02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the spend on social media campaigns by his Department and the agencies under its aegis on issues related to Brexit; the spend by campaign per platform and State agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":297,"content":"<p>My Department has not incurred any expenditure on social media campaigns on issues related to Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300083#WRF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300083#WRF02900"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[49822\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300083#WRF03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the outcome of the recent EU Council meeting on Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>At the General Affairs Council (Article 50) on Monday 20 November, the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier, provided an update to the EU27 Member States on the state of play with regard to the EU-UK negotiations.<\/p><p>This provided an important opportunity to take stock of progress in light of the forthcoming decision by the European Council in December on whether or not sufficient progress has been made on the exit issues in order to enable discussions on the framework for a future EU-UK relationship and transitional arrangements to begin.<\/p><p>In this regard, Mr Barnier reported that, while some progress was made in the latest round of negotiations on 9-10 November, there is a lot of work remaining in order to achieve sufficient progress across all of the exit issues - citizens&rsquo; rights, the UK&rsquo;s financial settlement and the issues unique to Ireland.<\/p><p>During the meeting, I took the opportunity to express Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the work of Michel Barnier and his team.

When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Unit, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 33 of whom were assigned to Cavan\/Monaghan Division.\u00a0 In addition, another 200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest next month which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.

However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.\u00a0 To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Operation Thor, which is effective in all Garda Divisions including the Cavan\/Monaghan Division, involves a broad range of activities to tackle organised crime gangs and other prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.

The CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q4 of 2016 show a 30% decrease in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015 - which parallels the implementation of Operation Thor.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that there is close and ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing, with a particular focus on combatting security threats and cross-border crime.  The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, who are responsible for operational policing cooperation, have repeatedly emphasised the scope and the value of the close and high quality cooperation between the two police services in combating crime, protecting community safety and saving lives.

Once Part 6 is operational, each ward will be reviewed by the wardship court in accordance with the new system.  A ward who is found to have capacity will be discharged from wardship.  A ward who continues to have capacity needs will be discharged from wardship and offered the decision-making support option most appropriate to his or her needs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The specific decision making supports available under the Act to adults with capacity difficulties will be decision-making assistants, co-decision-makers and decision-making representatives, all of whom will be supervised by the Director of the Decision Support Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300083#WRF05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300083#WRF05300"},{"type":"question","counter":323,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[49712\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300083#WRF05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the residency status in the case of persons (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":324,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the first named person concerned was granted Stamp 1 conditions for\u00a0two\u00a0years on 12 October 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The second named person concerned\u00a0was granted permission to remain in the State, on immigration Stamp 3 conditions, for\u00a0two years on 12 October 2017 as a dependant of the first named person. <\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

They generally require various queries to be raised by the PRA in order to prove the facts of possession as claimed on affidavit.  Once a case has been fully established, notice must be served on all interested parties and appropriate time allowed for objections.  As a result, there can routinely be ongoing and detailed correspondence between the PRA and other parties, which can run for some time.\u00a0 The PRA must be fully satisfied that a case is fully grounded, the nature of the title proved and that all interested parties' concerns have been fully considered before registering a State guaranteed title which has been based solely on adverse possession. \u00a0While every effort may be taken to speed up the process, such applications, by necessity and legislation, may take a long time to process. <\/p>  <p>  All other applications submitted that are fully in order for registration and that do not result in the raising of queries are dealt with in a very timely and efficient manner. \u00a0In 2017 to date, in excess of 62% of cases in order for registration which do not require a change to the map or examination of title are completed within ten days or less, while more than 70% of such cases are dealt with within 15 days or less. \u00a0Where a case is urgent and is brought to the attention of the PRA it will, in accordance with its customer service policy, deal with the matter as a priority. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also refers to a number of initiatives previously outlined by the PRA which are aimed at reducing arrears.\u00a0 The PRA has been enhancing its training and development programmes for managers and staff, and in particular for the large number of new staff in the organisation.  This has included business process improvement training for staff in key areas, with a view to identifying and implementing more efficient processes. \u00a0The PRA has also now published a series of guides and videos for solicitors, again to help improve the quality of applications lodged and to assist in the reduction of cases being re-submitted, which add to the number of cases on hand.  These went live on the PRA's website in August 2017.  Advertising of the guides and videos was undertaken through the Law Society Gazette and the PRA&rsquo;s website. \u00a0These measures are in addition to ongoing engagement with solicitors in various locations across the country, with a view to improving applications and well as improving internal PRA processes.<\/p>  <p>  I would agree with the Deputy that unwarranted delays in the process of applications for the registration of property must be addressed and initiatives in this regard are being monitored by the Board of the Authority.\u00a0 I am advised that the measures outlined\u00a0above will increase efficiency and, in tandem with further development of ICT systems, will increase the case processing capacity and capability of the PRA in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300084#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Resources","counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300084#WRG01000"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[49749\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300084#WRG01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the estimated cost of doubling the number of dogs available in the Garda dog unit; the estimated cost of doubling the number of horses available in the Garda mounted unit; the estimated cost of constructing ten new stables at Garda headquarters for use by the mounted unit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":340,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the provision and allocation of resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.\u00a0<\/p><p>I have, however,\u00a0asked the Garda Commissioner for the specific information requested and when it is to hand I will inform the Deputy accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300084#WRG01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300084#WRG01300"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[49768\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300084#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the basis for the conclusion that it would be conducive to the common good to issue a deportation order in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that notifications have issued to the persons concerned pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  <\/p>  <p>  All representations received, together with all other information and documentation on file, will be fully considered, under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and all other applicable legislation, in advance of a final decision being made.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Significant developments have taken place over the last 3 years to improve the capacity of the health system to move to a digital environment.  New strategic systems are being put in place such as the new medical laboratory platform known as MedLIS, the continued roll out of the national radiology solution NIMIS, the eReferrals initiative in primary care and the Maternal and New Born System which is transforming the delivery of maternity care and has gone live in both Cork (2016) and Kerry (2017) and most recently in the Rotunda Hospital over last weekend.  <\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the recognition of the priority required for investment in the EHR Programme in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report which recommended &ldquo;continued strong support of the e-health strategy - particularly ensuring the necessary funding for timely roll-out of the EHR system\" and advancement in eHealth will be considered as part of the implementation response to Sl&aacute;intecare, currently being developed by my Department. <\/p>  <p>  The scale of the task to implement a national electronic health record programme is very large, challenging and requires a complex planning, approval and tendering process.  The EHR business case, which has been developed by the HSE, highlights a number of optional timescales and investment approaches for implementation and roll-out including a 5 year and a 9 year technology investment programme.  <\/p>  <p>  The Electronic Health Record (EHR) has 4 main elements - the Shared Care Record, the Community &amp;amp; Primary Care EHR, the Acute Operational EHR and the EHR integration suite.  The HSE appointed a programme manager to oversee the implementation of the Electronic Health Record in May 2017.  The next phase of the EHR programme is to develop detailed business cases for each of the components including specification of requirements, procurement documentation and support during the procurement process.  The HSE sought and received conditional sanction from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure to procure additional services to further develop the business case in preparation for submission for permission to tender.  Tenders sanctioned are for the delivery of support in the following areas:<\/p>  <p>  1. programme office, <\/p>  <p>  2. acute EHR, <\/p>  <p>  3. community EHR and <\/p>  <p>  4. Shared Care Record and Integration.  <\/p>  <p>  The tender documents were published in August and the tender process closed mid-September.  To date, one contract for this work has been awarded for the acute hospital EHR in view of the requirements for the National Children's Hospital.  In the case of the other two lots, a re-tendering exercise is underway.  The outputs from this work will allow greater clarity on the scope of the individual components for what is being procured and the detailed costings for each of the areas that will make up the electronic health care record.  Only when this detailed work is completed can the procurement process be considered for submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and prioritisation assigned to the work.  The work in relation to EHR will continue and feed into the implementation response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report being prepared by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  ICT Capital allocation in the HSE has grown from a low base in 2012 of &euro;22m to &euro;55m in 2017.  The Government has committed to increase ICT capital spending over the next four years for the HSE with an indicative capital allocation of &euro;60m in 2018, &euro;85m in 2019, &euro;100m in 2020 and &euro;120m in 2021 to support eHealth, in the context of the Mid-Term Capital Review.  Provision of revenue funding to support ICT has also increased in recent years and  sanction for 49 additional posts was granted in 2016.  For a programme of this scale and scope, realistic timescales and funding options are important to ensure that the adoption of both the technology and the business change required by front line staff can be absorbed and managed in a coherent way. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300086#WRJ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Consultant Contracts","counter":461,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300086#WRJ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":462,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[49811\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300086#WRJ02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the systems in place for the oversight of the hospital consultant contracts; the accountability structures which exist to ensure compliance with this contract; and if he is satisfied that this operates properly.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":463,"content":"<p>Arrangements concerning implementation and monitoring of Consultant Contract 2008 including the provisions in relation to private practice are matters for the HSE in the first instance.

Hospitals know their consultants and the work they deliver.  <\/p>  <p>  However it seems clear that the arrangements in place are not robust enough to deliver compliance in all circumstances and, as a result, some consultants are able to engage in private practice activity at levels that significantly exceed the permitted levels, or else they may engage in significant levels of off-site private practice, although their contract does not provide for this.

This extension followed an earlier comprehensive review by the European Food Safety Authority which concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and can be used safely without putting consumers or users at risk.  Both the EFSA and ECHA assessments included detailed consideration of a report produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organisation in relation to glyphosate.<\/p>  <p>  The RAC concluded in March 2017, in an opinion adopted with the full support of all members, that glyphosate does not warrant classification as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction.  This means that legally glyphosate does not meet any of the substance non-approval criteria specified in Regulation 1107\/2009.  A final decision on renewing the approval of glyphosate is due to be taken by 15 December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the conclusions of the risk and hazard assessments conducted by the European Food Safety Authority and the European Chemicals Agency, the Commission has prepared draft proposals for renewal of the approval of glyphosate.  These proposals have been discussed by Member State representatives at technical experts standing committee meetings but there has not been qualified majority support at these meetings for the draft renewal proposals that have been presented by the Commission.  This process will now move to a further meeting of member states, called an &lsquo;appeals committee&rsquo;, later this month.  This meeting will consider and vote on this proposal again at that time.<\/p>  <p>  In my view it is important that decisions such as this are based on the best scientific information that is available to us as policy makers.

The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The review is now complete and a full report setting out findings and recommendations has been prepared.\u00a0 I expect to be in a position to publish the outcome of the review shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300088#WRL06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payment Administration","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300089#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[49673\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300089#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to address the anomaly whereby the maximum HAP allocation is between 23% and 47% less than the average rental price in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a flexible and immediate housing support that is now available to all eligible households throughout the State.  There are currently over 29,800 households in receipt of HAP and\u00a0over 20,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Under HAP, a tenant sources their own accommodation, the tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended).  The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on the household size and the rental market within that area.\u00a0 HAP applicants are informed of the maximum rent limits for their local authority area; these elements of the scheme are stated in the HAP Tenant Information Booklet, on the dedicated HAP website, www.hap.ie, and local authority staff are expected to explain them to each HAP applicant. <\/p>  <p>  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.\u00a0 Greater enhanced support is also statutorily provided for in the\u00a0Dublin Region for homeless households.\u00a0 It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. Local authorities must also be cognisant of the provisions\u00a0 of the Residential Tenancies Act\u00a0when approving increases in HAP payments and advise tenants accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf.  There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord.  Where a qualified household sources accommodation outside the maximum rent limits, it is important to highlight the responsibility falling on the household as set out in their tenancy agreement.\u00a0 From available data,\u00a0at\u00a0the end of Q2\u00a02017, and excluding the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin Region, 12.6% of HAP households nationally were benefiting from the flexibility to exceed the rent limits.  In the Kerry local authority area,\u00a0 27 of the 194 households supported by HAP at that point, or\u00a013.9% of households, were benefiting from the flexibility to exceed the rent limits. \u00a0The average level of discretion being provided to those households was 13.4% in excess of the rent limits.<\/p>  <p>  The data available to my Department indicates that the current rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits, continues to provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  I am satisfied with how the HAP scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300089#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":605,"content":"<p>Question No. 223 answered with Question No. 221.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing","counter":606,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300089#WRM00600"},{"type":"question","counter":607,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[49710\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300089#WRM00700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1358 of 7 November 2017, the criteria used to classify voids.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":608,"content":"<p>Vacant social houses are those that are in need of far greater levels of repair in order to bring them up to a lettable, energy efficient condition\u00a0and are vacant pending that work.\u00a0 The funding criteria involved are listed in the Table.<table><tr><th>Energy Efficient Measures -50% ERDF Co Funded<\/th><th>Max Grant<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>300mm Attic Insulation<\/td><td>&euro;500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavity Wall Insulation or Dryling Wall<\/td><td>&euro;1,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>External Wall Insulation in lieu of cavity wall insulation or dry lining Terrace\/End Terrace<\/td><td>Terrace &euro;4,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>End Tec &euro;7,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Window &amp;amp; External Door Replacement<\/td><td>&euro;4,750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Replacement Boiler or Installation of Renewable Heating System with fully Integrated Heating   Controls with exception for solid fuelled central heating appliances.<\/td><td>&euro;1,750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Replacement Radiators and Pipework<\/td><td>&euro;750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Installation of Room Space Heating Stove<\/td><td>&euro;1,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td>Terrace &euro;14,250<br \/><br \/>End Tec  &euro;17,250<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ancillary Measures if required<\/td><td>Max Grant<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Installation of Kitchen<\/td><td>&euro;1,200<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Installation of Bathroom<\/td><td>&euro;1,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rewiring of Smoke Alarm<\/td><td>&euro;2,300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Plumbing<\/td><td>&euro;800<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Internal Joinery<\/td><td>&euro;800<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Internal Painting<\/td><td>&euro;1,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>External Painting<\/td><td>&euro;1,100<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gutter Downpipes\/Foul Water Systems<\/td><td>&euro;500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wheel Chair Access<\/td><td>&euro;500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>External Works Upgrade<\/td><td>&euro;800<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waste   Disposal<\/td><td>&euro;250<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Other   Necessary Works not specified Above.<\/td><td>&euro;2,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total <\/td><td>&euro;12,750<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300089#WRM00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seaweed Harvesting Licences","counter":609,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300089#WRM00900"},{"type":"question","counter":610,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[49739\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112300089#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the position regarding the licensing of mechanical harvesting of seaweed and kelp in the Bantry Bay area; and the policy in respect of mechanical harvesting of these resources by private companies.","asker":"1367","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":611,"content":"<p>The application to harvest seaweed in Bantry Bay was originally received in 2009, approved in principle in 2011 and the legal papers giving effect to the decision were completed in 2014.
