The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained.  Instead, the rates for people who had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. <\/p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are not proportionate with their level of contribution.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that, to revert to the previous bands from January 2018, this would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million each following year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is examining in depth various options that would provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension had the rate bands not been amended in 2012.  If there are equitable changes that target such relief to those who were particularly affected by anomalies under the yearly average system, particularly those with homemaking periods prior to the introduction of the Homemakers scheme, I will bring these options to the relevant Cabinet Committee before bringing any final proposals to Cabinet.<\/p>  <p>  Any change would, if of any substance, have a significant cost, and the resources would have to come from somewhere.  It is unlikely this could be done before Budget 2019, and this would reduce the funds available to increase rates of payment in that Budget for everyone, including widows and non-contributory pensioners, neither of whom would gain from any such measure.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended to introduce a total contributions approach for new pensioners from 2020.  This will make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  It will also have significant homemakers provisions that will assist those pensioners who spent significant periods caring for their children, or adults with a caring need.  <\/p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.  The reforms that are planned will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900068#WRA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":26,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 41 to 43, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":27,"content":"<p>Questions No. 44 and 45 answered with Question No. 40.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900068#WRA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[50588\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900068#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she has satisfied herself that the public service identity data her Department as data controller provides to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as data processor, is processed with appropriate security and data protection safeguards.

Firstly, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Secondly, the State pension contributory, which is not means-tested, is paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  Accordingly, it is important to ensure those qualifying for that pension have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.    The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension. <\/p>  <p>  Backdating it in respect of periods before its introduction in 1994 is estimated to cost &euro;290 million per year, and this figure would rise annually and at a faster rate than the overall cost of State pensions. <\/p>  <p>  It is clear that this is a very substantial sum, which would not be affordable without very significant cut-backs in other areas.  Therefore, a change where everyone affected by the 1994 cut-off point for the Homemakers scheme would receive a maximum rate pension, is not a feasible option at the present time. <\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate. <\/p>  <p>  I plan to introduce a total contributions approach to the calculation of the State Pension (Contributory) to replace the yearly average approach from around 2020.  The position of homemakers will be carefully considered in the context of that reform. <\/p>  <p>  Separately, I have committed in this House to ask my officials to carefully examine approaches that might assist some women in the situation you refer to, particularly if they were impacted upon by the rate-band changes in 2012.  When they report to me, I will consider the options available, and bring the matter to cabinet committee for consideration and thereafter to Government for approval. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900068#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foster Care Policy","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900068#WRA03050"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[50592\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900068#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will review the position of foster parents that are in receipt of homemaker credits but can only qualify for this while foster children are under 12 years of age in view of the fact that their responsibilities continue after 12 years of age; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.

The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained. Instead, the rates for people who both had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. <\/p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are better than proportionate with their level of contribution.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension, which compares favourably with contributory pensions in other EEU countries.<\/p>  <p>  On the matter of differing criteria for people who retired before and after this change was made, this is the norm, both in Ireland and in other countries, when pension systems are reformed in a way to make them more sustainable.  If it were not the case, either (a) existing pensioners would be subject to actual reductions in their incomes, in some cases several years after reaching pension age, or (b) no reforms which made savings could ever be made, as people would always be subject to the rules in place when older pensioners had reached pension age.  <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is examining in depth various options that would provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension, had the ratebands not been amended in 2012. If there are equitable changes that target such relief to those who were affected by the yearly average system, particularly those who had homemaking periods prior to the introduction of the Homemakers scheme, I will present the possible solution(s) to cabinet committee to consider how these might be financed and thereafter I will bring to Government for approval. <\/p>  <p>  It is intended to introduce a total contributions approach for new pensioners from 2020.

The most recent data show that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 6.2% by mid-2017.  Numbers at work have increased from 1.836 million in Q2 2012 to 2.063 million in Q2 2017, an increase of 227,000 persons.  Within the South East region, which includes Wexford, unemployment has fallen from 19.0% to 8.1% over the same period, and numbers in employment have increased by 29,000 to 214,900.While data from the QNHS are not available at the county level, trends in the Live Register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment.    Overall, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by almost 42% in the 5 years to October 2017, close to the reduction of 44% nationally.  In the year to October 2017, the Live Register in Wexford has fallen by 1741 people, or almost 14%, again closely in line with the national trend.<\/p>  <p>  Regional QNHS data show increases in employment in the high technology sectors in the South East.  Employment in the information and communications sector grew by 50% in the five years up to Q4 2016 compared to 13% nationally.  Likewise the professional, scientific and technical activities sector 90%, compared to 19% nationally. <\/p>  <p>  These figures indicate that the county has shared in the overall national recovery both in terms of unemployment and the level and quality of employment. <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle unemployment since 2012 is twofold.  First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs.

Under this policy, the employment service and activation supports provided by my Department are heavily concentrated on the areas of highest unemployment, including those in Wexford.<\/p>  <p>  To date, as I have said, these policies have been effective in reducing unemployment, both nationally and in Wexford.

Following the publication my Department undertook nationwide consultation workshops with key Community Employment (CE) scheme stakeholders during May and early June. The consultation was very positive and following the workshops new changes to CE conditions were implemented from 3rd July 2017. The main purpose of these changes is to broaden the availability of CE to a greater number of people on the live register and to standardise other conditions around the length of time a person can participate on the programme.These changes include reducing the general qualifying age for CE, for those on the live register, from 25 to 21 years. It addition it is now easier for previous participants, who have exhausted their CE entitlement, to requalify as participation prior to the year 2007 is disregarded. From July all participants between 21 and 55 years are entitled to one year on the programme and this can be extended by up to 2 more years if they are engaged in a recognised training or education award that is helping them progress towards employment. Furthermore all CE participants age 55 and over can now avail of 3 consecutive years on a CE scheme. There is an overall lifetime limit of 6 years from 2007 (or 7 years if on a disability payment) on CE. <\/p><p>The roll-out of the &lsquo;two strand approach&rsquo; of activation and social inclusion in terms of how places are categorised is also being progressed. This approach recognised that not all CE places are the same &ndash; some places are providing an opportunity for those who are very distant from the labour market and but interested in working and delivering services in their local community. <\/p><p>Other places are more directly related to employment opportunities with participants achieving a higher level of award and more labour market relevant work experience. The target progression rate for activation places is set at 50%, given their closer links to job opportunities, while the target progression rate for social inclusion places is set at 20%. In terms of measuring the performance of CE schemes in terms of the progression of participants from both activation and social inclusion places regard for local labour market conditions and the training and education opportunities available. <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy  .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900069#WRB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defined Benefit Pension Schemes","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900069#WRB02450"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[50576\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900069#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when proposals on defined benefits schemes for the social welfare pensions and civil registration Bill will be published and the Bill advanced having been first published in May 2017.","asker":"1370","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>The General Scheme of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017, which was published in May, contained a number of key measures to respond to the ongoing difficulties in defined benefit schemes and to increase protections for members.

It provided for an increase in the age for qualification for the State Pension from 66 years to 67 years from 2021, and a further increase to 68 years from 2028. It also discontinued the State Pension (transition) for new claimants with effect from 1 January 2014. As the State Pension (transition) could only be paid if the recipient had retired, and given such a criterion does not apply to the State pension (contributory), this removed a significant disincentive to those who did not wish to retire at State pension age. The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for the terms and conditions of employment and pensions of public servants, including the age at which they may be required to retire.

The objective of this reform plan will be to provide for a fit for purpose pension system for the coming decades.  Perhaps the most fundamental reform contained within the plan will be confirmation of the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop and introduce a new automatic enrolment supplementary retirement savings system for employees without pensions coverage.  The rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland is 47% of the working population and this reduces to 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  Without reform, it is evident that there will not be the increase in savings necessary to ensure that many current workers avoid significant reductions in their living standards at retirement.   Automatic enrolment will see a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation for retirement.

ICS goes a long way to meet the concerns on transparency, legitimacy and public interests that had arisen under ISDS.<\/p>  <p>  The ICS system is composed of a first instance tribunal and an appeal mechanism based on clearly defined rules and operating on similar principles to the WTO Appellate Body, with qualified judges and transparent proceedings. The ability of investors to take a case before the Tribunal is precisely defined and limited to cases such as targeted discrimination on the base of gender, race or religion, nationality, expropriation without compensation, or denial of justice. Forum&ndash;shopping (i.e. seeking to select from a number of different options the option perceived to most likely offer the most favourable outcome) will not be possible. Claims deemed to be frivolous will be dismissed quickly, and multiple and parallel proceedings will be avoided.<\/p>  <p>  The implications of the ICS for Ireland are viewed as positive as they bring greater clarity to Irish business, especially SMEs, on the modalities of an open and transparent dispute resolution system as well as confirming that a State can never be forced to change legislation, only to pay fair compensation in cases where the investor is deemed to have been treated unfairly.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the European Commission is to establish a Multilateral Investment Court, modelled on arbitrator panels currently operating under the WTO, and other Investment Tribunals.  It will build on the EU's approach on its bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and be a major departure from the system of investor-to-State dispute settlement (ISDS) based on ad hoc commercial arbitration.  The recently concluded EU-Canada trade agreement - CETA - and the EU-Vietnam trade agreement both contain a reference to the establishment of a permanent multilateral investment court. Work continues at EU level on this matter.  <\/p>  <p>  In the context of a possible EU-UK Free Trade Agreement, which is the stated objective of the UK Government, it is far too early in the Brexit negotiation process to know what the precise trading relationship will be.

As a result, Enterprise Ireland knows, in detail, the level of their clients&rsquo; exposure to Brexit associated risks.    <\/p>  <p>  In March 2017 EI published its international events programme for 2017 to support Irish exporters which lists 145 events scheduled in Ireland and overseas to include 46 international trade visits with focus on market diversification into Eurozone and North America. Enterprise Ireland has also launched a &lsquo;Global Ambition Campaign&rsquo; which is a communications campaign to promote Irish companies and their products and services to international buyers. Enterprise Ireland also launched a new strategy to increase exports to the Eurozone by 50 per cent (&euro;2 billion) by 2020 &ndash; this is a key response to any potential barriers which may adversely impact trade with the UK.    <\/p>  <p>  Also in March, 2017, EI&rsquo;s 'PrepareforBrexit' communications campaign featuring the &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo; (on www.prepareforbrexit.ie) was launched.

It is also the case that the ODCE cannot be sure of the outcome of cases in terms of costs orders and it cannot anticipate the scale of costs that other parties may seek.

These are farmers who are under 35 years of age and have (or will have within a specified period following the receipt of the farm land) specified relevant educational qualifications (known as the &lsquo;green cert&rsquo;). \u00a0 A &lsquo;young trained farmer&rsquo; is required to retain ownership of the farm land for a period of five years following the transfer and to actively farm the land during this period.  Section 81AA Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 provides for this relief.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a relief known as &lsquo;consanguinity relief&rsquo; applies in relation to transfers of farm land between certain blood relatives, including from parents to their children.  A reduced 1% rate of stamp duty applies subject to specified conditions. \u00a0The recipient of the farm land must actively farm the land for a period of at least six years or have (or will have within a specified period following the receipt of the farm land) specified relevant educational qualifications.  Alternatively, the farm land can be leased for at least six years to someone who satisfies either this active farming or educational qualification condition. <\/p>  <p>  Consanguinity relief currently applies where the person transferring the land is under 67 years of age.  There is no age limit on the recipient of the farm land.\u00a0 However, Finance Bill 2017 contains measures to extend this relief for a further three years until 31 December 2020 and to remove the age limit of 67 years.  Both of these measures will come into effect on the enactment of the Finance Bill which I expect to happen around the end of December. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that a recipient of farm land could potentially avail of &lsquo;agricultural relief&rsquo; in relation to capital acquisitions tax.  The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable value of agricultural property that is gifted or inherited.  Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for this relief. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for the relief, the recipient of the gift or inheritance (the 'beneficiary') must first qualify as a 'farmer' for the purpose of section 89 CATCA 2003.  This means that a beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise at least 80% by gross market value of the beneficiary's total property at a particular date. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a beneficiary, or a lessee where the beneficiary leases the agricultural land, must actually farm the land on a commercial basis for a period of at least six years following the gift or inheritance.  The relevance of a &lsquo;green cert&rsquo; is that the holder of such a certificate, while required to actually farm the land, is not subject to the requirement that he or she spends at least 50% of his or her normal working time doing this.<\/p>  <p>  The relationship between the person who provides the gift (i.e. the disponer) and the beneficiary determines the maximum tax-free threshold known as the &lsquo;Group threshold&rsquo; below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.  Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on the current benefit.  A son or a daughter is entitled to the Group A tax-free threshold of &euro;310,000 for the purposes of computing the tax payable on the taxable value of any gift of agricultural property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900071#WRD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Data","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900071#WRD03200"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[50847\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900071#WRD03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of appeals received and processed by the Revenue Commissioners in each of the past five years from 2012 to 2016.","asker":"1306","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>The Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) was established and new procedures for making, processing, adjudicating and determining appeals came into effect on 21 March 2016.

HBFI will provide lending on commercial, market-equivalent terms and conditions.  This approach would be akin to a bank or private equity investor.

Human rights protections form a vital part of the institutional underpinning for the peace settlement founded on the Good Friday Agreement and serve to build and maintain confidence for communities across Northern Ireland.  The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland - including through the incorporation into law of the European Convention on Human Rights - is one of the key principles of the Agreement, as set out in the chapter on Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity.  It is important to be clear that the European Convention on Human Rights is separate and distinct to the European Union.  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU has no impact on its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Even after the UK leaves the EU, there remains a continuing obligation on the British Government to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.  In this regard, it is welcome that the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper on legislating for withdrawal from the EU that was published in March clarified that it has no plans to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p>In February, as part of the All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit, the Government convened a Sectoral Dialogue on Human Rights under the Good Friday Agreement to hear the views of civil society, North and South, on the possible implications of Brexit for this pivotal chapter of the Agreement.  This was a very valuable exchange and a number of key themes emerged, which have been communicated publicly, which are informing the Government&rsquo;s approach in this area, including as set out in the comprehensive document, <i>Ireland and the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union<\/i>, published by the Government on 2 May. <\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s programme of engagement with EU partners has ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns have been fully understood by the EU27 and have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position for the Article 50 negotiations with the UK.  In this regard, the Guiding Principles for the dialogue on Ireland\/Northern Ireland, which were published by the European Commission Article 50 Task Force in September, confirm that European Union law and practice has provided a supporting framework in Northern Ireland and across the island for the Good Friday Agreement provisions on Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity.  They state that the Good Friday Agreement requires equivalent standards of protection of rights in Ireland and Northern Ireland and that the United Kingdom should ensure that no diminution of rights is caused by the United Kingdom&rsquo;s departure from the European Union, including in the area of protection against forms of discrimination currently enshrined in Union law.  This position has been conveyed by the European Commission Task Force to the UK in the Article 50 negotiations in the High Level Dialogue on Ireland and Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously our responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles, including in the area of human rights.  The Government will continue to pursue, with our EU partners, an outcome to the Article 50 process that protects our headline priorities and Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests, including to ensure protection of and respect for the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900075#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid Data","counter":369,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900075#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":370,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[50951\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900075#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the cost of reaching the 0.7% ODA and GNP target from its current base of approximately 0.3% in incremental steps, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":371,"content":"<p>The Government is strongly committed to Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development co-operation programme and to its place at the heart of our foreign policy.

These reforms include the drive towards a medium term target of 20% civilians by 2021 to boost the management capacity of the organisation and to free up Garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties, and also the phased implementation of the Divisional model of policing to enable resources to be deployed more efficiently to prevent and detect crime.<\/p><p><b>Garda Reserve Strength 31 October 2017<\/b><table><tr><th>Division<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>DMR South Central <\/td><td>37<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR North Central<\/td><td>37<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR North <\/td><td>45<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR East<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR South<\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR West<\/td><td>26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny\/Carlow<\/td><td>26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td>44<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork North<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork West <\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan\/Monaghan<\/td><td>11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo\/Leitrim<\/td><td>18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon\/Longford<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare <\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois\/Offaly<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>603<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900075#WRH03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Civilian Staff Data","counter":391,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900075#WRH03300"},{"type":"question","counter":392,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[51304\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900075#WRH03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of civilian members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as of 24 November 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":393,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[50725\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900075#WRH03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of civilians in the Garda workforce in each Garda division on 31 October 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":394,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 176 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that, as of the 31 October 2017, the latest date for which numbers are readily available, there were 2,151 full time civilian staff members working throughout the organisation carrying out senior management, administrative and technical roles.<b><\/b>I am further informed that the attached table details the number of civilian staff currently deployed in each Garda Division as of that date.  The balance of civilian staff are attached to Garda Headquarters and carryout various roles including in HR, Finance,  ICT, as well as the Garda College.  <\/p><p>As part of its Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government has agreed an overall vision for a Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  The projected 4,000 civilians will effectively double the current figure and represents a medium-term target of a Garda organisation 20% comprised of civilians.  The 20% target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing roles where their skills can be used to best effect with the backfilling of these roles by suitably qualified civilians where necessary. <\/p><p>So far this year some 150 additional civilians have been recruited to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This has allowed the filling of critical skills and capacity gaps across the organisation and will facilitate the redeployment of the first batch of 43 Garda&iacute;. By quarter 1 next year the Commissioner projects that some 160 Garda&iacute; will have been redeployed.  This is a welcome start but as illustrated by the Garda Inspectorate Report &quot;Changing Policing in Ireland&quot; there is considerable scope for redeployment to operational policing.  The Inspectorate Report identified some 1,500 posts that could be suitable.  Furthermore Garda management completed an organisation deployment survey earlier this year which identifies some 2,000 posts for further examination in this regard.  It will take a determined effort by Garda management over the next number of years to achieve redeployments on this scale but I can assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to the target of 20% and to ensuring that the unprecedented investment in the workforce and other resources for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are used to optimum effect to provide effective policing services across the country. <\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that a number civilians have been appointed to newly created senior leadership posts to support the major reform programme underway including an Executive Director for Strategy and Transformation and an Executive Director for Legal And Compliance.  A competition is underway for another critical senior post, that of Chief Data Officer.  This transformation of the composition of the senior team will assist in bring diverse perspectives and management skills to the top levels in the organisation.<\/p><p>I am pleased to say that I have secured funding for the recruitment of up to a further 500 civilians in Budget 2018 to support the continuation of this major programme of civilianisation.<b><\/b><\/p><p><b>Garda Civilian Strength 31 October 2017<\/b><table><tr><th>Division<\/th><th>2017<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>DMR   South Central<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR   North Central<\/td><td>41<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR   North<\/td><td>38<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR   East<\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR   South<\/td><td>34<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR   West<\/td><td>50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>33<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>40<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny\/Carlow<\/td><td>31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork   City<\/td><td>67<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork   North<\/td><td>29<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork   West<\/td><td>24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>37<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>33<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan\/Monaghan<\/td><td>37<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo\/Leitrim<\/td><td>29<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>49<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon\/Longford<\/td><td>29<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois\/Offaly<\/td><td>24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>924<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900075#WRH03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900075#WRH03700"},{"type":"question","counter":396,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[50724\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900075#WRH03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; in each Garda division on 31 October 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":397,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p>  <p>  As the\u00a0Deputy will be aware the District referred to\u00a0is\u00a0part of\u00a0the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) East Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that on the 31 October 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the\u00a0D.M.R. East Division\u00a0was 376 of which\u00a0201 were assigned to the Dun Laoghaire District. There are also\u00a010 Garda Reserves and\u00a022 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, the Armed Response Unit\u00a0and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide,\u00a057 of whom have been assigned to the\u00a0D.M.R. East Division.  In addition, another\u00a0200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest\u00a0next month\u00a0which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers\u00a0is tangible progress on achieving\u00a0this Government&rsquo;s vision of\u00a0an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to\u00a0fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.\u00a0There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0 We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the\u00a0D.M.R.

However, this is partly attributable to a substantial number of Reserves joining the Garda&iacute; as full-time members in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  It is also attributable to the need for Garda management and the Public Appointments Service to prioritise the running of recruitment campaigns for Garda trainees over those for Reserves. I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that this was the right call to make in the circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Fortunately, with Garda recruitment up and running successfully it was possible to enable a recruitment campaign for the Garda to get underway in March. It attracted approximately 2,400 applicants of whom around 1,600 were successful following assessment. To date approximately 500 applicants have been referred on to the Garda Appointment Office from the Public Appointment Service for vetting and medical. I am advised that applicants from this campaign will enter training in early 2018. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware service in the Garda Reserve is voluntary and unpaid. However, an allowance is payable to Reserve members who complete a minimum of 208 hours duty annually as a contribution towards expenses incurred in performing their duties. The allowance is currently set at &euro;1,000 per annum. As this is a fixed allowance it does not change year to year. In addition, the uniform cost per Reserve member is in the region of &euro;1,300. <\/p>  <p>  Reserves are also reimbursed for expenses incurred while attending court in respect of their service as a Reserve.<\/p>  <p>  Thus, the cost of recruiting new reserve is some &euro;2,300 for the first year and &euro;1,000 per annum thereafter assuming completion of the hours required. It is a relatively straightforward calculation thereafter to calculate the costs involved for the numbers set out in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions.<\/p>  <p>  As far as increasing the reserve from 607 to 2,500, the cost would be some &euro;4.35 million (i.e. 1,893 x &euro;2,300).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900078#WRL04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electronic Tagging","counter":518,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900079#WRN00300"},{"type":"question","counter":519,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[51078\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900079#WRN00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons in custody that are electronically monitored while on temporary release in each of the years 2013 to 2016 and to date in 2017; the number of days each person was on release while electronically monitored; the cost per prisoner per day; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":520,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[51079\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900079#WRN00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the cost of providing electronic tagging for an additional 500 prisoners per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":521,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[51080\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900079#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the cost of providing electronic tagging for an additional 1,000 prisoners per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":522,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[51081\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900079#WRN00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the cost of providing electronic tagging for an additional 1,500 prisoners per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":523,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[51082\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900079#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the cost of providing electronic tagging for an additional 2,000 prisoners per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":524,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 to 254, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>I am to advise the Deputy that Part\u00a010 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for the introduction of electronic monitoring.<\/p><p>Following a competitive tender in 2014, a company was awarded the contract for the supply of electronic monitoring of prisoners for the Irish Prison\u00a0Service.<\/p><p>I am advised by The Irish Prison Service that\u00a0electronic monitoring\u00a0is used to monitor some prisoners who have been granted\u00a0Temporary Release including\u00a0for the purpose of the Community Return\/Support Scheme.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster (Versatis) is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults. It was reimbursed in the community drugs schemes from 2010. The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. Currently, over 25,000 patients receive this item. <\/p>  <p>  An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of Versatis highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p>  <p>  Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for Versatis from 1 September 2017. This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p>  <p>  Under the protocol, all patients who receive antivirals for shingles are automatically approved for Versatis for three months. No action is required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy is notified of his or her approval status.<\/p>  <p>  All patients who currently use Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer get Versatis under the community drugs schemes. The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. <\/p>  <p>  In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications.

Latest data from September 2017 shows that the public\/private mix at a system level stands at 82% public for elective in-patient work and at almost 86% for day-case work.  This is consistent with the typical 80\/20 split provided for in the consultant contract.  The framework for the regulation of a consultant's private practice is contained in Section 20 of Consultant Contract 2008.  It provides that the public to private practice ratio is to be implemented through the Clinical Directorate structure.

Under the new Framework, if two practice units are providing general practitioner services in the same qualifying area, both practices may qualify for a modified allowance of &euro;10,000. GPs holding a permanent GMS contract who received the Rural Practice Allowance of &euro;16,216.07 immediately prior to the introduction of the new Regulations who do not meet the new qualifying criteria continue to receive the payment on a personal basis, provided they retain their contractual commitment to the remote rural area. <\/p>  <p>  As at 27 November 2017, there are 249 practice units in receipt of rural supports under the RPSF. 175 practices receive the financial allowance of &euro;20,000 and 18 practices receive the modified allowance of &euro;10,000. The full year cost of increasing the existing allowance to &euro;25,000 and the corresponding modified allowance to &euro;12,500 for these practices would amount to approximately &euro;920,000. It must be emphasised that this estimate does not take account of any future increase in the number of qualifying practices.

The Officeis overseeing a programme of patient safety measures including progressing a programme of legislation.  The General Scheme of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill approved by Government in November 2015 provides for the extension of the Health Information and Quality Authority&rsquo;s (HIQA&rsquo;s) remit to the private sector, mandatory external reporting of Serious Reportable Events and measures to promote clinical audit.  The Bill has undergone pre-legislative scrutiny (PLS) with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and the PLS Report is currently being considered by the Department. The Patient Safety Licencing Bill will introduce a regulatory regime for all hospitals as well as certain designated high risk activities.

Warmth and Wellbeing Pilot Scheme commended\u00a0in 2016. It is funded by my\u00a0Department\u00a0and is a joint policy initiative with the Department of Health.\u00a0 It\u00a0is operated by SEAI and the HSE.  The aim of the pilot is to provide deep energy efficiency interventions to people living with chronic respiratory conditions who are in or at risk of energy poverty.  By making their homes warmer, more comfortable and cheaper to run, it is hoped that this will improve their health and wellbeing.  The pilot scheme is currently operating in Dublin 8, 10, 12, 22 or 24.  In 2016 spend of &euro;0.5m helped upgrade 72 homes.  To date in 2017 spend of &euro;2.6m has upgraded 196 homes.  I expect that\u00a0upgrades to 500 homes will have been completed by end year. <\/p><p>The Better Energy Community scheme cut across a variety of sectors, so it is not possible to give a strict breakdown of the scheme according to individual sectors.  Projects can also involve participants from more than one county.  Details of Better Energy Communities projects in 2016 and to date in 2017, their spend and their county location are set out in the following table. <\/p><p>The Deep Retrofit Pilot scheme commenced\u00a0operation in 2017.  The scheme\u00a0aims to help us understand how best we can persuade people to invest in the deep retrofit of their homes and what solutions we need to put in place to make it easy for them to do so.  To be eligible for support, a home must be upgraded to at least an A3 standard on the Building Energy Rating scale and the heating system must be upgraded to a renewable energy alternative.<table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>No.\u00a0of homes<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Co.

I do not have\u00a0statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments\u00a0in particular locations. The ComReg\u00a0consumer helpline is accessible at consumerline@comreg.ie and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator.    Notwithstanding ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers - including in Counties Cavan and Monaghan - where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. In July 2016, I\u00a0established the Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention. <\/p>  <p>  The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce the December 2016 report available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contains 40 actions to alleviate\u00a0some of the deficits. The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This includes ComReg, who attend as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in their role as the independent Regulator. Three meetings of the Implementation Group have been held so far - on 8 March, 5 July and 22 November. <\/p>  <p>  This week I published the third Taskforce Quarterly Progress Report, which demonstrates that good progress has been made in delivering the actions.\u00a0These reports show continuing progress and also the sustained level of engagement between actions owners and industry. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This engagement was clear in October at first National Stakeholder Forum in Athlone, which I hosted with Minister Kyne.\u00a0 It arose from the Taskforce&rsquo;s recognition that, given the rapid technological change and the emergence of new equipment and solutions to deliver telecommunications services, stakeholders needed an opportunity to raise concerns on impediments to the rollout of services. Issues impacting on rollout were discussed at the Forum, and there were also some new recommended actions\u00a0for the Taskforce to help improve services to consumers and in preparing for roll-out of the\u00a0National Broadband Plan\u00a0network, once contracts are in place. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Taskforce&rsquo;s achievements to date include:<\/p>  <p>  - Funding of all local authorities to assign a Broadband Officer; \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Close cooperation with local authorities to develop local digital strategies, including Government working closely with local authorities to identify approximately 320 high speed Strategic Community Access Hubs\u00a0to be connected at an early juncture after award of the NBP contract;<\/p>  <p>  - ComReg&rsquo;s development of a testing regime to check mobile handset performance which will inform consumers in choosing\u00a0products and network services. ComReg\u00a0will also develop a new network coverage map. <\/p>  <p>  - Most local authorities applying waivers in respect of development contributions for telecoms development. <\/p>  <p>  - Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has constructed 80km of ducting on the M7\/M8 corridor and 14km on the N25 in Cork, with more following in the coming months to help expedite infrastructure roll-out. TII is also reviewing the cost of duct access for telecoms. <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage. <\/p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas such as Counties Cavan and Monaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900087#WRV02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":939,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900087#WRV02800"},{"type":"question","counter":940,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[51163\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900087#WRV02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to improve broadband telecommunications service throughout County Cavan; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that households and many small enterprises have concerns regarding the service that exists at present; if the necessary investment programme will be undertaken to bring this broadband service up to a proper standard; the improvements which can be expected in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":941,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[51164\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900087#WRV03000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to improve broadband telecommunications service throughout County Monaghan; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that households and many small enterprises have concerns regarding the service that exists; if the necessary investment programme will be undertaken to bring this broadband service up to a proper standard; the improvements which can be expected in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":942,"content":"<p>I propose to take Parliamentary Questions Nos. 409 and 410 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.\u00a0 The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector so that today over 65% of the 2.3m premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband and this is set to increase to 77% (1.8m premises) by the end of 2018 and to 90% (2.1m premises) by the end of 2020.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included\u00a0in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). <\/p>  <p>  The Map is colour coded and searchable by address\/eircode:<\/p>  <p>  - The \u00a0AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing \u00a0procurement process.<\/p>  <p>  - The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.<\/p>  <p>  - The Light BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to\u00a0300,000 premises\u00a0by the end of 2018 as part of an Agreement signed with me in April. <\/p>  <p>  There are\u00a0nearly 42,000 premises in Cavan.\u00a0Approximately 17,000\u00a0(40%) fall within the AMBER area and will be covered under the State led Intervention.

These are the published projections. <table><tr><th><\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2020<\/th><th>2025<\/th><th>2030<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Electric passenger cars (BEVs and PHEVs)<\/td><td>2020<\/td><td>20,000<\/td><td>250,000<\/td><td>800,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Electric light duty vehicles<\/td><td>152<\/td><td>5,000<\/td><td>12,500<\/td><td>23,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Electric heavy duty   vehicles<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Electric diesel   hybrid buses<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Full electric buses**<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>100<\/td><td>450<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Electric motorcycles<\/td><td>171<\/td><td>250<\/td><td>1000<\/td><td>5000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900088#WRW03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Obligation Data","counter":985,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900088#WRW04000"},{"type":"question","counter":986,"qnumday":426,"qnumall":"[51011\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900088#WRW04100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount of PSO subvention that has been paid to Bus &Eacute;ireann, Irish Rail, Dublin Bus, and Luas since 2011, by year and company.","asker":"1250","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":987,"content":"<p>Since\u00a02010 however there is no PSO\u00a0subvention paid directly by my Department to transport operators. \u00a0The award and subvention of PSO contracts now falls under the independent statutory remit of the National Transport Authority (NTA), which has direct responsibility for this area and\u00a0I have therefore forwarded the Deputy's Question to the NTA for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900088#WRW04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Road Network","counter":988,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900088#WRW04300"},{"type":"question","counter":989,"qnumday":427,"qnumall":"[51013\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900088#WRW04400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount that has been allocated to the regional and local roads grants scheme for 2017 and 2018.","asker":"1250","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":990,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[51025\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900088#WRW04500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount allocated for the maintenance of local roads in 2017 and 2018.","asker":"1250","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":991,"qnumday":440,"qnumall":"[51026\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900088#WRW04600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount allocated for the maintenance of regional roads in 2017 and 2018.","asker":"1250","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":992,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 427, 439 and 440 together.<\/p>  <p>  Each year the Department prepares and lodges in the D&aacute;il Library regional and local road grant allocation and end of year payment booklets.

The CSP works on a social-enterprise model which means that it does not fully fund contract holders but requires that they generate revenue by charging fees or raising funds.  All CSP recipients are obliged to meet these criteria.  These social enterprises also remain responsible for their own budgets and financial liabilities. <\/p>  <p>  The defining characteristic of CSP services is that they are set up to provide social and economic value and are managed as going concerns with business and revenue targets set within a defined business plan.  In order to assist sustainability, all CSP service providers should strive for a situation where at least 30% of annual turnover is from traded income, and where the CSP grant is not more than 50% of annual turnover.  While this may not be achievable in the short-term for some service providers, it is something to focus on in the medium to long-term and business plans should be orientated towards the achievement of these benchmarks in terms of sustainability.<\/p>  <p>  Services must generate sufficient traded income to be viable and sustainable entities.  Services that do not generate sufficient traded income are unlikely to be effective and risk closure and loss of services to their local areas.<\/p>  <p>  The organisation referred to by the Deputy completed a business plan during 2016 as part of the CSP contract cycle.  The business plan was submitted to Pobal, which operates CSP on behalf of my Department.  Pobal has a proven track record in the administration of public funds and extensive experience in assessing funding applications and business plans.<\/p>  <p>  Pobal assessed this plan under the five standard criteria used - capacity, sustainability, value-for-money, demonstration of need and strategic fit.  Significant areas for concern were found with a number of aspects of the service.  These included the following:<\/p>  <p>  -  Capacity: there was limited information provided within the plan and it failed to make a clear business case; <\/p>  <p>-  Sustainability: while there has been a substantial drop in traded income by the organisation, there are no significant plans outlined to address this in the business plan.  Traded income is below the recommended standard of 30% and CSP income is now well above the recommended standard of 50%.  The organisation has provided very little information on how its board is dealing with this situation and no specific income-generating plans have been committed to;<\/p>  <p>  -  Demonstration of need: the evidence of need provided is considered weak and of poor quality; and<\/p>  <p>  -  Strategic Fit: there is little evidence of alignment to the CSP or social enterprise model.  The organisation stated that &ldquo;It is not a feasible project to have a traded income to support staff&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of this assessment, Pobal recommended that the service should exit the CSP at the end of June 2018 and this recommendation was approved by my Department.  The organisation was notified of the outcome of this process on 22 November 2016.  Funding is approved for 18 months up to 30 June 2018 at a level of one manager and two full-time equivalent positions (FTEs), after which the service is due to exit the CSP.<\/p>  <p>  The organisation was notified that it could appeal this decision no later than 22 December 2016 with details on the appeals procedure provided.  The organisation did not pursue this avenue and the time period for accepting an appeal has passed.<\/p>  <p>  It is open to the organisation to submit a new expression of interest in re-joining CSP in the future, but I would urge them to work closely with their local Pobal representatives before doing so.  Any new proposal would need to meet the criteria for the CSP before being approved to go forward to business planning.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900091#WRZ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1120,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 480 and 481 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobs Initiative","counter":1121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900091#WRZ04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1122,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[50755\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900091#WRZ04700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to change the jobs initiative scheme; the reason persons working on the scheme are being asked to transfer from their existing contracts to one year contracts; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1123,"content":"<p>The Job Initiative (JI) scheme was launched by F&Aacute;S in 1996 and transferred to my  Department with effect from 1 January 2012.

The service commenced operations in mid-2015, and reached full State-wide delivery of the service in July 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Some 65,000 Clients commenced their engagement with the service between January 1st &amp;amp; Dec 31st 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the number of participants to find full time employment, it is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months: under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.  <\/p>  <p>  It will therefore take time to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period with the service) for complete and robust outcome data to be available.  The Department has, however, commenced publishing initial cohort reports on the performance of the service.  The last report can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website.  I can confirm that the next report will be published within the next two weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  The most recent cohort report published on the Department&rsquo;s website indicates that 19% of Jobseekers who engaged with JobPath between July 2015 and March 2016 entered full time employment (this was 36% above the weighted reference performance rate of 14%), 4% of participants entered part time employment and a further 3% entered Self-employment.  Overall 26% of JobPath participants within this period had an employment outcome.  In addition, this report also shows that compared to people who did not take part in the service, people who availed of the service were up to 34% more likely to find a job than those who did not.  It is important to note that the outcomes for each cohort are updated every time these reports are published, to take account of outcomes that have been validated since the last publication date.  <\/p>  <p>  While the indications are positive, these initial reports are subject to review and are based on a small sample size and should be treated with caution.  <\/p>  <p>  An in-depth evaluation of the JobPath strand of the Department&rsquo;s activation service has commenced data gathering.  Completion of the evaluation is provisionally scheduled for the end of Quarter 3, 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  JobPath is a payment by results model and all set-up and day-to-day operational costs are borne by the companies.  The companies are paid on the basis of performance and with the exception of the initial registration fee; payments are made only when a client has achieved sustained employment.  The registration fee may be claimed once a jobseeker has developed a Personal Progression Plan (PPP).  Job Sustainment Fees (JSF) are payable for each 13 week period of sustained employment, up to a maximum of 52 weeks (i.e. 4 payments).  <\/p>  <p>  The overall cost of JobPath will be determined by the number of people who participate in the programme and the number who get sustainable jobs.  <\/p>  <p>  It is not intended to publish the details of payments to the JobPath companies as these are commercially sensitive.  The commercial sensitivity is specifically in relation to the release of information which has the potential to influence the pricing of future contracts providing a similar service, and thereby conferring commercial advantage on one bidder over another.  <\/p>  <p>  The total amount paid in fees to the two companies in 2016 was &euro;25.2m.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900092#WRAA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Communications","counter":1134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900092#WRAA01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1135,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[50770\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900092#WRAA01400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if data transmitted between her Department's central server and local branch offices is transmitted via HTTPS or HTTP.","asker":"1259","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1136,"content":"<p>My Department is a major user of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and invests on an ongoing basis in securing the ICT technical infrastructure and the services and data used in support of our business.

These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.  <\/p><p>The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund (SIF) as at 31 December, 2015, which I published on the 18<sup>th<\/sup>October 2017.  The Review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.  <\/p><p>The Review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure.  In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers will be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the Actuarial Review.  <\/p><p>As part of the Review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.  <\/p><p>The Review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  <\/p><p>It should be noted that the projected expenditure on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit assume the same incidence rate as prevail in the employed (PRSI Class A) population.  The following table gives a breakdown of the costs of the individual benefits.  <\/p><p><b>Projected costs of extending Invalidity, Jobseekers Benefit, Carer&rsquo;s Benefits<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Invalidity<\/th><th>Illness<\/th><th>Jobseeker&rsquo;s<\/th><th>Carer&rsquo;s<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2015 (act)<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>45<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>118<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2019<\/td><td>59<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>58<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>173<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2020<\/td><td>87<\/td><td>72<\/td><td>60<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>223<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2021<\/td><td>125<\/td><td>88<\/td><td>63<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>281<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2022<\/td><td>152<\/td><td>94<\/td><td>67<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>317<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2023<\/td><td>176<\/td><td>99<\/td><td>71<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>351<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2024<\/td><td>198<\/td><td>104<\/td><td>75<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>382<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2025<\/td><td>218<\/td><td>108<\/td><td>81<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>413<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The Review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the Exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.  <\/p><p>This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension (contributory).  <\/p><p>The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.  <\/p><p>The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the Social Insurance Fund in the years ahead including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.

Recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2017 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of almost &euro;83 million on the farm assist scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 fully reversed the previous cuts to the Farm Assist means test.  The changes included that 70% of farm income is now be assessed as means, down from 100% being assessed as means (which is equivalent to a 30% income disregard) and an additional annual means disregard of &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and subsequent children.  <\/p>  <p>  The farm assist means test is flexible so as to allow for significant income fluctuations from one year to the next.  It may also be noted that farm assist customers continue to receive more beneficial treatment than other self-employed persons as payments received under the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS), Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) or Special Area of Conservation (SAC) schemes are assessed separately from other farm income.  With regard to this income the first &euro;2,540 is disregarded, and then 50% of the balance and related expenses are disregarded - with the balance being assessed as means.  <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cost of changing the farm assist means testing rules in order that irrespective of the source of income the first &euro;3,000 would be disregarded and the balance would be means tested at 50% is approximately &euro;15 million for a full year.  This estimate is based on the existing number of recipients and current rates.  <\/p>  <p>  However, it is envisaged that there would be an inflow of new farm assist claims if these measures were introduced.  The Department cannot quantify the numbers involved and as such cannot calculate the associated additional costs.  Therefore, the estimated cost of &euro;15 million should be regarded as a minimum estimate.  <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provided for a &euro;5 per week increase in rate of payment for farm assist which will see the maximum rate increased from &euro;193 to &euro;198 per week from 26 March 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  Any changes to means assessment would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900092#WRAA05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Data","counter":1183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900093#WRBB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1184,"qnumday":503,"qnumall":"[51203\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900093#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of carer's allowance applications that are approved or refused on an initial application;

As such, the changes did not preclude any pensioner who would have qualified for a full State Pension (contributory) pre-2012 from qualifying for a full rate after September 2012.<\/p>  <p>  The current rate bands were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.   The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained.  Instead, the rates for people who both had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. <\/p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.

Firstly, by reversing the amendments made to the OFP scheme, this would likely result in a substantial cohort of lone parents that are currently not in receipt of a social welfare payment becoming eligible and therefore moving onto a social welfare payment.  As members of this cohort are not currently in receipt of any social welfare payment, the Department currently has no visibility of them and therefore, it would be impossible to estimate the numbers involved. <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, this proposal may incentivise some customers to move from alternative payments such as Jobseekers Allowance (JA), the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST) and the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) back onto the OFP. It would not be possible for the Department to estimate the magnitude of this flow between schemes. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, reversing the changes to the OFP would also increase the incidence of dual payments of OFP and the Family Income Supplement (FIS), which would lead to significant but unquantifiable reductions in FIS payments for some lone parents. <\/p>  <p>  These unknown factors are critical to providing a reliable costing.

Life expectancy at birth has increased significantly over the years &ndash; and is now at 78.4 years for men and 82.8 years for women.  This is very positive.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by roughly &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (although at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is anticipated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been a number of Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of over &euro;80 million, and this is expected to increase over time. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900094#WRCC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bereavement Grant","counter":1234,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900094#WRCC01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1235,"qnumday":526,"qnumall":"[51226\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900094#WRCC01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the full-year cost of reinstating the bereavement grant; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1236,"content":"<p>During the economic downturn, my Department protected primary social welfare rates and in recent years, as the economy recovered, the Government has concentrated resources in improving the core rates of payments, particularly for pensioners.  Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving and allowed my Department to protect other core social welfare payments such as the State pension. <\/p>  <p>  The number of bereavement grant claims in 2013 was 23,716, and this represented an increase of approximately 4% on 2012.  Based on a similar yearly increase each year since 2013, it is estimated that the number of bereavement grant claims that might arise in 2018, were the scheme to be re-introduced, would be in the region of 28,858, and the number would be expected to increase in future years.  Accordingly, if there were 28,858 such grants made in 2018, at a rate of &euro;850 each, the cost would be &euro;24.53 million.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to reinstate the Bereavement Grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s worth noting that there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900094#WRCC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1237,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 527  and 528 answered with Question No. 501.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Benefit","counter":1238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900094#WRCC01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1239,"qnumday":529,"qnumall":"[51229\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900094#WRCC02000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of increasing maternity benefit by one to six weeks respectively, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1240,"content":"<p>Maternity Benefit is paid by my Department and is based on payment of PRSI contributions while working.

In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants\u00a0is included, as\u00a0is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner\/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.<\/p><p>In order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, it is essential that an applicant&rsquo;s income is of a long-term and sustainable nature.

The Water Services Strategic Plan - A Plan for the Future of Water Services (WSSP), which was published in October 2015, set out strategic objectives for the delivery of water services for 25 years up to 2040.  The WSSP committed to the preparation of Business Plans by Irish Water to set out targets for delivery of efficiencies in operational and capital expenditure and performance targets consistent with the delivery of the objectives of the WSSP. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Water Business Plan - Transforming Water Services in Ireland to 2021 was published in late 2015.  It set the priorities for the utility to 2021 and underpins the transformation plan for the water sector to a single utility model.  The plan was considered by Government and was approved subject to budgetary and regulatory review.  The Water Services\u00a0Act 2017 contains provisions for the establishment of a Water Advisory Body (WAB).  The WAB is being established to advise on measures needed to improve the transparency and accountability of Irish Water.  The body will report on a quarterly basis to\u00a0an Oireachtas Committee on the performance of Irish Water on the implementation of its business plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Confidence and Supply Arrangement in support of the minority Government has confirmed the retention of Irish Water as a single national utility in public ownership,\u00a0responsible for the delivery of water and waste water services.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Since 2013, working through Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with the local authorities, Irish Water has made significant progress in establishing the utility capability, which has included investing over &euro;2 billion in the system to date.  Over the past year, significant design phase work has been undertaken on the development of a transformation plan, in line with the Business Plan objectives.  Flowing from this, I have been informed by Ervia (which has responsibility for Irish Water), that they consider that the public water system will benefit significantly by greater integration of operations into the single utility.  Consequently, the Ervia Board has agreed in principle not to renew the SLAs beyond 2025 when they are due to end, and to move to a full integrated public utility operations model.  The Water Services Acts already provide the necessary protections for terms and conditions, and pensions, of local authority staff working under the SLAs in such circumstances.  It is the intention of Ervia to work with local authorities to manage this change within the life of the current Business Plan (i.e. by end of 2021). <\/p>  <p>  A process of engagement with\u00a0local authorities on the proposed next steps on the transformation plan has now commenced.  The SLAs between Irish Water and local authorities have not been amended and remain in place until such time as an alternative is agreed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900095#WRDD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Data","counter":1286,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900095#WRDD02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1287,"qnumday":545,"qnumall":"[51242\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900095#WRDD02500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the social housing delivered under each of the categories (details supplied) by local authority, in each of the years 2011 to 2016 and to date in 2017, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1288,"qnumday":546,"qnumall":"[51243\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112900095#WRDD02600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the social housing targets committed to in Rebuilding Ireland under each of the categories (details supplied), by local authority for each of the years over the next five years, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1289,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 545 and 546 together.<\/p><p>The Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness provides for the delivery of 50,000 social housing homes out to 2021.
