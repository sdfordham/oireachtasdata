To facilitate this, Government policy since 2011 has been\u00a0focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources. <br\/><br\/>2013, the year of The Gathering, was the best year for inbound tourism since 2008. Tourism delivers income and jobs in every town and city and to every corner of our country. The abolition of the air travel tax last year will result in over one million extra passengers through additional capacity on many existing routes, as well as the introduction of new services. The reduced 9% rate of VAT on tourism related activities has been a great success and there are now an extra twenty three thousand employed in the sector since mid-2011. In addition, as\u00a0I announced\u00a0in the\u00a0Budget 2015 speech, I increased the amount of finance that can be raised by a company under the Employment and Investment Incentive to&euro;5 million annually subject to a lifetime maximum of &euro;15 million and I also\u00a0increased the required holding\u00a0period for shares from 3 to 4 years.\u00a0With specific regard to the hospitality sector, I extended the inclusion of hotels, guest houses and self-catering accommodation in the scheme by a further 3 years.<br\/><br\/>Some recent joint banking\/industry\u00a0research has revealed that a majority of Irish hoteliers are optimistic about the medium term outlook for the sector with (67%) saying that the tourism sector will improve within the next three years. A total of 71% believe the financial performance of their own properties will improve within the same time-frame. The research also revealed that 54% of hotels saw turnover increase in 2012, with 26% saying it decreased.\u00a0<br\/><br\/>Having completed a process of deleveraging, both AIB and Bank of Ireland are now concentrating on growing their balance sheets.In this context, both banks recognise the need to increase business lending in the period up to 2016 and have put on record their commitment to the SME sector.\u00a0<br\/><br\/>My Department has been involved in a range of initiatives to encourage access to credit for\u00a0small and medium sized\u00a0businesses, and the SME State Bodies Group, which includes representation from F&aacute;ilte Ireland, provides a forum for the development and implementation of policy measures to enhance SMEs' access to a stable and appropriate supply of finance.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>Some of the main\u00a0policies introduced by this Government to encourage access to credit for small and medium businesses include:<br\/><br\/>- The Supporting SMEs Online Tool, a cross-government initiative, was launched in May 2014. On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available Government supports.\u00a0 The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at <i><\/i>.<br\/><br\/>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has been established as a means of ensuring that SMEs are provided with sufficient finance for growth.\u00a0 The SBCI, from available funding of some &euro;800 million initially, will provide a more extensive range of financing than is\u00a0currently offered in Ireland. A full roll-out will occur from January 2015 with traditional bank lenders and importantly, new credit providers from beyond the traditional bank sector being involved which means SMEs will benefit from greater choice as well as more funding.\u00a0 More information on the SBCI can be found on <i>.<\/i><br\/><br\/>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, will shortly bring legislation to the Oireachtas which enable the development of a more flexible Credit Guarantee Scheme with longer duration and more products and providers included. <br\/><br\/>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to small businesses who have been refused credit by commercial banks. Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices\u00a0nationally to administer this fund.\u00a0This scheme is currently being reviewed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with a view to making proposed changes to enhance its effectiveness. <br\/><br\/>- The Credit Review Office helps SME or Farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.They also examine\u00a0cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Reviewer John Trethowan and his team have overturned 55% of the refusals that have been appealed to the Office.\u00a0\u00a0Further details are available at <i><\/i><br\/><br\/>The Department of Finance, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.\u00a0 In\u00a0this context the forthcoming Action Plan for Jobs 2015 will include a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing\u00a0for growth in the SME sector.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400063#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Operations","counter":133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400064#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[46569\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400064#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a situation has arisen with the National Asset Management Agency whereby a borrower claimed that it could achieve a better outcome for the taxpayer than could be expected from following NAMA&rsquo;s proposed course of action; NAMA&rsquo;s policy when facing a situation such as this, and in the event of such a situation occurring if NAMA&rsquo;s rationale for its decisions is available for independent analysis.","asker":"965","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>In the context of the management of close to 800 debtor connections, numerous situations arise where debtors disagree with NAMA as to what may be the best outcome for taxpayers.\u00a0\u00a0This is to be expected.\u00a0\u00a0Whilst in many cases debtors may believe from their perspective that a certain course of action will achieve a better outcome, NAMA has been charged by the legislature with determining in each instance what course of action will deliver the best outcome for taxpayers.

This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  In terms of the numbers of beneficiaries of the Scheme in 2013, 4,355 citizens availed of the Vehicle Registration Tax and\/or VAT relief, and 11,436 availed of the repayment of excise on fuel element of the Scheme. <\/p><p>  I\u00a0recognise\u00a0the important role that the\u00a0Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities, and\u00a0I have managed\u00a0to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis\u00a0despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.  I\u00a0frequently receive correspondence from applicants\u00a0who do not meet the qualifying criteria but feel that they could benefit from the Scheme.  While the\u00a0I sympathise with those who do not qualify for Scheme,\u00a0I cannot, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, expand it further within the current context of constrained resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400066#WRG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":185,"content":"<p>Question No. 76 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Income Data","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400066#WRG01150"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[46711\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400066#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide the Revenue Commissioners data on the number of persons in each of the following income brackets, below &euro;9,000, above &euro;9,000 but below &euro;12,000, above &euro;12,000 but below &euro;15,000, above &euro;15,000 but below &euro;20,000, above &euro;20,000 but below &euro;25,000, above &euro;25,000 but below &euro;30,000, above &euro;30,000 but below &euro;40,000, above &euro;40,000 but below &euro;50,000, above &euro;50,000 but below &euro;60,000, above &euro;60,000 but below &euro;70,000, above &euro;70,000 but below &euro;80,000, above &euro;80,000 but below &euro;100,000, above &euro;100,000 but below &euro;120,000, above &euro;120,000 but below &euro;150,000, above &euro;150,000 but below &euro;200,000 and above &euro;200,000.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":188,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the information requested, estimated by reference to the income tax year 2015, is set out in the following table.<br\/><br\/><b>All income earners for Income Tax Year 2015 (provisional)<\/b><table><tr><th>Range of Gross Income -\u00a0&euro;<\/th><th>Number of Income Earners<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>0 to 9,000 <\/td><td>368,585<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9,001 to 12,000 <\/td><td>107,297<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12,001 to 15,000 <\/td><td>116,836<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15,001 to 20,000 <\/td><td>213,112<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20,001 to 25,000 <\/td><td>216,626<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>25,001 to 30,000 <\/td><td>201,085<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>30,001 to 40,000 <\/td><td>324,506<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>40,001 to 50,000 <\/td><td>229,709<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>50,001 to 60,000 <\/td><td>157,805<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>60,001 to 70,000 <\/td><td>107,045<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>70,001 to 80,000 <\/td><td>77,378<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>80,001 to 100,000 <\/td><td>91,301<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>100,001 to 120,000 <\/td><td>47,956<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>120,001 to 150,000 <\/td><td>34,809<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>150,001 to 200,000 <\/td><td>22,512<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Over\u00a0 200,001\u00a0 <\/td><td>24,642<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>2,341,203<\/td><\/tr><\/table>The figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2012 adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.

While employment has increased nationally by approximately 80,000 since the start of the Action Plan process in 2012, not all regions are yet fully experiencing the benefits of economic recovery.

These provisions give rise to the principle of mutual recognition whereby each Member State is obliged to accept onto its market products which are legally manufactured or marketed in another Member State.  My Department attaches considerable importance to the live export trade and, over the years, has been very active in facilitating both the cross border live trade and shipments abroad. Live exports serve a dual purpose as a means of satisfying market demands for live animals and providing alternative market outlets for farmers. Total live exports to the end of November this year stand at almost 225,000 head of which 65,000 went to the UK, an increase of some 5,000 head or 8% up on the comparable period in 2013. Of this 65,000, nearly 49,000 went to Northern Ireland which is down only 2.4% on the same period in 2013.\u00a0 Live exports to Great Britain are up nearly 63% on last year. This does not suggest any failure in the common market. <\/p><p>  The potential to grow the live trade to the UK even further is constrained by the buying specifications operated by the British retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing in that market. The retailers&rsquo; longstanding policy is to market British and Irish beef separately. This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country or the other; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country. In addition, logistical difficulties can arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant. Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcasses have to be deboned in a separate batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor. These issues are a matter of commercial preference, both of slaughter plants in the UK and Northern Ireland, and of UK retailers. Decisions by processors and retailers in other member states in relation to purchasing policy are matters of commercial preference. <\/p><p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised this issue with British retailers over the years, they are unlikely to reverse their marketing policy in the short term and are currently under pressure to stock more British beef. Nevertheless Bord Bia, in its ongoing interactions with British customers, will continue to pursue all opportunities to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.\u00a0 In addition, Bord Bia actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity. <\/p><p>  I have also had several meetings with my Northern counterpart, Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, on this subject.\u00a0 We agreed to make a joint approach to the three British retailers who stock Irish Beef, accepting that these were commercial matters, but also seeking some flexibility given that this beef is produced to the exacting standards required by British consumers. Following on from this, I convened a meeting with Minister O&rsquo;Neill and the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium which took place in October. At this meeting the NIRC made it clear that their beef buyers had a preference for single origin beef, of which they had ample supply, but they would keep the situation under review.\u00a0 I also met separately with Tesco where we had a useful and frank discussion on this and other procurement issues. I will continue to pursue opportunities for exports of beef and live cattle at every opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400070#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[46720\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400070#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of applications currently with his Department for the licensing of ships for the live export of cattle; when each application was submitted; when it is expected a decision will be made on each application; if his Department has received further enquiries regarding the licensing of vessels; the additional steps he is taking to promote live exports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":269,"content":"<p>There are currently two applications for dedicated vessels (received in June and July respectively, of this year) being processed by my Department for the carriage of livestock from Irish ports.

Government has agreed that the Scheme will also include payments for the small number of women who have had a pubiotomy. The Scheme is designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and aims to minimise the stress for the women concerned. Many are elderly and may not want to experience the delay, publicity and financial risks that sometimes come with a court case.  I met the three support groups representing the women last September and their views have helped to shape the Scheme. The Scheme is supported by two of the three groups.  <\/p><p>  Judge Maureen Harding Clark, retired High Court Judge has been appointed as independent Assessor to the Scheme. Judge Clark, from her previous work on the Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme, brings valuable experience to the role of determining the appropriate level of award for each individual. <\/p><p>  The Symphysiotomy Scheme is open to women who are still living and who underwent a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in the State between the years 1940 and 1990. Awards of &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000 will be offered. Details of the Terms of the Scheme and how to access application forms have been widely advertised.<\/p><p>  Awards will be exempt from tax and legislation is being put in place as a matter of urgency to ensure they are also exempt from being taken into consideration for means tested welfare schemes and for the Nursing Home Support Scheme. <\/p><p>  It is not a requirement for a woman to retain a Solicitor to make an application.  However, the Scheme makes provision for applicants to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application if they wish.   <\/p><p>  Applications must be made within 20 working days of the Commencement Date, which was 10 November, 2014.  The Closing Date for receipt of applications is therefore Friday 5 December 2014.  In exceptional circumstances, Judge Clark has discretion to extend the time for receipt of applications by an additional 20 working days, that is, to Wednesday, 14 January 2015.  It is important to note that in the event of a delay arising in the compilation of a woman's supporting documentation due to difficulty in obtaining medical records, the application should be submitted within the time period set out in the Scheme with a written explanation of the reasons for the absence of the documentation. The details of this provision are set out in the terms and conditions of the Scheme, which are available on the Scheme&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>  Judge Clark reported that by last Friday, 28 November more than 140 women had applied for awards under the Scheme and to date conditional offers have been made totalling &euro;1,450,000.  There are 4 working days left to apply, including today and I would urge every eligible woman or her representative to submit her application within the appointed timeframe.<\/p><p>  My Department will be making payments in the case of 7 women shortly and others should have payments before Christmas. <\/p><p>  The Scheme is voluntary and I would like to emphasise that women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. Women may opt out of the Scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.<\/p><p>  Government hopes the implementation of this Scheme will help to bring closure on this issue for the women concerned and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400076#WRR01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Oversight","counter":418,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400076#WRR01350"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[46622\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400076#WRR01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures that have been taken to address the delays in the fair deal scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":420,"content":"<p>The HSE controls the release of funding to manage the funds that are available across the course of the year.

Of the 113 such deaths reported in 2011 the majority of these deaths (86%) involved poly-substance poisonings, in addition, 68% of those who died where methadone was implicated were not in opiate substitution treatment at the time of their death.<br\/><br\/>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the table.<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2004<\/th><th>2005<\/th><th>2006<\/th><th>2007<\/th><th>2008<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>ALL NDRDI poisoning deaths<\/td><td>267<\/td><td>300<\/td><td>326<\/td><td>389<\/td><td>386<\/td><td>374<\/td><td>338<\/td><td>365<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deaths involving Methadone<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>43<\/td><td>61<\/td><td>55<\/td><td>80<\/td><td>69<\/td><td>60<\/td><td>113<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deaths involving Methadone alone<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400077#WRS01100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Drugs Strategy Implementation","counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400077#WRS01150"},{"type":"question","counter":441,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[46700\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400077#WRS01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the basis for the decision to make naloxone more widely available; the categories of drug users to whom this will be made available; the anticipated benefits of this approach; and the evidence on which this decision is based.","asker":"1178","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":442,"content":"<p>Opioid overdose is treatable with naloxone,  an opioid antagonist which rapidly reverses the effects of opioids.

To date, it has been ratified by 190 countries.  The Convention provides for privileges and immunities for diplomats and certain other persons working in embassies.  Under the Convention, it is the duty of all persons enjoying diplomatic privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the host State, including any applicable labour laws.  Consistent with the State&rsquo;s obligations under the Vienna Convention, my Department works to ensure that the law is upheld and my Department will assist, as appropriate, in any investigation being undertaken by the relevant Irish authorities.  Persons working for embassies &ndash; i.e. foreign governments &ndash; may in certain circumstances bring legal proceedings in relation to their employment against that government, subject to the rules of state immunity, also known as sovereign immunity.  State immunity is not regulated by the Vienna Convention.  However, a distinction must be drawn between individuals working for embassies and those working for individual diplomats as private domestic workers.  Any legal proceedings brought by a private domestic worker against their diplomat employer will be subject to the rules set out in the Vienna Convention.  Although an international review of the Convention is not envisaged at this point in time, Ireland as well as many of our EU and OSCE partners keep under on-going consideration how best we can meet our international and national obligations. <\/p><p>  My interest in the promotion of best employment practices led to my introduction last September of new guidelines for diplomatic staff who intend to employ private domestic workers.  These guidelines set out clearly expectations regarding such matters as payment, working hours, employment records and health insurance. Upon publication of the guidelines, my Department arranged a briefing for all resident diplomatic Missions and followed up in writing with those Missions. My Department continues to monitor the implementation of the guidelines closely.<\/p><p>  While I believe that the majority of diplomatic staff in Ireland already follow good practices, it is my view that the obligations as set out under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations combined with the effective implementation of best practices in the form of these new guidelines provide the best way forward to ensure the protection of domestic workers employed by diplomats in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400077#WRS01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Official Engagements","counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400077#WRS01550"},{"type":"question","counter":447,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[46593\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400077#WRS01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the overseas trips he, and the Ministers of State in his Department, have planned between December 2014 and December 2015.","asker":"1037","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":448,"content":"<p>My Department performs a wide range of functions in pursuit of Ireland&rsquo;s values and interests overseas.

These tasks require extensive engagement with our international partners, including through face-to-face Ministerial meetings. Trade promotion and economic messaging are key elements in all visits abroad undertaken by Government Ministers.

I have since discussed this case with Minister Shoukry on a number of occasions. I have emphasised that this individual was only seventeen when the alleged offences took place, and the necessity for him to return to Ireland as soon as possible to continue his studies for his Leaving Certificate examination.

However, this may result in some pupils' not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory, and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. <br\/><br\/>  Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that, as regards that policy, principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected.<br\/><br\/>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department or, in the case of an Education and Training Board (ETB) school, to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student, or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld. <br\/><br\/>  The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The EWS may be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement within the pupil's home area. The contact details for the EWS is Educational Welfare Services, Block 3, South Dublin County Council, Tallaght, Dublin 24, Phone 01 4635513.<br\/><br\/>  My Department provides for a range of placement options for pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that all pupils can receive a school placement. Many pupils with special educational needs will be able to attend a local mainstream school whereas, for pupils who have needs which require more specialist interventions, special class and special school placements are provided for.<br\/><br\/>  In addition, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs. Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<br\/><br\/>The NCSE also recently published a Guide for Parents and Guardians of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs on Choosing a School. This guide is also available at www.ncse.ie.<br\/><br\/>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government gave approval in March of this year for drafting the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2014, and drafting by the Attorney General is currently underway. The aim of bringing forward legislative proposals in relation to school admission is to improve the admissions process, and to ensure that the way schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400079#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":479,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[46662\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400079#WRU00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if extra special needs teaching hours may be facilitated in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":480,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that all schools receive an allocation of additional teaching resources to support children who have mild general learning difficulties or learning support needs under the General Allocation Model in primary schools, or through Learning Support and Resource Teaching allocations at post primary schools.<br\/><br\/>  Schools are given guidance on how to identify pupils for learning support in my Departments Circulars 02\/05 and 70\/2014. <br\/><br\/>  In addition, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02\/05.

I anticipate that this target will be achieved and it is a matter for each individual local authority to allocate these units to those on their social housing waiting lists.<br\/><br\/>Budget 2015 has given a further impetus to this area, and I envisage a further 1,000 vacant properties being returned to productive use through this additional funding.<table><tr><th>Vacant Units to be returned to productive use in 2014 <\/th><th>Local Authority <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>26 <\/td><td>Carlow <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15 <\/td><td>Cavan <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>42 <\/td><td>Clare <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>186 <\/td><td>Cork City <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>155 <\/td><td>Cork County <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>115 <\/td><td>Donegal <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>371 <\/td><td>Dublin City <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>147 <\/td><td>Fingal <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>75 <\/td><td>South Dublin <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3 <\/td><td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>42 <\/td><td>Galway City <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>62 <\/td><td>Galway County <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>45 <\/td><td>Kerry <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>67 <\/td><td>Kildare <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>25 <\/td><td>Kilkenny <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>27 <\/td><td>Laois <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15 <\/td><td>Leitrim <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>86 <\/td><td>Limerick <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15 <\/td><td>Longford <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 <\/td><td>Louth <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>81 <\/td><td>Mayo <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>53 <\/td><td>Meath <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11 <\/td><td>Monaghan <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>31 <\/td><td>Offaly <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>21 <\/td><td>Roscommon <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>26 <\/td><td>Sligo <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>66 <\/td><td>Tipperary <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>48 <\/td><td>Waterford <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>46 <\/td><td>Westmeath <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16 <\/td><td>Wexford <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>32 <\/td><td>Wicklow <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1,960 <\/td><td>Total <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400080#WRV01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":510,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400080#WRV01800"},{"type":"question","counter":511,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[46588\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400080#WRV01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the total number of houses to be built per year under the social housing strategy 2020; if he will provide the figures for the breakdown of housing allocations per county as well as per local authority area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1040","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":512,"content":"<p>The Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform, approved by Government and published last week, builds on the provisions contained in Budget 2015 and sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.  In committing to provide 35,000 new social housing units, at a projected cost of &euro;3.8 billion, the strategy marks a fresh start for social housing in Ireland.  It is estimated that this level of investment will create or sustain some 29,000 construction industry jobs.  Importantly, the Strategy restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing through a resumption of direct building on a significant scale, primarily by local authorities and approved housing bodies.<\/p><p>  The strategy will be delivered in two phases. Phase 1 targets the delivery of 18,000 additional housing units and 32,400 Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme units by the end of 2017.  In phase 2, spanning the years 2018 to 2020, the strategy targets the delivery of 17,000 additional units and 43,000 Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme units.<\/p><p>  In the initial phase, increased Exchequer funding is necessary to underpin delivery.  The Government has already committed this initial funding, through the &euro;2.2 billion announced as part of Budget 2015.  The provision of this funding will allow time for the work to be carried out to move towards more off-balance sheet funding, through the extension to the NAMA Special Purpose Vehicle, a large scale Public Private Partnership and the establishment of a 'Strategic Housing Fund'.<\/p><p>  The strategy provides a clear governance structure which , as Minister, I will personally oversee to ensure delivery.  Action 1 of the Strategy requires the agreement of targets for delivery of social housing next year and in subsequent years.  These specific targets will be agreed through the governance structure, which is currently being put in place, in collaboration with local authorities and with input from the approved housing body sector.  For 2015, I expect that some 7,400 new social housing units will be provided under the range of existing initiatives broken down as follows: 3,000 units through leasing initiative; 2,000 new Rental Accommodation Scheme units; 1,000 vacant local authority units will be refurbished and brought back to use; with a further 1,400 units to be built or acquired by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies through the Social Housing Investment Programme and Capital Assistance Scheme.

This analysis is publically available on the Department's website through the consultation process (Background Paper No.10) and the final\u00a0Policy Framework\u00a0is due to be published in Q1 of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400083#WRY00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"question","counter":572,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[46640\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120400083#WRY00700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the degree to which the transport sector in this country is affected by unfair competition from outside the jurisdiction; if he has a particular strategy in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":573,"content":"<p>The transport sector is governed by\u00a0sectoral\u00a0transport legislation,\u00a0both national and European, and by general competition law.\u00a0 All transport operators in the State are subject to these laws.\u00a0 In some cases operators legally based outside of\u00a0our jurisdiction\u00a0but which\u00a0operate transport operations within the State may have a different cost base than transport operators based within the state.
