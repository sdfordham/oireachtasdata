Members will already be familiar with many of the answers but I will give perhaps slightly different perspectives on them.  The key questions are why Asia matters in a broader sense, why Asia matters to Ireland and the key trade opportunity sectors in Asian markets for Ireland.  I will outline a little of Asia Matters' activities and how they blend in with Ireland Inc. activities in regard to Asia.  Hopefully, we are saving the best until last but I will make suggestions to further Ireland's trade with Asia.<\/p><p>  Why does Asia matter?  Everyone is aware that Asia is essentially changing the world as we know it.  This is the century of Asian economic growth, which has profound implications for Asia, Europe and the rest of the world.  The Asian Development Bank, of which Ireland is a member, estimates that Asia will double its share of global GDP to 52% by 2050.  China, the fastest growing economy in the world, with 9.2% economic growth in 2011, presents huge opportunities.  Even if growth slows, as anticipated, it will very soon become the world's largest economy.  Japan, which remains an industrial giant, with 8.4% of world GDP, is Asia's largest overseas FDI investor, and 10% of the top 100 global companies are Japanese.  Many countries in Asia now have annual GDP growth of 6% or more.<\/p><p>  Of the top ten largest global cities by population, seven are in Asia and, as we know, many cities in Asia now have populations greater than entire population of Ireland.  I will give some examples based on the metro area of the cities.  The largest city in the world is Tokyo in Japan, with more than 32 million people.  Seoul has more than 20 million people, Mumbai, has 19 million, Jakarta has almost 19 million, Delhi has 18 million, Osaka has 17 million and Shanghai has more than 16 million.  If one moves into the second tier, Manila in the Philippines has just over 16 million.  This will have huge implications globally in the future in terms of growth, economic opportunity, where consumers are and Irish trade policy.<\/p><p>  Why does Asia matter to Ireland?  Ireland needs to embrace the change happening globally because of Asia.  We obviously need to go where growth is and we need more business from Asia to grow our economy and create jobs.  Currently, the Irish Exporters Association has advised us that only 4% of Irish trade goes to Asia compared with 20% going to the EU.  We obviously have a lot of catching up to do.<\/p><p>  Our history with Asia is relatively recent.  We do not have long historical relations, which is a good thing and a bad thing.  It is a good thing in that we have no colonial legacy or no historical baggage but it is a bad thing in that we do not have long-standing relationships.  Perhaps the best relationships we have at senior level in Asia were started through our missionaries, many of whom educated some of the leaders of today's private and public society in Asia.<\/p><p>  The year 2012 saw increased bilateral engagement between Asia and Ireland, including high level reciprocal visits by the Taoiseach and Asian leaders.  As the Chairman correctly stated, the visit of Vice President Xi Jinping was a game changer.  The Taoiseach, along with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, led a return visit in March following Vice President's Xi Jinping's visit in February.  I happened to be on that delegation and it certainly resonated very well with Chinese partners, companies and buyers and on the Irish side.  That was an example of Ireland doing something very well within a relatively short period of time.<\/p><p>  Part of our problem is that 90% of our trade to Asia comes from Ireland-based multinationals, so only 10% of our trade with Asia comes from indigenous Irish companies.  Obviously, we need to grow that.  However, in 2011, according to Enterprise Ireland figures released last year, Irish company exports to China grew by 29% and 17% to Asia overall, so we are heading in the right direction.<\/p><p>  Equally, the purchasing power of the Japanese consumer for quality goods and services remains very strong.  One gets different figures but it is estimated that the average household savings in Japan are somewhere in the region of &euro;250,000 to &euro;350,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013013000003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359567000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murray.

My involvement in the foreign affairs committee is mainly in the area of human rights rather than in trade and business but I was very interested in what Mr. Murray had to say.  A gentleman spoke recently to the committee about trade with Arab countries.  Does Mr. Murray know any organisation that seeks to build trade with such countries, or is this more of the lack of joined-up thinking?  I was interested in what Mr. Murray observed about Irish universities.  Perhaps he might outline this idea beyond the language aspect, where we fall behind, and might make a suggestion.  I live not far from DCU and know what it has been trying to do in its language courses.<\/p><p>  To return to my human rights hat, there are concerns with some countries in Asia that have appalling standards, and we are aware of abuses of human rights.  I would like to see some recognition of this when we do business and trade with these countries.  Perhaps these aspects could be of mutual benefit and complement each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013013000006#E00300","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1359567000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Martin answer that?

How can that be resolved?  I am aware the different universities are all trying to deploy in different parts of China, for example.  I presume they go on the basis of a contact.  The usual way it happens is when somebody else has had success in a particular area.  In my area, the Institute of Technology Tallaght is trying to open contacts with people in China.  One of the difficulties often mentioned in regard to Chinese students is accommodation.  I suppose it is the same for any group coming into a country.  If accommodation can be supplied to a group of students, it is all much easier and parents are assured their children will be okay, the food will suit and there will be no cultural issues, depending on which part of the world the students come from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013013000006#E00600","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359567600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Those questions could be dealt with very effectively if there was a senior political administrator co-ordinating all of this with the right resources to support him or her.  As the Deputy says about joined-up thinking, we need someone who can engage with NAMA, who can deal with the demand on the education side and the accommodation and supply.<\/p><p>  We do not have a significantly large Irish diaspora in Asia.  In Japan there are approximately 1,000 Irish people and slightly more in China.  I recently spoke in a personal capacity to a colleague from the US who suggested that the US should redirect some of its embassy locations in Europe to Asia because it is seriously refocusing on Asia.  That would be important.  One of the practical worries about building partnerships through educational exchange and trade is that some of our relationships were started by the missionaries even before Ireland had embassies there.  Some missionaries did amazing educational work, training some of the current leaders, but many of them are elderly and their goodwill and relationships could pass away with them.  I am not suggesting there should be a census <i>per se<\/i> but there should be some way of undertaking engagement with elders who are respected in those communities and happen to be Irish.  The UK does many things well but particularly through the British Council it promotes British education and culture, in the UK and elsewhere.  I have always felt that there is a gap in the Irish embassies where very good people work at promoting culture but we do not have an organisation which might amalgamate education in Ireland, and Culture Ireland.  Ireland, almost uniquely, gets permission from almost all Asian governments to close off a main street and have a parade, on St. Patrick's Day.  That and many other important events are organised by volunteers on the ground.  There is a need for someone to co-ordinate that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013013000007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1359567600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I compliment Mr. Murray.  His presentation was fascinating.  The five points on which he has expanded are food for thought.  In many ways it is frustrating to listen to him because, unfortunately, it is not easy to arrive at solutions to the problems he highlighted, something about which we have been speaking here.  For example, because of financial constraints the Government has closed three embassies.  The T&aacute;naiste has said he would love to open embassies in appropriate locations.  I agree with almost everything Mr. Murray has said.  There is a great cultural link between Ireland and Philippines, not just through the Columban Fathers who provided education there and to whom the Filipino people are extremely grateful, but also through the Irish wife or lover of a famous poet-revolutionary who is honoured annually on a national holiday.  The worry, as Mr. Murray quite rightly says, is that if we do not get in before the missionaries die, we will lose that connection when the economy is growing rapidly.  We should try to capitalise on that while the missionaries are still there.  I do not wish to dent his pride in his native city.  It is a wonderful victory that University College Cork won the international competition for Confucius Institutes based in educational institutions, but just because an institution does not have a Confucius Institute does not mean that Chinese language courses are not being provided.  The Dublin Institute of Technology has wonderfully proficient lecturers in its Chinese department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013013000007#F00300","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1359567600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>It is hard to pose a question because I agree with practically everything that Mr. Murray has said.  I am disappointed there might have been some place in the world where the universities are so competitive that they are pestering the city university.  I have seen them operate in China when all the colleges and DIT were at an event in Beijing.  They are doing reasonably well in China.  Two scholarships are being offered in Vietnam to a man and a woman to come to Ireland to study catering and the hospitality industry and build tourism.  Mr. Murray must be aware of the excellent report in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i> which highlights the work being done, particularly by DIT.  It was not an advertisement but a business feature.  The Minister for Education and Skills will do a tour of China.  It would be nice to think he might go to Hainan and get the local authority there to decide on which of the two sites on offer the campus will be developed.<\/p><p>  How does Mr. Murray envisage the financial package available from the Chinese in conjunction with DIT working out in the long term?  DIT might grant the certificates and oversee the courses.  What is Mr. Murray's opinion of that type of relationship?  Maybe it is mimicking the type of relationship that the College of Surgeons has with Bahrain.  Would Mr. Murray see that as a way forward, educational partnerships engaging with the governments or local authorities and private capital, or does he think it is better to try to suck as many international students as possible into Ireland and the college structure that exists here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013013000007#F00500","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359567600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>It is better for us to go there.

We have competent young people who learn the languages quickly.  As the Senator knows, there is the Farmleigh fellowship programme, which is a great programme.  Therefore we have the ability but we do not take it seriously at all.  Those of us who speak an Asian language are well aware of how many others speak it because the numbers are so small.<\/p><p>  As to whether the direct air link is viable, yes it is.  The indications are that it is viable with Beijing but part of that logic is that Beijing is positioning itself as a hub for Asia.  If one looks at the amount of traffic, including people who go to Australia, if certain of those numbers go via Beijing it could be very viable.<\/p><p>  The third question was whether business and culture are in sync.

I was interested to hear what Mr. Murray said about Indonesia because I was there last year.  He is so right.  It is a country with a huge population which is growing at a phenomenal rate and with an emerging middle class.  It is absolutely ripe for trade with Ireland as an export destination.<\/p><p>  The need for an Irish embassy there was brought home to me.  I was visiting with six other European parliamentarians.  We were invited to a dinner and each of their ambassadors was also invited.  There were five or six ambassadors but no Irish person apart from myself.  It is a lost opportunity when we do not have an embassy.<\/p><p>  We hear about air connections but it is hard enough to get one to America.  The critical mass to get a non-stop connection to Beijing is never going to happen.  We do not even have a runway that would take such a plane to fly direct to Beijing.  In fairness to the last government - to which I never give any credit - it did try to pursue the Middle East contact as a means to fly on to the Far East.  We should be working on that rather than talking about planes going directly from Beijing to Dublin, which is not going to happen.<\/p><p>  It was interesting to hear what Mr. Murray said about the visa issue.  We have talked endlessly about visas to China, as well as how difficult they are to obtain and how expensive they are.  There was quite an innovative pilot programme for the London Olympics last year whereby if one was coming to the games one could come to Ireland as well on the same visa.  It was being tried out as something that we could carry forward, rather than having to get a British visa.
