I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe McHugh, to the House to discuss this important issue.<\/p> <p>I take my appointment as Ireland&rsquo;s first emigrant Senator seriously.  That mandate not only extends to the US diaspora, with which I am more familiar, but to the entire diaspora across the globe.  One issue which comes up time and again with elderly members of the UK&rsquo;s Irish diaspora is the continued access to RTE long wave radio service which is set to be abolished at some point in 2017.  There may be many young or more digitally orientated people in RTE management who may scoff at the notion of retaining for what for them may be a feature of bygone era.  However, this narrow thinking does not understand the richness RTE provides for the tens of thousands of listeners in the UK who tune into RTE long wave every single day.<\/p> <p>There are more than 600,000 Irish-born emigrants living in the UK, with many of its older members forced out of Ireland in the 1950s with little education and no prospects of work at home.  In January 2016, the Social Policy Research Centre at Middlesex University London, funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, conducted a study into some of those emigrants&rsquo; usage of RTE long wave.  Up to 92% of respondents to the survey stated they listen every day or most days, with 44% listening to it in the car or another vehicle.  Less than half the respondents had used a television or some form of digital device to access the radio.  Unsurprisingly, it was the so-called older age groups who did not access the service on digital radio platforms on a laptop or digital TV.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State consider this survey, given it was funded by the previous Government, and implore RTE management to reconsider this ageist and discriminatory cut to RTE long wave planned for 2017?  Nobody is trying to halt the digitalisation of our media or impede RTE in its process of modernisation.  However, RTE must be reminded of its public service remit.<\/p> <p>The historic first state visit of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann to the United Kingdom in 2014 was an incredible moment for the Irish UK community, particularly the elderly who have been through difficult times for the Irish in the UK during the Troubles.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Billy Lawless:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Anyone watching the concerts and events held around the President's visit could see for themselves that they reconnected many Irish men and women of humble economic and social backgrounds in a way that had not been felt for many generations.  This was an extremely proud moment, not just for those immigrants, but for the global Irish diaspora.  It showed that this nation is taller than its borders.  I ask the Minister of State what kind of message is sent to those people when three years later we turn the switch off on RTE radio,  which is the daily, and perhaps only, link to home here in Ireland for so many.  Thankfully, we have exited the period of austerity.  It seems an extremely harsh and unfair decision for RTE to directly target some of the most elderly and vulnerable people who use the station's services.  This is not what public service broadcasting is supposed to be about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#A00400","speaker":"1429","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat a Leas-Chathaoirligh.

By way of background on this matter, in September 2014, RTE announced plans to shut down its long wave 252 service, which enables RTE Radio 1 to be broadcast into Britain.  While the initial plan was for the long wave service to close on 27 October 2014, this was further deferred until 19 January 2015.  On 18 December 2014, a decision was taken to continue long wave radio services until 2017.<\/p> <p>Following this announcement, the Government&rsquo;s emigrant support programme, which is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, supported research into the listenership figures in Britain for the RTE long wave service.  The purpose of this research was to obtain concrete data on the current listenership and also to explore the possibility of continuing the service using alternate technologies.  The research was conducted by the Social Policy Research Centre at Middlesex University, which was appointed following a competitive tender process run by Irish in Britain, the national representative organisation for the Irish community in England, Scotland and Wales.  Information was gathered through individual submissions, group submissions and focus groups.  Overseeing the research was a consultative group of key stakeholders composed of representatives of RTE, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials based in Dublin and at the Embassy of Ireland in London, and representatives of the Irish community in Britain.<\/p> <p>The figures show that out of 3,191 people who completed the individual surveys, 72% of those who responded were over 60, while 68% of respondents were born in Ireland and 62% were retired.  For the majority of respondents, long wave was seen as a lifeline to Ireland, helping them to maintain a sense of Irishness and to keep up with events back home.  The majority of listeners in the focus groups preferred the familiar, analogue service as opposed to digital platforms, computers, laptops and smartphones.  The Government recognises the special value placed on RTE's long wave 252 service by some Irish citizens in the Britain, especially the elderly, and my Department is working closely with RTE to ensure that the views of this community are heard in any decision-making process.<\/p> <p>While any decision on the future of long wave services in Britain is ultimately an operational matter for RTE, it can, as a result of the study, now be informed by awareness of the role that the service plays in preserving and enhancing links with Ireland and keeping our people in Britain informed of important events and developments, such as the UK&rsquo;s vote to leave the European Union and the Irish Government&rsquo;s position.  A meeting of the consultative group will take place in London next week in order to discuss the next steps, explore possible ways forward In the context of maintaining the link with audiences in Britain, and of keeping the Irish community involved in decision-making.  I am hopeful that a positive outcome can be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#B00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It also continues at a political level in the US Senate and House of Representatives.  The Senator is involved in that effort.  He took part in a very important meeting in America on 12 January.  Those meetings with the consulates and the embassy are so important.  In the context of what we can control in terms of budget, in last year's programme &euro;2.3 million was allocated to the emigrant support service.  We support many emigrant support services, be it in San Diego, San Francisco, Boston, New York or whatever part of America, and we need to continue that.<\/p> <p>We also need to continue work on our strong relationship with the US.  When the Taoiseach travels to the White House on 17 March, it is going to be about that relationship.

That is a top priority and it will continue to be.  It was my priority when I was in San Francisco, New York and Boston.  I am going again - the Senator will be joining me- to visit the the east coast and we have to make it a priority because there are people feeling vulnerable at the moment.  We have to ensure that the relationship that was always there between Ireland and the United States continues, in a similar vein to the Senator's comments on the relationship with the United Kingdom.  They are two separate issues but one and the same in terms of keeping the relationships strong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#B00700","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#B00800","speaker":"1429"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The motion speaks for itself and relates to the high cost of car parking in many public hospitals, especially for long-term patients.  I wish to ask the Minister of State if the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, will consider providing car parking guidelines to hospitals or to the private companies that run hospital car parks in an effort to reduce the cost for patients with long-term illness and their families.  The exorbitant cost of hospital car parking across the country needs to be addressed.  I was dismayed to hear of the wife of a cancer patient who was forced to fork out &euro;1,200 on hospital car parking in Beaumont over a six month period.  A three-hour stay in the car park of Tallaght hospital costs &euro;7.50.  This is almost twice what shoppers pay at the Square shopping centre, which is a stone's throw from the hospital and which clearly has a similar value in terms of real estate.  According to a recent report by the Irish Cancer Society, Dublin hospitals are the most expensive, which is logical in a sense due to real estate prices, etc.  A four-hour stay costs at one of these hospitals costs &euro;8.86 on average.  At hospitals in Munster, a four-hour stay costs approximately &euro;6.70 on average.  This has a huge effect on people's lives at a time when they are extremely vulnerable.  Meanwhile, only seven of the 27 cancer treatment hospitals offer weekly discounted car parking rates.<\/p> <p>Recently, Age Action researched and produced a report on the experience of older people regarding outpatient services at University Hospital Galway.  Some 68% of respondents said they found car parking charges excessive.  Paying such high rates on a regular basis adds financial pressure to families and patients who are already under significant physical and psychological stress.  Although a discounted rate of car parking is offered to relatives of long-term patients in some hospitals, this is not enough.  As a result, I am calling for the issuing of car parking guidelines, similar to those relating to the NHS in the UK, in order to reduce and streamline the cost of parking for patients with long-term illness and their families.  I am well aware that, in many instances, private companies run these car parks.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We can introduce policy that will affect them by implementing some sort of regulation or at least guidelines to help families in these situations.  Hospitals or indeed the companies that are allowed to franchise out or rent the land should not profit hugely at the expense of patients who are in long-term care in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#B01000","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>As the Senator can see, I am not the Minister, Deputy Harris.  I am here on his behalf since he could not be here.  Over the past decade, parking charges have introduced into many hospitals.  It is important to note that these parking charges are part of the series of measures which ensure the operational cost of providing parking services does not cause an adverse impact on their budget.  As demand for parking services at hospitals increases, so too does the associated cost of providing these services such as initial capital cost of purchasing or renting parking areas, the cost of developing extra parking spaces, the need to provide and upgrade security schemes in hospital car parks, staffing and general maintenance of the parking services.  The cost of providing these services needs to be recouped, and I am sure that we will all agree that the cost of providing these services to visitors, staff and patients does not impact on the hospital's budget to provide health care services to patients.<\/p> <p>The Health Service Executive, HSE, has advised that it does not have a single contract to provide parking services at all hospitals.  Instead each hospital has a unique arrangement which reflects its specific circumstances.  For example, Temple Street Children's University Hospital, the National Maternity Hospital and Mercy University Hospital in Cork do not provide public car parking spaces.  Further, some hospitals such as St. Luke's Hospital in Rathgar, Merlin Park University Hospital in Galway and Mallow General Hospital do not have a charge for parking a car.  They have free parking.  The HSE advises that a number of hospitals use parking revenue solely for maintenance and reinvestment in parking facilities, including payment of loans obtained for upgrading such facilities and investing in security.  The remainder of hospitals use parking revenue to cover the cost of parking services, with any additional income contributing to the general hospital budget or to fund research or specific patient facilities.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Harris, is aware that those hospitals which charge parking fees are very conscious of the financial impact of parking costs on patients and their families, particularly those with long-term illness.  Consequently, the hospitals have introduced a maximum daily fixed parking charge and thus have capped these expenses.  While there is no national HSE policy covering car parking charges, the executive advises the Minister that it keeps hospital parking charges under review.<\/p> <p>We must take into account public transport services when considering further development of the hospital system.  This is evidenced by planning and development, and support for the expansion of public transport facilities, especially for the new national children's hospital.  We continue to provide more transport choices to the public when visiting their loved ones in hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#C00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of the State for the response she gave on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris.

I anticipated the answer I received because I said in my speech that I know that the HSE is going to say that it does not actually manage the hospitals.  I suppose I have to take the answer at face value.<\/p> <p>What I would like and will request from the Department is an outline of what is being charged at a discount rate for the hospitals which the Minister, Deputy Harris, says is actually happening.  It is stated in the reply that hospitals have introduced a maximum daily fixed parking charge, thus capping this expense.  I am aware of that but I am not aware that it happens in all hospitals.  I would like to see that is definitely in place but also what it means in real terms for families of patients.  I will follow up with the Department in that regard separately.  I request that the HSE and the Minister, who is in charge of everything related to health care, do everything to ensure the private companies which are in operation in hospitals are given guidelines or regulations to ensure people are not charged an excessive amount when their loved ones are in hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#C00300","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I have taken note of some of the Senator's concerns.

A sum of &euro;1,200 is an exorbitant amount to ask anyone to pay over any period of time when people are very sick.  I know on a personal level, and I have been in this position myself, that when my brother was very seriously ill in Tallaght hospital last year and who later died, arrangements were made with the family and his eight children to be able to visit him on a frequent basis.  They were very co-operative in the hospital about providing parking for them at a very low rate because his family was with him 24-7 for at least three weeks.  There are ways for hospitals to look at that.  What the Senator said is very relevant to some of the experiences I have had myself around the HSE not having a proper guideline for hospitals.

He also referred to the distress of patients and their families and the impact to the staff caused by cramped and overcrowded conditions and high numbers of patients on trolleys.  University Hospital Limerick has been to the forefront in media coverage for having the highest number on trolleys and overcrowding in the accident and emergency department for quite a while.<\/p> <p>I am aware that the new accident and emergency department in University Hospital Limerick is due to open in May 2017.  The go-ahead was also received last week to go to the design stage for 96 acute beds.  At the same time that this application was put in for the 96 beds, St. John's Hospital in Limerick, which is part of the University Hospital Group as well, made an application for the replacement of 90 beds within the city centre in Limerick.  There are currently 99 beds in the hospital.  Ten are for people in need of medical procedures and ten are day care.  St. John's Hospital was built in 1780 as a fever and lock hospital.  It is the second oldest hospital in the country, after the Rotunda, which is still on the original site.  The application was included as part of the University Hospital Group application to the national capital development fund.  Both were put on a priority list at the same time.<\/p> <p>To solve the problem around waiting lists, overcrowding and the accident and emergency department in University Hospital Limerick, we need to expedite this at the same time as the 96 beds for University Hospital Limerick.  If we build these replacement beds within St. John's, it will be possible to expand the services.  Some services currently operate out of prefabs.  The hospital has been struggling for a while to provide services both for staff and patients in a safe manner.  The staff have certainly done their very best.  Their services are renowned and I compliment all involved who work there.

Acute hospital campuses are complex sites and all construction must be carefully planned and scheduled to ensure patient care is not impeded or unnecessarily impacted.<\/p> <p>In the 2017 national service plan, the HSE outlined a number of projects which are expected to be completed and become operational in 2017 or early 2018.

The acute medical assessment unit and outpatient department are being refurbished and reconfigured to provide eight additional assessment places and 12 replacement assessment spaces.  In addition, a surgical and pre-operative assessment unit is projected to open in the third quarter of 2017 and will provide 14 additional assessment spaces.  I also note the clinical education and research centre, which is co-funded by the University of Limerick, is projected to be operational by the fourth quarter of 2017.  It has an estimated capital cost of &euro;12.9 million.  <\/p> <p>These projects demonstrate the considerable investment in infrastructure which is currently under way on the UHL campus and which will benefit the wider hospital group.  The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for infrastructural development in the most effective way possible to meet current and future needs.  The reality is that limited funding is available for new projects over the multi-annual period of 2016 to 2021, given the level of commitment in place and the costs of completion of projects already under way.  Further investment in the UL hospital group must therefore be considered within the overall acute hospital sector infrastructure programme and within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  The House is aware that a proposed mid-term review of the State's capital envelope will assess progress and review emerging pressures and demands.  It is expected that this mid-term review will be completed in 2017.  The Department of Health will work with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to conduct this review of the capital programme.  The Department of Health will also conduct a bed capacity review which will assess projected health care needs over the next decade and the associated infrastructural requirements to meet these needs.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#D00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply and welcome what she has said.

I find it a little bit upsetting that the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is not here because all the requests I have made to meet her have been completely ignored.  She promised to set up a meeting but she has not done any of it.<\/p><p>I will tell the Minister of State in a nutshell what the problem is.  I launched a project called Project 95 to address the fact that 95 children were placed into adult psychiatric units in 2015.  The traumatic effect it has on children is astounding.  One can imagine how upsetting it is for a child to be placed in an ordinary ward for physical health but imagine what it must be like in an adult psychiatric ward.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is well aware of this.  We have spoken at length about it on many occasions.  It is no good to just highlight the issue.  The media have highlighted it every single year.  I have come up with a solution yet the Minister of State continues to ignore it.  The solution is to have a collaborative working relationship between the public and private sectors.  The private sector has beds available.  It has psychiatric intensive care units, PICUs, for children who are in terrible distress and they are available at weekends.  The public sector does not have anything.  All it would take is a series of conversations between the public and private sector.  It would reduce overnight the number of those 95 children who have to be placed into adult psychiatric units and it would also reduce the 2,500 children who are waiting to be seen and assessed by the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  They cannot be seen and assisted by CAMHS mainly because those services do not have the personnel to do it because they are overwhelmed with the numbers.  The private sector could jump in on a short-term basis and provide assessments.  Most of those children do not need CAMHS; they need to be redirected to somewhere like Pieta House or Barnardos or one of those other organisations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joan Freeman:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2483\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2483&amp;amp;pid=JoanFreeman&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister of State still refuses to consider the issue.  What is tragic is she and her Department are completely ignoring the fact there are children on that waiting list with life-threatening issues.  They are either starving to death because they are anorexic or they have strong suicidal ideation.  For example, there were three young people who killed themselves just before Christmas in Cork.  It has been suggested that if there was an out-of-hours service, they would still be alive today.  Can the Minister of State imagine not only the Christmas those families experienced but what the year ahead will be like for them?<\/p><p>There is another issue I want to address with the Minister of State.  I wonder how much of this will get to her ears and if she will address us.  I know the Minister of State in the Chamber today is listening but will the Minister of State with responsibility for this issue listen?  I publicly asked about allocation of funding the last time she was in the Chamber.  How was the money spent?  There is &euro;35 million every year meant to be given to A Vision for Change so how was that spent last year?  More importantly, during the budget the Government indicated there is another &euro;35 million for A Vision for Change but very quietly it was let out that it would come over two years.  There is &euro;15 million for this year.  As I stated to the Minister of State at the time, that will act as a stop-gap or contingency fund for the inadequacies of the budget but it will not go for any direct support or services.  Where and how will the &euro;15 million be allocated?<\/p><p>Last year I had to publicly go with the 95 Project and ask the public to be aware of the chronic and disgraceful treatment of the children of this nation.  I was recently advised that I am not angry enough or my tone is not angry enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#D01100","speaker":"1428","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I have given the Senator over a minute extra.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#E00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>It is not in my personality to be angry or aggressive but I will leave it to the public.

I have been asked to take this matter and I am happy to do so.  From 2012 to 2016, approximately &euro;115 million was added to the Health Service Executive, HSE, mental health budget, which totalled &euro;826 million in 2016.  This represents an increase of &euro;41 million, or 5.2%, over 2015.  The programme for a partnership Government gives a clear commitment to increasing our mental health budget annually, as resources allow, to expand existing services.  Budget 2017 made allowance for an additional &euro;35 million for services to be initiated in 2017.  Key priorities to be addressed in the HSE's 2017 service plan include: youth mental health; further improvement to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and adult services; older people&rsquo;s services; and further enhanced out-of-hours response for those in need of urgent services.  Recognising the time lag in new staff taking up posts and the completion of preparations for the introduction of these services, it is estimated that the revenue spend in 2017 associated with this increased allocation will be approximately &euro;15 million.  There will also be an additional spend of &euro;9.5 million in mental health associated with increased pay rates.  Details of the 2017 development money spending will be finalised with the HSE in the near future in the context of the 2017 HSE mental health division&rsquo;s operational plan for 2017.<\/p> <p>For 2016, an additional &euro;35 million in programme for Government funding was allocated to mental health.  This funding was spent on national mental health priorities as agreed between the Department of Health and the HSE, and as signalled in the HSE's 2016 national service plan.  Funding was issued in three parts.  The first part, totalling approximately &euro;22 million, was issued in June 2016 and used to fund such areas as homeless mental health, service user engagement, the Jigsaw programme, additional counselling and psychology services, and eating disorder posts.<\/p> <p>The second part, totalling &euro;12 million, was issued in August 2016 and used to fund minor works and capital works, both of which addressed difficulties identified by Mental Health Commission inspectors, as well as an increase in psychiatric nurse undergraduate training places.  The final &euro;1 million was allocated in December 2016 and helped fund replacement vehicles for residential mental health units and mental health work by organisations such as Bodywhys, &Aacute;ras Foll&aacute;in, ADD Ireland and Focus Ireland.  In cases where the HSE was unable to spend the full amount allocated to a certain area in 2016, it was reallocated to other mental health areas following sanction from the Department of Health.  For example, &euro;5 million issued for mental health in primary care was used to expand the range of small and minor capital works.<\/p> <p>Mental health priorities for 2016 were agreed between the Department of Health and the HSE.  These were published in the HSE's 2016 national service plan and in more detail in the HSE mental health division's 2016 operational plan.  The breakdown of all mental health funding is available in the HSE mental health division&rsquo;s operational plan, which is published annually.  The 2016 spend on these areas will be included in the forthcoming 2017 operational plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#E00400","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I do not mean to shoot the messenger but I must say that my eyes glazed as the Minister of State was speaking.

The matter has the heading of transparency in mental health budget allocations and whether the Minister of State will agree to disclose where resources have been allocated since October 2016.  The response in many ways outlines the avenues where the funding was spent.  I assure the Senator that with any business I take here on behalf of a Minister or Minister of State, I personally speak to them about the questions raised.  It would be wrong to think I do not do so as I convey those issues on a personal level.  When I take a Topical Issues matter in the D&aacute;il I always speak to the relevant Minister or Ministers.<\/p> <p>I agree with the Senator on a fundamental matter.

The first matter relates to Brexit.  Last week, I raised serious concerns about the threat of a hard Brexit and the serious effect this would have on the Irish economy.  Yesterday, MPs in Westminster voted to invoke Article 50.  A hard Brexit is no longer a threat but, in fact, a reality.<\/p><p>To compound the severity of this development, earlier in the week, the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, stated there would be no special status for Northern Ireland.  This means the likelihood of a hard border on this island has become far more plausible.  Mr. Brokenshire's comments are of particular concern due to the unique position of Northern Ireland.  It is the only part of the UK that has a land border with the European Union.  This, along with the fact that the region voted strongly to remain part of the EU, means special arrangements must be put in place.  Even the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, when in Dublin last week, acknowledged Northern Ireland's special position and pledged that there should be no return to the borders of the past.  Having said that, the lack of any plan on how this would be achieved is a serious concern.  That the Northern Ireland Secretary of State appears to be echoing the language of the DUP is frustrating.  Adding to the difficulty is the cynical manoeuvring of Sinn F&eacute;in in the context of Brexit and the instability brought to Northern Ireland by the collapsing of the Northern Ireland Executive.<\/p><p>Our focus should be on dealing with the real and serious risks facing Northern Ireland, rather than seeking to use the issue to advance other larger constitutional arguments.  Brexit is going to take a greater social and economic toll on Northern Ireland than on anywhere else in the United Kingdom.  Given that it is taking place against the express wishes of the people of Northern Ireland, we need to see a far more constructive approach from the UK Secretary of State.<\/p><p>The second issue I wish to raise relates to the challenges facing our capital in terms of transport and infrastructure and the resulting daily ordeal many of us have in getting to and from our place of work.  Unfortunately, since the economic downturn many of the capital's projects have been delayed or shelved &ndash; the same applies to projects throughout the country.  In the capital, metro north has been delayed and the DART underground appears to be rather uncertain at present.  I welcome the continuing development of the Luas cross city.  I hope it will be a convenient addition to the transport services for those living in Dublin when it is completed.<\/p><p>Yesterday, however, I read with concern an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  It stated that the future of the DART underground was in serious jeopardy due to the Government failing to provide funding to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for the rail line and a critical site for the development of the project on Pearse Street.<\/p><p>As many in the House will know, the proposed 7.5 km line would link the northern line to the Heuston main line, with new underground stations at the docklands, Pearse Street, St. Stephen's Green and Christchurch, as well as a surface station in Inchicore.  The business case put forward by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann outlined how the project provides an efficient and environmentally sustainable alternative to road transport.  Moreover, it provides the capacity to enable growth within an otherwise constrained city centre.  The cost benefit analysis from the report indicated that the project also offered high value for money.<\/p><p>When I read that a project of this importance was in jeopardy, it reinforced my belief in the need to have one person with responsibility for Dublin.  Again, I reiterate the calls made by my party colleague, Deputy John Lahart, and others for the establishment of a Dublin mayor.<\/p><p>We have to look to the future and the quality of life for citizens living in a badly congested city.  Where is the Government's vision for the capital?  How bad will traffic congestion have to get before the Government realises that it must work to deliver capital investment projects like the DART, metro north and the underground expansion of the Luas?<\/p><p>I call on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to clarify the Government's position on DART underground and to publish five, ten and 20-year plans for the infrastructure of our capital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#G00300","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I want to raise two issues.  First, I welcome the UK Supreme Court ruling relating to the flag protests that went on for months and that affected people living in the Short Strand.  Unfortunately, the PSNI chose not to stop the protests going through.  I am pleased that the UK Supreme Court found that the police service had the power to stop them and that it should have done so.  I commend the residents of the Short Strand in Belfast.  They courageously pursued this case through the courts, all the way to the UK Supreme Court to win that particular battle.<\/p> <p>I hope this marks a step change, because we need a step change.  Everyone in the Chamber wants fair policing in the North.  The UK Supreme Court has found that fair policing did not apply.  As a result, people suffered for months.

We stand for election in the North.  We are a 32-county party.  We welcome competition at any stage.  We want to talk about a united Ireland.  We will never apologise for that.<\/p> <p>The next point I want to raise relates to the US President, Mr. Trump.  I know a good deal has been said.  One aspect of particular concern relates to Palestine.  President Trump has signalled strongly that he intends to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem.  That is particularly concerning.  We now have people high up in the Israeli Government saying there is no need to even talk about the need for a Palestinian state anymore.  This has serious repercussions for the people of Palestine.

The picket stems from the frustration felt within the industry across the country but most particularly in Dublin because of the total inaction of the Irish Greyhound Board on the issue of the future of the Harold's Cross track.  The Indecon report published in 2014 showed that, under the board, the Irish greyhound industry was in debt to the tune of &euro;21 million.  It found that the board was challenged and flawed on a number of fronts, including financial governance, doping and performance procedures.  It also found that the financial system in place was flawed.  For that reason, it came up with a number of proposals, one of which was that the Harold's Cross track be sold in anticipation of the zoning being changed from amenity to development land in the Dublin development plan.  Local councillors, some from within the Labour Party, I am glad to say, saw off this proposal and the Harold's Cross track was retained as an amenity, thereby reducing the value of the land.  Despite this, the only action the Irish Greyhound Board has come up with to date to address its &euro;21 million debt involves the selling of the Harold's Cross track.  The board has squandered and wasted money for the past 20 years.  In one instance, it spent millions in developing a new track in Limerick, but it failed to sell the old track.  It has also failed dismally to grow the industry because it has not dealt with the problem of doping.  I congratulate everyone who was in Clonmel for the coursing meetings on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  There is horse racing meeting there today.  The people I met had lost faith in the industry.

Some 1.6 million people in this country suffer from chronic pain.  From a survey taken in the last week, it has now been accepted by GPs across the country that medicinal cannabis, properly dispensed with a prescription, properly controlled and produced in synthetic form to remove its damaging properties, would be good for patients and help to reduce the numbers of painkillers, sleeping tablets, antidepressants and morphine patches those suffering from these ailments have to endure every day.

We need a solution for Ireland that is unique.  We need a solution that will allow an all-Ireland customs union.  That would effectively mean that there would not be a hard border and that we would need controls at ports rather than along the Border with Northern Ireland.  We need a special and unique solution.  Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have to be treated within the negotiations as very special territory.  I ask the Leader to express that view, given that we are in a very difficult situation.<\/p> <p>I also ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the interim, as Brexit moves closer to become a reality, given the huge threat to the agriculture sector, particularly those engaged in intensive farming.

In the past few months many Senators have mentioned that we have a two-tier recovery.  Dublin is glowing.  There seems to be a lot of employment and, as Senator Catherine Ardagh said, there is massive traffic congestion.  However, rural Ireland has been forgotten.  When one looks at health services, schools, shops and post offices or at main streets and town centres, it is clear that it is very difficult for them to remain attractive for businesses.  It is also difficult for people to live and work in rural Ireland.  It is a 23-year plan and the Minister said this morning that public meetings would be held in various areas to discuss it.  If people want to know something these days, they turn on RTE radio and they will hear all of the information the Minister and the Taoiseach are launching.

We are a far cry from where we were ten, 15 or 20 years ago, when if we went abroad we were afraid to even look at a phone never mind use it for fear of hundreds of euro of charges.  It is one very positive thing that the EU has delivered.

I felt that the documentary, while it was very enlightening and interesting, was slightly anecdotal and lacked a bit of balance when it came to mental illness in particular.  There are over 450,000 people in Ireland who are on anti-depressants, and we cannot underestimate how vital and perhaps life changing those drugs are for people in many instances.  It must be said that a review of that area would be a very useful thing for the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to implement.  If indeed the figures are as stark and as worrying as was highlighted in that documentary, we need to be implementing a more structured counselling service in the country in order that general practitioners and other medical professionals can safely recommend and prescribe counselling in certain instances.  That is not to take from the fact, and I cannot stress this enough and I am repeating it, how important and vital these drugs are for some people who have mental illnesses.  I do not think that balance came across in the documentary.  I call on the Minister for Health to investigate the use of prescription medication in addressing mental health nationwide to avoid over-prescription and erroneous prescription.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#J01000","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP, is a prevention option for people at substantial risk of HIV.  It has been approved by the World Health Organization.  Currently, only one medication has been approved for use as PrEP which is marketed under the name of Truvada, and it is a combination of two antiretroviral drugs.  It is also used for HIV treatment in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.  Taken daily, PrEP reduces a person's risk of contracting HIV by more than 99%.<\/p> <p>In light of the permanent ban on gay men donating blood, on a questionnaire from the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, for those who wish to donate blood, question 52 asks whether the individual has taken PrEP in the past five years.  The HSE is engaged in a process to make PrEP available in Ireland, but there is no indication as to how long that will take.  We know that people in Ireland are taking PrEP, perhaps accessed via the Six Counties or Europe.  Sinn F&eacute;in asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for the reasoning behind question 52, and he said in a reply that I received this morning, \"Question 52 was added to the IBTS Donor Health &amp;amp; Lifestyle Questionnaire on 16 January this year when the permanent deferral of men who have sex with men ... from donating blood was changed from a lifetime ban to a 12 month deferral from the most recent sexual contact with another man.\"  Essentially, I or any other man who has sex with a man has to wait 12 months to donate blood.  That is not in line with international best practice of around three months.<\/p> <p>I am informed by the Minister that the reason question 52 is on the questionnaire is, \"Persons who have taken medication to prevent HIV infection, i.e. ... PrEP ... are [now] deferred for a 5 year period.\"  This is a massive U-turn in terms of LGBT rights and in terms of the commitment for gay men to donate blood.  While I will admit it is possible after a 12 month period, we are increasing that fivefold for those who have taken PrEP.  I want the Minister, Deputy Harris, to come into this House and address this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#J01100","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>On the issue of cannabis, I know that the Minister has been working on legislation to make this available to people and I support his endeavours in this regard because I believe it would be a very useful adjunct in treating people with various ailments.<\/p> <p>I want to return to the issue of Brexit, which was raised, and indeed the Leader of the Opposition's comments around traffic congestion in Dublin.  She is quite right to say that with the economy returning to strength in Dublin and with the efforts to make that happen throughout the country, this is going to be an issue.  Brexit itself will provide many challenges, which we are aware of, but it will also provide many opportunities in the Irish Financial Services Centre and other centres.  We hear unofficially that many companies have already decided to come here without making much of a brouhaha about it because of other sensitivities.  Hundreds of jobs are coming our way already, and thousands may into the future.  The challenges that will present are around housing and accommodation, office accommodation and, as has already been mentioned, transport.<\/p> <p>Ireland has already made a special case, which is accepted, and using the precedent of the unification of West and East Germany, we have an opportunity through the European Investment Bank to avail of moneys off book and allow us expedite the infrastructure that we need.  In particular I am talking about the metro, which is now more important than ever.  Dublin Airport's stunning performance in terms of additional visitors to this country will be undermined if we cannot address the infrastructural deficit, not just with regard to the metro, which is critical and which will have the capacity to produce its own income to repay loans due through fares, but also roads, which have already restricted development.  A major development in Belcamp was refused recently by Fingal County Council, which had no other option because of lack of road access.<\/p> <p>These need to be addressed urgently, because there is no better place for housing.  The land is all in Fingal.  Some 75 acres have already been rezoned for office development in Dublin Airport which has not been put to full use yet.  The original Dublin Airport plan for 10,000 jobs is already afoot.  We have an opportunity to get up to 50,000 new jobs in this area.  In terms of infrastructure, it will serve the rest of the country, with park and ride coming into that area.  It will be useful for getting into town, for international business people commuting, and for tourists to access the rest of the country.  For all these it is critical there is a metro like they have in Heathrow, where one can hop onto a train into London.  Why not the same for Dublin?<\/p> <p>Again, I welcome the Government's initiative to avail of the European Investment Bank capacity to fund these off book, and I do hope that metro will receive the priority that it should.  It will help relieve the traffic congestion that the Leader of the Opposition has already mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#J01200","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I call Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.

I can think of names like Conway, Kelly, Bannon, Spicer and Pence.  They want to give a certain view of the Irish-American experience.  It is important that Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and Irish people across the world take a stand on St. Patrick's Day and in that week.  We must remind the world that we know intimately what it is like to leave this country, what it meant to be on a coffin ship and takes to overcome sectarian hatred, deal with terrorism and division and seek peace.  We must take stock of the experience in our own country.  <br\/><br\/>I make reference to the recent goings on in Ballaghaderreen when local representatives were shown up completely by local people when asked to accept 80 Syrian refugees into their own community.  I pay tribute to Mary Gallagher who I believe owns a small shop in Ballaghaderreen.  When asked by RTE how she felt about the situation, she asked how, when one saw children being picked out of clay, could one say no.  However, political representatives in that part of the world were slow in being as welcoming as she was.  We in this House have a responsibility to work on a cross-party basis to ensure we will implement the recommendations made in the McMahon report on direct provision.  We now have an opportunity to sort out our own house.  We can say to the rest of the world that we are an emigrant nation, that we understand intimately the needs of emigrants across the world and that we will not allow the Irish story to be hijacked by the right-wing white national viewpoint of those who surround President Trump.<br\/><br\/><b>Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/b>I refer to the domiciliary care allowance and the high number of appeals that arise from applications made to the Department of Social Protection.  As Senators will know, the domiciliary care allowance is about &euro;309 per month and paid to the carer of a child under 16 years of age with a severe disability.  He or she must be living at home and require full-time care and attention, over and above the care and attention normally required by a child of that age.  I am disturbed by the high number of appeals.  In some cases applicants have been forced to pursue the matter through the courts to get justice.  The Department has released figures for 2016 that show there were approximately 7,434 applications and that 1,344 appeals were lodged.  The most startling figure was that of the 1,344 appeals lodged, as many as 1,065 were successful.  That shows clearly that there is an issue with how applications are determined.  Another issue worth considering is the time taken to process an application.  It takes approximately 14 weeks for a decision to be made on an initial application.  The hearing of an appeal takes up to 30 weeks.  The figures clearly show that there is something wrong with how the Department considers applications and appeals.  I urge the Leader to ask the Minister for Social Protection to consider the matter and put a mechanism in place to inform the carers of children in this category at an early stage about their entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#J01400","speaker":"1410","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I welcome the announcement made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the formation of a tillage forum.

It is important that we note that he has invited farmers, professional bodies in the agriculture sector, as well as environmental organisations to give their views in the next three months.  Details of the consultation process can be found on the Commission's website.

Other challenges include addressing the impact of Brexit, the effects the Russian import ban has had on agriculture, the slump in milk prices following the downturn and the lifting of quotas, market volatility and diversity.

Ireland has been ranked ahead of the United Kingdom which has been ranked 16th and the United States which has been ranked 21st.  As a country, Ireland needs to be open, mature and confident enough to take its place among the nations.  We can ask the United Kingdom and the United States to work with us.  As Ireland is located between the two, we must be at the vanguard in promoting democratic rights.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We must highlight to President Trump all that is good on the island of Ireland.

The arms of the State must support the collection of taxes, whether for hospitals, housing, supports for rural areas and so on.  Our tax base must be supported and sustained.  In early January, I contacted the Revenue Commissioners to highlight allegations that national lottery staff were giving tax avoidance advice to lottery winners in respect of gift tax, inheritance tax and several other taxes.  In the excitement of winning a large amount of money, people will most likely take any advice they receive from the national lottery.  In some cases, it is alleged, that the advice was to form a syndicate where none existed before.  I am deeply disturbed that the lottery licence may have been granted to agencies which see fit to help people to defraud our tax system.<\/p> <p>I have not yet had a response from Revenue to my query but evidence that was recently put before the courts indicates such activity did take place in the past.  We do not know for how long it went on.  The Minister must come to the House to assure us that the current licensee is not giving tax avoidance advice, which would constitute a breach of the tax code.  There must be an assessment of the previous licensee to ascertain what advice it gave customers and whether it colluded in the avoidance of tax.  A former lottery claims manager told the High Court that he advised sole winners that they possibly could form a syndicate even where it was not in existence prior to the win.  This is a clear breach of law and, if the allegations are correct, tax was forgone.  We are all agreed on the importance of bringing in foreign direct investment.  For that and other reasons, the integrity of our tax system is important.  A licensee of the State cannot be allowed to collude in the breaching of the tax code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#L00200","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>We need to be very careful in discussing the issue raised by Senator Humphreys given there is an ongoing court case concerning a lottery claim.  My understanding, having sold many lottery tickets over the years in my former role as a retailer, is that people are advised to sign the back of their ticket after purchase. When the national lottery pays out on a win, payment goes to the persons who signed the ticket.  If a ticket is presented that has been signed by a number of people, it is deemed that they will share in the prize.  A syndicate is really only a word for a number of people claiming the one prize.  However, I take the Senator's point on board and it is important we have clarification on this matter.<\/p> <p>Recent reports by the BBC and Channel 4 and other media regarding the practice of waterboarding by the British Government in Northern Ireland in the 1970s are a cause for serious concern.  We have had a great deal of reconciliation and progress as a result of the peace process in the past ten or 15 years but the whole situation is still in its infancy and we have a long way to go in terms of building reconciliation in the North.  I encourage the Government to do even more to facilitate, engage with and develop the processes of reconciliation.  The British Government, meanwhile, has a responsibility to order an inquiry into the very serious and credible allegations regarding waterboarding and other torture methods used in 1972 against a 17 year old.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach must raise this issue with the Northern Ireland Secretary, Mr. Brokenshire, and the Prime Minister, Ms May.  It is the only fair way to proceed.<\/p> <p>I tabled a motion in the House last week, which was very well received, one aspect of which was the recognition that we cannot move forward unless we understand and acknowledge the wrongs of the past and the good that happened in the past.  To move forward with a sense of confidence and ambition for Northern Ireland and the island as a whole, an ambition we all share, we must understand and acknowledge what happened in the past, on all sides, bad as some of it was.  It is incumbent on the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Taoiseach to raise this matter with people at the highest possible levels in the British Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#L00300","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>One of the aspects of Brexit that does not seem to have gained much traction, and in respect of which there is a serious complacency on the part of Government, is the question of its implications for the energy security of the State.  Ireland has very few natural energy resources, meaning we have to import most of what we need.  Perhaps the Government has been made complacent by the commencement of gas production at Corrib at the end of 2015, but that supply will decline within five years.  We must avoid putting all our eggs in that basket.<\/p><p>There was an interesting article by Joe Brennan in <i>The Irish Times <\/i>on Tuesday, in which he refers to a report by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies which expresses concern that Ireland might be effectively cut off from continental Europe's gas market when the UK leaves the EU.  The UK might try to gain leverage in the talks, a representative of the institute noted, by arguing it offers the cheapest way to provide security of supply to Irish customers.  The report states that Ireland will need to build a dedicated terminal to import liquefied natural gas and convert it back into gas.<\/p><p>In that context, it is all the more amazing that we have had only an astounding silence from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in respect of a particular project that is in line with the recommendations in the report to which I referred.  That project is located in the Shannon Estuary in north Kerry, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach will know, and is shovel ready, all planning stages having been completed.  Furthermore, the State owns the property, it contains natural waterways and there is very little investment required in terms of docking and marine site facilities.  The delay in bringing the project to fruition has been going on for years.  Four months ago, a group representing all political parties in the county, business interests and community groups, and headed up by the mayor of Kerry, met the Minister, Deputy Naughten, to discuss the status of the project.  We have heard nothing since.  Members are probably bored of hearing me raise this issue by now.<\/p><p>I call on the Leader once again to ask the Minister to set up a task force or interdepartmental group to work on this project, which is vital for our long-term energy security.  It is a clean, safe and environmentally friendly project that will safeguard our energy needs into the distant future and create a huge number of jobs in an area that has been badly let down in the past ten or 12 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#L00400","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>The Senator has made his point very well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#L00500","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>Senators &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Feighan spoke eloquently on the issue of migration, with particular reference to Ireland's heritage and record in this regard.

We need to have clarity about the EU deals that are being signed in respect of the externalisation of EU borders and Ireland's position in that regard.  We also need to have clarity on how Ireland sees itself responding to the changes in the USA, including for example, how we will respond to programme refugees from Somalia who were due to arrive in the US.  What is our position with regard to the situation on the island of Nauru?  Migrants on that island are in a shocking and appalling situation and it seems that they will also be let down in terms of their arrangement with the United States.

The Taoiseach has been actively engaged across Europe and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, was here this week.  The Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputies Charlie Flanagan and Dara Murphy, and other Ministers are traversing Europe and the world to highlight the importance of Ireland being considered as a special case in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations.  The issue of the North is one that the Taoiseach has, at all times, stressed.

Those of us who are Members of this and the Lower House must work actively with the Government in that regard.<\/p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor also spoke about the importance of rural Ireland.  I would remind her that her party's national spatial strategy was a failure.  It fell victim to parish pump politics and many other things that were wrong in our country.  I would point out to the Senator that we now have a national rural action plan, launched recently, which contains 270 specified actions and is backed by an investment by Government of &euro;60 million.  I am sure the Senator will join me in welcoming that action plan.  Hopefully we will see more people employed in and a rejuvenation of rural Ireland.  <\/p> <p>Senator Noone spoke about the recent RTE programme on prescription drugs.  Several good points were made yesterday during the debate on the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016.  I am happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss this issue.

As Chairman of the previous health committee who travelled to the HSE medical card centre to discuss its processing mechanisms, I believe it might be something for the Senator to take up with the Minister at the committee.<\/p><p>I join Senator Tim Lombard in welcoming the announcement of the tillage grain forum.  It is important to give farmers who have lost a considerable amount of income in the awful autumn weather an opportunity to have a plan for the future.  Senator Boyhan raised the important topic of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and I thank him for doing so.  This is about the future of Europe and the agricultural sector is very important to Ireland.  The point made by Senator Boyhan is one we should not lose in the context of the impact it has in respect of Brexit, relationships with Russia and globalisation.  The Senator correctly stated that we should encourage those involved in the farming community to engage in an important consultation process.  We might have a discussion about how the House can play a role in that as well.<\/p><p>The Cathaoirleach has made a ruling regarding the Brexit committee.  From speaking to the leaders at the leaders' group meeting this week, I am aware that it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but we are anxious, as a House, to stand united in having a Brexit committee.  The Cathaoirleach is equally adamant about that.  I hope we will have that progressed.  I have not got any further information for the Senator but I am aware it is a matter that the Cathaoirleach, as Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, will pursue as well.<\/p><p>Senator Humphreys raised the issue of the tax collection system.  It is a matter before the courts.  I will not delve into it, but I would be disappointed if the national lottery was issuing information to people about avoiding tax payment.  I do not believe that organisation might be doing that.  There was a comment attributed to the national lottery in a newspaper recently where, as part of a press statement, the national lottery stated it did not do that and that it actively advises winners on the use of independent consultants.  Let me add, I have not spoken to any lottery winners.  If it is the case, then it is certainly something that should be looked into.<\/p><p>Senator Conway also raised the issue of the lottery.  He spoke about the issue of waterboarding in the North in terms of reconciliation.  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, we must learn from the past.  We must engage in reconciliation.  I hope that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will take up the remarks of the Senator.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Higgins, I would be happy to have a debate on migration.  The Senator is correct in terms of domestic violence.  As a country, we have led in many ways in terms of our legislation.  The T&aacute;naiste recently launched the new policy and I would be happy to have her come to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#M02900","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I am aware of the T&aacute;naiste's commitment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017020200002#N00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1486031400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>It is something that we should do.
