I also welcome Mr. Tom Parlon, a former Minister.  I thank all of the witnesses for their attendance here this afternoon.  I propose that we hear the witnesses in the order that I introduced them.<br\/>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statements and any other documents they have submitted to the committee may be published on the committee's website once this meeting has concluded.<br\/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br\/>Before I call the witnesses I wish to make some comments.  As everyone will be aware, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has asked the committee to scrutinise the heads of the general scheme of the planning and development (No. 1) Bill 2014 and to report to him prior to the Bill being published.  We have met officials from the Department to consider the issue and we will have one further meeting with witnesses this day next week to discuss the issue further.  We have invited a number of organisations to address us at these meetings.  We have also received a number of written submissions from a number of organisations and individuals on the issues.<br\/>I call the Construction Industry Federation to deliver its opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000003#H00500","speaker":"996","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421763600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The general scheme of the planning and development (No. 1) Bill addresses the following key issues: a review of Part V of the Planning and  Development Act 2000; the proposed vacant site levy; reduced development contributions for planning permission yet to be activated; and modification of the duration of planning permission in certain circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  I will outline CIF's views on each issue.  The first key issue is a review of Part V.  The general scheme provides that there is no longer justification for providing 10% of affordable housing under Part V of the Planning and Development Act.  However, the requirement for 10% social housing is being retained.  On-site provision of social housing is to be the predominant default option for developers and local authorities under the new Part V arrangements.  The general scheme of the Bill provides that the alternative off-site option should only be possible in specific exceptional circumstances, for example, where there is insufficient social housing demand at the location of the proposed development and where there is greater demand in another location.<\/p>  <p>  The definition of an existing use value is being modified to reflect the value prior to date of commencement of development and disregards the value of any buildings on the land that are to be demolished.  In the past, planning authorities had the option of accepting a monetary payment as an alternative to land or social housing units from developers.  It is now proposed that the monetary payments shall no longer be an alternative option for completed units or land.<\/p>  <p>  CIF has long called for the review of Part V as it is not sustainable in its current format.  It has previously advocated for the abolition of Part V in its current format, and its replacement with a 1% contribution by the seller in respect of every residential unit sold, both new and existing.  In the case of new homes, this will be paid by the developer and in the case of existing homes, this will be paid by the seller.  If a 1% contribution had applied in 2013, the measure would have yielded &euro;61 million for the Exchequer.  The revenue could have been used as seed capital to fund social housing programmes and could have been leveraged by the voluntary housing sector.  For 2014, a levy of this nature would have yielded &euro;81 million.<\/p>  <p>  While the reduction in the new per cent rule to 10% is to be welcomed, the removal of the additional options for compliance with Part V, including monetary payment, is unreasonable and will ultimately be difficult to implement.<\/p> <p>In the case of high-density residential developments where management charges apply, will local authorities be prepared to pay the management charges that will apply for these new developments to management companies?  These charges could be in the region of &euro;2,000 for each housing unit required under Part V.  There will be many instances in which high-density schemes developed in the private sector may be unsuited to the requirements of local authorities.  In this regard, the industry strongly advocates the retention of all the options for compliance with Part V, including delivery of units off-site and the payment of monetary compensation <i>in lieu<\/i>, which could then be used at local authorities' discretion in meeting social housing requirements.<br\/>With regard to the definition of &quot;existing use value&quot;, the proposal to disregard the value of any buildings on the land that are to be demolished is unreasonable.  The owner, in complying with the Part V requirement on lands, which includes existing buildings, should be compensated for the proportionate value of such buildings that must be demolished in order to meet the Part V requirement.<br\/>I will now deal with the vacant site levy.  The proposed vacant site levy may be activated in respect of vacant or under-utilised sites where there is a failure to commence development authorised by a planning permission for a vacant or under-utilised sites within three years of the granting of permission or to lodge a planning application in respect of the site within three years of the making of the development plan or scheme.  While the logic of legislating for a vacant site levy is well understood, there are many genuine reasons a development may not commence within the stated timeframe of three years from the granting of planning permission, including economic and financial reasons.  Where it can be proven that sustainable demand for the scheme granted planning permission does not exist or where it can be proven that the market value of the completed asset will be less than the all-in construction cost, there should be an exemption available in respect of the imposition of the levy.<br\/>I will now deal with the reduced development contributions for planning permissions yet to be activated.  The proposed provisions with regard to the provision of reduced development contributions for planning permissions yet to activated are welcomed by the industry.  This has the effect of reducing the bureaucracy associated with making new planning applications in order to get the benefit of reduced development contributions which have been adopted by local authorities.  Notwithstanding this, the rates of development contribution applicable are still too high.  The rates have not decreased in line with movements in the market valuation of completed developments.  Local authorities must be urged to review further the development contribution rates currently applicable.  There must also be flexibility to facilitate the payment of development contributions as revenue streams become available from the transactions of new development works.<br\/>The proposal to modify the duration of planning permissions in certain circumstances, involving the use of a use-it-or-lose-it approach for future planning permissions for housing projects for a period not exceeding two years, will result in difficulties in the industry.  Generally speaking, planning permission is attached to land rather than an individual planning applicant.  If planning permission of a particular nature is appropriate for a specific development, it should be appropriate for that development no matter who the ultimate developer of the lands will be.  Introducing a provision of this nature may also prove problematic for some funders in that a new risk is being introduced from a funding perspective whereby the planning permission may have a reduced lifetime.<br\/>There are a number of other issues we would like to see dealt with in the context of the awaited planning Bill.  We want a simplified process for changing planning approvals for house types approved in previous planning permissions; a simplified process, including a timeframe, for approval of planning compliance documentation submitted to planning authorities - this should involve a default process; a simplified taking-in-charge process, to include a default process; the enabling of planning permission where there is a deficit in environmental or wastewater services, subject to the availability of a connection agreement with Irish Water; provision for economic viability testing to form part of a planning process to facilitate the granting of planning permission where, for example, reduced densities or alternative house types are required; and a simplified planning processes for making amendments to strategic development zones.  These are some of the issues we would ultimately like to see addressed in the context of new planning legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000004#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421764200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fitzpatrick.

I will give a brief summary of the paper we have submitted.  The Housing Agency, the sustainable communities agency, was established in 2012.<\/p> <p>Approaches to Part V need to be more efficient, and its practical implementation and delivery must be linked to statutory timeframes, thereby binding the local authority and the applicant to agreements, schedules and timelines.  The general scheme of the Bill does not advance this.  Furthermore, housing authorities need to be able to advise on specific housing needs in specific parts of their area and address them with targeted and pre-identifed housing types.  There is a fear that local authorities will not have the staff or expertise to deliver this, or to ensure adequate social housing is provided in a given area.  Given the rapidly improving market in Dublin in particular, the provision of an element of affordable housing could be considered, particularly in larger cities and the greater Dublin area.  This matter needs to be given regional consideration and we need to ensure enough measures on the supply side to ensure affordability.<\/p> <p> Our members have highlighted significant difficulties with the vacant site levy as drafted in the heads of the Bill.  There is no doubt that preventing land hoarding is laudable, but what is proposed in the heads of the Bill is considered problematic.  There are many reasons a site might not be brought forward for development, and proving land withholding purely for commercial gain would be fraught with difficulty.  Head 5B of the general scheme states the levy is aimed at enabling local authorities to incentivise the development of big sites.  The incentive to develop through an unspecified reduction in capital contributions payable comes attached to a penalty for failure to develop.  In other words, the penalty is quantified but the incentive is not.<\/p> <p> The complexity of the proposed process and the opportunities to avoid the levy seem to undermine seriously the objective of the legislation.  There are concerns about whether local authorities will have the resources and expertise to carry out this work.  Overall, the institute is of the opinion that if a levy is to be apportioned to vacant property, consideration should be given to a broad site or land value tax as an alternative to the vacant site levy.  We suggest this to avoid a patchwork of piecemeal fiscal incentives.  Furthermore, any tax levy introduced should have a mechanism to ensure land in public ownership is subject to it.  All of these difficulties are bolstered by the fact that \"vacant\" and \"underutilised\" are not defined in the general scheme.  Defining these will be difficult.<\/p> <p> With regard to reduced development contributions, the institute supports the key aim that future development contribution schemes must promote sustainable development patterns, secure investment in capital infrastructure and encourage economic activity.  More emphasis needs to be placed on time periods and providing more consistency in general for development contribution schemes.  There is concern that uncertainty about development contributions could hold up development due to fears that schemes which are currently viable may become unviable.  There is also a requirement for a mechanism to assist funding local infrastructure upfront to speed up the delivery of housing and commercial projects.  In the UK, revolving infrastructure funds are being introduced as a funding mechanism prior to infrastructure developments being completed.  Consideration should be given to such a proactive fund here.<\/p> <p> The use it or lose it proposal, whereby planning permission may be revoked if development does not proceed within a certain timeframe, risks reducing supply by increasing uncertainty for developers and investors.  We are unclear as to what will be achieved through this amendment.  In a normally functioning market this provision would have an impact, but we seriously question the introduction of this provision in the extremely volatile and unstable market we have at present.  Furthermore, the principle proposed under the heads conflicts with the basic structure of the planning system, creating uncertainty and a lack of confidence in the system.<\/p> <p> We raised a number of miscellaneous issues in our submission to the committee.  The existing planning legislation has a number of deficiencies and no proposal in the general scheme addresses these.  We will flesh out these deficiencies with the Department.<\/p> <p> We acknowledge the publication of the heads of the planning and development (No. 2) Bill and will comment on them in future.  Regarding another issue that we brought to the committee's attention, we are seeking for the term \"planner\" to be defined in legislation to ensure continuing transparency and credibility within the planning system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000005#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Skehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421765100,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hughes.

They should not take it as read that what they hear today is the general consensus of the committee.  We will digest and investigate all that has been recommended before making recommendations of our own.<\/p>  <p>  It should be taken as read that any new planning and development Bill should take cognisance of the recommendations of the recent tribunals, given the Government's commitment in response to same.  I hope that the Government will show the colour of its money in that regard and let it be the foundation of any new Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I will address the main issues raised by the witnesses.  I am interested in expanding further on the Construction Industry Federation's submission on Part V and its claim that the affordability element has gone out the door.  That may well be the case.  The CIF believes that 10% of each development should be retained for the provision of social housing.  It supported this contention by claiming that, had a 1% levy been applied last year, &euro;61 million would have been generated.  This year, it would generate more than &euro;80 million.  Will the witnesses compare this with the level of spending that was available to local authorities for the provision of social housing, be it done directly or alongside housing agencies?  We need a breakdown on a county-by-county basis if representatives are to see whether what the witnesses are proposing has the potential to be of greater benefit to local authorities and counties than the current scheme does or the Bill's provisions would.<\/p>  <p>  I will turn to the issues of changes to planning approvals and the State agencies being immediately informed of planning applications as they arise in local authorities.  Many agencies have national policies that may be more applicable to certain regions than to the nation as a whole.  When informed by local authorities of certain applications, they feel the need to impose an inappropriate national policy on a region.  This approach prolongs the process for many applications and does not allow the requisite throughput.<\/p>  <p>  Most local authorities adopt a haphazard approach to taking estates in charge.  It is like our haphazard approach to the social dividend that the State was to derive from NAMA properties.  It is incumbent on the authorities, the Government and the Department to consider putting in place in local authorities dedicated NAMA units as well as dedicated and properly resourced planning enforcement offices.  In my county and elsewhere, the staff in planning departments is minimal and the expectation under existing legislation warrants more work being done than is actually the case, but resources are not available to local authorities to make these departments effective.<\/p> <p>An obligation must be placed on Government that forthcoming legislation will be supported with the necessary funding and resources in order for local authorities to do their job effectively and properly.<\/p> <p> In terms of the policing of bonds, I have seen the efforts and associated costs made by local authorities to enforce insurance agencies, insurance companies and banks to meet their side of the bargain when it comes to cashing in a bond.  Many of the so-called pillar banks have been found most wanting in their application of reinstatement works.  That is not good enough and the issue must be addressed.  This situation only heightens the case for a proper, efficient and well-resourced enforcement office in the planning sections of local authorities.  It would mean local authorities could do their job effectively and easily, thus benefiting the communities that they represent.<\/p> <p> The National Association of Building Co-Operatives, NABCO, has stated that amendments must be revenue neutral in terms of any developer who was in the business of making social housing available in the locality.  The idea has some merit.  We do not expect developers to make money on the back of social housing but we expect a social dividend, as I said about NAMA in the same fashion, and because lands must be zoned appropriately to meet the needs not only of the general market but also of the social market.  I acknowledge what the delegations have said but the proposal needs to be beefed up.<\/p> <p> There was a question on the use it or lose it concept and the hoarding of land.  The practicalities of that and the message that is being given to the public is a very good one when one considers what happened in the past ten, 12 or 15 years during the property boom.  The CIF mentioned an economic viability test which is a notion that needs to be further explored.  It is something that could sell.  A proper template would allow local authorities to measure economic viability but it would have to be regionalised and conscious that markets differ from one area to another.  For example, there has been a boom in the east coast market and in Dublin, but that is not the case down the country.  An economic viability test would differ from region to region.  I would like the matter explored.  It could be considered but there must be proper regional balance for it to make sense and to fly, as it were.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000007#N00300","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421765400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy addressing one particular group?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000008#O00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1421765400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Both speakers have touched on these issues.  From my perspective and that of my party, for a new planning and development Act to work effectively, we must learn from the lessons of the past and present in terms of how permission is enforced.  That is the big issue.  Even if a local authority in my county, for example, has the best will in the world and the best intentions, only one person works in the enforcement office.  I know they do not have the labour resources, let alone the financial resources, to allow them to work effectively and properly on behalf of the public, especially considering all we have supposedly learned.  We must do all that we can more effectively and more properly, thus getting a greater dividend.  This business and aspect of the economy are proving to be essential and important.  Therefore, benefits will accrue to all sectors of the economy.  This will only happen when local authorities are given the proper tools and resources to manage the situation effectively and properly into the future.  It would mean that the local economy would derive a greater benefit from a social perspective and a public benefit perspective.  There must be a firm and honest commitment given to resource local authorities adequately, thus allowing them to do their job effectively.<\/p>  <p>  Various submissions had merit.  My initial reaction and that of any other member, however, cannot be taken as read.  Much more in-depth analysis must take place before we can support amending the existing Planning and Development Act which does not meet the requirements of business currently.<\/p> <p>We have been very slow to amend it properly and effectively to meet current demand and allow the sector to be sustained and grow, and also to have a social element we can stand over such that we can say people from all walks of society, rather than just one, are benefiting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000008#O00300","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421765700,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cowen.

I noted that the speaker from the Construction Industry Federation regarded the provisions in Part V as unreasonable.  I draw the federation's attention to a practice that has occurred in the past.  When the wealthiest areas of Dublin - Dalkey and Ballsbridge being two good examples - were built, houses were built for the wealthy.  Behind them, houses were built for less-wealthy people who in many cases actually worked for the well off.  One reason it is important we do not take on board the federation's suggestion is that travelling is so difficult, particularly in the greater Dublin area and also in Cork and Galway.  The more people who have short distances to travel to work, the better.  If we continue with trying to build a socially divided city, we will be left with even greater problems than we have at present.  I hope we will not take on board the suggestions made in this regard.  I really do not understand the rationale for the delegates' argument, other than that it may suit certain developers.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue I would like to raise concerns the question of vacant sites.  Many towns and cities have many vacant sites that are an eyesore.  It does not really matter whether the locations are big, such as Dublin, or small towns around the country.  Could Ms Hughes, or anyone who feels able to comment on this, go back over how she envisages the provisions in this area could be strengthened?  I did not get the impression that she is against doing something about vacant sites but that she wants the job to be done as effectively as possible.

House prices today are still approximately 40% to 50% lower than they were some six or seven years ago, yet the input costs have not adjusted to reflect that.  There are still many parts of the country where it is not viable to build.  That is why we do not have a recovery of house-building activity at present.  We all know there is a sustainability requirement of upwards of 18,000 or 19,000 houses per annum, yet the output is closer to 11,000 units.  It will take time for housing output to recover.  This will happen only if we address input costs, through adjustment, or the sale price must increase.  The only input costs that can be reduced are costs such as those associated with Part V, development levies or the VAT added to the sale price of a house.  If we want an increase in housing output to meet sustainably the demand and help prevent unnecessary rises in the number on social housing waiting lists, we must bring housing output to a level that meets demand in the sustainable manner.<\/p>  <p>  When the proposal was put forward for a levy on the sale of all homes, both new and second hand, we made our calculations based on the sale price of units from the property price register.<\/p> <p>If one considers the total value of transactions in each of the last two years, one can see that it would have produced in excess of &euro;60 million in 2013 and in excess of &euro;80 million in 2014.

The industry has an ongoing problem with bonds.  By and large, many local authorities require open-ended bonds.  There is a serious reluctance on the part of local authorities to adequately deal with the taking-in-charge process in a timely manner.  This needs to happen so that these bonds, particularly those relating to developments that are well completed, are released on a timely basis.  That is why we would support a revised taking-in-charge process after taking-in-charge applications are made to local authorities.  Local authorities should have to respond within a fixed period of time, as they have to do in cases of planning applications, outlining the snags on a development that have to be addressed.  If local authorities do not respond to taking-in-charge applications within a fixed timeframe, there should be a process for default in the same way that one can get planning by permission by default if a local authority does not address these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000010#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hubert Fitzpatrick"},{"type":"speech","time":1421766000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>It is not the case that everyone has the same view on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000010#Q00900","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1421766000,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I am going to move on.

As an institute, we have serious concerns about how effective a levy will be.  We should consider the effectiveness of the vacant site levy in the context of the derelict site legislation.  We should look at how effective or ineffective the 3% levy that is apportioned to derelict sites has been in terms of stimulating the development of derelict sites.  We also need to look at the reasons these sites are not being developed.  In many instances, although not all, there are issues of funding, of course, but also issues of land assembly and title.  In that regard, the institute supports more proactive measures, such as the strengthening of the compulsory purchase powers of local authorities in terms of site assembly.  Perhaps those powers could be broadened to facilitate things like residential developments, for which they have traditionally not been used simply because cases have not been made for their use.  The compulsory purchase powers of local authorities need to be streamlined so that they become more effective.  Consideration could be given to establishing a revolving fund that would be used to stimulate and incentivise the development of these sites, as opposed to proposing a levy which could hinder their potential development in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000010#Q01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Hughes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421766300,"counter":40,"content":"<p>To add to that, the reforming of our CPO legislation has been talked about for many decades but has not happened.  This is yet another example of something that should be looked at urgently and brought forward to enable local authorities, perhaps together with an agency established by Government, to tackle derelict sites in a proactive way by acquiring sites through a rolling fund and making them available for building.  They have to be built and delivered as part of the arrangement to sell them on and using the funding from that to buy the next one.  This would bring about the regeneration of urban areas which have considerable capacity to deliver on housing in very sustainable locations.  That could also be used to help regenerate our town centres through promoting in a proactive way town centre retail development.

I will start with Mr. Hubert Fitzpatrick's contribution in respect of putting timelines on local authorities.  The rules of engagement prevent me from saying what I want to say but I am gobsmacked.  There may be some local authorities where that is the case but my experience has been that his members, developers, have been chased by local authorities and public representatives for years to try to get them to finish off basic infrastructure within estates, such as footpaths, put in place manhole covers and fix sewerage that is not working.  I can take him to some of these estates, including one which is very close to me that I have been chasing for the past 12 or 13 years.  Others which have been successful took five, eight and ten years to complete.  Bonds have been allowed to lapse by developers, by his members, yet the representative has come before the committee to say that timelines need to be put on local authorities.  I do not necessarily have a problem with that but the timelines need to be put on developers.  The country is full of estates which are a quarter and half finished; I can take the representative on a tour of them.  The Construction Industry Federation has a duty to ensure its members are putting the infrastructure in place for the people who bought the houses for which they paid boom time prices and are living in shambolic conditions.  That is the first point.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the federation's position on Part V, how will its proposed 1% levy help social integration?  Deputy Robert Dowds referred to the example in part of Dublin where different types of houses were built in different areas, including Victorian type houses, resulting in social segregation.  How does the federation intend to counter that Victorian type of housing practice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000011#R00300","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1421766300,"counter":42,"content":"<p>That was actually better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000011#R00400","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1421766300,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Yes, it was in some ways but I will come to that in a moment.  How does the federation see a 1% levy helping social integration as opposed to Part V?  While Part V was not perfect - I would be critical of some aspects of it including some aspects which may have held up the industry, which I do not want to do, as we want to ensure that new houses are coming on stream - overall, if we take it in the mix and if worked properly, it was beneficial.  Why is it that the members of the federation insisted on not having Part V?  The idea behind Part V was the delivery of social housing but also social integration.  I would happily take the members of the delegations present or Members on a tour of some of the estates to show what has happened in some of them.  I could show them a couple of examples of where their members got away with putting all the social housing into one corner.  I remember reading about Liverpool in Victorian times and streets where the sun never shone on houses on each side of the street because they were too close together.  I can take the representatives to an example of where that happened in County Laois, where a developer bullied planning officials who should not have caved in, to grant planning permission for such houses.<\/p> <p>The irony of it is that there are cattle grazing in the field beside it.  These are built on the edge of an estate.  Mr. Parlon might be aware of them, being a former public representative for the constituency.  There are cattle grazing on green grass and beside them are houses shoved face to face, front door to front door, with less than 3 m between them.  I can show the witnesses that.  The set on Coronation Street has more space.  It is an absolutely scandalous situation.<\/p> <p> I wish to hear from the delegates on how they propose ensuring that social housing units are peppered properly throughout an estate.  The estate I live in has social housing.  My next door neighbour on one side is in a social housing unit.  I have no problem with this.  The units are peppered reasonably well throughout the estate.  I can show the delegates examples of where that was done and where it was not done.  Is the CIF in favour of doing this?  Is the Irish Planning Institute in favour of continuing with that type of social integration because it is, to my mind, important that we have that type of social integration. <\/p> <p> On the delivery of the Government's programme over the next six years, how do the delegates view the provision on some of these units being provided by social leasing?<\/p> <p> The vacant site levy has become a problem.  This is an issue on which the delegates can help.  Some people have not registered their ownership of sites to avoid the existing derelict sites levy.  This levy is very weak and I brought forward a Bill to strengthen it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000011#R00500","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421766600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Six minutes time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000012#S00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1421766600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Some owners of sites and developers are not registering to avoid that, and financial institutions, including pillar banks, which we have certainly had the chase on it.

We have this great need on the one hand and on the other hand we have people sitting on these assets, letting them go derelict and not doing anything with them except waiting for the price to go up.<\/p>  <p>  On the reduced development contributions, perhaps the Irish Planning Institute delegates would stay here to comment on this issue.  To my mind, something else was pushing up the cost more than development contributions.  Development contributions were &euro;4,000 to &euro;6,000, &euro;7,000 or &euro;8,000 but the little plot of land - very small plots of land in many cases - that the house was popped down on was costing up to &euro;40,000, &euro;50,000 and &euro;60,000.

I ask the delegates for their view on that.<\/p>  <p>  Another question, while the delegates are here, concerns ghost estates.  Around the country, there are a large number of units which are 50%, 70% or 75% finished.  These are units, where there is a shell, that need some work done on them.  This is not of benefit to the delegates' members and it is certainly not of benefit to society or the poor unfortunate people who are living in some of these estates.  In one estate of which I am aware, five houses are occupied and over 40 are empty yet we have people are all over the place looking for housing.  How do the delegates see these houses being brought into use, because it is very hard to get developers in some cases to buy into site resolution plans?<\/p>  <p>  It is very difficult to get site resolution plans in place.  The delegates' members are key to this.  Receivers, where receivers exist, local residents and the local authorities are the pillars of site resolution plans.  We need to get site resolution plans in place.  There are jobs to be created in finishing these units.  There are people who need them.  There is a sale value in them.  The value of them is not increasing.  There are fellows going around in white vans pulling the copper cylinders and the fittings out of these units.

Those units could actually be acquired at market value, that is, if the 1% levy is to apply across the board in respect of all properties sold.  That can deal with the social integration issue.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to Deputy Stanley's point about our members failing to complete basic infrastructure, the economic collapse resulted in a number of developments not being completed, which the federation does not support.  The federation has many quality experienced developer-housebuilder members who have built terrific schemes over the years.  The standard of them has been second to none in those cases.  It is unfortunate we have had some instances of developments not being completed.  We have been more than anxious to work with the banks in those particular cases and in association with Housing Agency, where we were able to offer some input into how site resolution plans could be brought forward and some those developments addressed.  We fully support a situation where adequate security is lodged with the local authorities to ensure that developments are completed to standard but we must ensure the process works from everybody's perspective.  Suffice it to say, we have had very many quality developments built over the years, of which the whole country has to be proud.  It is regrettable that we have had those other instances where that has not happened.  It was not intended by our members but I would have to say the experience is there to ensure quality schemes can be completed.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of developers bullying planning officials in regard to the planning, I would say that the planning process was quite open and transparent.  It is quite difficult from a developer's perspective in that one will frequently get requests for further information and for amended drawings and amended layouts to meet planning purposes.  We have a planning process in place that is designed to ensure we end up with proper planning and sustainable development in respect of all projects going forward.<\/p>  <p>  On the concept of the vacant site levy and ownerships not being registered, there is provision in Construction 2020 for a registration of options.  We fully support that in that one should know where title is in respect of various lands.  <\/p>  <p>  I have touched on those issues and I appreciate the timeframe.

I echo the point Deputy Stanley made in that my experience has been that the local authority is run ragged by the construction industry and not just because of the recent crash.  From the time I was elected to a local authority in the early 1990s, it was usual to chase up on the completion of estates.  There were some excellent developers and some who had to be cajoled.  There was some absolute rubbish.  The amount of time, energy and effort that goes into this does no service to construction sector.<\/p>  <p>  We need to find mechanisms in legislation that actually reward good behaviour and penalise bad behaviour.<\/p> <p>The ability to refuse planning permission to people who do not comply with the basic requirements of completing estates and being fair to the people purchasing is essential.  I would like to hear from the construction industry because it is in its interests.  What measures could the witnesses recommend that will get us to a point where good behaviour will be rewarded and bad behaviour penalised in this legislation and in the No. 2 Bill as well?  That is in all of our interests.<\/p> <p> Regarding the Derelict Sites Act and the vacant sites levy, the Derelict Sites Act did not work.

It delivered a very good outcome but it required a huge amount of administrative time, and it requires money.  The witness was quite right about the rolling fund.  It would be useful to identify the deficiencies in the Derelict Sites Act, which was cumbersome in that a derelict site notice could not be served on, say, somebody living outside the country.  There were disputes within families and all of that became problematic.  Even the definition was problematic.  If such measures could be put into this legislation, they would be useful to us in terms of making this useful and practical legislation.  Too often we see legislation brought forward that has aspirations but when we attempt to implement it in practice, it is not workable.  It is important to state that.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to hear from the Planning Institute regarding its statement that given the rapidly improving market in Dublin in particular, it believes that the provision of some affordable element for the greater Dublin area should be considered.  Will one of the witnesses expand on that?  The institute's presentation goes on to refer to European Investment Bank funding with regard to addressing this particular difficulty where we have all the houses built first and the infrastructure following that.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Part V in terms of the Housing Agency, have the witnesses done a piece of work on the amount of housing that can be delivered in the various sectors?  What has the agency  factored in regarding Part V in terms of what can be delivered on this?  It is clear there is an ability to raise money from the European Investment Bank, for example, with regard to a rental option that may well be funded through bonds from that source.  Will the Part V mechanism deliver sufficiently in all parts of the country?  It may well be the case that where it does not deliver in some parts, direct social housing provision or something from that other funding source may be another route.  One size will not fit all.  I would like to hear what the witnesses have to say on that aspect.<\/p>  <p>  The big issue is that a change in behaviour required in the construction industry.  The issue of bonds has been touched on.  The only ones that were issued in perpetuity were those that were issued by Anglo Irish Bank and we know there are unsecured creditors in regard to IBRC.  Bonds have not worked to the benefit of people who purchased houses. They are the ones whom we have an obligation to consider given that they are not here.<\/p> <p>I suggest, for example, in regard to planning permissions that the legislation seems to be quite short-term in its focus and there should be a sunset clause in order that the operation of Part V would be examined, because in five years time we may well be back in a situation where there is a much bigger delivery of housing stock in all sectors and the provision might require to be revisited.

We completely agree with the Deputy.  There are lessons to be learnt from the derelict sites register.  However, I suggest that the vacant sites levy, as drafted in the heads of the Bill, will result in the same difficulties being encountered as with the derelict sites provision, in particular in terms of identifying ownership.  One of the big issues is the huge amount of resources required to manage the vacant sites levy in terms of establishing a register and to pursue issues actively and ensure results are achieved.  Deputy Murphy is correct that there is much to learn from the derelict sites legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Murphy spoke about the definition of a derelict site.  There is no proposed definition currently in terms of what constitutes a vacant site.  Are we talking about undeveloped land, a brownfield site or vacant buildings?  In the opinion of the institute, a vacant levy should apply to buildings in as much as it does land if the whole purpose is to regenerate and stimulate growth in town and urban centres.  In that regard, what the institute would suggest is that rather than tackle the issue on a piecemeal basis, why not simply seek a land tax levy on land that is zoned for development purposes and which has been enhanced in value because it is zoned for a purpose?  We believe that would perhaps be a more straightforward approach if it is felt that a levy is the way to go to stimulate growth.  Overall, our mantra in relation to it is that we need to look more proactively at it.  Reference was aptly made to the Clonakilty model which was only achieved because of a dedicated county architect living in the town.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the affordable housing element, perhaps it might be more appropriate to defer it to the Housing Agency to respond to that.  We have come from a situation where we had social and affordable housing.  The affordable element is now dropped and the institute's position is to consider whether we are certain that it should be dropped, in particular in urban centres that are experiencing a bit of pressure currently in terms of affordability.  Again, that could be dealt with through the supply side.  Perhaps the Housing Agency will address the matter further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000015#V00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Hughes"},{"type":"speech","time":1421767800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>We will defer the matter to the Housing Agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000015#V00800","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421767800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Very briefly, on the last point, it is important to remind people that provision is made for affordable housing in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and that it can be commenced if and when it is deemed appropriate by the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of Deputy Murphy's question about the contribution, we have done two pieces of work on that.  The first is in the report that we prepared on the Part V issue.  We looked back at what was delivered in the 2002 to 2011 period and reported back that 15,100 units were delivered by Part V in that period, of which 62% were affordable and 37% were social.  It is important to realise that we have fairly firm evidence from the past about what is possible.<\/p> <p>Our chief executive has done a very quick calculation to answer the question, looking into the future, and without the benefit of the detailed evidence here, which is that the delivery will depend on housing delivery.  If 20,000 homes per annum were delivered, assuming that Part V applied to 10,000, that would yield 1,000 social homes per annum of the 6,000 needed.<\/p> <p> This does not exist in isolation.  There is a mix of other delivery forms in addition to Part V: a mix of direct build, acquisition and different types of funding to some of the approved housing bodies mentioned earlier.  It appears that we can continue the past success when towards the end of that period a substantial stream of housing was coming on board.  There is every reason to believe we can be successful in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000015#V00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Skehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421768100,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Deputy Catherine Murphy raised the importance of legislation being useful and practical.  She said the derelict sites legislation did not work.  I contend that Part V has not worked, despite Mr. Skehan&rsquo;s assertion, because there is a major national crisis in respect of social housing with almost 100,000 people on a housing list and a long-term commitment from the Government to provide &euro;3.5 billion for social housing.  It has been aspirational and as a funding model it did not work.  Regardless of its aspirational side and the positive side of social integration, which we in the CIF support, it was not supported because the funding was not there.  Our model is an alternative.  In light of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a substantial budget for social housing - unfortunately we will need more social housing unless private housing is built - Part V is a deterrent to private building because the costs are holding back development.  Previously in the industry, and the planners would agree with me, approximately 40% of the sale price of a house went directly to the Exchequer.  One of our members lately contended the figure is now 50%.  That makes it difficult.  Even the Part V contribution is enough.  The last straw, they say, breaks the camel&rsquo;s back and as Mr. Fitzpatrick said, if it is not the Part V contribution, the financial contributions or VAT, the rest is fixed and, if anything, going up.  Labour prices will be under pressure and the other inputs are going up.  Land is different and I agree with the Deputies&rsquo; assertion that previously the cost of land was a major factor.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Cowen talked about using it or losing it.  Deputy Stanley has just left but if there is a vacant site in Portlaoise, Tullamore, Birr or Portarlington it is because it is not viable to move it.  If the unfortunate owner, developer or builder, has to pay a levy, that will delay any chance of building and creating much-needed infrastructure, and jobs.  However the vacant site levy is introduced, it must take note of the very serious considerations that we and the Planning Institute have raised.  The costs are the major issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000016#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421768100,"counter":76,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Murphy some players in the industry did the industry no good.

That is a credible registration process whereby experienced builders can be registered.  Only those who meet their obligations in full, complete developments, comply with building regulations and are tax compliant will be able to build in the future.  We fully support that.

In doing that we must ensure there is social integration in development.  In the past where buy-outs were possible, social integration was not done as well as it should have been.  We should keep that in mind.  Mr. Skehan said there is still a facility for affordable housing.  I would not like to see it go away, particularly in light of the new regulation on the 20% deposit.  Although that decision has not been made, it is imminent and will affect first-time buyers.  That must all be taken into consideration.  The facility for affordable housing should remain.<\/p>  <p>  I was on South Dublin County Council for 20 years and saw how Part V led to problems.  I hope that this will activate building.  While the recommendation to keep all the options and the 1% sounds attractive, I do not think it would work to provide social housing.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of the land valuation tax versus the vacant site levy, too many taxes could halt construction.  In an ideal situation where there are enough houses or builders have money to build the houses which we do not have, we could say we would not start from here but we are here.  I can understand the theory behind the land value tax instead of the site levy but we are not in the right place for that.<\/p>  <p>  I agree that the housing strategies may need to be amended to be more responsive to change because that is a shortcoming of the housing strategy.  They are static and react to change rather than being proactive.  Building is expensive.  Developers are in the business for the good of society but also to make a profit.  I can see why nine houses were specified.  I would enter a caveat that in order to progress development, for example, a site for 36 houses should not be done piecemeal in groups of eight and a few.  If a developer who owns such a site wants to build only nine houses on it, the local authority should have the foresight and insight to question that.  The construction industry welcomed the reduced development levies which removed some of the inconsistencies in them but the levy is a matter for the local authority.  It asked too that the payment be made as the development progresses rather than as one tranche.  It depends on whether the local authority can afford that.<\/p>  <p>  The exceptional circumstances must be defined because exceptional to the witnesses may not be exceptional to me.  There are many ways to skin a cat.

People must be frank about these things.<\/p>  <p>  The two words the ordinary people on the streets do not want to hear are \"building boom\" because we all know the stories of what it did to families and individuals.  Never again do we want to see a building boom in this jurisdiction.  When talking to people about the construction industry, the need for housing etc., and thinking about the legacy, I find the language used interesting.

Markets must always price in risk so if the members do only one thing they should do everything they can to remove the ambiguity and uncertainty from the existing situation, which has been commented unfavourably upon by at least two High Court judges.  Our document to the committee has summarised those findings so if there is any guiding light for the work the members do, it is where there is an opportunity to increase certainty and remove doubt they should do it.<\/p> <p>However much they hate a system, if the market knows that is the system and that everybody will be treated the same way, that is at least an advantage.

That is the big issue to leave members with.<\/p> <p> I remind the members also that for all its prickliness the Part V measure exists in the context of an increasingly comprehensive and well thought out interlocked system of other measures to produce housing that is both affordable, available and integrated.  It is part of a bigger complex.  The members should not allow themselves be scared by certain aspects of it because it exists in a much bigger and better thought out system than it did previously.  We are finishing where we began by recommending that it continue as it is at the level proposed and with the focus on the social aspect.  It is well thought out but they should watch the details and avoid any ambiguity.  That reflects well in what Senator Keane said, namely, that this is where many of the issues, particularly about exceptional circumstances, need to be thought through.  One size will not fit all and there will always be a case for examining issues on a case by case, site by site and county by county basis.  Good luck to the members in their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015012000020#AA00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Skehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421769900,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Skehan.

Three weeks have passed since the official launch of the Latvian Presidency of the EU Council.  These days have been marked by intensive consultation with all the actors concerned, namely, EU member states, EU institutions, parliamentarians, various non-governmental structures and external partners.  The tragic acts of terror in Paris have shocked European citizens who are rightly awaiting an adequate response.  The economic, social and political situations in several EU countries remain challenging.  Also, the external environment remains rather difficult.  Conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East continue and the Ebola problem has not disappeared.  It is no wonder that President Tusk, when meeting my Prime Minister some ten days ago, said that the Latvian Presidency had started in a rather difficult situation.  Nevertheless, my government is very conscious of this fact, Latvian institutions are well prepared for the challenges to come and we are determined to be as dynamic as the situation requires, both internally and externally.<\/p>  <p>  Before presenting the priorities of the Latvian Presidency I would like to remind the committee that the functioning of the EU is a well co-ordinated process.  The Latvian Presidency intends to work in full conformity with the provisions of the Lisbon treaty respecting the competencies and prerogatives of the EU institutions, other member states and all the partners concerned.<\/p>  <p>  As the holder of the Presidency, Latvia will ensure that the Council plays its part to facilitate achieving the ambitious goals set out in the June 2014 European Council strategic agenda for the Union in times of change.  The priorities of the Latvian Presidency have been developed over the past year, in close consultation with members of the trio, namely, Italy, Luxembourg, the European institutions, member states and other partners.  The priorities I present today are essentially the result of Latvia's and the trio&rsquo;s 18-month work programme.  Naturally, the Presidency has paid due attention to the priorities of President Juncker, announced last summer, and the work programme of the Commission for the year 2015.<\/p>  <p>  It is our collective task to develop a Union built on shared values of peace, freedom, democracy, human rights, the rule of law and solidarity.  Europe must be a source of inspiration, not only for Europeans, but also for societies beyond our frontiers.  Latvia&rsquo;s commitment to strengthening the EU, its institutions and its policies is rooted in these common values, the preservation of European identity and an acknowledgment of a shared European future.  It goes without saying that under these circumstances, Europe should work more efficiently to ensure the safety of its citizens and to contribute to peace and prosperity within and beyond its borders.<\/p>  <p>  My government is fully aware of the fact that European citizens expect improvements in the functioning of the EU.  To meet their expectations the Presidency is fully committed to strengthening the decision-making process within the EU and to improving inter-institutional co-operation within the existing treaties.<\/p>  <p>  The Latvian Presidency has two broad major objectives.  The first is to steer the work of all relevant Council formations in order to fully overcome the economic and financial crisis.  I remind the committee that there are approximately 1,500 meetings of various committees, working parties and working groups in Brussels and Luxembourg, plus approximately 200 meetings to be held in Riga over the next six months. <\/p> <p>In order to achieve these two major objectives, the Presidency intends to focus on three main themes, namely, competitive Europe, digital Europe and engaged Europe.<br\/>The priority of competitive Europe is based on our understanding that Europe needs to enhance its economic capacity by promoting investment in new and competitive products and services.  Only by developing competitive industry and service sectors can Europe facilitate job creation and thus also promote social cohesion.  Based on Latvia's experience, we know that this is possible through efficient structural reforms and growth-stimulating investment measures.  Hence, Latvia is committed to fast-tracking at the Council procedures relating to the investment plan for Europe that are aimed at unlocking public and private investment in the real economy.  The Presidency will also continue work on the reduction of administrative obstacles and the continued development of the Single Market in order to enhance economic activity through the EU.  This will allow Europe to truly benefit from the multiplication effect of investment.  The Presidency is fully committed to facilitating the well co-ordinated and efficient conduct of the European semester, based on the goals of the renewed Strategy Europe 2020, and will work to ensure that the Council plays its role in the multilateral process.  The Presidency welcomes the Commission's ideas for a more streamlined European Semester process to secure the proper involvement of all member states, national parliaments and stakeholders in the discussions on country specific recommendations.<br\/>The Presidency will prioritise work on strengthening the Single Market through swift progress on the remaining Single Market Act II proposals, while maintaining and promoting the four freedoms.  The Presidency intends to launch discussions on the expected Internal Market strategy for goods and services, thereby contributing to enhancing the competitiveness of industry and related service sectors.  The Presidency's guiding principle will be better regulation and the wider use of competitiveness proofing.  More efficient and targeted regulation means focusing human and financial resources towards the main objectives of growth, jobs and competitiveness.<br\/>The need to establish an energy union has been evident for many years and the EU must make this vision a reality.  We are of the view that there needs to be an energy policy built on solidarity, trust and security.  The entire Union would benefit from a better integrated energy infrastructure grid and improved governance in the sector.  The EU also needs solid energy diplomacy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>its external suppliers, increased use of renewables and better implementation of energy efficiency measures already agreed.<br\/>On the second of its priorities,  the Presidency's priority is the development of a true digital Europe through devoting permanent attention to building trust in the digital Single Market, digitalisation of the public sector and increasing safety and security in the digital environment.  Streamlined and enhanced use of digital capacities must continue.  The Presidency will seek to conclude negotiations and reach an agreement on legislative proposals currently under discussion.  It will also focus on building a stronger and more coherent data protection framework.  Seeking agreement on the general data protection regulation and directive is one of our immediate tasks.  Safety, in its widest sense, will also be enhanced through the implementation of the cyber security strategy and by finalising negotiations on the network and information security directive.  The Presidency is looking forward to the timely publication of the digital Single Market strategy.  We will hold proper discussions at the Council, as well as making use of informal events, for this purpose.<\/p> <p> The Presidency will also seek an overall compromise on the telecommunications market package.  The guiding principle will be to find a balance between high quality services and a reasonable cost for consumers.  Sufficient attention will be devoted also to aspects of inter-operability, web accessibility and the digital transformation of the public sector to make it efficient and innovative.<\/p> <p> The third major priority area for the Latvian Presidency is \"engaged Europe\".  Since the adoption of the European security strategy in 2003, the EU has strived to assume a full and active role on the global stage.  Now facing similar conflicts on our doorstep, the situation in the neighbourhood is even more challenging than previously.  Therefore, Latvia will support the efforts of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and will work closely with the European External Action Service.  The European neighbourhood policy, ENP, comprising its eastern and southern dimensions, is a policy of continuous engagement and is a priority of EU external relations, beyond the priorities of the Latvian Presidency.  The member states have agreed that the ENP should be strengthened through a comprehensive review process.  During the Riga Eastern Partnership summit, to be held in May this year, we will send a strong signal reaffirming our long-term strategic support for this initiative.  The ENP review process should allow the EU to develop more flexible and inclusive approaches to all its partner countries based on differentiation and the well-known more-for-more principle, emphasising joint ownership of the initiative.<\/p> <p> The EU's external engagement also includes a commitment towards a stronger transatlantic partnership, notably by making every effort to conclude negotiations on an ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, agreement by the end of 2015.  Enhancing relations with other strategic partners is equally important for the Presidency.  The Presidency looks forward to the conclusion of the EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement talks and the advancement of the EU-Japan free trade agreement negotiations.  We also support the early conclusion and implementation of the deep and comprehensive free trade agreements, DCFTAs, with countries such as Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.<\/p> <p> Latvia also looks forward to the review of the EU-central Asia strategy.  EU engagement with that region can be enhanced by discussions on security, border management, energy supply, and educational exchange, while keeping civil society interests and human rights high on the agenda.<\/p> <p> This year offers a unique opportunity to promote an ambitious, transformative and inclusive post-2015 development agenda.  The EU is entering a new phase of intergovernmental negotiations on the follow-up process to the sustainable development goals and financing for development.  The Presidency wishes to highlight gender equality and women's empowerment as a thematic issue for development co-operation during the first semester of this year.<\/p> <p> The Presidency is fully committed to the EU enlargement policy as agreed by all member states several years ago.  We believe that this process contributes significantly to the mutual benefits of peace, democracy, security and prosperity in Europe.<\/p> <p> Before concluding I wish to quote the President of the Commission, Mr. Juncker.  Speaking at the European Parliament on 14 January he said: \"The Latvian Presidency is the symbol of reconciliation in the history of the EU.  Thirty years ago no-one could have imagined this.\"  President Juncker added that Latvia has succeeded in changing the course of history.<\/p> <p>My compatriots and my colleagues in the capital take his words as inspiration and encouragement.  Needless to say, this also fully applies to the Latvian embassy in Dublin.<\/p> <p> Let me assure all the Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad that the Latvian Government will do its best to implement the priorities mentioned and spare no effort to promote the values and principles of the Union in a changing world.  As was said a few days ago by the Prime Minister, Ms Laimdota Straujuma: \"Our objective is to defend the European values, a space of freedom, security, justice and mutual tolerance, characterising Europe in the world.\"  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012000004#C00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I have some questions and comments.  I am glad to hear that Latvia will examine improving the functioning of the European Union.  I spent yesterday in Brussels with my Latvian colleague,<b><\/b>Ms Lolita \u010cig&acirc;ne, and we discussed how we could improve the inter-institutional agreements between our countries and the role of national parliaments within the current treaty structure.  Members will be glad to hear that at the COSAC in Riga in two weeks' time and in June we will discuss how we can improve the operation of the yellow card system and will have several proposals on how we can work within the treaties to do that.<br\/>Dr. Apals said the investment plan for Europe would be fast-tracked.  That is good news for all of us and is something everybody on this committee would welcome.  We had a presentation on it just before Christmas.  One key part of the investment plan is to ensure that any expenditure is treated outside the fiscal compact limits.  There was discussion across European capitals as to whether that would be universally acceptable.  Could Dr. Apals advise us on the status of those discussion?  Is there agreement on how we treat this additional capital investment?<br\/>Dr. Apals referred to his hopes for the eastern partnership.  I understand there will be a summit in Riga in May.  What does he hope to achieve regarding the ongoing situation in Ukraine?  <br\/>My final question concerns enlargement.  He said he will look to ensure that the path to enlargement continues.

I welcome the ambassador and his staff and thank him for setting out his broad objectives and how he intends to reach a position on them over the next number of months.  <\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise some issues that have been outstanding for some time, one of which is banking union.  What role can Dr. Apals play in driving that agenda?  From our economic perspective it is quite important, and as a nation we recognise its importance.  There is a level of frustration among the citizens of this country.  Decisions were taken at a Council meeting in June 2012, when the Government was able to leave the meeting in the belief that it had received a ground-breaking deal on the capacity to get support from the ESM to assist in the retrospective recapitalisation of our banks.  At the time we were told that decision would be subject to a finalisation of banking union.  <\/p>  <p>  It is no wonder that citizens lose interest in the European project when they see that we are now heading for the middle of 2015 and banking union has not happened.  It now looks like the decisions which were taken then are not considered relevant by the current Government or will not happen.  That is a domestic issue, and we will hold the Government to account on it in the Parliament.  From a European perspective, there is quite a lot of annoyance among citizens who are still waiting for the baking union to progress.  <\/p> <p>From a European perspective, there is much annoyance among the citizens still awaiting the progression of banking union because of the lack of cohesive banking regulation throughout the Union.  Some believe this had a significant impact on our banks during the financial crisis, as did the lending practices which prevailed at the time.  The ambassador spoke about digital Europe, which is extremely important.  We have issues here with the roll-out of broadband but they are domestic.  Where the citizens of this country saw phenomenal benefits associated with our membership of Europe was with regard to roaming charges being harmonised or eliminated.  This is where we can really show the benefits of working in a co-operative environment.  However, the telecommunications companies are still creaming off and increasing profits by virtue of roaming charges on the use of data.  It is hardly any wonder that roaming charges have reduced on voice telephony when one considers many people have moved to a data environment and this is where the market is at for them.  Does Latvia intend to try to push this agenda, with regard to reducing charges for data for those travelling within and between member states?<\/p> <p> The ambassador also spoke about the security issue, and it is significant and right that he would do so, with regard to trying to get a level of further co-operation in light of the threat.  Comments have been made by certain individuals in the UK who believe a particular airport in Ireland is considered to be a legitimate target for acts of aggression.  This is misconceived.  The action spoken about never happened.  Notwithstanding this, the Irish Government is clearly concerned about it.  How does Latvia intend to formulate a way of dealing with this perceived threat?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012000007#F00300","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421763900,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Apals.  I have a soft spot for my Latvian colleagues as we have much in common.  We have endured a terrible economic crisis.  I understand the crisis in Latvia was even more difficult than the one here, and the ambassador has our sympathy.  Like Ireland, Latvia has successfully turned an economic corner, and growth this year is estimated to be 5%, which is remarkable.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 25,000 Latvians live in Ireland.  They are all hard working and very welcome.  They add a nice diversity to our culture.  I wish Latvia well because this is its first Presidency and I have no doubt it will make a success of it.  This year is of crucial international importance and Dr. Apals has touched on some of the reasons for this.  Given Latvia's history, and that of its neighbours, Estonia and Lithuania, it is possessed with great understanding of the region and the Russian Federation, which has us rather concerned.  Given their history, Russian is widely spoken in the three countries.  We are now seeing the disastrous effects of the difficulties which have been unfolding in Ukraine over a long period.  We have another crisis as the ceasefires have collapsed and Luhansk is in very serious turmoil.  Perhaps the Russians have reintroduced their troops to fight against the Ukrainian armed forces.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has a new high representative for foreign affairs.  I heard her speak in Dublin Castle and I was deeply impressed by her contribution.  I was also impressed by her contribution when we met her in private.  Does Dr. Apals agree with her scenario that Russia is a problem, but Russia as a problem is part of the solution?<\/p> <p>Will Dr. Apals assure me that the Latvian Presidency will engage with Russia and that Europe might learn some lessons from the collapse in the eastern partnerships with Armenia initially and subsequently Ukraine?

Dr. Apals's comments were true.  Some issues were not mentioned but still remain.  In terms of cohesion and security, Europe is a challenging place at the moment.  The Latvian and subsequent Presidencies will have to address the emerging issue of security.  We do not want to see a repetition of how relatives were not allowed to collect belongings after an aeroplane was downed in Ukraine.  Hooded, masked and armed personnel surrounded them and prevented them from doing so.  Such a situation was seriously damaging to the concept of a powerful, cohesive and protective Europe that wanted to push ahead economically and socially.<\/p>  <p>  The Italian Prime Minister mentioned that Europe was at a crossroads.  It has been at a crossroads for many years.  Some would suggest that it has been on a roundabout, unable to decide which exit to take.  The time has come for the European leadership to concentrate on where Europe is going and to move away from the old adage about the future of Europe and how Europe is changing.  We make the future.  We make the change.  Each member state has a contribution to make.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, I will allude to the elephant in the room, namely, the situation in the UK.<\/p> <p>To what extent will the ongoing question of the UK's future in the European Union impact on the cohesiveness and competitiveness of the Union in the foreseeable future? <\/p> <p> In regard to digitalisation and innovation, I hope euroscepticism which has grown in the past number of years is finally addressed over the next couple of years.  If that is not done, it will lead to unfortunate circumstances.  However, we can address the matter on a number of levels.  Digitalisation and innovation in job creation can be utilised in addressing issues that affect people.  We also need to identify the main underlying reasons for euroscepticism which we can see evidence of on a daily basis and read about all the time.  If such scepticism is not addressed, it will continue to grow.  Some scepticism may stem from domestic politics in individual member states.  Collectively, however, it has a debilitating effect on the concept of developing and consolidating Europe, what it stands for, where it has come from and where it is going, particularly in terms of the future of Europe.<\/p> <p> We are faced with the challenge of achieving higher levels of economic growth and development.  Europe has a huge population of 500 million and thus has massive economic clout so it should be able to generate the necessary growth and development to be a world leader.  Job creation automatically follows such growth and development. <\/p> <p> Social cohesion will suffer and fracture as a result of dissension within.  One cannot have dissension, a wish to opt in or opt out and euroscepticism at the same time as an evolving concept of modern European.  I referred to security earlier.<\/p> <p> With regard to my colleague's comments, I do not necessarily agree with the claim that nothing has happened in banking.  Quite a considerable amount of progress has been made in that area.  At least there is an indication now that all European countries recognise that something had to be done, and that we generally point in the same direction.  It is very important that we all face in the same direction throughout the European Union because, otherwise, we will not succeed.<\/p> <p> A few years ago during the boom years in Europe we were told that we had no control over our currency because it was controlled by Brussels, that interest rates were controlled by Brussels and nothing could be done.  That was untrue because we now know credit controls were possible at all times and had to be introduced in the final analysis.  Credit controls were introduced and were effective.  Many eurosceptics were critical of the European project, suggested that we should devalue our currency and claimed that if we were not in the eurozone we could have done so.  We devalued our currency and it is now called the euro.  We collectively own the euro and whatever happens to it affects Irish citizens.  The euro is now almost back down to parity with the US dollar where it started.  To those who suggested that devaluation was the solution to all of our problems I say that we would have resolved some of our problems at this stage by now.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012000009#H00700","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421764500,"counter":124,"content":"<p>As Deputy O'Reilly must leave shortly, I suggest we allow him to make a brief contribution before returning to the ambassador for his comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012000010#J00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1421764500,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I have received word my visitors have arrived so I must depart and I appreciate the Chairman allowing me this opportunity to speak.<\/p>  <p>  I share the Chairman's happiness that he expressed to the delegation on Latvia's ambition to bring forward the &euro;300 billion investment package.

I am interested the learn the proposed timeframe for delivering the package.<\/p>  <p>  I ask Dr. Apals to comment on youth unemployment.  I believe it should be the priority for all governments.  Countries must make, in so far as possible, dealing with youth unemployment a big priority.  We are happy to have reached 10.7% unemployment now but that level is still unacceptable.<\/p> <p>There is a greater level of youth unemployment which needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p> With regard to digital Europe, I am interested in the ambassador's comment on how to strike the balance between security and freedom.  We must be aware of people's privacy but at the same time maintain security and prevent terrorism.  I presume an issue in every European country is cyberbullying through the use of the Internet and various social media sites.  Will the ambassador comment on that?  Has Latvia considered strategies to eliminate cyberbullying and promote more responsibility in providers to prevent it?<\/p> <p> I am happy that Latvia is interested in advancing a European energy policy.  Will the ambassador comment on the balance between green energy and the possibility of using more nuclear energy?  How safe does the ambassador believe is nuclear energy and are we advancing the goal of eliminating waste?  Do more possibilities exist with nuclear energy if the question of waste can be dealt with?  I thank the Chairman for allowing me to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012000010#J00300","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421764800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Perhaps the ambassador can answer those questions and other members wish to ask some questions afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012000011#K00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421764800,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Before answering each question, I remind the committee of an important consideration.  As I have tried to explain, the responsibility of the Presidency is to ensure the smooth functioning of all council information.  The efficiency of a Presidency cannot be measured by a number of decisions adopted.  We are in a policy process both in terms of the trio work programme and harmonisation between the Presidency priorities, the trio work programme and work programmes of the European Commission and other institutions and partners.  I cannot comment too much on positions of other member states concerning specific issues.  The representatives of many member states are here and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on their national positions.<\/p>  <p>  The Presidency intends to ensure smooth functioning of institutions and it also intends to remain perfectly neutral when it comes to all member states.  We cannot use the position of the Presidency to promote our national interest or take sides.  We should forge a compromise and, therefore, compromise on each and every issue is an ultimate objective.  This will leave space for the incoming Presidency to continue from the point where our Presidency ends.<\/p>  <p>  I will now go through the questions individually.  There was a question about fiscal compact limits in light of the ongoing discussion concerning the European fund for strategic investment.  I can outline the calendar for European debate of these issues.  As we know, the proposals concerning the strategic investment fund will be discussed and submitted before the meeting of economic and financial affairs ministers.  That will happen on 27 January.  A status report will follow to the same Council formation in February.  The Presidency intends to formulate a common approach by March.  In the margins of the General Affairs Council in March and June, we will work towards a draft European Council decision.  The collective undertaking of the EU is to have a political decision this year.  This means that decisions should be taken at the latest in May in order that the fund can start functioning in June.<\/p> <p>The problem, namely, the fiscal compact limits, will form part of the wider debate.  I hope this issue will be successfully resolved according to the existing schedule.<\/p> <p> Concerning the eastern partnership, this should be one of my favourite subjects because it is a high priority for my government, in view of our geographical location and historical experience.  I referred to one major event which is the eastern partnership summit to be held on 20 to 21 May, in Riga.  There will also be debates and discussions at ministerial level and the participation of civil society from all eastern partnership countries before and after the summit meeting.  The objective of all these activities is to reconfirm the interest of the European Union in having a close partnership with eastern partnership countries, namely, the six countries participating in that project, which are Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Moldova.<\/p> <p> In our view it would be right to keep that platform of multilateral co-operation for future relationships.  These countries are not all the same in that they have varying degrees of ambition when it comes to relationships with the EU.  Nevertheless, we think that keeping the platform is very important in order to have a more or less balanced progress through the geographical area to the east - while not exactly continuing bilateral co-operation with these countries - but also to ensure that the process develops in a more balanced manner in all six countries.<\/p> <p> Concrete deliverables for the Riga summit would be, first, decisions and debate on visa liberalisation; second, an evaluation of the results concerning the implementation of the decisions; and stocktaking on the progress of association agreements with Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova.  We could also start a debate on the role of the Russian Federation, how to conduct dialogue with the Russian Federation and how to change the image of the eastern partnership in the Russian-speaking media.  There could also be a debate on strategic development of the initiative and on how the initiative should develop in the future.  I will comment on that initiative in more detail if necessary and on the deliverables of the Riga summit.<\/p> <p> On the question about enlargement, our priority is to keep the enlargement process alive.  We know that pessimistic comments were voiced last year by many high level representatives of European institutions.  Nevertheless, the Presidency is directly responsible for chairing all the Council meetings and also for steering the enlargement process.  Therefore, in co-operation with the European Commission, we intend to continue the negotiation process in good faith.  I cannot comment further on whether significant progress will be achieved because high level representatives have already stated it is probable that actual enlargement will not happen in the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012000011#K00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

The responsibility of the Presidency is only to ensure that the negotiation process continues and that the process is credible.<\/p>  <p>  Concerning the countries specifically mentioned here, with regard to Montenegro I can only confirm that the Latvian Presidency will proceed with the ongoing accession negotiations with Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey, with the view of achieving further sustained progress.  In the case of Montenegro, we expect to continue to work mainly on chapters without opening benchmarks.<\/p> <p>In the context of Montenegro, we expect to continue to work - mainly on chapters and without establishing benchmarks - provided progress continues in the areas of the rule of law and fundamental rights.  We know that the rule of law is a problem for many accession countries.  This could, therefore, be regarded as our priority in respect of Montenegro.  We would also like progress to be made in the negotiations with Turkey.  If actions are to follow words with regard to moving closer to EU values, certain internal developments in Turkey could give rise to questions in respect of the application of such values there in daily internal political life.  We hope that Turkey will be as credible a partner as all other accession countries and we intend to continue the negotiations in good faith.  We hope to be able to open the first chapters of negotiations with Serbia.  We are aware that serious efforts will be necessary on both sides regarding the process of normalising relations with Kosovo.  As members know, significant progress has been achieved in this area during the past two years.  However, that progress has not exactly been conclusive.  Problems remain and these are a consideration in the context of the negotiation process.  We will pursue the negotiations relating to all three countries and enlargement policy in general on the basis of the principle of conditionality and the merits of each individual state.<\/p> <p> The question of a banking union is an extremely complex subject in respect of which not only the Presidency but also many member states, the Commission and the European Central Bank have roles to play.  The Presidency can only represent the Council in negotiations with the Commission and the European Central Bank and seek to advance the process in all Council deliberations relating to that subject.  The general approach of the Presidency is characterised by the fact that Latvia believes the new legislative framework for the formation of a banking union will have a positive impact on the stability of the financial sector.  We will follow closely the implementation of the banking union.  Proper and timely implementation of measures aimed at ensuring the smooth functioning of newly-operational banking mechanisms will be at the centre of the Latvian Presidency.  Members will excuse me for voicing such general comments as I try to explain the position.  Progress depends on the specific positions of member states, the Commission and the European Central Bank and, therefore, we can address these questions in more detail separately rather than during this meeting.<\/p> <p> Digital Europe is a high priority for my country's Government.  An interesting debate on the subject, organised by the European movement, already took place here in Ireland.  During this debate representatives of the Irish public voiced similar questions and it emerged that we should consider digital issues from three different perspectives.  The most important of these is the economic perspective.  We are looking at the digital economy as a way to produce jobs, etc.  As members stated, there are also issues relating to human rights involved.  I refer here to the need for data protection.  In addition, issues of social policy come into play and these have already been highlighted by members of the Irish public.  The Presidency will certainly do its best to take all three dimensions into account when advancing the debate on the digital economy at the Council.  Of course, the overarching objective in this regard is to stimulate economic growth.  However, the issues mentioned at this meeting and at others already held in Ireland will be duly communicated to my Government and to colleagues back home in order to draw their attention to the many matters that are related to the digital economy and the overall objectives relating thereto.<\/p> <p> I am of the view that security issues should be discussed in the context of human rights dimension of the digital economy and data protection.<\/p> <p>At the same time one should protect not only the individual security of a person in the digital environment, but also the security of businesses, institutions and, possibly, nation states.  This will remain a big issue for the future and that will be addressed in the Justice and Home Affairs Council.  The next meeting of that Council, an informal one, is scheduled for 29 January and it will take place in Riga.  It will address many issues which were already raised on 11 January following the acts of terror in Paris and continue the debate on many issues, including data and digital security, and partially related phenomena such as foreign fighters and the reason for them.  The departure point of my government is to start from better implementation of existing European decisions.  Before producing new decisions we should implement what is already on the table.  We should also aim at better efficiency within the existing European structures in that area as well as co-operation between all member states.<\/p> <p> There was a set of questions concerning the eastern partnership, Ukraine, the role of the Russian Federation, our approach to the crisis in Ukraine and relations between the EU and the Russian Federation.  I share the view of Deputy Eric Byrne that the speech of the High Representative in Dublin was very impressive.  We heard a very balanced approach to all the questions mentioned by the members.  On the one hand it did not compromise on our principles, including the fundamental principles of international law as far as Ukraine is concerned, and on the other it referred to continuing constructive dialogue with the Russian Federation and trying to achieve normalisation of the situation in Ukraine.<\/p> <p> The role of the Presidency in that area is not decisive.  The External Action Service and the High Representative have the prerogative of steering the external relations of the EU.  The Presidency may assist the High Representative and the External Action Service, if invited.  Certainly, my government has assisted the High Representative on several occasions, for example, presiding over several ministerial level meetings with central Asian countries, both in the region and in Brussels.  However, the ultimate responsibility remains with the High Representative.  The Latvian Foreign Minister has done much to assist the High Representative to promote progress on the crisis in Ukraine and to achieve some progress in normalisation of EU-Russian relations, namely, by paying a visit to Moscow a few days ago.  That visit followed his visit to Kiev.  The Presidency can use its position to pursue bilateral national dialogue and then use the results of the dialogue during the debate on external relations in Brussels when formulating the common European position.  This is exactly what my authorities are doing and will continue to do.<\/p> <p> One of the specific questions raised by Deputy Eric Byrne concerned the future deep and comprehensive free trade agreements with three countries, which will be discussed tomorrow in the D&aacute;il.  My government is 100% positive that these agreements should be concluded and implemented.  The philosophy and approach of the EU to the eastern partnership has been based not only on political partnership, but also on economic partnership.  The deep and comprehensive free trade agreements are an integral part of the association agreement and one cannot separate the political dialogue from dialogue on other issues, be they economic, social or legal issues.<\/p> <p>We should have a more complex approach and, therefore, these agreements will probably provide a positive effect for the overall relationship within the EU and eastern partnership countries and will also leave a positive impression on EU relations with Belarus, Armenia and Azerbaijan.  <\/p> <p> On the question concerning lessons from EU-Ukraine relations, the lessons will be drawn collectively in the formation of an EU Council or a European Parliament.  In my national capacity, I can only say that the experience we had with Ukraine affirms two important lessons.  One is that we should advance the negotiations and have a firm legal basis for our relationship in the form of an association agreement, including the economic part.  The second is that we should keep the eastern partnership as a platform comprising six countries so that we could have multilateral dialogue with all of the countries concerned.  By doing so, we could avoid bilateral contradictions.  This could also be possible between the Russian Federation and the countries concerned.  <\/p> <p> The question of security and Ukraine was already addressed.  On the euroscepticism issue, it does not belong to the competencies of the Presidency.  As a diplomat, I can only observe that the degree of euroscepticism varies throughout Europe.  There are countries which are more eurosceptic and others that do not have any significant political force which could be described as eurosceptic.  It is probably related to the overall perception of the euro and economic prospects in society.  Delivering on the primary objectives of the Presidency, which are stimulating economic growth, employment and social cohesion, would probably be the right answer to euroscepticism.  Euroscepticism could also be approached from the perspective of social cohesion.<\/p> <p> On the question concerning the European Investment Fund national allocations, this question belongs to discussion on the Council and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the positions of individual member states and their national priorities.  Youth unemployment is a general problem which will be addressed in close co-operation with the European Commission when implementing the youth employment plan in all European countries.  <\/p> <p> At this stage I will stop and listen to further comments and questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012000012#L00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

In his initial remarks he touched on external problems, and spoke about the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.  He stated the Latvian ambassador had been in touch with both parties, which answered one of the questions I was going to ask.  Has Latvia been able to put forward any conflict resolution proposal?  It does not appear that many resolutions have been put forward by the countries in the area, perhaps because of a fear of having to take sides.  Will Dr. Apals elaborate on the talks Latvia has had with Russia and Ukraine?<\/p>  <p>  I believe a sizeable Russian minority, which amounts to approximately 26% of the population, lives in Latvia.  Is Russian still not given any status as an official language in Latvia, as was the case when I visited there?  Is there a ban on employing Russians in certain professions?  Does Dr. Apals believe this leads to a form of inequality which will inevitably lead to disquiet and dissent among this sizeable minority?  My facts may be wrong, and perhaps the situation has dramatically changed in Latvia in this regard.  I was given information just before I came in that dual citizenship is provided with regard to specified countries, including all EU member states, NATO members and Australia, but not Russia or Israel.  If this is the case, why is it so?  I have the idea that if there is such a sizeable minority in the country and it is prohibited from taking part in the country's affairs, its language is not acknowledged and its members are excluded from certain professions, these issues need to be dealt with.  This is not interfering with the country, or telling the ambassador how to run it; these were some of the problems which reared their heads in Ukraine with regard to the Russian minority there.  I would like to hear Dr. Apals views on the conflict.  Countries such as Latvia have a very important part to play in the peace process for which we all wish.  Does he believe there is a resolution and if so what might it be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012000016#P00100","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1421766300,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I will develop some of the points raised by Deputy Halligan.  I was approached by people on the same issue, with regard to dealing with minorities in Europe.  Latvia has its experience, as do other countries in the region.  Part of the difficulty in Ukraine was the response of the authorities to people who see themselves as Russian speakers.  There were also outside influences.  With regard to addressing minorities in Latvia and other regions in Europe, will Latvia encourage a different approach from that which we have had until now?  This is an issue not only in Latvia's region, but throughout Europe.  There is a difficulty with the approach to the Irish language in Northern Ireland.  The issue exists throughout Europe, such as in the Basque country and Catalonia in Spain.  At one time Latvia had a language test, which people said was quite expensive.  People stated their payscale was based on the outcome of this test on their language ability.<\/p> <p>Some people have what is deemed to be an alien passport even though they were born in that country.  That seems to be a difficulty in some regions.  Does the ambassador have views on those matters?  What approach should Europe be taking in that regard?  <\/p> <p> The ambassador mentioned the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, agreement in his presentation and that progressing the negotiations on it will be a priority for the Latvian Presidency and that trade issues and geopolitical issues will also serve to broad the EU's relation with the US.  If it is sought to popularise this agreement in Europe, part of the difficulty - although there does not seem to be the same difficulty in the US - is the secrecy that has surrounded much of the negotiations on it.  Does the ambassador envisage a different approach will be taken under Latvia's Presidency to open up the process and give people across Europe more information on it?  I have attended a number of meetings on it and we have discussed it at this committee, at the foreign affairs committee and at other fora inside and outside the Parliament and people have continued to point to the secrecy surrounding the negotiations.  While they have heard all the positive news about it, they have not heard of the potential negatives involved for different industries and workers.  Does the ambassador have a view on that?<\/p> <p> The ambassador talked about the accession countries and he mentioned Serbia and Turkey.  There has been a breakdown in the talks over the partition of Cyprus.  Does the ambassador consider that issue to be not only part of those negotiations, but part of the proactive work that needs to be done within the EU?  He referred to the Presidency being a symbol of reconciliation.  If we consider what happened in Cyprus, it was invaded and partitioned.  Part of the negotiations comprised the potential for reconciliation and that the city of Famagusta would be rebuilt but unfortunately the Cypriots withdrew from the discussions because of the Turkish involvement in searching for gas and oil off the shores of Cyprus on the Turkish-Cypriot side and the impact it has had.  Does the ambassador believe there will be any movement forward in dealing with that conflict and would he view that as a priority for his country's Presidency?  It is a country within Europe but it is divided.  It is similar to Palestine in the Middle East with people having been settled on the island and the impact that has had.  There has been a planation of sorts there.  Does the ambassador view that issue as one of the Latvian Presidency's areas of priority?<\/p> <p> In terms of an inclusive approach in Europe, one of the issues is migration and emigration.  The ambassador spoke in terms of having more open borders and so on but how does he see that developing with the imbalance that there is in Europe with northern Europe carrying the weight for southern Europe?  How does he see that impacting and the Latvian Presidency addressing it?  We discussed the experiences of some countries in Europe last week.  It would not be unknown in some countries for 4,000 or 6,000 people to land on their shores in boats and to find bodies floating up on to beaches.<\/p> <p>Should Europe have a common approach to people fleeing conflict or war and how does the ambassador see such a system developing?  Will greater supports be available for those countries that have a significant impact in that regard?  I seek an overall view of the Presidency itself.<\/p> <p> President Juncker was quoted.  There was much criticism of his involvement in the Greek elections.  Does the ambassador consider it helpful to the new Commission but also to the European ideal of the Commission for people to involve themselves in elections in various countries in the EU?  Does the Latvian Government, as President, have a view on more involvement from Commission members in such elections in terms of who they would like to see being elected and the approach of governments?  It is seen by many as a direct intervention in the political process within the country in question.  If a similar intervention took place in Ireland or Latvia, people would have been extremely upset and annoyed.  Does the ambassador have a view in that regard?  I wish to hear a response to the rise in racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism across Europe.  What is Latvia's experience?  Does the ambassador see that as one of the key issues to be addressed by the Presidency?<\/p> <p> I wish Latvia well with the Presidency.  The issues of focus such as growth and jobs are positive.  In terms of jobs, we are interested in the type of jobs created, equality and who the growth will benefit.  They are some of the issues I wish to raise.  I do not know if other speakers addressed them.  The ambassador outlined some of the priorities in his speech but I wish to dig down and get a sense of what new issues will come forward during the Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012000016#P00200","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421766900,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I invite the ambassador to answer as many of the questions as possible and also to sum up his overall position.

Not all questions are exactly pertinent to my function as representative of the Presidency but in view of the fact that this meeting is being broadcast live and is therefore available to the Irish public, I feel obliged to respond to questions also concerning the situation in my country, especially those raised by Deputy Halligan.  I regret that he has left the room but for the record I will briefly comment on the questions and positions raised by him, first concerning the citizenship policy of my country.  Approximately 13% of permanent residents in Latvia are not Latvian citizens.  They are not Latvian citizens for many reasons.  The most important consideration is that any permanent resident of Latvia is entitled to apply for Latvian citizenship following a rather simple naturalisation procedure and to become a citizen of Latvia.  The problem is that not all permanent residents would like to become Latvian citizens, and the official position of the State is that citizenship cannot be imposed on anyone, including collectively on a group of people.  Citizenship is an issue for the individual and individual application is needed, in addition to the wish to become a citizen.  That is the departure line, which probably explains why 13% of the population of Latvia, most of whom who came from the Soviet Union as Soviet citizens under Soviet occupation, have not yet decided to apply for a Latvian passport.<\/p> <p>Our citizenship policy does not have any ethnic dimension.  Citizenship is by no means related to the ethnic background of the people concerned.  There are probably about 100 different ethnicities among Latvian citizens in Latvia, including a large number of ethnic Russian citizens of Latvia.<\/p> <p> The second part of the same question concerned my country's language policy.  According to the constitution of Latvia there is only one official language which is the Latvian language.  Three years ago, we had a referendum on this subject and the results of the referendum were binding.  Some 75% of all participants - and the participation rate was very high - voted to keep the provision that there should be only one official language, which is Latvian.  Some 25% of participants thought that the Russian language should also become official along with the Latvian language, but here we are talking about a relatively small minority.  Therefore, my country still continues with its constitutional provision for one state language.  I assure the committee that no discrimination is taking place on the language basis.  The few examples mentioned here by Deputy Halligan are not related to the language group represented by the persons concerned.<\/p> <p> Deputy Halligan spoke of a ban on employment.  Here I would say that, yes, there are a few positions, for example, officials of the security services, where only Latvian citizens can work.  Those people who have not bothered to apply for Latvian citizenship are not entitled to hold sensitive positions, but they are relatively few.  Restrictions on the employment of people who are not Latvian citizens are based on considerations pertinent to national security or public health.<\/p> <p> There is no language-based discrimination in employment policy in Latvia whatsoever.  I have already discussed the question of language status; the issue was resolved through a referendum.  As regards the pay test, I have no information that people speaking only Russian are receiving more or less than others.  The reality of a market economy, however, is that normally people speaking many languages would receive higher salaries.  Of course, we should not intervene in the private sector and tell employers how much to pay their employees on the basis of the number of languages they know.  Many industries, especially the services sector, require a knowledge of several languages to be successful.  Employers have the right to promote multilingual people.<\/p> <p> Having answered Deputy Halligan's questions, I will now move on to the EU Presidency's business, if I may.  I remind the committee that I cannot comment precisely on internal developments in Cyprus, Turkey or other countries.  The position of the ambassador representing the Presidency requires perfect neutrality.  Cyprus is an EU member state and I think Cypriot diplomats in Dublin could provide the committee with much broader and better information, including on relations between Turkey and Cyprus.<\/p> <p> I have already commented on the issue of Turkey.  The Latvian EU Presidency intends to pursue enlargement negotiations according to the established schedule.  I cannot tell at the moment whether the relationship between Turkey and Cyprus will have an impact on the dynamism of that process.<\/p> <p> The next question concerns the Greek elections.  I should apologise but I cannot comment on internal developments in EU member states.  I am confident that the Greek elections will happen in a transparent and democratic manner and in full accordance with Greek law concerning these issues.<\/p> <p> Another question is whether members of the European Commission should have an opinion, intervene or try to shape public opinion.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, that is beyond my competence at present.<\/p> <p> On another question concerning inclusive Europe and migration, I should recognise that migration is a permanent item on the Council agenda and this is not exactly a priority of Latvia's Presidency.  We recognise the fact that migration was one of the priorities of the preceding Presidency of Italy.  The Presidency system means that we probably achieve the ultimate balance in EU policy through the fact that the priorities change twice a year.  Italy's Presidency achieved significant progress in this respect.  We believe that future Presidencies will also prioritise that part of the agenda.  From our national perspective, unfortunately, we are not able to attach priority status to each and every task.  Our priority list was already extensive enough.<\/p> <p> Conflict resolution in general and also in Ukraine is a broad subject, while belonging to the domain of common foreign and security policy, CFSP, and common security and defence policy, CSDP.  The committee will be aware that the EU is not a military alliance and, therefore, the EU cannot use military means to resolve conflicts in its neighbourhood.  The policy instruments at the disposal of the EU and at the disposal first of the European External Action Service are conflict prevention mechanisms and negotiation with all the parties concerned.  When it comes within the competence of the Commission and member states, there are such instruments as CSDP missions.  For example, for some period a CSDP mission was considered for Ukraine which would not be a military peacekeeping or peace enforcement mission but rather a police mission assisting the Ukrainian police in its preparations for guaranteeing peace, security and stability in areas under its control.  Of course, in the domain of foreign relations, there is such an instrument as economic sanctions which are applied according to decisions of the European Council.  In that process also, the European Commission plays its role.<\/p> <p> However, in my capacity as a representative of the Presidency, I can only say at this point that the Presidency will do everything possible to promote progress through Council decisions on promoting conflict resolution in Ukraine and elsewhere.  This is what we can do.  Otherwise, the Council is free to apply any of the instruments I mentioned on that basis but the Presidency cannot separately promote conflict resolution without consulting the External Action Service and without consideration to prerogatives of other European institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015012000018#R00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.
