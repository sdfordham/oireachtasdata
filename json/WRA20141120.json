Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.<br\/><br\/>However, the Government also recognises the need for additional measures in the interim while the economy recovers. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work Strategy. Pathways to Work 2015 prioritises the allocation of available resources to the long-term unemployed. While many long-term unemployed return to occupations that required little or no reskilling, the Government recognises that in some cases certain skills may not be in strong demand at a particular point in time or that a de-skilling effect may take place when someone remains out of work for a long-period of time. The ambition in Strand 3 of Pathways to Work 2015 is: &ldquo;<i>To provide unemployed people, in particular people who are long-term unemployed and young unemployed people, with opportunities to enhance their job prospects through value-adding work experience, education and training activities<\/i>.&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>Hence, the Department in conjunction with other Departments and agencies (most notably the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills and Solas) has put in place a range of options for reskilling as part of the wider whole of government approach contained in the Pathways to Work Strategy. A range of SOLAS, ETB Further Education and Training and Higher Education Programmes are available to meet the needs of the long term unemployed. Fifty seven thousand places are targeted for the long term unemployed in 2014, and subject to demand a further 57,000 will be made available in 2015. <br\/><br\/>The places targeted for the long-term unemployed in 2014 include 8,700 places on Solas (formerly F&Aacute;S) training courses for unemployed people, 6,200 on Momentum, 4,300 on Springboard, 4,000 on PLC courses, 3,200 on VTOS, and 29,000 opportunities on other further education programmes. <br\/><br\/>The former FAS training provision is being progressively transferred to the new regional Education and Training Boards (ETBs) up to mid-2014. The main FAS\/Solas programmes of relevance to the long term unemployed are Specific Skills Training, Traineeships, Local Training Initiatives, and training for people with disabilities through Specialist Training Providers.<br\/><br\/>MOMENTUM, a scheme for education and training interventions, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs initiative, was rolled out by the Department of Education in 2013. MOMENTUM supports the provision of free education and training projects to allow up to 6,500 long term jobseekers to gain skills and to access work opportunities in identified growing sectors.<br\/><br\/>Long-term unemployed people undertaking re-training on a full-time basis generally qualify either for a Solas training allowance or for support from the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Back to Education Allowance scheme. Where the training is part-time or of shorter duration, support may be provided under the Part-time Education Option (PTEO) and Education Training and Development Option (ET&amp;amp;D). The PTEO allows participants to attend part-time day\/evening or weekend courses of education or training and retain their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while an entitlement exists provided that they continue to satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking employment on an on-going basis. Payment is made at the same rate as the primary payment and no maximisation of payments occurs. The ET&amp;amp;D allows participants to attend certain courses of education, training or development of short duration and retain their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment while an entitlement exists. Participants are exempt from engaging in job search but must be available for employment should an opportunity arise. <br\/><br\/>In conjuction with these programmes, there is also ongoing engagement between Intreo Offices and Education and Training Boards (ETBs) to ensure that training programmes are relevant to the needs of the unemployed. <br\/><br\/>More generally, substantial reform is being undertaken in the education and training sector to ensure programmes are relevant to the needs of learners and employers. <br\/><br\/>When taken together these reforms and initiatives constitute a comprehensive approach to the reskilling of the long-term unemployed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000062#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":31,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000062#WRA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":32,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[44733\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000062#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide in tabular form, the number of staff in her data protection office; if she has a specified data protection officer; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":33,"content":"<p><b>Staff numbers in Business Information Security Unit:<\/b><table><tr><th>NUMBER OF STAFF<\/th><th>Grade  <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Principal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1<\/td><td>Assistant Principal  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Higher Executive Officers\u00a0 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>The Department of Social Protection has a designated Head of Information Security at Principal level.

Depending on the supply being offered, different variations of VAT treatment may apply, but in all cases, suppliers established in Ireland compete on a level playing field in the UK market with UK established suppliers.<\/p><p>  The EU VAT Directive, with which Irish and UK VAT legislation must comply, distinguishes between a supply of goods and a supply of services.\u00a0 Where an Irish VAT registered trader makes a supply of goods to a UK business, the Irish trader zero-rates the supply and the UK business self-accounts for VAT on the goods.\u00a0 If the UK trader purchases the goods from a UK business, VAT would apply on the supply as normal.\u00a0 In both cases the UK trader will have the right to deduct the VAT charged on the goods if they are used for their taxable supplies.\u00a0 In this case the VAT treatment of the supply of goods is the same whether the supply is made from an Irish or a UK based supplier.<\/p><p>  With regard to the supply of a service of the installation of fittings to a UK business, the same VAT treatment applies.\u00a0 Where supplied by an Irish company, the service is zero-rated, and the UK business self-accounts for VAT.\u00a0 Where supplied by a UK company VAT is charged on the supply as normal.\u00a0 In both cases the UK trader will have the right to deduct the VAT charged on the service of the installation of fittings if they are used for their taxable supplies.\u00a0 Again, there is no difference in the entitlement to deduct input VAT by the UK company who receives the services, whether the supplier is based in Ireland or the UK.<\/p><p>  The VAT situation differs where the service being supplied relates to the installation of fixtures, but in any event, there is no discrimination in terms of VAT deductibility depending on the location of the supplier.\u00a0 Where a service consists of the installation of fixtures, the place of supply for VAT purposes will be the country where the installation takes place.\u00a0 In the case referred to in your correspondence, the installation of fixtures will take place in Ireland which means the service is liable to VAT in Ireland.\u00a0 In this situation the service should be charged with Irish VAT by both the Irish supplier and by the UK supplier, who will have to register for VAT in Ireland if not already registered.

take Questions Nos. 28 to 41, inclusive, together. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, my colleague Ged Nash TD, Minister for Business and Employment, presented the General Scheme of the proposed Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2014 to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for pre-legislative scrutiny at its meeting on 11 October last; it is my understanding that the Deputy was present at the meeting. The General Scheme and discussion which took place at the meeting addressed in detail most of the issues raised in this series of questions put down by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  The main purpose of the proposed Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2014 is twofold. Firstly, it will provide for the reintroduction of a mechanism for the registration of enterprise-level employment agreements. In this context an enterprise-level agreement means an agreement relating to the remuneration or the conditions of employment of workers of any class, type or group made between a trade union, or trade unions, of workers and an employer, or a trade union of employers that are binding only on the parties to the agreement.<\/p><p>  Such agreements will not be legally binding beyond the subscribing parties, nor would it be constitutionally permissible to so legislate. Indeed, prior to the Supreme Court ruling in the McGowan case, enterprise-level Registered Employment Agreements were not given general application on a sector-wide basis.<\/p><p>  Enterprise-level Registered Employment Agreements, which are in line with Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing voluntarist industrial relations system, provide certainty for the employer and workers in terms of rates of pay and other terms and conditions over the period of the agreement. Furthermore, all such agreements will be required to contain a provision that, if a trade dispute occurs between workers and their employer, a strike or lock-out shall not take place until the dispute has been submitted for settlement by negotiation in the manner specified in the agreement, thereby contributing to industrial peace in the enterprise or enterprises.<\/p><p>  As such agreements are not legally binding beyond the subscribing parties, the same constitutional issues regarding the delegation of legislative authority that arose in McGowan do not apply in these cases<\/p><p>  Such REAs will set terms and conditions across a range of matters; as they cannot undercut sectoral Orders, they cannot undermine such Orders.<\/p><p>  The Bill will separately provide for a new statutory framework for establishing minimum rates of remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment for a specified type, class or group of workers, particularly in the context of transnational provision of services and in the context of promoting harmonious relations between workers &ndash; in effect a framework to replace the former sectoral Registered Employment Agreements system, which included the Construction and Electrical Contracting Sector. <\/p><p>  In this context, the new framework proposes a mechanism whereby, in future, at the request, separately or jointly from organisations substantially representative of employers and\/or of workers, the Labour Court can initiate a review of the pay and pension and sick pay entitlements of workers in a particular sector and, if it deems it appropriate, make a recommendation to the Minister on the matter. <\/p><p>  The Labour Court is identified as the appropriate expert body to make judgment calls in relation as to whether a review should be instigated in the first place and, where it is, to decide on what recommendation, if any, to make to the Minister. As the Labour Court is the delegated authority, the legislation does not provide for an appeal mechanism in this regard.<\/p><p>  This mechanism is in contrast with the previous REA system struck down by the Supreme Court which, prior to the enactment of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012, provided for employment agreements made between trade unions and employer representatives being given general application by being registered by the Labour Court. The 2012 Act, which was not considered by the Supreme Court in McGowan, provided for a Statutory Order by the Minister confirming the registration of the agreement.<\/p><p>  The new legislation will provide the Labour Court with specific principles and policies that it will be obliged to take into account when considering whether to make and, if so, what recommendation to make to the Minister in relation to pay and pension\/sick pay terms in a particular sector. In this context, the proposed Bill provides that the Labour Court shall not undertake an examination unless it is satisfied that the request applies to all workers of a particular class, type or group and their employers in the identified sector and that the Court is satisfied that it is desirable or expedient to have separate terms and conditions relating to pay, or pension scheme and sick pay scheme for that class, type or group. In addition, the Court shall only undertake an examination where it is satisfied that the organisation or organisations making the request is\/are substantially representative of the class, type or group of workers and employers in the sector to which the request is expressed to apply, and any recommendation is likely to promote harmonious relations between such workers and employers.<\/p><p>  There is no specific definition of substantially representative in the proposed Bill, rather it will be a matter for the Labour Court to judge, based on the principles set out in the Bill. In this context, in satisfying itself  with regard to whether the parties are substantially representative, the Court will take into consideration -<\/p><p>  (i) the number of workers represented by the organisation representing the workers, and<\/p><p>  (ii) the number of workers employed by the employers represented by the organisation representing employers, in the class, type or group of workers to which the request is expressed to apply.<\/p><p>  The Court shall not make a recommendation to the Minister unless it is satisfied that<\/p><p>  i. to do so would promote harmonious relations between workers and employers and assist in the avoidance of industrial unrest;<\/p><p>  ii. the recommendation is reasonably necessary to promote and preserve high standards of training and qualifications in the sector; and<\/p><p>  iii. the recommendation is reasonably necessary to ensure fair and sustainable rates of remuneration in the identified sector, in light of EU law on the transnational provision of services.<\/p><p>  The Court shall, for the purpose of making a recommendation to the Minister, take into account\/ have regard to the following matters:<\/p><p>  (a) the potential impact of the recommendation on levels of employment and unemployment in the identified sector;<\/p><p>  (b) the terms of any relevant national agreement relating to pay and conditions for the time being in existence;<\/p><p>  (c) the potential impact of the recommendation on competitiveness in the identified sector;<\/p><p>  (d) the general level of wages in sectors within which workers of the same, class type or group are employed.<\/p><p>  If the Minister is satisfied that the process provided for in the new legislation has been complied with by the Labour Court, the Minister shall make the Order.  Where the Minister is not satisfied that the provisions have been complied with, he or she shall:<\/p><p>  i. refuse to make an order in accordance with the terms of the recommendation, and<\/p><p>  ii. notify the Court in writing of his or her decision and the reasons for the decision.<\/p><p>  The standard provisions dealing with the laying of orders before the Oireachtas are proposed.<\/p><p>  Where such an order is made in relation to a class, type or group of workers it will be binding across the sector to which it relates and will be enforceable by the National Employment Rights Authority. The existence of such a legislative provision is recognised under European Union law and ensures, in accordance with the Posted Workers Directive, that contractors from outside the jurisdiction, who may be using employees from lower wage economies, do not obtain an advantage over local contractors in terms of wage costs.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s robust suite of employment rights legislation, including any order made under this proposed legislation, applies to all workers, whether employed by a sub-contractor or other class of employer.  <\/p><p>  This sectoral mechanism proposed is constitutionally robust compared with the previous REA system struck down by the Supreme Court which, prior to the enactment of the IR (Amendment) Act 2012, provided for employment agreements made between trade unions and employer representatives being given general application by being registered by the Labour Court. As enterprise-level agreements never were and will not be legally binding beyond the subscribing parties, the same constitutional issues regarding the delegation of legislative authority that arose in McGowan do not apply in such cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000063#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000063#WRB02050"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[44730\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000063#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide in tabular form, the number of staff in his data protection office; if he has a specified data protection officer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":98,"content":"<p>Although my Department does not have a dedicated Data Protection Office, data protection functions are the responsibility of a specified Data Protection Officer at senior management level who is supported by a number of key staff within my Department and its Offices.<br\/><br\/>Set out in tabular format is the number of staff involved in Data Protection duties for my Department and its Offices only. <br\/><br\/>Finally, I have asked the Agencies under the aegis of my Department to advise me of the number of staff designated to deal with Data Protection within their organisations and I will communicate that information to the Deputy as soon as it is available.<table><tr><th>Main Department<\/th><th>Number of Data Protection compliance Officer(s)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Head Office<\/td><td>1 Data Protection Officer<br \/><br \/>1.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offices of the Department<\/td><td>Number of Data Protection compliance officer(s)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Companies Registration Office<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Employment Appeals Tribunal<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Register of Friendly Societies<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Labour Court<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LRC<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>NERA<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ODCE<\/td><td>.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Patents Office<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Equality Tribunal<\/td><td>.5<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000063#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000063#WRB02250"},{"type":"question","counter":100,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[44737\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000063#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which his Department has monitored possible obstacles to job retention and job creation; if any specific measures are contemplated in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":101,"content":"<p>The <i>Action Plan for Jobs<\/i>(APJ) is a whole-of-Government approach to job retention and job creation, with a specific ambition to have 100,000 more people in work by 2016. The first annual APJ was launched in February 2012, and its first successor was published in February 2013. Together, these comprised over 600 specific actions. The third APJ was published in February of this year, building on and drawing lessons from its predecessors. This multi-annual Framework represents a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach to strengthening the competitiveness of the Irish economy and to stimulating job creation and retention. Coupled with this, the APJ process contains a rigorous quarterly monitoring and reporting system.<br\/><br\/>The 2014 Action Plan, with a strong focus on the domestic economy, improving competitiveness and supporting our entrepreneurs and smaller firms with new Local Enterprise Offices, contains 385 actions. In total since the APJ was launched almost 1,000 actions have been proposed and progressed in order to deliver private sector-led, export-oriented economic growth and job creation.<br\/><br\/>The OECD has reviewed the APJ process and has found that the Plan&rsquo;s most striking innovation in the Irish public policy context is a coordination mechanism that ensures high-level political buy-in and oversight, whole-of-government engagement and the establishment of quarterly targets underpinned by a robust monitoring system.  <br\/><br\/>As of Q2 2014 there were1.9 million people were employed, an increase of 33,500 on last year. At 11% the rate of unemployment is still unacceptably high. This is why the Government has designated 2014 to be the &ldquo;year for jobs&rdquo;; we are working relentlessly to ensure that the unemployment rate continues to decrease.<br\/><br\/>In the third quarter of 2014, Departments and agencies were to deliver 100 measures relating to 84 of APJ2014&rsquo;s 385 actions. Some 88 of the measures due in Quarter 3 (Q3) of 2014 have been delivered, giving a completion rate of 88%. In delivering 88 third quarter measures under the Plan, the Government has, for example launched two programmes to support Youth\/Graduate Entrepreneurship, a competitive Youth\/Graduate Entrepreneurship Fund to complement the new  LEOs\/Microfinance Youth Programme, and rolled out &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Best Young  Entrepreneur&rdquo; competition which involves a total fund of &euro;2 million. The Government also launched a national trading online voucher scheme in Q3, which will target the distribution of 1,000 vouchers to Irish SME&rsquo;s in 2014, and which involves all 31 Local Enterprise Offices. These are just some examples of the practical job retention and job creation steps taken recently under the Action Plan process. <br\/><br\/>The Action Plan for Jobs is complemented with the Government&rsquo;s <i>Pathways to Work<\/i>labour market activation strategy. The <i>Pathways to Work<\/i>strategy, first introduced in 2012 and led by the Department of Social Protection, seeks to ensure that as many newly created jobs as possible go to people on the Live Register. The key strands of Pathways to Work include incentivising employers to provide more jobs for those who are unemployed, better engagement with unemployed people, greater targeting of activation places and opportunities for those who are long-term unemployed, and incentivising the take-up of employment opportunities by unemployed jobseekers.<br\/><br\/>In addition, we are continually monitoring skills supply and demand within the economy through the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. For example, over recent years there have been substantial job gains in the high-tech sector.

In the case of manufacturing, lower labour costs in Asia have, for many years had a significant impact on the production of lower value goods with high labour element, but Government policy has pursued the development of higher value areas. In fact since the advent of the recession, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved, as shown by our rise in International rankings, as various costs have been reduced.  While some of the specific data sought by the Deputy in his questions is not available in the precise format requested, overall trends are very positive. The Annual Forf&aacute;s Employment Survey shows a rise in employment in Agency supported manufacturing companies of over 3,300 since 2011. The latest data for Agency &ndash;supported Internationally Trading Services companies show a rise of over 14,000 in the same period. Other Services sectors in the domestic economy have shown significant growth in employment in recent years. <br\/><br\/>Manufacturing encompasses a broad range of sub-segments that present considerable opportunity for growth: Developing manufacturing has been adopted as a Disruptive Reform in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, with a range of measures designed to support industry growth including encouraging entrepreneurship, further improving our skills base, improving access to finance by SMEs and supporting a range of indigenous and foreign-owned manufacturing companies to transform their businesses as part of a National Step Change Initiative. The Manufacturing Development Forum is helping to address the key issues arising from the Manufacturing Strategy recommendations. <br\/><br\/>Services encompasses a diverse range of activities -  there is a complex mix of high value added internationally traded activities such as software, financial services and customer support services as well as more labour intensive (primarily) locally trading sectors such as retail, logistics, professional services and a range of private and public sector delivered healthcare,  education and transport services. <br\/><br\/>The Government have made great strides in addressing various issues impacting on costs for business over recent years  and we will continue to carry out analysis on  the various factors impacting on the cost base of all sectors, including manufacturing and services.  Maintaining and improving our competitiveness is an ongoing priority. <br\/><br\/>Innovation is a key characteristic of growing companies in both the Manufacturing and Services sectors. Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a range of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support. By way of illustration, in 2013 SFI had links to 65 per cent of the jobs announced by IDA in fields covered by SFI&rsquo;s legal remit.<br\/><br\/>The importance of innovation and technology to Ireland&rsquo;s on-going and future economic recovery is well recognised by the Government as being crucial to growth in both our indigenous and FDI sectors. Evidence, from both the EU and internationally, shows that the Government&rsquo;s strategy of accelerating the economic and societal return on our Science Technology and Innovation investment is paying off.  While is it not possible to fully disaggregate the contribution of Innovation and Technology to job creation, all the evidence is that it is very significant, as Ireland moves up the value chain and exploits our competitive position  in  knowledge based activity.  We have actively pursued the availability of EU funding for Research and Innovation and, in particular, we will ensure that we will access significant funding from both new EU <i>Horizon 2020 Programme,<\/i>to further enhance Irish business capability.<br\/><br\/>Measures designed to support industry growth are set out in the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2014<\/i>and include encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting start\u2010up activity, further improving our skills base, assisting our businesses to grow, improved access to finance by SMEs and developing and deepening opportunities from global investment.

Irish scores are weakest in the 'Macro-Economic Environment' category which is driven by Government debt and borrowing. Market size and access to funding are also somewhat weaker. These weaknesses are being addressed through Government macro-economic policies and the on-going focus on improving the performance of financial institutions.

I am very pleased that the Member States concerned and the EU Commission have already taken urgent steps to control the spread of the virus. The measures taken include the culling of the poultry on the affected holding, the establishment of protection and surveillance zones, the prohibition of movements to sell live poultry, eggs, poultry meat and other poultry products to other EU countries and non-EU countries and the culling of affected flocks only in the restricted zones. These measures will help to reduce the likelihood of the disease spreading to other countries, such as Ireland, but clearly, given the nature of the disease and the fact that it can be spread by migratory birds, they cannot guarantee that the disease will not spread.<br\/><br\/>I would like to stress that avian influenza is a disease of poultry and that there is no known food safety risk associated with the strain of the disease which has been confirmed in the 3 countries.\u00a0 The strain of the disease which has been confirmed is not the H5N1 virus that can cause severe disease in people who are infected from close contact with birds. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has stated that no human infections with the particular form of virus which has been confirmed as being involved in these outbreaks have ever been reported world-wide and that the public health threat from these outbreaks is considered very low.<br\/><br\/>In light of the increased threat of an incursion of this disease into this country, my Department has reviewed its state of preparedness to deal with an outbreak of the disease. The Department has a full range of contingency plans in place and, should an outbreak occur, it will take immediate measures to prevent the spread of the disease. The Department has been liaising with other State agencies including FSAI and the Department of Health on the matter. Close co-operation is being maintained with Bird Watch Ireland in relation to migratory patterns of wild birds. My Department has also been in touch with officials in DARDNI with a view to ensuring maximum co-operation in the event of an outbreak.<br\/><br\/>The key focus at this stage is that bio-security measures are applied at the optimal level on farms. In view of this, contact is being maintained with farm representatives and poultry processors to ensure that a high degree of vigilance is being maintained with a view to preventing the incursion of the disease, insofar as this is possible, and to detect an outbreak at an early stage in order to prevent its spread. Avian Influenza is notifiable to the Department and it is a legal requirement to notify any unusual increase in mortalities or any suspicion of the disease to the veterinary practitioner and to the Department.<br\/><br\/>The Department also operates an Avian Influenza hotline (<b>1890 252 283)<\/b>where members of the public can report dead wild birds.<br\/><br\/>I can assure the Deputy that the Department continues to maintain the upmost vigilance in its approach towards this disease and it will continue to monitor the situation very carefully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000064#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000064#WRC00550"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[44720\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000064#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will provide in tabular form, the number of staff in his data protection office; if he has a specified data protection officer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>There are four staff working in the Data Protection Unit in my Department as follows: <table><tr><th>Grade <\/th><th><div>Number <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Assistant Principal Officer <\/td><td>1 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Higher Executive Officer <\/td><td>1 - Data Protection Officer <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Executive Officer <\/td><td>2 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>These staff report to the Head of Corporate Affairs Division.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000064#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000064#WRC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[44758\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000064#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will arrange to issue disadvantaged and single farm payments in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":161,"content":"<p>The person named submitted a 2014 Single Farm Payment\/Disadvantaged Areas&rsquo; scheme application on 14 May 2014.

Members of the Board act in accordance with the primary legislation, the Ethics in Public Office Acts, the PSA General Governance Guidelines (which are based on the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies) and the Authority&rsquo;s Code of Business Conduct.

I am informed by the Authority that the standard required for the access control sector is SR 40:2005 - an Irish Standard Recommendation for electronic security services.  For CCTV, both the SR 40 standard and PSA 2006:12 are required, the latter being the Authority's requirements for CCTV installation. SR 40 is also the standard for intruder alarms along with two European Standards, EN 50131:1 and EN 50131:7.  It is a requirement of SR 40 that all installations comply with the national wiring rules (ET 101). I further understand that compliance with SR 40 is certified on an annual basis by auditing bodies accredited to Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB).

These functions are provided from the Burgh Quay offices in respect of the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  The offices also provides a range of other immigration related services with in the region of 130,000 people per annum attending in person at the office. These include applications for re-entry visas which are issued to visa-required nationals resident in Ireland to ensure they can return following a trip to their home country or a third country.  There is no requirement to attend in person to apply for such a visa and a postal service and a drop-box service are provided.<\/p><p>  The nature of the services provided is such that it is demand led and accordingly, there are peaks and valleys in the numbers of callers at different times of the year.  For the purpose of the efficient processing of the registration of up to five-hundred people  who attend at this registration office every day, GNIB personnel who are employed there operate a shift system, which ensures it is open from 8am to 9pm each Monday to Thursday and 8am to 6pm each Friday (excluding bank holidays) and remains open through lunchtime.  A numbered ticket issuing system is operated at this registration office, to ensure that those attending are dealt with on a &lsquo;first come first served&rsquo; basis.  In addition those attending are advised of the approximate time that they will be dealt with, which allows them to leave the office and return later in the day, if they so wish.  A GNIB officer is also deployed to meet with each person on arrival at the office to ensure that they are in possession of all of the necessary documentation required for registration, so that unnecessary delays are avoided.  Specific times are set aside for certain categories of persons such as students.  In addition, to deal with the recent high level of demand for services the office opened on two recent Saturdays: 4 October and 11 October 2014.<\/p><p>  In common with the operation of immigration functions in other States, immigrants seeking to register are required to present in person at my offices.  This is necessary for establishment of identity and as an anti-fraud measure and is the practice of immigration services worldwide.  For the majority of customers the Garda National Immigration Bureau provides a 'same day service' at its Burgh Quay office.<\/p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s customer service charter encompasses INIS and the organisation is continually seeking to improve the quality of services provided to customers.  A major overhaul of the public reception facilities in Burgh Quay with vastly improved public areas was completed last year.  In addition, the immigration service is planning to introduce an on-line booking system for appointments as part of a wider plan to transfer the registration function from the Garda National Immigration Bureau to INIS.  The aim of the booking system is to give certainty to customers that they will be dealt with within a stated time window and at the same time enabling the immigration service to match its staff resources to meet demand at any particular time.  The new reception facilities have been designed to cater for such a system.<\/p><p>  Finally, I might add that this office is probably one of the busiest Public Offices with some of the longest opening times in the State.  As I indicated earlier, around 130,000 persons attend the Burgh Quay office each year, which I am sure the Deputy will appreciate presents ongoing logistical challenges.  I am anxious that queuing be reduced to the absolute minimum at the earliest possible opportunity and consistent with the requirement to protect our immigration system from abuses.  I am confident that the measures outlined above will further improve the services provided to customers calling to this office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000065#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000065#WRD00750"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[44717\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000065#WRD00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to reform the firearms legislation; if her attention has been drawn to the concerns held by those who use firearms for sport with regard to this reform; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":222,"content":"<p>In light of public safety concerns<b><\/b>highlighted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and difficulties in the interpretation of the legislation expressed by members of the judiciary, a joint Department of Justice and Equality\/An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Working Group was established by my Department to review firearms licensing.

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the enhancement of their high standards of professional education and competencies. The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.<\/p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.<\/p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013\/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17th September, 2014.  A helpline, email address and website information page have been made available by the NMBI to provide clarification for registrants who may have queries on this matter.<\/p><p>  I am aware that a campaign by the staff associations not to pay the fee is actively underway and I am concerned regarding the possible implications for the health service and patient safety should this action continue.  My Department requested the Board to give this matter very careful consideration at its meeting on 19th November, with a view to agreeing and implementing a course of action most likely to achieve a satisfactory outcome. I understand that the staff associations have sought discussions with the Board in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000065#WRD02500","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000065#WRD02550"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[44564\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000065#WRD02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide in tabular form, for October 2013 and October 2014 for each local health area, the number of medical cards in circulation; the number of which are issued on the basis of the exercise of discretion; and the number of which are allocated to over 70s.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with these procedures, the NCPE conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.

The review was directed by a Steering Committee chaired by an independent chairperson and included key officials from four Government Departments.  The Report makes a number of recommendations including relating to the challenges associated with the operation of one-diplomat missions.<br\/><br\/>Overall, the review found that the work of our bilateral mission network in other EU member states plays a key role in helping Ireland maintain close relations with its EU partners and in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s economic and other interests. It also notes that, with quite modest resources, the missions do what they set out to do or are called upon to do; that they provide a platform to advance Ireland&rsquo;s policy objectives within the EU; and that in a variety of ways, these missions make important and timely contributions to promoting and protecting Ireland&rsquo;s strategic interests, including helping rebuild Ireland&rsquo;s reputation.<br\/><br\/>In discussing one-diplomat missions, the report notes the advantages and drawbacks of such representations and also highlights locations where such a model is not realistic - such as in countries where, for example, there are high demands for consular services - and the skills set required to oversee a one-diplomat mission. The advantages include reduced operating costs and the ability to maintain an active presence on the ground in a time of reduced resources, while the drawbacks include a high administrative burden on the Head of Mission.<br\/><br\/>The Department has a duty of care in respect of all staff serving abroad regardless of the size or the location of the mission.  We currently operate twelve one-diplomat missions (10 in Europe and 2 in the US) and, while there is no sense that these missions are &ldquo;fraught with difficulty&rdquo;, we do recognise that one-diplomat missions will from time to time require additional assistance from HQ or a neighbouring mission. Our Human Resources Unit has the capacity to make temporary assignments to cover leave or other absences, while Lead Units at HQ continue to make greater use of video conference facilities for ongoing engagement with missions as well as for planning and training purposes. In addition, the upcoming Heads of Mission conference in early 2015 will provide an opportunity to discuss the operations of these missions with the relevant Heads of Mission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000066#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000066#WRE02350"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[44678\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000066#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the issues discussed at the recent EU Foreign Affairs Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>I attended the most recent Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) in Brussels on 17 November. This FAC &ndash; the first chaired by the new High Representative Federica Mogherini &ndash; had a very busy agenda, with discussions on Ukraine, the Middle East, Ebola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Libya.<\/p><p>  Ukraine was the first item to be addressed. Our discussions focused on the path to peace, the reform process and maintaining a firm EU response to the crisis. The situation in Ukraine remains extremely fragile and I am deeply concerned in particular by reports of the increased level of violence and troop and weaponry movements in Eastern Ukraine. During our discussions I reiterated the importance of the full implementation of the Minsk agreement, and the need for a sustainable political solution, based on the respect for Ukraine's sovereignty, with clear guarantees of border security, disarmament of all illegal groups and the withdrawal of foreign forces. I joined with my colleagues in supporting a new initiative by High Representative Mogherini to undertake outreach to the parties involved. This will complement the important contribution being made by the OSCE. I also joined with colleagues in welcoming the parliamentary elections which took place on 26 October in Ukraine, and in looking forward to the early formation of a new Government which can seize the mandate for reform given to it by the Ukrainian people. I believe that there is now a need and an opportunity for outreach, national dialogue and reconciliation. At the Council meeting I stressed the need for the new Government to implement an ambitious reform programme to build confidence among the people throughout Ukraine.<\/p><p>  The question of an appropriate EU response to the deteriorating security situation in Eastern Ukraine and the illegal and illegitimate elections, which took place in Donetsk and Luhansk on 2 November, was also discussed. A decision was reached to prepare further sanctions against separatists by the end of November. Council conclusions on Ukraine were adopted.<\/p><p>  The Council then exchanged views on latest developments in the Middle East Peace Process and received a report from the High Representative on her recent visit to the region. I had advocated such a visit and welcome it as a sign of the continued priority which the EU accords this issue. The growing violence by both sides in East Jerusalem and the West Bank is of great concern, and shows us that continued political failure will leave a vacuum which more militant or despairing voices will fill. Gaza has just highlighted the perils of allowing an unsustainable situation to simply drift on. I believe that the EU must become more actively engaged in the efforts to re-launch the peace process, and in confronting the increasingly serious threats to securing a viable, negotiated two-State solution. I am confident that High Representative Mogherini will embrace a more active role for the EU so that we can play our part in bringing about a comprehensive peace settlement. At our meeting Foreign Minister Wallstrom also took the opportunity to brief the Council on Sweden&rsquo;s recognition of Palestine. Council conclusions on the Middle East Peace Process were adopted.<\/p><p>  The Council was then briefed by EU Ebola coordinator Christos Stylianides on his priorities and on the findings of his mission together with Health Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis to the affected countries in West Africa. With the EU and its Member States having together pledged &euro;1 billion in funding, the EU is the prime donor amongst the international community in addressing Ebola. Ireland continues to work closely with EU partners as well as through the UN system to ensure a coordinated and robust response to this crisis. On the ground in West Africa, Ireland is working to combat the spread of Ebola, providing support of over &euro;17 million to the affected countries. Three members of the Irish Defence Forces will also be deployed to Sierra Leone to reinforce Ireland's Embassy in Freetown. The Council also discussed a proposal from Germany and France for the EU to establish a reserve pool of health experts which would allow for quick and targeted deployment in future health crises similar to the Ebola crisis. It was decided that this proposal could be considered at a future point following the current crisis. Council conclusions on Ebola were adopted.<\/p><p>  The Council took stock of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the elections on 12 October. Ministers discussed ways and means to encourage reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European perspective for the country. Ireland has long been a strong supporter of Bosnia and Herzegovina&rsquo;s EU aspirations and we are supportive of proposals that might unblock the current stand still. It remains important however that there is no relaxation of the substantive conditions which are an integral part of the enlargement process.<\/p><p>  The Council briefly discussed the current situation in Libya. I joined with my colleagues in expressing our full support for the efforts of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General, Bernardino Leon, to address the current crisis for the benefit of the people of Libya.<\/p><p>  Finally the Council approved, without discussion, the Council Conclusions on CSDP which were formally adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council (Defence) on 18 November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000066#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[44679\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014112000066#WRE02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he raised with his EU counterparts the need to recognise the state of Palestine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":308,"content":"<p>I have addressed in replies to recent Questions and also outlined in some detail, when meeting the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade on 11 November, the Government&rsquo;s position on the possible recognition of Palestine.

The current practice is to use a guideline of 80m&sup2; as the standard size for a general primary school classroom. This space allows for the inclusion of two en-suite toilets and in room storage. In the case of existing schools and given the limitations of existing buildings, site conditions and funding availability, it is not always possible to achieve the level of accommodation that is provided with a new school design. For example, ensuring the availability of sufficient playground space can be much more difficult particularly in town and city locations. However, such limitations can often be addressed through the use of a school's general purpose room together with the arranging of access to local community facilities and amenities.<\/p><p>  The Government's focus in recent years has been on operating a budgetary programme that is designed to return the Government finances to a sustainable basis.

The studies will involve desktop studies and marine survey studies to collect data to inform a decision on the feasibility and possible benefits of such an interconnector. If, on completion of the studies, the project is deemed viable, both partners would then decide on progression to the planning and development stages.
