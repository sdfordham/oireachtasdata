Our policy of military neutrality remains a core element of Irish foreign policy. The Government&rsquo;s recent review of foreign policy and the Defence White Paper confirmed that Ireland will continue to maintain a policy of military neutrality which is characterised by non-membership of military alliances and non-participation in common or mutual defence arrangements.   <\/p>  <p>  Neutrality has always been a matter of policy and has never been a matter of law either constitutional or statutory. Ireland's policy of military neutrality was formed in an era when inter-State conflict was the key issue of national security for most States. The State&rsquo;s policy of remaining outside of military alliances has remained in place ever since. Thankfully, the threat of inter-State war in Europe is much diminished, but there will continue to be new and emerging threats in the defence and security environment. <\/p>  <p>  The reality remains that the world continues to evolve to such an extent that no one country alone can respond adequately to the threats in the defence and security environment and inevitably there will be threats and challenges that have not yet been anticipated. Such security challenges will require an enhanced collective and comprehensive approach, and there will be an increasing emphasis on security co-operation. <\/p>  <p>The issue of overflights and the use of Shannon are the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. However, the Deputy will be aware that successive Governments have made overflight and landing facilities available at Shannon Airport to the United States for well over 50 years. These arrangements do not amount to any form of military alliance with the US and are governed by strict conditions, applied to ensure compatibility with our traditional policy of military neutrality.   <\/p>  <p>Finally, it goes without saying that all our policy responses must realistically reflect current and future security challenges and should be able to accommodate the necessary responses, both national and collective without prejudice to our policy of military neutrality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800042#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Recruitment","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800042#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[34449\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800042#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the role the Defence Forces will play in supporting employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>It is recognised that the Defence Forces has a limited role in relation to the employment support agenda.

Subject to the availability of seagoing berths, Naval reservists also receive annual training on board Naval Service ships when on patrol.      The availability of seagoing berths was however significantly restricted in 2014 for a number of reasons, including the non-availability of L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Ciara due to the necessity to carry out urgent remedial works on both vessels. In addition there was a requirement to carry out unforeseen maintenance arising from a serious engine problem encountered by L&Eacute; Eithne.

As the White Paper notes, the threats to international peace and national security are complex, multi-dimensional, interrelated and transnational in nature. A feature of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to these security challenges is continued strong support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the UN and of the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security. In recent years, the UN has increasingly mandated regional organisations such as the EU, the African Union and NATO to manage operations on its behalf and under its authority. <\/p>  <p>Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy on military neutrality remains completely unaffected by deepening our relationship with the EU or by our support of, or participation in, CSDP operations with military elements. In keeping with our support for the multilateral system of collective security, Ireland will continue to play a full and active part in all facets of the EU&rsquo;s CSDP in accordance with nationally determined values and principles. A key objective in the continued development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy is the ability to respond rapidly to emerging crises. The EU, quite rightly, now engages in a wide range of crisis management operations, invariably in support of or in partnership with the UN. These actions, referred to as the Petersberg tasks, are humanitarian and rescue tasks, peace-keeping tasks and the tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking, joint disarmament operations, military advice and assistance tasks in supporting the reform and restructuring of security services and legal institutions in fragile States, conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilisation. Ireland will continue to play a full and active role in this regard.   <\/p>  <p>Similarly, close cooperation between NATO and the UN and its agencies is an other important element in the development of an international &ldquo;Comprehensive Approach&rdquo; to crisis management and operations. Ireland&rsquo;s participation in NATO-led operations such as the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan and the NATO-led KFOR Mission in Kosovo in no way infringes upon our traditional policy of military neutrality. These are operations authorised by successive UN Security Council resolutions, undertaken at the UN's behest and very often working congruently with a UN mission   . <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland&rsquo;s cooperation with NATO is conducted through the Partnership for Peace (PfP) which we joined in 1999 following approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Presentation Document.\u00a0 Our purpose in participating in the PfP is to improve our military capabilities so as to ensure that our Defence Forces have the necessary interoperable capabilities to participate effectively and safely with other like minded nations in UN mandated operations. <\/p>  <p>As the White Paper notes, this will include engagement with the Connected Forces Initiative (CFI), the Planning and Review Process (PARP), and the Operational Capabilities Concept (OCC).   <\/p>  <p>In joining PfP, Ireland, in common with other PfP nations, reaffirmed its commitment to fulfil in good faith the obligations of the United Nations Charter, and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Equally, Ireland reaffirmed its commitment to the Helsinki Final Act and all subsequent documents of the OSCE.   Ireland&rsquo;s decision to participate in PfP is in full accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality and it is worth noting that many other like-minded States, in particular Austria, Switzerland, Malta, Sweden and Finland also participate in PfP. <\/p>  <p>Ireland will continue to engage proactively with the UN, the EU, the OSCE and NATO\/PfP and other States with a view to developing and deepening relationships in the development of an international approach to crisis management and operations, without prejudice to our policy of military neutrality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800043#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Union Naval Force Operation&ndash;Mediterranean","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800043#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[34385\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800043#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will report on the role the Defence Forces are playing in the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean; and his future plans for this role.","asker":"1110","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>Following a Government Decision on 12 May 2015, an Irish Naval Vessel, L.&Eacute;.

As the White Paper notes, the threats to international peace and national security are complex, multi-dimensional, interrelated and transnational in nature. A feature of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to these security challenges is continued strong support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the UN and of the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security. In recent years, the UN has increasingly mandated regional organisations such as the EU, the African Union and NATO to manage operations on its behalf and under its authority. <\/p>  <p>Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy on military neutrality remains completely unaffected by deepening our relationship with the EU or by our support of, or participation in, CSDP operations with military elements. In keeping with our support for the multilateral system of collective security, Ireland will continue to play a full and active part in all facets of the EU&rsquo;s CSDP in accordance with nationally determined values and principles. A key objective in the continued development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy is the ability to respond rapidly to emerging crises. The EU, quite rightly, now engages in a wide range of crisis management operations, invariably in support of or in partnership with the UN. These actions, referred to as the Petersberg tasks, are humanitarian and rescue tasks, peace-keeping tasks and the tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking, joint disarmament operations, military advice and assistance tasks in supporting the reform and restructuring of security services and legal institutions in fragile States, conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilisation. Ireland will continue to play a full and active role in this regard.   <\/p>  <p>  Similarly, close cooperation between NATO and the UN and its agencies is another important element in the development of an international &ldquo;Comprehensive Approach&rdquo; to crisis management and operations. Ireland&rsquo;s participation in NATO-led operations such as the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan and the NATO-led KFOR Mission in Kosovo in no way infringes upon our traditional policy of military neutrality. These are operations authorised by successive UN Security Council resolutions, undertaken at the UN's behest and very often working congruently with a UN mission. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland&rsquo;s cooperation with NATO is conducted through the Partnership for Peace (PfP) which we joined in 1999 following approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Presentation Document.\u00a0 Our purpose in participating in the PfP is to improve our military capabilities so as to ensure that our Defence Forces have the necessary interoperable capabilities to participate effectively and safely with other like minded nations in UN mandated operations. <\/p>  <p>As the White Paper notes, this will include engagement with the Connected Forces Initiative (CFI), the Planning and Review Process (PARP), and the Operational Capabilities Concept (OCC).   <\/p>  <p>In joining PfP, Ireland, in common with other PfP nations, reaffirmed its commitment to fulfil in good faith the obligations of the United Nations Charter, and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Equally, Ireland reaffirmed its commitment to the Helsinki Final Act and all subsequent documents of the OSCE.   Ireland&rsquo;s decision to participate in PfP is in full accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality and it is worth noting that many other like-minded States, in particular Austria, Switzerland, Malta, Sweden and Finland also participate in PfP. <\/p>  <p>Ireland will continue to engage proactively with the UN, the EU, the OSCE and NATO\/PfP and other states with a view to developing and deepening relationships in the development of an international approach to crisis management and operations, without prejudice to our policy of military neutrality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800043#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800043#WRB02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions Payments","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800043#WRB02550"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[35085\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800043#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will reconsider the pension calculation which was brought in during the austerity period where a person who has worked considerable amount of time with a short break is receiving the same contributions as one who has never worked in their lives (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>The State pension contributory is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must &ndash; <\/p>  <p>have at least 520 paid contributions, and <\/p>  <p>satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages). <\/p>  <p>  Working part-time would not generally reduce entitlement, as part-time workers also pay weekly PRSI contributions, however absences from the labour force - when contributions were neither deducted from pay nor credited in respect of a social welfare payment &ndash; may impact upon the rate of a person&rsquo;s pension.<\/p>  <p>  This can be mitigated by the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  It should be noted however that the scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions must also be satisfied. <\/p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced. These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. <\/p>  <p>  Those with lower earnings and those with lesser contribution histories continue to obtain the best value for money from the Social Insurance Fund. Even for those with an average of only 20 contributions per year (i.e. 38% of the maximum), reduced rate State pensions of &euro;196 are now paid, a higher rate than the full rate in 2007, so that those retiring after September 2012 who are being paid a reduced amount under the new bands are still receiving more, in real terms, than the maximum pension rates that applied during most of their working life. <\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  Where someone over 66 does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may apply for a non-contributory pension, which is based on need and is means tested. The maximum rate of this pension is &euro;219 weekly, which is 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension. <\/p>  <p>  Where it is more beneficial for the claimant, they may instead seek an Increase for Qualified Adult payment, on their spouse&rsquo;s State pension contributory, the maximum rate of which is &euro;206.30.  This increase is, by default, paid directly to the Qualified Adult. <\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800043#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wage Subsidy Scheme","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800043#WRB02750"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[35174\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800043#WRB02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on the issues raised in correspondence from a group (details supplied).","asker":"1069","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>The wage subsidy scheme (WSS) is an employment support to private sector employers, the purpose of which is to increase the numbers of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market. The scheme encourages employers by providing financial incentives to employ people with a disability for between 21 and 39 hours per week under a contract of employment. The rationale behind this approach is to increase the potential for people with disabilities, with the capacity to do so, to obtain employment in the open labour market and become more independent and therefore less reliant on social welfare payments. Any reduction of the hours worked threshold would dilute this policy intent.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the proposal to abolish PRSI contributions for a person with a disability, it should be noted that social insurance is based on the principle that there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions paid and entitlement to a range of social insurance benefits which are payable as a right, if and when particular contingencies arise.  This contributory principle underpins both the operation and the funding of social insurance. Dispensing with the requirement to pay PRSI contributions while retaining an entitlement to social insurance benefits, for any particular category of worker, would negate this principle.

The Review covers a 55 year period and builds on the findings of previous Actuarial Reviews, taking account of the policy, economic and demographic changes with particular reference to income and expenditure projections as well as value for money and break-even contribution rates issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Review found that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  The report also found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This is compared favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  In relation to the provision of jobseeker's benefit to the self-employed, the report found that an incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker's benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.<\/p>  <p>  The report estimated the full year incremental costs of extending jobseeker's benefit to the self-employed to be &euro;87m, in 2012 terms, where the incidence rate of benefit is the same as that applying to the overall population. This was estimated using a number of assumptions based on the existing population of contributors and beneficiaries.<\/p>  <p>  The extension of jobseeker's benefit to the self-employed was subsequently examined in the Third Report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, published in September 2013.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.<\/p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800044#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Applications","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800044#WRC01750"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[35059\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800044#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Roscommon will receive a decision on a review; the reason for the delay; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":112,"content":"<p>The department received a claim for invalidity pension (IP) from the person concerned on the 08 April 2015.

Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation. While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to now, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate. <\/p>  <p>  I decided to change the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF. This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided. <\/p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years. In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy. <\/p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75. This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down. However, this draw down will also be available to them for periods when their AMRF investments make losses or returns of less than 4% of the value of their AMRF assets and where, under the previous arrangement, they would not have been able to make a draw down or a draw down of a lesser value than will now be permitted.

This approach was taken\u00a0as the Department is cognisant of the fact that credit unions needed time to implement all aspects of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner and so this has informed the timeline for implementation of the various measures on different dates.<\/p>  <p>  I have not yet signed\u00a0the order\u00a0to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act which relate to\u00a0the following areas: reserves; liquidity; lending; investments; savings; borrowing; systems, controls and reporting arrangements; and services exempt from additional services requirements. <\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that the draft regulations set out in\u00a0Consultation Paper 88 (CP88), will be introduced\u00a0at end December 2015. \u00a0It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations.\u00a0 These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. <\/p>  <p>  My role as Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. <\/p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank\u00a0is the independent regulator for credit unions.\u00a0 Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. <\/p>  <p>  While it is important to distinguish this division of roles,\u00a0it is equally important to recognise that both the Registrar of Credit Unions and myself, as Minister for Finance are working together for the safety of members' savings and the security of the credit union sector.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the new sections into the 1997 Act by the 2012 Act will, in effect, remove some of the requirements (including limits) that currently exist in certain sections and will provide regulation making powers to the Central Bank. The new sections will also contain a number of new requirements.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>The regulations will introduce a maximum individual member's savings limit of &euro;100,000 which will ensure the protection of members' savings   and continue to ensure that credit unions' funding is sufficiently diversified and is not dependent on a small number of members.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Following consultation with the credit union sector and representative bodies, the Central Bank amended the transitional arrangement for the savings regulations to provide for credit unions that have individual member savings in excess of &euro;100,000 at the commencement of the regulations to apply to the Central Bank to retain these savings where they can demonstrate that it is appropriate and prudent for them to do so. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Central Bank's feedback statement on CP88, as part of the consultation process I proposed that in the interests of clarity and fairness, credit unions are provided with details of the process of applying for a retention of savings above the limit amount.\u00a0 I have been informed by the Registry of Credit Unions that all credit unions have been contacted giving further information on its application criteria for the retention of savings in excess of &euro;100,000.\u00a0 The Registry of Credit Unions intends to engage with the representative bodies and to invite comments from them prior to finalisation of the application process. When the application process is finalised, the Registry will provide an application form and explanatory notes in order to assist credit unions. It is anticipated that application forms will be available during December 2015.\u00a0 It is envisaged that applications will be accepted in the first quarter of 2016 and that applicant credit unions will be informed by the end of the second quarter of 2016 on the outcome of the process, which is well within the 12 month transitional period. Where a credit union has demonstrated that it meets the criteria, it will be in a position to retain members' savings in excess of &euro;100,000 held at the commencement of the regulations. <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the steps that have been taken to provide clarity for credit unions on the criteria for the retention of savings over &euro;100,000 and also welcome the proposed engagement with the representative bodies to seek their comments on the application process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also informed me that it is committed to undertaking a review of the continued appropriateness of the savings limit, once the impact of the restructuring process can be assessed. It is envisaged that this review will commence within three years of the introduction of the regulations. The Central Bank has agreed to provide regular updates to my Department on developments in this matter. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has further informed me that it is open to working with the credit union sector\u00a0to ensure that prudent and appropriate business development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework.\u00a0As set out in the feedback statement on CP88, the Central Bank intends to invite interested parties to discuss business model development in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is\u00a0absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800046#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800046#WRE01150"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[34973\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800046#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a person (details supplied) in County Kildare is due a tax rebate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not have sufficient information to establish if the person concerned is entitled to a repayment of tax.

Previously both the South West and the South East Regions were managed through the IDA Regional office in Cork, but as a full-time manager has now been appointed to the South East Region, the South West team is now focussed solely on Cork and Kerry.The agency markets Kerry as part of its South West region, along with Cork.  There are 158 multinational companies based in the Region, employing a total of 30,419, according to the Annual Employment Survey for 2014 Figures for 2015 will not be available until completion of the survey early next year. Kerry has 12 IDA Ireland client companies, employing 1,874 people.<\/p><p>Companies supported by IDA Ireland in Kerry have added 361 additional new jobs between 2011 &ndash; 2014 (a 24% increase) compared to 502 job losses  in the period 2008 &ndash; 2010 (a 25% decrease). It should be noted that 70% of new IDA jobs come from existing client companies, not from new investments.<\/p><p>Marketing of any regional area, including Kerry, for Foreign Direct Investment is done through IDA Ireland&rsquo;s network of overseas offices.  IDA Ireland actively incentivises and encourages investors to consider a range of potential locations in Ireland although the ultimate locations selected are always decided<font color=\"#5F5F5F\"> <\/font>by the companies themselves.<\/p><p>Achieving a balanced regional dispersal of employment is challenging. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s new five year strategy Winning &ndash; Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019contains a strong focus on regional development, setting forth aims and strategies to achieve a significant increase in investment going into regional locations. To support that aim, IDA Ireland is rolling out a &euro;150million capital investment programme to help attract more multinational jobs into each region over a 5-year period. This programme will include investments over the coming years in building advanced technology buildings and office facilities in a number of regional locations to provide state-of-the-art property solutions for clients. Tralee is to be the site of one such advanced technology building.<\/p><p>A further boost to the county is the reinstatement of Regional Aid for Co. Kerry under the new Regional Aid Guidelines, which came into force on 1stJuly, 2014. The RAGs enable the State to grant State Aid, at enhanced rates, to businesses in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions. This funding for this comes from the Exchequer. This means that the full range of Regional Aid assistance options are available in Kerry.  <\/p><p>As well as working to attract new investment into the region, an important focus for IDA Ireland is on supporting the needs of existing companies to help them to grow and develop, allowing them to add jobs.<\/p><p>In July 2015, IDA Ireland with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation launched the South West Regional Action Plan for Jobs  , which highlights working with the other agencies and local stakeholders to improve enterprise development and identify job creation opportunities at regional level. IDA Ireland engages particularly with Enterprise Ireland regarding the supply chain that can be in a position to encourage and support Foreign Direct Investment.<\/p><p>It is important to recognise that only 8% of employment is in IDA supported companies nationally. The Action Plan for Jobs and the Regional Action Plans are committed to developing an indigenous engine of growth. In the period 2011-2014 Enterprise Ireland supported companies created an extra 370 jobs in Kerry (9% increase), while companies supported by the Kerry LEO added 85 new jobs in 2014 (5% increase).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800047#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800048#WRG00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Payments","counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800048#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":195,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[34959\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800048#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payments under the areas of natural constraints scheme and the basic payment scheme will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":196,"content":"<p>An application under the 2015 Basic Payments\/Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme was received from the person named on 7 May 2015.

In relation to forestry, it is envisaged that the TRP will determine, inter alia, the circumstances in which afforestation, if any, might be accommodated in Hen Harrier SPAs without impacting on the conservation of the species.\u00a0 In the meantime, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) is not in a position to grant approval for any afforestation projects in those areas, until the TRP has been completed and measures identified as being necessary to preserve, maintain or re-establish suitable Hen Harrier habitats have been determined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800049#WRH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes","counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800049#WRH00550"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[35064\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800049#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to introduce measures to address the income difficulties in the sheep sector, including a new direct payment scheme to replace the sheep grassland scheme; if sheep farmers will receive priority access to the green low-carbon agri-environmental scheme to replace income lost due to the ending of the rural environment protection scheme in 2015; his plans to reinstate the sheep handling and fencing grant under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme II; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This option is only available where the Member State is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new CAP.\u00a0 Accordingly, while the legal basis for the former Grassland Sheep Scheme is no longer in place under the new regulations, these payments have been taken into account under the new Basic Payments Scheme. Many sheep farmers will also benefit significantly from the model of convergence to be applied in Ireland where those with a low Initial Unit Value will see their entitlements increase over the period of the new Basic Payment Scheme.  In addition, in negotiating and developing the new Rural Development Programme, 2014-2020, I have included a number of schemes that will be of direct benefit to sheep farmers . For example, a strong commitment to continuation of funding under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme (formerly the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme), a range of supports under the new Capital Investment Scheme TAMS II, the prioritisation afforded to commonage farmers under GLAS, and support for a specific Knowledge Transfer Group for sheep farmers will be of particular benefit in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Green, Low-carbon, Agri-environment Scheme (GLAS) will shortly re-open for applications.\u00a0 Those farmers who wish to apply may do so by engaging an approved GLAS Advisor to prepare their application.\u00a0 Tier 1 applicants will receive first priority access to the Scheme, followed by Tier 2 then Tier 3.\u00a0 Many sheep farmers will also be commonage shareholders and as such they would receive priority access to the scheme.

This is largely due to potential double funding which would arise from the completion of more than one Farm Improvement Plan for a single farming enterprise.  I have, however, asked my officials to examine how farmers could participate in more than one Knowledge Transfer group across two sectors, while at the same time avoiding double funding issues.<\/p>  <p> - The issue of allowing a named nominee to attend a Knowledge Transfer Group has also been raised and, following on from further consideration of this issue, an appropriate named nominee will now be allowed to attend meetings in the place of a farmer participating in a Knowledge Transfer Group.

These include the Low Input Permanent Pasture action and the Planting of New Hedgerows.  For this reason, it is proposed to adjust the provision for the Low Input Permanent Pasture (LIPP) action under the second tranche of GLAS, in recognition of the fact that we have already met all our targets. As things stand, over 20% of the entire budget for GLAS will be directed towards payments of this one action. However, it will still be possible to take up to 10 hectares of either LIPP or Traditional Hay Meadow as before, but the LIPP component will be limited to 5 hectares. Instead, I would like to see more farmers avail of the Traditional Hay Meadow option, which attracts the same rate of payment. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the planting of new hedgerows, I am proposing to suspend this action for Tranche 2, along with the planting of traditional orchards.

They are at an advanced stage in the implementation of AVFC   and have already moved into population sectors of 50,000, appointed team co-ordinators, and developed an over-arching Clinical Governance model.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has secured an additional 54 new staff posts for Galway\/Roscommon since 2012, of which the bulk are now in place with remaining posts well advanced through recruitment. The new posts include additional Consultants in the areas of General Adult Community Mental Health Teams, Psychiatry- of- Later Life teams, and Rehabilitation and Recovery Teams.  Allied staff includes Occupational Therapists, Community Mental Health Nurses, Social Workers and Psychologists.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2014, a new Day Hospital was opened for Child and Adolescents across Galway and Roscommon. This initiative was completed with the help of clients of the service. The Day Hospital caters for adolescents aged 12-18 years of age with severe and\/or complex mental health difficulties from the Galway\/Roscommon CAMHS.  This is a programme for those who require intensive, multidisciplinary treatment but do not require inpatient hospitalisation. Treatment will include intensive group, family and individual therapies but most importantly will allow the young person to remain at home with their family and remain within their community. Connections will be maintained with their school and other social supports.<\/p>  <p>  Key to modernising services in line with current and future demand, and best international practice, is re-orientation from a hospital and bed-based focus to developing structures and processes required for enhanced community based provision.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Galway\/Roscommon Mental Health Service has a nursing complement of almost 400 whole time equivalent (WTEs). The service had a spend of &euro;62.3m in 2013, &euro;63.4m in 2014 and an allocation of &euro;65m in 2015 before   receiving its share of the 2015 development funding. Also, the service has mental health spending of around &euro;190 per head of population which, when adjusted for deprivation indices, compares very favourably to the national average of &euro;161 per head.<\/p>  <p>Following the closure of St. Brigid&rsquo;s, approximately &euro;3 million has been invested by the HSE in Ballinasloe to ensure that community based mental health services are delivered effectively. Its refurbishment was carried out to ensure reconfiguration of the building from acute to community based services, in line with A Vision for Change.  The refurbishment was necessary also to meet relevant statutory building standards.  The building is being used for Psychiatry of Later Life patients, Community Mental Health Teams, and Mental Health Intellectual Disability services and a range of other community mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the standard of care provided by the Inpatient Unit in University Hospital Galway an agreement was reached between the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA) on 3 June 2015, that a joint and sustained effort will be made to improve the quality of care for service users, their families and the staff who care for them. Central to this agreement is the opening of the high observation area and a revised staffing compliment of 64 WTEs which will further enhance patient care. During the implementation of this agreement there is a commitment to flexibility by all parties to mitigate any short term deficits or difficulties which arise. This is being aided by an additional 16 staff being recruited for the Community Home Based Intensive Treatment Team, as an alternative to admission to Galway University Hospital. The Roscommon area has developed a Home Based Intensive Treatment team, since February this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Acute Unit in Galway continues to recruit additional Nursing Staff, including 2 Clinical Nurse Managers, 5 Registered Psychiatric nurses,1 Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse, and progressing registration for 12 post graduate nurses. In addition, 6 Clinical Nurse Managers and 10 Staff Nurses are in the process of recruitment.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that local HSE management has recently met with the Health and Safety Authority, and staff representatives, and that all concerns highlighted regarding Health and Safety are being addressed as constructively as possible. Any indication that Galway Mental Health Service is an unsafe service is unfounded, and any patient or staff member requiring assistance from the service is encouraged to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800056#WRP02400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Complaints","counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800056#WRP02500"},{"type":"question","counter":433,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[35003\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800056#WRP02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the national advocacy unit is still operational; if so, if there is a set timeframe for reply to a complainant; to conduct an investigation into the complaint; and to have a final decision made by the complaints officer.","asker":"1099","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":434,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter the question has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p><p>If no reply has been received from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with the Executive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800056#WRP02700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Recruitment","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800056#WRP02800"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[35004\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800056#WRP02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a rheumatologist will be appointed to Mayo General Hospital on a full-time basis, rather that one day per week, as this is not sufficient; if the rheumatologist will have a full back-up team; when a rheumatology day infusion ward will be provided at this location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1074","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  The vaccine has not been available since the end of April 2015.  The licensed supplier has informed the HSE that the BCG vaccine will be delivered into Ireland in late October.  <\/p>  <p>  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG and with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) who licenses vaccines in Ireland as well as with other relevant stakeholders.  The HPRA have been seeking to find an alternative supply of BCG that meets safety, quality and effectiveness standards and that could be used in Ireland.  To date no appropriate alternative manufacturer of BCG vaccine has been found.<\/p>  <p>  In early 2015 the HSE asked the HPRA to look at extending the shelf life of BCG vaccine from 12 months to 18 months.  The HPRA reviewed the necessary documentation and agreed to extend the shelf life of any new delivery of BCG vaccine to 18 months.  Any new deliveries of BCG will have an 18 month shelf life.<\/p>  <p>  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the National TB Advisory Committee have recommended stopping routine BCG vaccination of newborn babies and instead provide a selective vaccination of babies in high-risk babies groups.  The Department of Health have requested the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to conduct a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to review the implications of this change.  HIQA commenced a public consultation on proposed changes to the BCG vaccination programme in Ireland on September 9th 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Tuberculosis (TB) is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I.

Most European countries, including the UK, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland do not give BCG vaccine to all babies.

This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12.  The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure.  The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.

The most recent EU review of cumulative global safety update data completed in December 2014 concluded that the benefit\/risk profile for Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>remains positive.<\/p><p>Up to the 11 September 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 901 reports of suspected adverse reactions\/events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines (Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>899 and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>2).  The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA regarding both Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix vaccines to date have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information.  Vaccination related events, occurring at the time of vaccine administration, such as syncope (faints) has been among the most commonly reported effects.  Other commonly reported symptoms include gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.  Reports of allergic-type reactions including skin rashes, urticaria and flushing have also been received, including isolated reports of more severe hypersensitivity-type reactions.<\/p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting ().  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  All reports received through the online reporting options receive an acknowledgement and case record number on successful submission of a report.  Further information is provided to reporters in respect of any questions\/concerns reflected in their reports, in the context of report follow up.

Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they who face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. <\/p><p>Where a person does not qualify for a medical card, they may be provided with a GP Visit Card, appropriate therapy or other community supports or drugs and appliances under the Long Term Illness scheme, where the qualification criteria are met.<\/p><p>The Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility was published by the HSE on 25 November 2014. A key recommendation of the &quot;Keane&quot; Expert Panel was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. <\/p><p>On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE has also established a Clinical Advisory Group (CAG). The CAG's interim report included a recommendation to extend medical card eligibility to all children under the age of 18 years with a diagnosis of cancer, for a period of five years in each case. The Director General of the HSE accepted this interim recommendation and agreed to it being incorporated in the guidelines for deciding officers in respect of discretionary awarding of eligibility.  The CAG is continuing its work to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system. <\/p><p>It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 93,000 at the beginning of September this year. While the HSE makes every effort to apply discretion whenever possible, in a small number of cases, given the financial means assessment, it is not always possible for those in higher income brackets to qualify for a medical card. <\/p><p>Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800059#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":496,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800059#WRS01400"},{"type":"question","counter":497,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[35153\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800059#WRS01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo has not yet received a decision on an application for a medical card; if a decision will be made on this application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1074","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":498,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

These talks resumed on 21 September and are continuing in a constructive atmosphere. The first two weeks of roundtable talks have been relatively positive and constructive with a clear willingness on all sides to address the issues around the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and dealing with the legacy and impact of paramilitarism. I remain hopeful that, with committed collective engagement, we can make real progress on both of these critical issues. An agreed outcome would be an important step forward - not just for politics but for the further normalisation of society in Northern Ireland.    In an effort to facilitate inclusive talks, the Secretary of State has announced a British Government assessment of the current profile of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland. This is a one-off assessment which will be completed in the coming weeks and does not pre-empt the discussion of the paramilitary issue in the talks. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of criminality stemming from the legacy of paramilitarism is also an important point for the talks. I welcome the Secretary of State&rsquo;s announcement that there will be enhanced support and resources for tackling criminality in Northern Ireland. This is very much in keeping with our Government&rsquo;s strong determination to tackle crime, including organised crime. There is already very strong North-South cooperation involving the police and other relevant agencies when it comes to cross-border crime. My colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality had the opportunity to engage with the parties on these issues when she participated in the Stormont talks last week. <\/p>  <p>  Of equal importance in the talks is the need to fully implement the Stormont House Agreement. This agreement, concluded in December 2014, offers a blueprint for overcoming current difficulties in the Executive, especially around financing, welfare reform and dealing with the legacy of the past. While financing and welfare reform is primarily an issue for the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, I have continually encouraged the parties to resolve their difference for the sake of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economic stability and the sustainability of public services. <\/p>  <p>  It is also crucial that the work started by the Stormont House Agreement on establishing institutions to deal with the legacy of the past is completed so that justice and truth can bring what healing is possible to victims and survivors of the troubles and their families. My officials and I are working intensively with the Secretary of State, the Northern Ireland Office, and the Northern Ireland political parties to ensure the rapid establishment of these institutions, including the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval, the Historical Investigations Unit and the Implementation and Reconciliation Group. <\/p>  <p>  A successful outcome to the talks, which will respect and protect the Good Friday Agreement and its power sharing institutions, is a crucial priority for the Government. It is essential that all of the five main parties in Northern Ireland, with the support of the two Governments, urgently advance the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and address the impact and legacy of continuing paramilitary activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800060#WRT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":536,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800060#WRT01750"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[35168\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800060#WRT01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the up-to-date position regarding the proposed immigration reform Bill in the United States of America; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":538,"content":"<p>Achieving relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US remains a priority for the Government in our contacts with the United States. Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., the Irish Government continues to work closely on this agenda with high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond. The aim of these contacts is to achieve relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US and to improve channels for legal migration between Ireland and America. The administrative measures announced last November by President Obama, which could benefit thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants based in the US, were very welcome. However, I am conscious that these administrative measures remain under legal challenge in US Federal Courts and that in any case legislation in Congress is still needed to build on what has been promised in President Obama&rsquo;s announcement.  For that reason, the Government and our Embassy continue to avail of all contacts with the Administration and with Republican and Democratic political leaders to make the case for comprehensive immigration reform legislation.    To that end, in July I met in Dublin with a US congressional delegation led by John Boehner, Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Taoiseach also met with them and we both took the opportunity to re-emphasise the Government&rsquo;s wish to see comprehensive legislative reform so as to provide relief for the undocumented Irish and a legal pathway to allow for future Irish immigration to the US. Additionally, I raised immigration reform issues when I met with Vice President Biden in Boston on 30 March and I have also discussed these matters on a number of occasions recently with US Ambassador O&rsquo;Malley. <\/p>  <p>  Most recently, I met with the US administration, members of Congress and Irish community leaders on this issue when I visited New York and Washington DC last week. On foot of these meetings, a Bill is now in the process of being tabled by Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner in the US House of Representatives. The Bill will be aimed at providing access to several thousand E3 visas for Irish citizens.  I warmly welcome this positive step towards meeting the desire of many Irish people to live and work in the US for a time, but would also point out that there is work to be done in both Houses of Congress before this Bill might become law. I am also aware that while this particular measure would help with our objective of securing improved legal migration channels, it would not address the concerns of undocumented citizens currently in the US. These remain a key priority and continue to be the subject of our ongoing contacts with the US authorities.

The aim of these contacts is to achieve relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US and to improve channels for legal migration between Ireland and America. We are aware of and have raised the matter of waivers for 3 and 10 year travel bans in relation to US visa applications for Irish undocumented who have overstayed their visa in the United States. At my request, the Secretary General of my Department wrote to the US Ambassador earlier this year to ask him to explore further the question of such waivers. I have also had the opportunity to directly discuss the matter with the US Ambassador. The Taoiseach also raised waivers, amongst other immigration reform issues, during his visit to Washington for St Patrick&rsquo;s Day.    I must respect the confidentiality of diplomatic communications on behalf of foreign governments, but I can offer some information on the basis of these representations and responses.<\/p>  <p>  The US Embassy have indicated that the waiver system is applied in strict accordance with US laws and regulations and is operated uniformly worldwide, including in Ireland. An Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility, as this is known, is an application for legal entry to the United States made by an individual who is otherwise inadmissible on one or more grounds. Such a waiver can be applied for in the case of a 3 or 10 year ban having been imposed for overstaying a visa in the US.<\/p>  <p>  The US Embassy has underlined that applications are assessed individually on a case-by-case basis, with final decisions on each a matter for the US authorities in Washington, and that accordingly an applicant would not be able to predict with any degree of certainty as to whether they would be successful or not.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been assiduous in seeking to advance all viable opportunities to achieve relief for our undocumented citizens in the United States.

Any such decision would need to take account of several factors including those relevant to the agriculture sector itself and the scientific evidence provided by the European Food Safety Authority in approving the products in question, as well as the potential socio-economic impacts.   <\/p>  <p>  In terms of GM food and feed, it is important to note that the animal feed sector in Ireland is reliant on imports of GM protein sources such as soya bean and maize products from North and South America.  At present, as there are no alternative sources of non-GM protein, we therefore need to be cognisant of the implications for Irish farmers who may not have access to imported protein, if Ireland were to consider implementing a GMO free policy.  The Ministers for Health (in relation to food) and Agriculture, Food and the Marine (regarding   animal feed) have supported votes to authorise the placing on the market of such materials for food and feed use (but not for cultivation) on the basis of the scientific recommendations from EFSA and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.   <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in terms of considering any question of going GMO free, consideration would need to be given to the implications for research and development on both the medical and veterinary sectors, where contained use of GMOs are an important element. Ireland currently has a significant number of such R&amp;D activities underway,   which are licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency.   <\/p>  <p>  As responsibility for GMO policy and regulation in Ireland rests across a range of Government Departments and Agencies, there is continuing discussion and consideration of issues relating to GMO cultivation, food and feed and its contained use in terms of developments arising at the EU level and specifically where any revised legislation might have practical or legal implications for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800062#WRV01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme Administration","counter":592,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800062#WRV01750"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[34984\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800062#WRV01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when he will introduce the regulations, as stipulated in Part 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1026","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":594,"content":"<p>The necessary Regulations, for the new scheme for the tenant purchase of existing local authority houses along incremental purchase lines are at an advanced stage and are expected to be finalised and signed by end October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800062#WRV01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800063#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[35009\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015100800063#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the amounts of grants allocated to each local authority in each of the past three years; the basis on which these allocations were made; and if he will publish the criteria, data, or other factors which determined the amount awarded to each local authority.","asker":"1203","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":598,"content":"<p>My Department has a wide and diverse business agenda, including protecting the environment, providing necessary housing supports and fostering community and rural development in partnership with local government and other local development bodies.
