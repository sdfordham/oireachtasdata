These schemes support farmers who choose to deliver environmental goods for the benefit of society as a whole. The fact that I made provision of &#8364;243m in the 2012 Vote for my Department for REPS and AEOS, despite a very difficult budgetary situation, demonstrates the strength of both my own and the Government&#8217;s commitment to environmentally-friendly farming practices. I believe that the schemes enhance the farmer&#8217;s role as custodian of our countryside while allowing productive farming to continue and are an essential part of our response to the significant environmental challenges of the 21<sup>st<\/sup>   century. <\/p><p><br \/>  REPS and AEOS are area based schemes which are co-funded by the EU under the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 and EU Regulations governing the Schemes must be strictly adhered to. These require that a full and comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, as well as field inspections, must be completed before payment issue. The Commission have made it clear, in the course of audits, that all checks must be passed and eligibility conditions met. This means that a farmer&#8217;s application must be fully in order, all outstanding documentation provided and queries resolved before payment can be released to him or her. Given these requirements, my officials take considerable care in validating payments while also ensuring that farmers receive their payments as soon as possible. <\/p><p><br \/>  In overall terms, the situation is that payments are more advanced at this stage than in previous years and I am satisfied that payments are issuing on schedule. I am confident, also, that the full Vote provision of &#8364;243m will be spent this year and that there will be no underspend. <\/p><p><br \/>  Insofar as REPS is concerned, practically all of the remaining 30,000 participants have received their 2011 payment and the last remaining query cases are being dealt with as queries are resolved. Arrangements to commence payments in respect of 2012 are ongoing and I expect that I will be in a position to commence payments earlier than last year and in higher numbers.  There are about<i><\/i>14,500 active participants in AEOS, 8,200 in AEOS I and 6,300 in AEOS 2. Practically all of the early backlogs associated with these payments are now resolved. Almost all AEOS I 2010 payments have issued, and nearly 7,000 cases are finalised for 2011. The main issue holding up Year 2 payments are queries associated with capital investment claims and receipts. The Department has contacted all of the farmers where queries have arisen and is dealing with the responses received. Nearly 4,000 AEOS II participants have received their 2011 payment and payments continue to issue as the validation process is finalised. I expect to commence AEOS payments in respect of later in the year and to make a substantial number of payments before year end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500056#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Fisheries Policy Reform","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500056#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[40049\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500056#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his key priorities for the process of reforming the common fisheries policy which will more than likely conclude during the Irish Presidency in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the fisheries policy of the European Union which was first put in place in 1983 and has been subject to reviews every 10 years.

All the proposals are subject to negotiation and adoption through the co-decision process involving both the EU Fisheries Council and the EU Parliament.

At the June Agriculture Council, the Danish Presidency presented a Progress Report outlining the current status of the negotiations. The Cyprus Presidency has continued the negotiating process, with debates at the Agriculture Council as recently as yesterday (24 September) on rural development and market support issues. The proposals are also being discussed in the European Parliament. Earlier in the summer, draft reports from EP rapporteurs on each of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals were published, and about 8,000 amendments proposed by MEPs are currently being processed within the Parliament.  A  number of these elements will be the subject of substantial discussion and amendment over the coming months, and there will be ongoing contact at informal level between the Presidency, Commission and Council as they are developing their positions. <\/p><p>  Negotiations on the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the EU budget for the period 2014 to 2020 are being progressed in parallel, primarily through the General Affairs Council, although the final decisions will be taken by the European Council. Many of the CAP issues, including the key issue of distribution of funds between Member States, are being discussed in the MFF negotiations and will ultimately be agreed as part of these negotiations.  <\/p><p>  My key concerns as regards the reform proposals arise in four areas.  These are the overall CAP funding, the method for distributing CAP funds between Member States, the method for distributing direct payment funds within Member States and the overarching need for simplification in the reformed CAP. <\/p><p>  On the budget, the funding proposals in the MFF maintain CAP spending at current levels in nominal terms post-2013. The agriculture heading is the one showing the greatest restraint, and in my view the amount proposed by the Commission is the minimum required. However, there are continuing, and intense, pressures for reductions in the proposed overall EU budget, with obvious implications for proposed CAP allocations. The Irish Government will continue to resist any pressure for reductions in the CAP budget. <\/p><p>  As to the allocation of CAP funds between Member States, the current Commission proposals for Direct Payments in Pillar 1 take a pragmatic approach to redistribution and are broadly satisfactory, albeit with some loss to Ireland (estimated at around 1.4%).  The Commission has yet to table a specific proposal for allocation of pillar 2 (rural development) funds.  I have concerns that the basis on which they propose to do so could reduce our allocation.  However I am vigorously defending our Pillar 2 funds, and will continue to do so.  <\/p><p>  As to the distribution of direct payments within Member States, the Commission proposal is to gradually move towards a system of uniform per hectare payments, or flat rates, by 2019, in each Member State or region of a Member State.  Many Member States already have such flat rates or are evolving towards them. I recognise that we cannot continue to base our payments on outdated historic production references. Nevertheless, I have major difficulties with the pace and extent of convergence in the Commission&rsquo;s proposal.  <\/p><p>  Under a national flat rate, although the overall allocation to Ireland would not change, around 76,000 Irish farmers would gain an average of 86% on their current payments, while around 57,000 would lose an average of 33%. These are average percentages, and some of the gains and losses would be far larger than this. For example, in the extreme case of those on very high payments of over &euro;1000 per hectare, the loss would be well over 70%.  In general, the losses would be incurred by more productive farmers. This would have undesirable consequences at a time when Ireland is trying to encourage sustainable intensification in the agri-food sector, as we strive to achieve the objectives in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. <\/p><p>  I have accordingly been pressing for the maximum possible flexibility to be given to Member States to design payment models that suit their own farming conditions. I also want a more gradual, back-loaded transition process. The &lsquo;approximation&rsquo; approach, by which all payments could gradually move towards, but not fully to, the average, is one alternative that I believe should be considered in this regard. The Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; proposal for redistribution between Member States is, in effect, an approximation approach and provides a useful precedent. Modelling in my Department suggests that the application of this system to the distribution of funds between farmers in Ireland would lead to much smaller gains and losses to individual farmers than a flat rate system. However the precise level of transfers depends on the details of the methodology used.<\/p><p>  I have been very active in seeking allies for this position and I have been making significant progress, particularly with a group of Member States with somewhat similar concerns.  However, it should also be understood that a majority of Member States have no difficulty with the idea of flat rate payments, although they have concerns about other aspects of the proposals.<\/p><p>  The negotiation process on CAP is a complex and difficult one, but all of my efforts are focused on achieving the best possible outcome for Ireland. These efforts will be continued over the coming months as I continue to build close working relationships and potential alliances with the European Parliament and with Member States. I will also continue to press the Irish position with Commissioner Ciolos - whom I met as recently as last Friday in Dublin - ahead of a determined attempt to reach an agreement during our Presidency in 2013.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500056#WRA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500056#WRA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[40444\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500056#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans regarding the lobster stock numbers; his plans to provide for access to stock in a limited and sustainable way; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>Analysis of lobster stocks over recent years has shown that lobster stocks are over exploited in many areas around the coast.

The lobster v-notching and live return scheme, operated by BIM and co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund, is a vital national tool in ensuring that many female lobsters caught are v-notched by BIM staff and returned alive to the sea to spawn and contribute to the reproduction of the stock over many years.<\/p><p>  My policy for all sea-fisheries is to promote sustainable fishing, good environmental practice and compliance with law.  In the case of inshore fisheries, in light of the judgement of the European Court of Justice against Ireland concerning non-compliance with the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, the overriding priority continues to be to bring all inshore fisheries and aquaculture in Natura 2000 sites into full compliance with the EU Birds &amp; Habitats Directives.  <\/p><p>  The Habitats Directive requires that an appropriate assessment consider the potential impact of the proposed activity on the conservation objectives for each Natura 2000 site affected.  Given the national nature of the lobster fishery, almost all of the approximately 90 Natura sites around our coast could be affected.  In addition, the Directive requires that the potential impacts on the habitat of a proposed activity be considered in combination with the potential impacts of all other activities or proposed activities in each Natura site, including other fisheries, aquaculture and non-fishing activities.  <\/p><p>  The resource intensive Natura 2000 compliance project will ultimately lead to appropriate assessment of all of our Natura sites.

There are comprehensive marine leisure facilities at Howth, Dingle and Ros An Mh&iacute;l Fishery Harbour Centres which work well alongside the needs of the fishing industry.<\/p><p>  My Department will continue to take every opportunity to facilitate and promote marine tourism at the Fishery Harbour Centres subject of course to its compatibility with the needs of fishermen and budgetary constraints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500056#WRA02600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Harvest 2020 Strategy","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500056#WRA02650"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[40441\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500056#WRA02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will state, as Chair of the High Level Implementation Group, if it is still his view that Food Harvest 2020 is not a plan or programme as defined in Article 2 of Directive 2001\/42\/EC and therefore subject to a Strategic Environmental Assessment; if he will explain the reason that it is not considered as such by him in view of the fact that the directive requires an SEA to be carried out on any activity, plan or project that may affect a Natura 2000 site; his views on whether appropriate time was given for the public consultation process of the present environmental analysis process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":38,"content":"<p>Since becoming Minister, and as Chair of the High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC) for Food Harvest 2020, I have whole-heartedly embraced the Food Harvest 2020 (FH2020) strategy and I am totally committed to ensuring its success. Coordination of the State contribution to FH 2020 is being overseen by this Committee which includes representatives from Bord Bia, Teagasc, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Enterprise Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department. The HLIC also engages regularly with various private sector groups with a key role in FH2020. Implementation of many of the key measures needed to achieve the growth figures set out in the report is a matter for private sector actors including industry and individual farmers.<\/p><p><br \/>  As a high level strategic vision, the Food Harvest 2020 report does not contain implementation plans related to specific sites, including Natura 2000 sites. However, my Department and the HLIC are acutely aware of the need to ensure that appropriate assessment and strategic environmental analysis are considered, in line with the relevant EU Directives, and carried out where required, in the course of achieving the targets set out in the report. <\/p><p><br \/>  The HLIC committee recognised that the broad strategic targets in the report could be achieved in a variety of ways and determined that an independent environmental analysis should be commissioned of various possible scenarios through which the targets set out in the report could be achieved. The results of this analysis will inform the implementation of measures by all relevant actors, including those in the private sector. An independent team of experienced consultants with expertise in both agriculture and environmental assessment has been procured by my Department to carry out this work. The team has presented a detailed interim report to the HLIC and is due to present its final report by the end of October.<\/p><p><br \/>  The analysis is in line with the strategic environmental assessment process and includes the likely impacts of achieving the targets, through a number of scenarios, including; biodiversity, flora\/fauna, water, including groundwater quality, soil, air quality, landscape and climatic factors including impacts on greenhouse gas emission levels. My Department is considering if the analysis should include an appropriate assessment under the Habitats Directive, and in this regard we are engaged in discussions with the European Commission. <\/p><p>As part of the analysis<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>  process my Department has facilitated a public consultation, with details of the consultation posted on my Department&#8217;s website on 11 May 2012 and advertised in the Irish Independent on 16 May 2012 with a closing date of 28 June 2012 so that submissions could inform the work of the consultants in preparation of the interim report. Following representations from a number of interested parties, my Department extended the closing date to 6 July 2012, representing an eight week consultation period. Any further submissions received after the deadline, are also being forwarded to the consultants to inform their final report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500056#WRA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Milk Quota Purchases","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500057#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[40439\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500057#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to ensure that there will be adequate processing capacity to process the increased milk output expected after the ending of the quota regime in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>Food Harvest 2020 is a strategy for the development of the Agri-Food sector drawn up by industry stakeholders, in conjunction with my Department. Specifically within the dairy sector, the stakeholders identified the abolition of the milk quota regime in 2015 as a real opportunity for the sector to expand.  Ireland strongly supported the abolition of the regime, on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy industry and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.<\/p><p>  The setting of the target that the volume of milk produced in 2020 will be 50% greater than that produced in the 2007-2009 baseline period, reflects the confidence of the industry, as represented by the stakeholders on the Food Harvest Committee, in the potential of the sector.  <\/p><p>  My Department and its agencies are playing their part through the monitoring, and implementation where relevant, of the 55 actions identified by the Dairy Expansion Activation Group&rsquo;s Roadmap as a means to achieving the 50% target; through the provision of support for a Dairy Efficiency Programme which provides for the  transfer of critical knowledge within the sector by way of Discussion Groups; through  the provision of dairy equipment grants for the upgrading of dairy farms; and through the activities of Teagasc who are playing a critical role in research, development and innovation in the sector and Bord Bia who are engaged in the  development of a sustainability model for the Irish dairy sector, as well as the provision of support for the work of ICBF in improving breed quality in the Irish herd.

This restructuring included:<\/p><p>  - dissolving and reorganising a number of administrative Oireachtas Committees to allow the re-allocation of resources towards Oireachtas Committees dealing with Government Departments;<\/p><p>  - the establishment of an Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, to focus solely on this Government priority area; The establishment of an Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to deal with the increased workload in this area in light of the proposed changes to the CAP; and <\/p><p>  - the merger of the role of Chairperson of the Oireachtas Committee on the Good Friday Agreement with that of the Irish Co-Chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.<\/p><p>  These reforms did not increase the number of Oireachtas Committee Chairpersons.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to increase the number of D&aacute;il sitting days by 50%.

In working with our partners to guide discussions on the post-2015 development framework we will build on our commitment to eradicate poverty and hunger in the world.  We will also work to highlight the important linkages between hunger, nutrition and climate change and to have these linkages recognised for future policy and programming internationally.<\/p><p>  We will also work to forge stronger links between humanitarian relief and development aid, based on experience in emergencies in recent years.

We will place particular emphasis on the EU&rsquo;s approach to disaster risk reduction, helping communities to prepare and take action to avert the effects of disasters and emergencies.

AMRFs form part of the options introduced by Finance Act 1999 to provide control, flexibility and choice to certain individuals in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans. Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension under a defined contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract had no choice but to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the permissible  tax-free lump sum. <\/p><p>  The choices which then became available included the existing option to purchase an annuity with those remaining funds, and new options to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions. Access to these flexible options was extended to all main benefits from retirement benefit schemes (other than Defined Benefit arrangements) in Finance Act 2011.<\/p><p>  Under the regime the options to<\/p><p>- invest in an ARF, or<\/p><p>- receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate)<\/p><p>are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (&ldquo;specified income&rdquo;) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised. The purpose of the specified income requirement is to ensure, before an individual has unfettered access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF or by way of the cash option (subject to tax), that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed pension income throughout the period of their retirement.<\/p><p>  Finance Act 2011 increased the specified income limit from the previous fixed amount of &euro;12,700 per annum introduced in 1999, and unchanged since that time, to a variable amount equal to 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) bringing the specified income limit to &euro;18,000 per annum at present.  However, as a transitional measure, Finance Act 2011 allows the previous lower guaranteed income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum to continue to apply for a period of 3 years from the date that Act was signed into law (6 February 2011), including for individuals who had retired before that date and who already had an AMRF.<\/p><p>  The State Pension (Contributory) would count towards meeting the specified income limit.  You should note, however, that only guaranteed pension income paid to the individual in his or her own right can be taken into account for this purpose. Pensions paid directly to the spouse of an individual or pensions\/allowances received on behalf of a spouse or dependant may not be included.<\/p><p>  Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an AMRF must be chosen into which a &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount must be invested. The purpose of an AMRF is to ensure a capital or income &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; throughout the latter period of their retirement for individuals with pension income below the specified income limit.  Prior to Finance Act 2011, the &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount was fixed at the first &euro;63,500 of the pension fund or the remainder of the fund after taking the tax-free lump sum, if less than &euro;63,500. Finance Act 2011 increased the &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; amount to 10 times the maximum annual rate of State Pension (Contributory) &ndash; &euro;119,800 at present &ndash; or the remainder of the pension fund, after taking the tax-free lump sum, if less. The capital in an AMRF is not available to an individual until he or she reaches 75 years though any income generated by the fund can be drawn down subject to tax. The capital in an AMRF can be used by the owner at any time to purchase an annuity and the AMRF can be changed to an ARF with access to the capital sum (subject to taxation) before the age of 75 where the specified income test is met before that age.<\/p><p>  These are the various requirements around the operation of the options at retirement for those with Retirement Annuity Contracts, Personal Retirement Savings Accounts and other defined contribution pension arrangements and the reasons for those requirements.  While I am not in possession of all of the relevant personal details of your constituent&rsquo;s case which would impact on the scope of the options available to your constituent, and subject to that very important caveat, the following options may be available with regard to the AMRF, other than to leave the capital sum until age 75:<\/p><p>  - The use of the AMRF funds to purchase a pension annuity.<\/p><p>  - If your constituent is in receipt of the State Pension (Contributory), the amount of that pension in payment to him\/her in his\/her own right (excluding any amount in respect of a dependent) would count towards meeting the annual specified income test which in this case could be &euro;12,700 at this point in time. The funds in the AMRF could be used to purchase a pension annuity equivalent to the difference between the relevant State Pension amount and &euro;12,700. Any remaining funds in the AMRF would then be available as an ARF and could be withdrawn as a lump sum amount subject to income tax at your constituent&rsquo;s marginal rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500059#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":129,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500059#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":130,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[40141\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500059#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to review the taxation of home heating oil in view of the difficulties consumers are experiencing with increasing costs.","asker":"1023","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":131,"content":"<p>Ireland, as with other countries, has experienced an increase in fuel prices. This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.<\/p><p>  The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  It should also be noted that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel. For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system. VAT on petrol cannot be deducted\/reclaimed.

The Domicile Levy was introduced in Finance Act 2010 and was charged on an individual:<\/p><p>- who in any year is Irish domiciled and an Irish citizen,<\/p><p>- whose worldwide income for the year exceeds &euro;1m,<\/p><p>- whose Irish located property in the year is greater than &euro;5m, and<\/p><p>- whose liability to Irish income tax for the year is less than &euro;200,000.<\/p><p>  Where a relevant person has paid income tax that person is entitled to a credit for the tax paid in calculating the amount of the Domicile Levy.<\/p><p>  The amendment introduced in section 136 Finance Act 2012 removed the requirement to be an Irish citizen.

For these reasons, Revenue focuses on deterring shadow\/hidden economy activity and non-compliance through its audit and investigation programmes based on risk analysis, use of Revenue powers and their intelligence and information systems.   Revenue tackles the problem of the shadow economy through its range of compliance and audit interventions including through targeted special projects. Case interventions are undertaken based on Revenue&#8217;s assessment of compliance risks, the level of those risks and other relevant information available. Revenue is using a wide range of methodologies to identify those operating in the shadow economy and is deploying the full range of compliance interventions. Activities can include covert surveillance, cold calls to businesses and venues as well as pre arranged aspect queries on specific items. This work is continuing.<\/p><p>The Revenue Commissioner&#8217;s approach to the shadow economy is underpinned by close consultation and cooperation with the Department of Social Protection. The primary objective of these activities is to uncover either non-declaration<b><\/b>  or under declaration of income and\/or fraudulent DSP claims.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy will be aware of the continuing strengthening of legislation to provide for a robust framework within which the Revenue Commissioners may tackle tax and duty evasion, including recent provisions relating to: - <\/p><p> - The making of returns of transactions by merchant acquirers, and other payment settlement entities, to the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p> - The more effective investigation of white-collar crime.<\/p><p><br \/>  Further provisions included a comprehensive package of measures in relation to Excise (Oils) including, requirement for separate licences for auto-fuel traders and marked fuel traders, requirement to have a separate licence for every premises or place at which the fuel concerned is dealt in, and a requirement that a licence must be clearly displayed at the premises or place.<\/p><p><br \/>  Revenue&#8217;s tobacco strategy, &#8220;Strategy On Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011- 2013)&#8221; was published on the Revenue website in June 2011. This three-year strategy is underpinned by annual action plans. <\/p><p><br \/>  The strategic level plans include taking steps to ensure that the legitimate trade remains compliant, delivering more effective and visible interventions through enhanced capability and better deployment of Revenue resources. The strategy also include further development of cooperation and intelligence sharing at national and international level, together with a commitment to prosecute all serious cases of tobacco tax evasion and a focus, in partnership with other Government agencies, on reducing the demand for contraband tobacco.<\/p><p><br \/>  During 2011 Revenue&#8217;s Customs Service seized a total of 109 million cigarettes in 10,581 seizures. Commercial quantities in maritime freight traffic accounted for 76.4 million cigarettes. Revenue also seized 11,158 kg of tobacco in 2011. In six particular operations, over 19 million cigarettes, 1,344 kg tobacco and 49 vehicles were seized.<\/p><p><br \/>  Regulations were also introduced in 2011 requiring Government Departments and State Bodies to supply details of payments made to the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this data is matched to the Revenue records of the various recipients, and is used to profile risk. Similar matching is also carried out using other third party data received by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p><br \/>  Revenue has a prioritised focus on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity such as cash businesses. All possible sources of information, including following up on services advertised on TV, radio, local newspapers, Internet, special interest publications are used by Revenue. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that in order to inform the approaches they are taking, and help determine where resources may best be deployed, they continue to engage in meetings with trade and representative bodies. The Hidden Economy Monitoring Group provides a forum for the exchange of views on the effectiveness of measures introduced in combating the hidden economy. This group, which is chaired by Revenue, includes representatives from employer and business organisations, trade unions and other Government Departments and agencies. Regional hidden economy liaison groups have been established to facilitate greater local interaction and more immediate responses to insights and issues that may be highlighted. <\/p><p><br \/>  Revenue investigations have detected the use of computer programmes or electronic devices to alter or conceal sales records. To counteract these risks, legislation was enacted in 2011 providing penalties for the possession, use or supply of automated sales suppression devices known as &quot;zappers&quot; for the purpose of evading tax. <\/p><p><br \/>  Streetscape programmes, in which every cash business in an area is visited, without prior announcement, have been carried out. While the main focus of real time activity is on businesses that use cash registers, all sectors that have cash receipts are monitored. This includes professionals such as doctors, veterinary surgeons, etc.  These operations have also resulted in the registration of previously unregistered persons. 803 such registrations were recorded in the period from January to the end of April 2012.<\/p><p><br \/>  The results from all the various projects are reflected in the general audit and compliance results from audits, assurance checks, site visits etc. which are published in the Revenue Annual Report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500061#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gambling Legislation","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500061#WRF00750"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[40466\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500061#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>It was announced in Budget 2011 that the necessary arrangements are being made to ensure that bets placed on the internet by domestic punters are subject to the same level of betting duty as applies to high street betting shops. This will serve to broaden the tax base and increase betting duty receipts.   The Finance Act 2011 provides for the taxation of bets that remote bookmakers enter into with persons in the State. This means, for example, that a business which engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from people in this country will be liable for betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based. The existing betting duty (1%) will be applied to such bets. The Finance Act also provides for the taxation of Betting Exchanges under the new arrangements; however the calculation of the tax will take account of their particular business model, in other words a 15% tax on the commission charged. In addition, excise duties are being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licences. <\/p><p>  The Betting (Amendment) Bill, which was published in July, will establish the regulatory framework for these licences. The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted. <\/p><p>  I am hopeful that by including the high-growth area of the betting sector the tax base from betting will be boosted significantly.<\/p><p>  In addition, this measure conveys a positive signal to international betting operations that have expressed an interest in or have already invested in Ireland.

Lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax. They are also paid free of USC. The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%.

As there is no general requirement for data on the number of persons who are receiving payments of retirement lump sums of less than &euro;200,000 to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &euro;200,000 to &euro;150,000.<\/p><p>  As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the savings involved, it is estimated that just under 2,500 individuals in the public service would be on salaries of over &euro;100,000 and less than &euro;133,500 which, under existing pension scheme arrangements generally applying across the public service, would deliver retirement lump sums of between &euro;150,000 and &euro;200,000. If it is assumed that these individuals would retire in line with retirement trends from the public service in a normal year (about 2.5%), then the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums in excess of &euro;150,000 at 20% could be less than &euro;0.5 m in a full year.<\/p><p>  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector. I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum. This option is not available to members of public sector schemes. Depending on the impact of any tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500061#WRF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry Tax Reliefs","counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500061#WRF01550"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[40483\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500061#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the plans he has to review the film industry's tax regime, an industry that historically has been extremely successful in attracting high profile films and TV productions; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Government in the United Kingdom is due to review their tax regime in respect of the film industry which could have a serious competitive impact on the film industry here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1092","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>The Finance Act 2011 provided for an extension of the film relief scheme to the end of 2015.

The scheme also permits employers to take a double deduction for the salary of the employee when calculating profits for the purpose of taxation.   This incentive applies in respect of individuals who have been unemployed for at least 12 months and are in receipt of a specified social protection payment or, who are in a category approved for the purposes of the scheme by the Minister for Social Protection with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Disability benefit and disability allowance are both qualifying payments for the purposes of this scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  The scheme is designed to help the long-term unemployed get back into paid employment by helping to ensure that the income earned from that employment is greater than could be obtained by staying on welfare payments.

This increase is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.    The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>  It should also be noted that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel.

The new collaborations recommended will mean that a smaller number of publicly funded centres for ITE exist, but that they offer education across multiple sectors from early childhood to primary, to post primary to adult education.

The Request for Tender for MPS was advertised, in accordance with the EC Procurement Directives, on e-Tenders and in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU).  15 tender responses were received, of which seven tenderers were selected to be Framework Members.  The Framework Agreement for MPS was established on 8 February 2012.  The Framework Agreement will be in place for two years, with an option to extend for a further two years. <\/p><p><br \/>  Four of the successful tenderers are indigenous small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (MJ Flood, Bryan S Ryan, Hibernian Business Equipment and Ergo). The Framework Members have also indicated in their tender submissions that they will use a further 11 indigenous SMEs in the delivery of MPS. <\/p><p><br \/>  MPS is a unique office print solution, where a supplier provides an all inclusive service based on an on-going per click charge, that includes the provision of print\/imaging devices at no capital cost to the public sector body.  The supplier, in effect, provides the full infrastructure required for all day-to-day office printing.  Research carried out by the National Procurement Service (NPS) has indicated that such an approach gives best value to the Irish public sector. Some of the smaller suppliers do not have the resources to provide such infrastructure themselves, but they can have roles within the supply networks of the seven Framework Members.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The majority of public sector bodies currently have <i>ad-hoc<\/i> print arrangements in place.  A typical Government office has multiple print and imaging devices such as photocopiers, scanners and faxes.  These devices can potentially come from a wide range of different suppliers with separate supply and servicing arrangements.  The ratio of print devices to staff is often in the region of 1:2 and in some cases as low as 1:1 where a large number of staff have their own desktop printer.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Circular 6\/12 specifies that the MPS Framework is mandatory from 1 September 2012.  However, it is important to note that this Framework is only mandatory where a public sector body opts for an MPS solution. If a public sector body simply wishes to purchase a printer or a photocopier they do not have to use the MPS Framework.

The relevant provisions of the Employment Permits Acts of 2003 and 2006 hold that where an employee, who was required to hold an Employment Permit, has failed to do so then he or she is guilty of an offence.  Furthermore, while an employer may also be guilty of an offence in this matter, Justice Hogan points out that the legislation provides for a defence with regard to an employer but fails to do so with regard to an employee.<\/p><p>  As I understand it, this lack of defence affects the courts&rsquo; scope to interpret the statutory provisions and compels the court to hold that the legislation has created an absolute offence so far as an employee is concerned.  Importantly, Justice Hogan found that it must therefore be taken that the Oireachtas intended that such a non-national employee automatically commits an offence if he or she does not have a work permit irrespective of the reasons for that failure and that this has implications so far as the civil law is concerned in that such a contract of employment must also be taken to be void.<\/p><p>  The question that arises for policy makers is to what extent such non-nationals should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so versus to what extent should certain employment rights protect vulnerable migrants who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will recognise that this question requires careful consideration as the applicability of rights in one context can have far reaching consequences beyond that originally intended.<\/p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department is treating the matter with the utmost importance and that I would expect proposals on the matter within the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500064#WRJ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500064#WRJ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[40089\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500064#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he is able to determine if his Department or any of the other Government agencies under his remit such as Enterprise Ireland or the Industrial Development Agency have paid for former Government members to undertake courses in the United States of America.","asker":"1058","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>My Department has not paid for former Government members to undertake courses in the United States of America.<\/p><p>Expenditure on training by the Agencies under the aegis of my Department is a day-to-day administrative matter for those Agencies in which I have no function.

As independent quasi-judicial bodies, I have no role in the day-to-day exercise of their functions.     <\/p><p>  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntarist in nature; the LRC cannot compel any party to a dispute to attend a hearing\/meeting.  The LRC does not have any jurisdiction to adjudicate on disputes in relation to redundancy payments. <\/p><p>  The EAT is an independent body bound to act judicially and was set up to provide a speedy, fair, inexpensive and informal means for individuals to seek remedies for alleged infringement of their statutory rights.  The EAT has jurisdiction to deal with and adjudicate on disputes under a number of pieces of legislation including the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 1997 and the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Acts 1984 to 1994.   The Redundancy Acts provide that all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum upon being made redundant.  The latter Act provides for the protection of employees&rsquo; entitlements in regard to matters relating to pay (e.g. arrears of wages, holiday pay etc.) in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  The Act also provides that disputes concerning some of these entitlements may be referred to the EAT.  <\/p><p>  The EAT currently has the power to compel any person (including the director(s) of  a company) to attend a hearing to give evidence and to produce any documents in his\/her possession, custody or control, relating to any matter referred to the Tribunal, including complaints referred under the aforementioned legislation. A person who fails to attend a hearing in response to such a notice from the EAT or who refuses to give evidence or to produce any required documents will be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine.  The EAT also has the power to take evidence on oath and may administer oaths to persons attending as witnesses.  Penalties are prescribed by law for wilful and corrupt perjury by any person convicted in a Court of Law giving false evidence or wilfully or corruptly swearing anything, which is false as a hearing of the EAT.  <\/p><p>  It is entirely a matter for the Tribunal, having regard to the circumstances of any particular case, to determine whether or not to invoke its powers to compel a witness to attend a hearing in order to give evidence. <\/p><p>  I have no plans to introduce legislation amending the existing rules concerning the compellability of witnesses to either the EAT or LRC.  However, as you may be aware, I am currently undertaking a root and branch reform of the existing Workplace Relations Bodies. The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the LRC, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the EAT and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.  It is intended that Adjudication Officers in the new WRC will also have the power to compel witnesses to attend hearings to give evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500065#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Numbers","counter":365,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500065#WRK00950"},{"type":"question","counter":366,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[40599\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500065#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if his Department still grants leave of absence; and if not, the reason this is not considered as a neutral cost saving exercise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":367,"content":"<p>Staff in my Department may apply for unpaid special leave in the form of a career break.

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two involve the enhancement of the website    and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears. <\/p><p><br \/>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.<\/p><p><br \/>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.<\/p><p><br \/>  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main recognised accountancy bodies and the lenders. The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence. <\/p><p><br \/>  The advisory framework has commenced with practicing accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  <\/p><p><br \/>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as requested by borrowers.  It is intended to review the operation of the advisory framework in June 2013 at which point other interested parties who meet the criteria in terms of qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc., may be considered for inclusion.   <\/p><p>The accountancy bodies have already notified their members about the new service with a view to having the panel in place before the end of September.

Our records indicate that a significant proportion of individuals have progressed into employment across various occupations\/ disciplines on completion of their internship placements.  To ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the JobBridge team are involved in the continuous monitoring of internships.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the conducting of random monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the Internship.<\/p><p>  All internships advertised on the JobBridge website clearly state &ldquo;This is an internship.  An allowance of &euro;50 per week will be paid in addition to your current social welfare payment.  See eligibility criteria above.&rdquo; <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500065#WRK03200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Status","counter":397,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500065#WRK03250"},{"type":"question","counter":398,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[40151\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500065#WRK03300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that a person (details supplied) in Dublin 16 is waiting six months on a social welfare appeal; if she will ensure that they receive a decision shortly; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1027","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":399,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 22 March 2012.

The national social target for poverty reduction provides a key reference point for government policies and offers a tangible benchmark against which to measure social and economic progress.<\/p><p><br \/>  Given the challenging economic and fiscal context, the Government initiated a comprehensive review of the national poverty target, first set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion<i><\/i>in 2007, in order to ensure that it remained appropriate and achievable.  I will shortly be publishing the result of the outcome of the review and following that will make arrangements for appropriate consultation with stakeholders to discuss how best to implement its recommendations.<\/p><p><br \/>  Notwithstanding this, I should point out that in advance of the publication of the review, the revised targets were set out in a document submitted to the European Commission in April 2012 entitled the &quot;National Reform Programme for Ireland 2012 Update under the Europe 2020 Strategy&quot; and are available on the website of the Department of An Taoiseach.  In that update, the Government indicated that it had decided to revise and enhance its national poverty target to meet Ireland&#8217;s contribution to Europe 2020 and commitments in the Programme for Government.  The revised target is to reduce consistent poverty to 4 per cent by 2016 (interim target) and to 2 per cent or less by 2020, from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.2 per cent.  Ireland&#8217;s revised contribution to the overall EU poverty target is to lift a minimum of 200,000 people out of the risk of poverty or exclusion between 2012 and 2020.  I want to stress that the revised targets still mean that the Government has retained the ambition of the original target, despite the difficult economic conditions.  The target will now be achieved over an extended timeframe of 2020, in line with the EU timescale.

I am advised by IFI that any extension to the recreational angling season would need to be based on scientific analysis of available surplus, catch returns, counter information, run timing, exploitation rates etc.  With the majority of these parameters the time series of available data is considered by IFI to be too short to draw any meaningful scientific conclusions and therefore, in line with the conservation Imperative based on the precautionary principle, no recommendation can be made for an extension to the salmon angling season at this time.  <\/p><p>  The independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for salmon provide advice on the criteria that should be evaluated when considering a proposal for an extension to the angling season in any salmon catchment.  These criteria include the advice that, where an extension is being considered, there should be a reasonably sized quota and a reasonable proportion of the surplus remaining after the original season has ended to ensure essential recruitment and to avoid over fishing.  A further criterion is that an angling season in a river should only be extended if the salmon stock in that river has been meeting the Conservation Limit (CL) and is likely to continue to meet the CL if an extension is given i.e. provided no more than the harvestable surplus is taken.  2012 is only the third year where a full assessment of the salmon run on the river Maine is available.

This is because developers do not have to accept or reject their offer until they receive their final constraint and curtailment report from EirGrid.  <\/p><p>  These reports cannot be developed until the Single Electricity Market Committee (SEMC) policy on tie-breaks in dispatch has been completed.  This piece of all island work involves examining the appropriate rule-set to share the burden of constraints and curtailment.  The SEMC has made a decision (SM-11-105) in relation to constraints but is still considering the appropriate course of action in relation to curtailment of wind.  It is likely that this policy will be completed by end 2012 or early 2013.  This will then allow EirGrid to prepare the constraint and curtailment reports, issue them to all Gate 3 developers and for developers to then accept or reject their offer.<\/p><p>Following this, there will be a good indication of the level of Gate 3 offers being accepted by developers. The policy on any future Gate beyond that will consider issues such as the level of capacity available on the networks, Ireland&rsquo;s progress towards meeting its 2020 renewable targets when Gate 3 contribution is considered and the appropriate connection rules in order to ensure efficient connection to the networks.  The CER will carry out full consultations on all aspects of Gate 4 policy at the appropriate time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500070#WRP02200","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Services Provision","counter":615,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500070#WRP02250"},{"type":"question","counter":616,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[40531\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500070#WRP02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 985 of 18 September 2012, when the formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position in relation to commercial service providers existing and planned broadband service throughout the State will be completed.","asker":"1066","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":617,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan contains a very clear commitment that my Department will undertake a full mapping exercise in respect of high speed broadband deployment.

Under the legislation, it is a function of a local authority to collect the household charges and associated late payment penalties due to it and all such charges and late payment penalties imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Section 7 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act 1983 provides that where a sum is due to a local authority in respect of a charge under any enactment and at the same time, another sum is due by the local authority to the same person, the local authority may set-off the money owing to it against the money it pays out. Local authorities are thus legally empowered to withhold money due to an individual if that person owes unpaid charges to the local authority . However, this does not apply to higher education grants, which are administered by local authorities on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.

My Department consulted on the matter with the Law Reform Commission, which had been involved in drafting the 2009 Act, and it took the view that unreasonable interference caused by high trees or hedges was a matter in any particular case for tort law or more generally for planning or environmental law.  In England and Wales, complaints about high hedges are dealt with under Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003.  This Act makes provision for local authorities to determine complaints by the owners or occupiers of domestic property who are adversely affected by evergreen hedges over 2 metres high.  Broadly similar legislation, i.e. the High Hedges Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, came into operation in Northern Ireland on 31 March 2012.  Helpful information notes for hedge owners, complainants and local authorities have been published on the web site of Northern Ireland's Department of the Environment.<\/p><p>  The manner in which problems associated with high hedges and trees are resolved in England, Wales and Northern Ireland demonstrates a clear preference for the resolution of such disputes at local level, preferably by mediation, with recourse to the courts as a last resort.  This is designed to reduce the risk of prolonged and costly litigation and the risk that court proceedings would leave a legacy of bitterness between neighbours and ill-feeling in the local community.  The introduction of such legislation in this jurisdiction would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his Department.  Under our existing law, a person may be in a position to seek damages or an injunction requiring the cutting of boundary hedges or trees under the tort of nuisance.  In order for the nuisance to be actionable, the person would have to show that an easement existed - an easement of light or otherwise - and that there had been a substantial interference with that right.  It is my intention to bring forward a Mediation Bill later this year to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, thereby reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes.  The legislation, which is currently being drafted, will introduce an obligation on solicitors and barristers to advise any person wishing to commence court proceedings to consider mediation as a means of resolving a dispute before embarking on such proceedings.  It will also provide that a court may, following the commencement of proceedings, on its own initiative invite parties to consider mediation and suspend the proceedings to facilitate the mediation process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500074#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":764,"content":"<p>Question No. 319 answered with Question No. 310.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Judicial Appointments","counter":765,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500074#WRT00850"},{"type":"question","counter":766,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[40510\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500074#WRT00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will outline the process whereby a member of the judiciary may be disciplined if they have not been able to fulfil their duties in a competent manner, if there has been any issue of misconduct or if there is a question over of their ability to practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":767,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, Article 35.4.1&deg;<b><\/b>of the Constitution provides that &quot;A judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann calling for his removal&quot;.

Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister&#8217;s announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation. Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:<br \/><br \/>&quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland. Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon. That is no longer the case. The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.<br \/><br \/>There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution. While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement. It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot;\u00a0<br \/><br \/>The Minister added that:\u00a0&quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole. It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course. Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so. It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.<br \/><br \/>My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document. The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate. I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received. I expect it is likely that the Committee&#8217;s report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad. The report received by me from the Joint Oireachtas Committee will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary new legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>I look forward to the results of the consultation process.&quot;\u00a0<br \/><br \/>The discussion document is attached below and will be made available on the Department&#8217;s website,\u00a0\u00a0<br \/>This discussion document does not favour any particular approach but simply tries to assist reflection.

However, great caution should be exercised before embarking on such a project.

Any possible implication for the operation of the Common Travel Area would also have to be very carefully considered.<\/p><p>  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.

It is to be hoped this will also have knock on benefits for any future badger vaccination programme.<\/p><p>With regard to the impact of TB in badgers for TB in cattle, a research paper published in 2010 summarises the evidence on the role of badgers in the spread of TB in cattle both in Ireland and the UK and concludes that &#8220;badgers are directly implicated in the transmission of infection to cattle&#8221; and &#8220;the ability to eradicate tuberculosis is severely constrained while infection continues to be spread from badgers&#8221; (<i>Mycobacterium bovis Infection in the Eurasian Badger (Meles Meles): the Disease, Pathogenesis, Epidemiology and Control<\/i> (Science Direct)  <i>). <\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  There is considerable evidence that the removal of badgers results in a reduction in the incidence of the disease in cattle.  In summary, the first major research project into the impact of badgers on TB incidence in cattle in East Offaly found that the risk of herd breakdowns was found to be 14 times higher in the control area compared with the area from which the badgers were removed.  A later study, the Four Area Project, involved the intensive and proactive removal of badgers in four &#8220;removal&#8221; areas and &#8220;reactive&#8221; culling of badgers in matched reference areas. The published results of this project also demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in TB levels in cattle following the removal of badgers. In view of this research and in order to limit the spread of TB from badgers to cattle, the Bovine TB eradication programme implemented by my Department contains a wildlife strategy involving the removal of badgers by culling when an epidemiological investigation associates a TB herd breakdown with the presence of badgers. This strategy is an important element of Ireland&#8217;s bovine TB eradication programme and has contributed to a significant reduction in the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in the cattle population in recent years.  TB reactor numbers were 18,500 in 2011, the lowest recorded number in any year since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950s.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department is satisfied that the badger culling strategy has contributed to a reduction in the incidence of TB over the past number of years. However, it is my intention to replace badger culling with vaccination when research demonstrates that this is a practicable proposition.  There are trials ongoing at present to determine if vaccination of badgers can provide an effective alternative to badger culling in the longer-term and to develop an efficient and effective vaccine delivery methodology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRV00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":830,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRV00550"},{"type":"question","counter":831,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[40068\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if forestry payments will be expedited in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; the reason for the delay in payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1056","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":832,"content":"<p>This site has a history of poor maintenance and, thus, has failed two previous inspections.

In order to assist meeting the ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020, new taxation measures were introduced in last year&#8217;s budget aimed at improving land mobility and farm consolidation, and encouraging transfers to younger, more progressive farmers. Two measures are of particular note in this regard;<\/p><p><br \/>  1.Reduced stamp duty rate applying to farm transfers<\/p><p><br \/>  2.Restructuring of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) retirement relief<\/p><p>1. <b>Reduced stamp duty rate applying to farm transfers<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  There was a reduction in the stamp duty rate applying to the sale on agricultural land from 6% to 2%. In addition, half the rate (1%) is now applicable on transfers to close relatives until the end of 2014. This change substantially reduced the stamp duty payable on transfers of farm land by gift or by sale. The measure promotes inter-generational transfer, as the cost of lifetime transfer to transferees who do not qualify for the young trained farmer stamp duty relief has been reduced considerably.<\/p><p>2. <b>Restructuring of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) retirement relief<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Budget 2012 restructured the retirement relief available on Capital Gains Tax in order to incentivise the earlier transfer of farm assets to the next generation, and to encourage the sale of land by those farmers with no successors. As of 1st January 2014, for those farmers aged 66 and over, an upper limit of &#8364;3m will be introduced on family transfers, compared to an unlimited amount currently. On non-family transfers, the current upper limit of &#8364;750,000 will be reduced to &#8364;500,000. Applying the new limits from 1st January 2014 allows farmers already aged 66 and over to plan the orderly transfer of assets in advance of that date.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is important to remember that these new measures do not mean that a farmer has to cease farming altogether beyond the age of 66, but it allows them to plan for a phased gradual transfer of assets to the next generation.<\/p><p><br \/>  Retirement relief was restructured in order to encourage farmers around the normal retirement age, who have successors, to transfer their land and holdings to young, innovative, ambitious, prospective farmers. This measure encourages an improvement in the age profile of farmers, and should ensure that farmland is put to more productive use.  It should be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). This means that farms worth up to &#8364;2.5 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRW00400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":877,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 360 to 362, inclusive, answered with Question No. 354.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Numbers","counter":878,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRW00550"},{"type":"question","counter":879,"qnumday":363,"qnumall":"[40589\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his Department still grants leave of absence; and if not, the reason this is not considered as a neutral cost saving exercise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":880,"content":"<p>My Department grants leave of absence on an unpaid basis in accordance with the regulations which govern such leave.

Prices have continued to increase during 2012 and are currently at record levels, some 12.53% ahead year on year, or 18c per kilo higher. The industry faces a number of challenges in the short and medium term and my Department will continue to assist the sector to resolve these issues.<\/p><p>  New EU Animal Welfare rules set down new standards in relation to the housing of sows and will come into force on 1 January 2013. A significant number of producers have undertaken the necessary work required in order to upgrade their facilities in order to comply with the new rules.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department is aware of the scale of the challenge facing pig farmers in respect of the new requirements. To this end, the Department introduced a Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for Sow Welfare in June 2010, with a total of &euro;13 million being set aside under this scheme.  It follows two earlier schemes in 2005 and 2007 which made payments of &euro;6.36 million to 64 applicants.<\/p><p>  Following discussions with producers and the evidence of the initial stages of the scheme my Department modified and improved some elements of the scheme. Grant-aid is now available at a rate of 40% to eligible producers with a maximum investment ceiling of &euro;500,000 for the first sow house, with further amounts of &euro;300,000 for each of the next three houses.  Applications from 47 producers with a value in grant terms of &euro;4 million were received prior to the enhancement of the scheme.  Since the revised scheme was launched a further 37 applications have been received with a grant value of &euro;7.1 million. This latter number includes a small number of the initial 47 which were withdrawn and resubmitted under the more favourable terms. The penultimate tranche closed yesterday with a final closing date for applications of 31 October 2012.<\/p><p>  I, together with officials from my Department met with the IFA during the summer to discuss a number of issues including the new animal welfare measures. My officials continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders with a view to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the requirements by the January 2013 deadline.  My Department is in regular contact with banking representatives and has encouraged them to discuss requirements with sectoral agri-food interests. It is of course important that those seeking credit present a suitable business case with detailed cash flow projections. In this context the Department also facilitated contacts between Teagasc and the Banking sector to encourage seminars and training in relation to credit application.  Any farming enterprises that feel they have not been treated fairly in relation to access to credit can contact the Credit Review Office, who will review their case.<\/p><p>  Improving access to credit is a priority on the business agenda and is an issue which the Government is addressing in a comprehensive and co-ordinated manner.  To address the issue the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will shortly launch both the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme and a Microenterprise Loan Fund for small business. While primary production in agriculture, horticulture and fisheries are excluded from the scope of the Credit Guarantee Scheme in the light of particular restrictions under the De Minimis State Aid rules, these enterprises may be eligible under the Microenterprise Loan Fund provisions.<\/p><p>  I am also working to improve access for Irish pigmeat to 3rd Country markets, and indeed in 2011, exports of Irish pigmeat to international (non-EU) markets increased by 25% to 43,000 tonnes.

In the context of internal market and third country trade, DG Agriculture &amp; Rural Development produces regular market forecasts for various agricultural sectors and its most recent short-term outlook for the meat and certain other sectors was published in June 2012. <\/p><p><b>Dairy sector<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  The June report predicted increased EU production and exports for most dairy commodities but it is important to note how quickly the market can change. Extreme weather in different parts of the world this summer has had a significant impact on global dairy markets, as rising grain prices have led to an increase in dairy commodity prices.   <\/p><p><br \/>  Volatility in dairy prices is caused by imbalances of supply and demand in international markets, which are cyclical in nature.  However, while there will always be short term fluctuations in dairy prices, the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good.  Growth in global population and wealth is forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  Against that background, I believe that prospects and opportunities for the dairy sector will expand significantly over the coming years.  My Department and its agencies will continue to play their part in providing an appropriate framework to support the development of this critically important industry.  <\/p><p><b>Beef Sector<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  According to its analysis of the overall beef trade, the Commission expects that weak domestic demand and exchange rate movements will cause EU imports to fall by almost 6% in 2012 followed by a stabilisation in 2013. EU beef exports will be affected by a significantly reduced export capacity in 2012 and 2013 because of a shortage in domestic supply. As a result, the EU will revert to a being net beef importer in volume terms in 2012 and 2013 after the exceptional trade surplus recorded in 2011.<\/p><p><br \/>  The EU cattle population, which was estimated at 86 million head in December 2011, has declined at an average rate of 1.1% since 2008 and this trend should persist in the near future. EU beef and veal production in 2012 is expected to decrease by 3.5% compared to 2011 and to remain largely unchanged in 2013. A consequence of these supply constraints is that EU beef prices are likely to remain at record levels for the remainder of 2012. High beef prices combined with weak internal demand will lead to a reduction in beef and veal consumption in 2012 before stabilising at the lower level in 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland is over 600% self sufficient in beef production and exports around 93% of slaughter output with volumes averaging approximately 0.5 million tonnes annually over the past 3 years. The outlook is for continued buoyant cattle prices on the basis that total prime cattle throughput at Department-approved meat plants is down 16% for the year to date compared to the same period in 2011. However, data on calf birth registrations in 2011 and 2012 indicates that prospects for production growth in the beef sector in 2013 are positive. Increased supply availability can be expected to result in increased beef output and exports in the short run. <\/p><p><b>Lamb sector<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  According to the latest forecasts from the European Commission, the European sheep flock is expected to remain relatively stable in 2012 with slaughterings also at similar levels to last year. There are uncertainties about consumption levels due to the economic situation.<\/p><p><br \/>  Regarding the sheep sector in Ireland, slaughterings for the year 2012 up to week ending 16 September are up by 7% on the corresponding period in 2011. This points to an increase in production following the recovery in the breeding flock which was noted in 2010 and 2011. Factory prices for the year 2012 to date are approximately 2% below 2011 levels for the corresponding period. This reflects the competitive pressures in the market.<\/p><p><br \/>  The vast majority of Irish sheepmeat is sold on EU markets, with France being the single most important export market. Although almost all Irish sheepmeat has traditionally been sold on European markets, there has been more interest shown by exporters in third country markets in recent years. My Department, in co-operation with Bord Bia and with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs, has been active in negotiating access to key third country markets. In recent years we have succeeded in gaining access for Irish sheepmeat to Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa and Singapore and we are continuing to work on other possibilities. I am confident that this work will give the sector the options it needs to ensure the best returns possible going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRX00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":914,"content":"<p>Question No.376 answered with Question No. 74.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":916,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRX00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Preschool Services","counter":915,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRX00675"},{"type":"question","counter":916,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[40062\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRX00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the inspection regime for newly established creches; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1007","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":917,"content":"<p>Pre-school services, including childminding services, are currently regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act,1991.<\/p><p>  Under the regulations, the National Children and Family Office of the Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible generally for inspecting pre-school services with the objective of securing the health, safety and welfare of children attending them.

The purpose of the Adoption Act, 2010, is to improve standards in both domestic and intercountry adoption and its enactment coincided with the establishment of the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI). The Adoption Authority of Ireland is an independent statutory body charged with implementing the Adoption Act, 2010. The Authority has responsibility for the direct operational implementation of legislation and Government policy. It has a quasi-judicial role and is independent in its decision-making functions.The AAI is the Central Authority with responsibility for overseeing standards in respect of the adoption process taking place within this jurisdiction.   <\/p><p><br \/>  In considering matters relating to intercountry adoption the Authority must satisfy itself that the adoption complies with the terms and conditions of the 1993 Hague Convention, which is a co-operative agreement drawn up to allow countries to mutually support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the intercountry adoption process. It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures to mutually assure countries of the safety and standard of intercountry adoptions in those countries.  This applies to all children in the inter country adoption process, including those with special needs.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Adoption Act, 2010, which provides the legislative framework for adoption in Ireland, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that <b>all <\/b>  adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child and to the highest possible standard.

It must not be forgotten that intercountry adoption is a service for those children who cannot be raised by their birth parents or cared for in their own country. The interests of the child must always be paramount throughout the adoption process. This is best achieved through the full implementation of the highest national and international standards governing adoption practice.

There are no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":961,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRY00750"},{"type":"question","counter":962,"qnumday":392,"qnumall":"[40064\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason persons who have suffered from cancer have had there medical card renewals refused; the reason for same when they have a long term illness.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":963,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRY00900","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Report","counter":964,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRY00950"},{"type":"question","counter":965,"qnumday":393,"qnumall":"[40069\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRY01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"following recent reports (details supplied) that the bulk of the &euro;35 million promised in Budget 2012 for the development of community mental health services was going to be used to offset the Health Service Executive deficit, the way this will effect the implementation of A Vision for Change; the position regarding the implementation of a A Vision for Change; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1104","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":966,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[40167\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRY01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the recruitment of the approved creation of an additional 414 posts for healthcare professionals as recommended in A Vision for Change to support the the delivery of modern secondary mental health care in the community","asker":"1056","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":967,"qnumday":413,"qnumall":"[40171\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the 2012 funding for the mental health services with particular reference to the 414 additional staff that were announced for the provision of the service; if as per recent information from his Department it is still hoped that 353 of these positions will be filled before the end of 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"966","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":968,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 393, 412 and 413 together.<\/p><p><br \/>  Since taking office, this Government has prioritised the reform of our mental health services in line with <i>A Vision for Change<\/i> and is committed in particular to the delivery of more and better quality care in the community.

However, a number of changes have been made to the way in which medical card applications are processed by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Any medical card holder undergoing a review, who genuinely engages with that review, will not have their entitlement withdrawn before the review is complete, regardless of the expiry date shown on their medical card.  In cases where a decision is made not to grant a medical card, the applicant is informed of the decision and is notified of their right to appeal this decision.  Contact details for the appeals office are provided to them.  Where a person submits an appeal to a decision not to renew a medical card within 21 days of that decision, they retain their medical card or GP visit card until the appeal is decided.  The Appeals officer notifies the appellant of the final decision in the case.<\/p><p>  In relation to those persons under the age of 25 years who apply for medical cards, in future being on age related Supplementary Welfare Allowance will not, in itself, prohibit a person from being awarded a medical card or a GP visit card.<\/p><p>  The HSE has implemented a set of guidelines in relation to the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford.  Emergency medical cards are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.  As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.  The arrangement is slightly different for persons with a terminal illness.  Terminally ill patients are given an emergency medical card for six months.  Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive has confirmed that 96% of fully completed applications and reviews are now processed within 15 days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRBB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRBB02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1131,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[40389\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRBB02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if she will have an early assessment arranged for a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny who has been waiting for a knee operation for some time at Waterford Regional Hospital;

Benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat anxiety, sleep disturbance and insomnia and are known to be associated with dependence and withdrawal symptoms.  Consequently, benzodiazepines are usually recommended for short-term treatment only.   The Irish Medicines Board-approved prescribing information for alprazolam products states that they are only to be used when the symptoms of anxiety are severe.  It is also recommended that treatment with an alprazolam product should be as short as possible and generally not more than 8 to 12 weeks, including a tapering off process.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, benzodiazepines are prescription-only medicinal products.  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.  The Regulations also make it illegal for prescription medicines to be supplied by mail order.  The definition of mail order includes reference to electronic custom solicitation and order for supply.  This includes ordering prescription medicines through internet sites.  <\/p><p>  The Irish Medicines Board is aware of illegal supply of alprazolam from internet sites outside Ireland and is working closely with the Revenue's Customs Service officials to detain supplies on entry to Ireland and, where possible, with counterpart agencies in other countries to stop the supply.  <\/p><p>Furthermore, m y Department is reviewing the Misuse of Drugs Regulations with a view to introducing additional controls on certain prescription drugs, including benzodiazepines.  These include the introduction of import and export controls as well as an offence of unauthorised possession, thereby assisting the law enforcement roles of Customs and of the Garda Sioch&aacute;na.  My Department is consulting with key stakeholders in relation to the proposed amendments and it is anticipated that new legislation will be introduced by early 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRCC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1169,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRCC03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1170,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[40567\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500075#WRCC03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the provision of free GP visits in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Longford with a long-term illness;

However, more recent research has shown that the percentage of badgers now infected with TB in previously high cattle prevalence areas has halved since then. The reduction in the incidence of TB in badgers is welcome and indicates an improvement in the health of the badger population. It is to be hoped this will also have knock on benefits for any future badger vaccination programme.<\/p><p>With regard to the impact of TB in badgers for TB in cattle, a research paper published in 2010 summarises the evidence on the role of badgers in the spread of TB in cattle both in Ireland and the UK and concludes that &#8220;badgers are directly implicated in the transmission of infection to cattle&#8221; and &#8220;the ability to eradicate tuberculosis is severely constrained while infection continues to be spread from badgers&#8221; (<i>Mycobacterium bovis Infection in the Eurasian Badger (Meles Meles): the Disease, Pathogenesis, Epidemiology and Control<\/i> (Science Direct)  <i>). <\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  There is considerable evidence that the removal of badgers results in a reduction in the incidence of the disease in cattle.  In summary, the first major research project into the impact of badgers on TB incidence in cattle in East Offaly found that the risk of herd breakdowns was found to be 14 times higher in the control area compared with the area from which the badgers were removed.  A later study, the Four Area Project, involved the intensive and proactive removal of badgers in four &#8220;removal&#8221; areas and &#8220;reactive&#8221; culling of badgers in matched reference areas. The published results of this project also demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in TB levels in cattle following the removal of badgers. In view of this research and in order to limit the spread of TB from badgers to cattle, the Bovine TB eradication programme implemented by my Department contains a wildlife strategy involving the removal of badgers by culling when an epidemiological investigation associates a TB herd breakdown with the presence of badgers. This strategy is an important element of Ireland&#8217;s bovine TB eradication programme and has contributed to a significant reduction in the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in the cattle population in recent years.  TB reactor numbers were 18,500 in 2011, the lowest recorded number in any year since the commencement of the eradication programme in the 1950s.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department is satisfied that the badger culling strategy has contributed to a reduction in the incidence of TB over the past number of years. However, it is my intention to replace badger culling with vaccination when research demonstrates that this is a practicable proposition.  There are trials ongoing at present to determine if vaccination of badgers can provide an effective alternative to badger culling in the longer-term and to develop an efficient and effective vaccine delivery methodology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500076#WRV00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":1319,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500076#WRV00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1320,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[40068\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500076#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if forestry payments will be expedited in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; the reason for the delay in payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1056","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1321,"content":"<p>This site has a history of poor maintenance and, thus, has failed two previous inspections.

In order to assist meeting the ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020, new taxation measures were introduced in last year&#8217;s budget aimed at improving land mobility and farm consolidation, and encouraging transfers to younger, more progressive farmers. Two measures are of particular note in this regard;<\/p><p><br \/>  1.Reduced stamp duty rate applying to farm transfers<\/p><p><br \/>  2.Restructuring of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) retirement relief<\/p><p>1. <b>Reduced stamp duty rate applying to farm transfers<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  There was a reduction in the stamp duty rate applying to the sale on agricultural land from 6% to 2%. In addition, half the rate (1%) is now applicable on transfers to close relatives until the end of 2014. This change substantially reduced the stamp duty payable on transfers of farm land by gift or by sale. The measure promotes inter-generational transfer, as the cost of lifetime transfer to transferees who do not qualify for the young trained farmer stamp duty relief has been reduced considerably.<\/p><p>2. <b>Restructuring of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) retirement relief<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Budget 2012 restructured the retirement relief available on Capital Gains Tax in order to incentivise the earlier transfer of farm assets to the next generation, and to encourage the sale of land by those farmers with no successors. As of 1st January 2014, for those farmers aged 66 and over, an upper limit of &#8364;3m will be introduced on family transfers, compared to an unlimited amount currently. On non-family transfers, the current upper limit of &#8364;750,000 will be reduced to &#8364;500,000. Applying the new limits from 1st January 2014 allows farmers already aged 66 and over to plan the orderly transfer of assets in advance of that date.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is important to remember that these new measures do not mean that a farmer has to cease farming altogether beyond the age of 66, but it allows them to plan for a phased gradual transfer of assets to the next generation.<\/p><p><br \/>  Retirement relief was restructured in order to encourage farmers around the normal retirement age, who have successors, to transfer their land and holdings to young, innovative, ambitious, prospective farmers. This measure encourages an improvement in the age profile of farmers, and should ensure that farmland is put to more productive use.

Prices have continued to increase during 2012 and are currently at record levels, some 12.53% ahead year on year, or 18c per kilo higher. The industry faces a number of challenges in the short and medium term and my Department will continue to assist the sector to resolve these issues.<\/p><p>  New EU Animal Welfare rules set down new standards in relation to the housing of sows and will come into force on 1 January 2013. A significant number of producers have undertaken the necessary work required in order to upgrade their facilities in order to comply with the new rules.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department is aware of the scale of the challenge facing pig farmers in respect of the new requirements. To this end, the Department introduced a Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for Sow Welfare in June 2010, with a total of &euro;13 million being set aside under this scheme.  It follows two earlier schemes in 2005 and 2007 which made payments of &euro;6.36 million to 64 applicants.<\/p><p>  Following discussions with producers and the evidence of the initial stages of the scheme my Department modified and improved some elements of the scheme. Grant-aid is now available at a rate of 40% to eligible producers with a maximum investment ceiling of &euro;500,000 for the first sow house, with further amounts of &euro;300,000 for each of the next three houses.  Applications from 47 producers with a value in grant terms of &euro;4 million were received prior to the enhancement of the scheme.  Since the revised scheme was launched a further 37 applications have been received with a grant value of &euro;7.1 million. This latter number includes a small number of the initial 47 which were withdrawn and resubmitted under the more favourable terms. The penultimate tranche closed yesterday with a final closing date for applications of 31 October 2012.<\/p><p>  I, together with officials from my Department met with the IFA during the summer to discuss a number of issues including the new animal welfare measures. My officials continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders with a view to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s compliance with the requirements by the January 2013 deadline.  My Department is in regular contact with banking representatives and has encouraged them to discuss requirements with sectoral agri-food interests. It is of course important that those seeking credit present a suitable business case with detailed cash flow projections. In this context the Department also facilitated contacts between Teagasc and the Banking sector to encourage seminars and training in relation to credit application.  Any farming enterprises that feel they have not been treated fairly in relation to access to credit can contact the Credit Review Office, who will review their case.<\/p><p>  Improving access to credit is a priority on the business agenda and is an issue which the Government is addressing in a comprehensive and co-ordinated manner.  To address the issue the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will shortly launch both the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme and a Microenterprise Loan Fund for small business. While primary production in agriculture, horticulture and fisheries are excluded from the scope of the Credit Guarantee Scheme in the light of particular restrictions under the De Minimis State Aid rules, these enterprises may be eligible under the Microenterprise Loan Fund provisions.<\/p><p>  I am also working to improve access for Irish pigmeat to 3rd Country markets, and indeed in 2011, exports of Irish pigmeat to international (non-EU) markets increased by 25% to 43,000 tonnes.

Growth in global population and wealth is forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  Against that background, I believe that prospects and opportunities for the dairy sector will expand significantly over the coming years.  My Department and its agencies will continue to play their part in providing an appropriate framework to support the development of this critically important industry.  <\/p><p><b>Beef Sector<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  According to its analysis of the overall beef trade, the Commission expects that weak domestic demand and exchange rate movements will cause EU imports to fall by almost 6% in 2012 followed by a stabilisation in 2013. EU beef exports will be affected by a significantly reduced export capacity in 2012 and 2013 because of a shortage in domestic supply. As a result, the EU will revert to a being net beef importer in volume terms in 2012 and 2013 after the exceptional trade surplus recorded in 2011.<\/p><p><br \/>  The EU cattle population, which was estimated at 86 million head in December 2011, has declined at an average rate of 1.1% since 2008 and this trend should persist in the near future. EU beef and veal production in 2012 is expected to decrease by 3.5% compared to 2011 and to remain largely unchanged in 2013. A consequence of these supply constraints is that EU beef prices are likely to remain at record levels for the remainder of 2012. High beef prices combined with weak internal demand will lead to a reduction in beef and veal consumption in 2012 before stabilising at the lower level in 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland is over 600% self sufficient in beef production and exports around 93% of slaughter output with volumes averaging approximately 0.5 million tonnes annually over the past 3 years. The outlook is for continued buoyant cattle prices on the basis that total prime cattle throughput at Department-approved meat plants is down 16% for the year to date compared to the same period in 2011. However, data on calf birth registrations in 2011 and 2012 indicates that prospects for production growth in the beef sector in 2013 are positive. Increased supply availability can be expected to result in increased beef output and exports in the short run. <\/p><p><b>Lamb sector<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  According to the latest forecasts from the European Commission, the European sheep flock is expected to remain relatively stable in 2012 with slaughterings also at similar levels to last year. There are uncertainties about consumption levels due to the economic situation.<\/p><p><br \/>  Regarding the sheep sector in Ireland, slaughterings for the year 2012 up to week ending 16 September are up by 7% on the corresponding period in 2011. This points to an increase in production following the recovery in the breeding flock which was noted in 2010 and 2011. Factory prices for the year 2012 to date are approximately 2% below 2011 levels for the corresponding period. This reflects the competitive pressures in the market.<\/p><p><br \/>  The vast majority of Irish sheepmeat is sold on EU markets, with France being the single most important export market. Although almost all Irish sheepmeat has traditionally been sold on European markets, there has been more interest shown by exporters in third country markets in recent years. My Department, in co-operation with Bord Bia and with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs, has been active in negotiating access to key third country markets. In recent years we have succeeded in gaining access for Irish sheepmeat to Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa and Singapore and we are continuing to work on other possibilities. I am confident that this work will give the sector the options it needs to ensure the best returns possible going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500078#WRX00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1403,"content":"<p>Question No.376 answered with Question No. 74.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":1405,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500078#WRX00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Preschool Services","counter":1404,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500078#WRX00675"},{"type":"question","counter":1405,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[40062\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500078#WRX00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the inspection regime for newly established creches; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1007","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1406,"content":"<p>Pre-school services, including childminding services, are currently regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act,1991.<\/p><p>  Under the regulations, the National Children and Family Office of the Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible generally for inspecting pre-school services with the objective of securing the health, safety and welfare of children attending them.

These discussions were also attended by officials from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and concluded on  17 September 2012.<\/p><p>  The outcome of this engagement is that detailed proposals have been agreed between the parties.  Amongst the key provisions of this agreement are that:<\/p><p>- Consultants will be available for rostering for any five days out of seven as opposed to weekdays as at present;<\/p><p>- There can be rostering of consultants where required on 16\/7 (8 a.m. to midnight) or 24\/7 basis in services where this is required;<\/p><p>- Clinical Directors will have a strengthened management role in respect of consultants;<\/p><p>- There will be cooperation with a range of measures to support improved Community and Mental Health services;<\/p><p>- Consultants commit to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurers;<\/p><p>- There will be more cost-effective arrangements for funding of continuing medical education.  <\/p><p>  Separately, Government will apply a 30% reduction in salary for future consultant appointees.  Management proposals to reduce the &quot;rest day&quot; arrangements that currently apply and the elimination of the fee to consultant psychiatrists for giving a second opinion under the Mental Health Act 2001 will be referred to the Labour Court, in line with the procedures provided for in the Public Service Agreement.  The issue of &quot;historic rest days&quot; will be referred to the Labour Court in line with normal procedures.<\/p><p>  Government policy is to increase the number and availability of consultants in the public health service.   This policy is reflected in the 2008 Consultant Contract and the outcome of the recent discussions.

However, a number of changes have been made to the way in which medical card applications are processed by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Any medical card holder undergoing a review, who genuinely engages with that review, will not have their entitlement withdrawn before the review is complete, regardless of the expiry date shown on their medical card.  In cases where a decision is made not to grant a medical card, the applicant is informed of the decision and is notified of their right to appeal this decision.  Contact details for the appeals office are provided to them.  Where a person submits an appeal to a decision not to renew a medical card within 21 days of that decision, they retain their medical card or GP visit card until the appeal is decided.

Emergency medical cards are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.  As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.  The arrangement is slightly different for persons with a terminal illness.  Terminally ill patients are given an emergency medical card for six months.  Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive has confirmed that 96% of fully completed applications and reviews are now processed within 15 days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500082#WRBB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1619,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500082#WRBB02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1620,"qnumday":452,"qnumall":"[40389\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500082#WRBB02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if she will have an early assessment arranged for a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny who has been waiting for a knee operation for some time at Waterford Regional Hospital;

Benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat anxiety, sleep disturbance and insomnia and are known to be associated with dependence and withdrawal symptoms.  Consequently, benzodiazepines are usually recommended for short-term treatment only.   The Irish Medicines Board-approved prescribing information for alprazolam products states that they are only to be used when the symptoms of anxiety are severe.  It is also recommended that treatment with an alprazolam product should be as short as possible and generally not more than 8 to 12 weeks, including a tapering off process.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, benzodiazepines are prescription-only medicinal products.  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations, it is prohibited for a person to supply a prescription medicine except in accordance with a prescription and the supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.  The Regulations also make it illegal for prescription medicines to be supplied by mail order.  The definition of mail order includes reference to electronic custom solicitation and order for supply.  This includes ordering prescription medicines through internet sites.  <\/p><p>  The Irish Medicines Board is aware of illegal supply of alprazolam from internet sites outside Ireland and is working closely with the Revenue's Customs Service officials to detain supplies on entry to Ireland and, where possible, with counterpart agencies in other countries to stop the supply.  <\/p><p>Furthermore, m y Department is reviewing the Misuse of Drugs Regulations with a view to introducing additional controls on certain prescription drugs, including benzodiazepines.  These include the introduction of import and export controls as well as an offence of unauthorised possession, thereby assisting the law enforcement roles of Customs and of the Garda Sioch&aacute;na.  My Department is consulting with key stakeholders in relation to the proposed amendments and it is anticipated that new legislation will be introduced by early 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500083#WRCC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"963"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1658,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500083#WRCC03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1659,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[40567\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500083#WRCC03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the provision of free GP visits in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Longford with a long-term illness;

In the meantime,\u00a0I have no plans to implement a standard 30 KPH speed limit within village and town boundaries.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act, 2004, allows road authorities to\u00a0make bye-laws which allow the application of special speed limits on public roads within in their administrative areas.\u00a0To assist in setting special speed limits, my Department issued Guidelines for the Application of Special Speed Limits to all local authorities in January 2011\u00a0and the onus is on local authorities to take them into account in relation to any special speed limits set.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500086#WRFF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1761,"content":"<p>Question No. 503 answered with Question No. 500.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme Applications","counter":1762,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500086#WRFF00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1763,"qnumday":504,"qnumall":"[40238\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092500086#WRFF00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when successful applicants under the sports capital grants scheme will be notified;
