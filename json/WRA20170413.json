This level of investment allowed for the recruitment of additional nurses, doctors, teachers, garda and special needs assistants which will improve public service delivery to citizens.  It also funded the Action Plan for Housing, improvements in childcare funding and a number of increases to Social Welfare rates.  <\/p>  <p>For public servants, the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA) provides a negotiated pathway for public service pay increases through a phased partial unwinding of the FEMPI measures at a full year cost of &euro;844m in 2018 and represents a considerable investment in public service remuneration.

As far as investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is concerned, this included:<\/p><p>-  PPP projects to deliver new Garda station construction nationwide;<\/p><p>-  &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles;<\/p><p>-  major additional investment of &euro;205m in Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na technology and systems; and<\/p><p>-  &euro;18 million for refurbishment of Garda stations.<\/p><p>This allocation demonstrates this Government's commitment to investing in 21st Century policing, and to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the vehicles and technology to be effective, mobile and responsive to prevent and tackle crime in both urban and rural areas. In addition, it will provide better facilities for members and staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, importantly, enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enhance the service it provides to the public in terms of supporting victims of crime and investigating crime. <\/p><p>In relation to investment in Garda ICT infrastructure, some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested over the period 2016 to 2021.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems, an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system, an e-Vetting system and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which itself is further supported by a dedicated data entry service in Castlebar. <\/p><p>I am further informed that key ICT outputs from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, include:<\/p><p>-  the introduction of mobile technology solutions to enable operational Garda&iacute; to access core information systems, including PULSE, while on duty and away from Garda stations;<\/p><p>-  providing members with real-time information on mobile devices, as well as enabling investigation teams to collect and share information digitally;<\/p><p>-  the continued extension of the Garda network throughout 2017 to ensure that non-networked stations gain access to relevant systems;<\/p><p>-  modernisation of Garda information systems, such as PULSE, to ensure that members have quick access to timely and accurate information. <\/p><p>In addition, I understand that the following key projects have commenced and will see delivery across 2017:<\/p><p>-  Investigations Management System which will support the management of activities completed as part of an investigation, maintain a full history of the chain of events in an investigation, manage information gathered, decisions made and actions taken;<\/p><p>-  Property and Exhibit Management System which will be used to record all property and exhibits which come into Garda possession and manage them throughout their life cycle within the organisation from crime scene to court; <\/p><p>-  Enterprise Content Management system which will provide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a single enterprise content repository for all documentation and multimedia content created (for example CCTV clips); and<\/p><p>-  Rosters and Duty Management system.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that three new Garda Headquarters are being progressed by the Office of Public Works in close cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am informed that work is progressing well on all three projects which are expected to be completed this year. The cost of each project is some &euro;29.5 million for Kevin Street; some &euro;24.5 million for Wexford and some &euro;27.5 million for Galway - all figures ex VAT. <\/p><p>In October 2015, I announced in conjunction with my colleague the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016 &ndash; 2021.  This Programme includes a number of projects which reflect the priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including:<\/p><p>-a PPP to deliver new Garda stations in Macroom Clonmel and Sligo;<\/p><p>-  major refurbishment of stations\/facilities including facilities for meeting victims of crime;<\/p><p>-  essential remedial works to existing stations;<\/p><p>-  development of large scale Property and Exhibit Management Stores; and<\/p><p>-  upgrade of cells and provision of improved Custody Management Facilities.<\/p><p>As far as the PPP is concerned, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Office of Public Works is making good progress towards the acquisition of suitable sites for the proposed developments and, in addition, discussions have taken place with the National Development Finance Agency. <\/p><p>With regard to the Garda Fleet, some &euro;46 million is being invested over the lifetime of the Capital Plan. The Deputy will be aware that there has been unprecedented investment in the Garda Fleet in recent years and, from the moment that the economy began to turn, it was clear to this and the previous Government that such investment was a necessity.  The actual expenditure in new and replacement vehicles over the period 2013 to 2016 was in the region of &euro;40 million.  This works out at average expenditure of &euro;10 million per annum compared to an average of &euro;1.6 million<b><\/b>over the three year period 2009 to 2011 for example. <\/p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that, as on 13 March 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, the Garda fleet comprised of 2,807 vehicles.  Some 64% of the fleet is now less than 4 years old and in fact almost 1 in 5 vehicles are less than one-year-old.  This compares with the situation in 2012 where in the region of 89% of the fleet were older than four years and only 1 in 50 (i.e. 2%) of the fleet was less than one-year old.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300050#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300050#WRC01600"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[18820\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300050#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount provided under the capital plan for the new forensic science laboratory in County Kildare; the amount spent to date; the expected completion date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>The need for a new purpose built forensic science laboratory appropriate to the State's requirements is long-standing.

However, it is worth noting that the Seniors Alert Scheme, which is provided by my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, provides grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alarms to enable older persons, of limited means, to continue to live with independence and peace of mind in their own homes.<\/p><p>I am of course very much aware of the particular concerns which may arise in relation to the safety of elderly and vulnerable persons.  In this regard I can assure the Deputy that I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that the available Garda resources are used as effectively as possible for tackling crime in our community.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work in partnership with a wide range of community based groups, including Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch groups, to support enhanced community safety and with particular regard to the needs of elderly and more vulnerable people.  <\/p><p>The protection of elderly and vulnerable people was a key consideration in the broad review of our response to burglary and related crimes which I initiated in the early part of 2015.  Arising from this, the Deputy will be aware of the concertedstrategy which has been put in place to tackle such crimes and protect householders.  In particular, very important progress has been made under Operation Thor which has led to concentrated Garda activity with more than 67,000 targeted checkpoints nationwide, and in the region of 4,000 arrests connected to a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  Operation Thor has particularly targeted mobile gangs engaged in burglary and related crimes and it is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, the burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend.  Indeed, the most recent CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q4 of 2016 show a decrease of 30% in burglary for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to same period in 2015.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor. <\/p><p>As part of the concerted strategy to combat burglary, I made it a priority to secure the enactment of specific legislation targeting prolific burglars in the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015.  These provisions are now available to Garda&iacute; to support prosecutions arising from Operation Thor.  The reduction in the volume of burglaries as a result of Operation Thor will not of course be indicated in the overall detection rate for burglary.  However, I might add that the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act was commenced a year ago and introduced the DNA database, which provides Garda&iacute; with investigative links (&rsquo;hits&rsquo;) between people and unsolved crimes, including burglaries.  It is anticipated that this will assist in improving detection rates for burglary over the coming years. <\/p><p>Garda&iacute; support over 3,700 Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch Schemes nationwide, and these form an important partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent crime and protect communities, especially the elderly and more vulnerable persons. In addition, the Garda Text Alert Scheme provides an effective means for Garda&iacute; to communicate crime prevention information to local communities.  Since it was launched in September 2013, it has grown quickly with a total of 164,000 subscribers and in the order of 3 million text messages sent annually.  Every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups.<\/p><p>I should advise the Deputy that neither my Department nor An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provide direct funding for the setting up of Text Alert Schemes, or for the operation of local Community Alert Groups generally.  Instead, funding is provided in relation to the employment and associated costs of the national Community Alert programme, including the employment of regional Development Officers.  The long-standing view has been that this is the best use of the resources available to my Department to support effective community crime prevention actions.<\/p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government plans to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan which is in train within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Approximately 300 appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300050#WRC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300050#WRC04600"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[18947\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300050#WRC04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; with foreign language skills in each Garda division; and the resources available to and approach taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with language barriers in ethnically diverse Garda districts.","asker":"1222","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for carrying on and managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p>I have requested the information sought by the Deputy from the Commissioner and I will write to the Deputy on receipt of same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300050#WRC04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[19039\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300050#WRC05000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of drivers under section 29 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 that were not eligible for\u00a0a specific notice (details supplied).","asker":"1278","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[19044\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300050#WRC05100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of fines or fixed penalty notices that were issued to motorists\u00a0in tabular form (details supplied).","asker":"1278","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[19045\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300050#WRC05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of fines and fixed penalty notices that were issued to motorists\u00a0in tabular form\u00a0(details supplied).","asker":"1278","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[19109\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300050#WRC05300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of fines or fixed penalty notices (details supplied) that were issued to motorists in tabular form.","asker":"1278","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 52, 53 and 56 together.<\/p>  <p>  I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the matters referred to in the Deputy's questions and I will contact the Deputy directly upon receipt of a Garda report.

Rather, it is provided by NAMA in line with its commercial mandate under Section 10 of the NAMA Act. NAMA's commercial activities, including asset management plans to facilitate housing on sites securing its loans, are decisions for the independent NAMA Board and are funded entirely from NAMA's own resources. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Plan (2016-2021), NAMA planned to fund the delivery of 4,500 new homes in the three years to end-2016.

An additional 7,300 units have received planning permission and planning applications have been lodged, or are\u00a0anticipated\u00a0to be\u00a0lodged within the year, for another 10,000 units.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that NAMA originally allowed for &euro;5.6 billion in funding, with peak funding of up to &euro;1.8 billion, for its residential funding programme if required.  However, NAMA do not anticipate reaching such funding levels given the proceeds from the sale of completed projects are being recycled to fund new commercially viable residential projects.<\/p>  <p>  It is also very important to understand that NAMA is not itself a developer.\u00a0 Rather, NAMA is ensuring the delivery of these units through continued work with its existing debtors to agree development plans, secure\/alter planning permission and funding the delivery of these residential units on a commercial basis.\u00a0 Furthermore, NAMA only\u00a0extends funding to willing NAMA debtors and receivers on commercial arms-length terms where there is an expectation that such funding will enhance NAMA's recovery on the loan.  NAMA requires that the projected return resulting from the provision of additional funding must be the value maximising strategy for the asset and this is fully in accordance with Section 10 of the NAMA Act. \u00a0This means NAMA will facilitate the funding of development\u00a0of only those sites that are commercially viable and where\u00a0site development will deliver a better recovery than the sale of the undeveloped site.

The Capital Plan itself is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and the other Government Departments concerned.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In my recent response I informed the Deputy that in accordance with its double bottom line mandate to invest, on a commercial basis, to create employment and economic growth in Ireland, ISIF's investment strategy and its activities are closely aligned with and support Government policy across a wide range of areas, including: housing, the agri-sector, communications and energy.<\/p>  <p>  ISIF has already committed &euro;2.7 billion and it acts as a catalyst for other investors to invest in Irish projects.\u00a0 This includes a commitment of &euro;361 million to Infrastructure investment essential to the future competitiveness of the Irish economy.  In addition, ISIF's ability to attract co-investment from the private sector means that &euro;7 billion of total investment has been committed up to end December 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Only a certain amount of any capital investment programme can be deliverable via either direct Government expenditure or traditional, proven sources of commercial investment such as PPPs.  Therefore, in the course of implementing its investment strategy and conducting its activities, ISIF has been playing an important role, as both an investor and as a catalyst for private investment, in respect of the capital plan, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment, 2016-2021. <\/p>  <p>  As a public fund, it is important to the ISIF's success that the commercial investment decisions taken under its mandate are consistent with Government policy.\u00a0 In this regard, ISIF's investment policy dovetails with Government policy while also, critically, maintaining the commercial mandate which is at ISIF's core.<\/p>  <p>  In this way, ISIF plays an important role as a key link between Government, semi-State bodies and the private sector.  Such a strategic position is important for the continued investment in Ireland's infrastructure and, indeed our future economic growth and expansion. <\/p>  <p>  Turning to the Connectivity Fund specifically it was established as a sub-fund of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to invest the &euro;335 million proceeds from the sale of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus with the aim of enabling and enhancing Ireland's physical, virtual and energy connectivity.<\/p>  <p>  As at 31 March 2017 the ISIF has completed the first two investments from this fund with a combined value of &euro;57m.<\/p>  <p>  -  ISIF announced a $25 million (c. &euro;22 million) equity investment in Aqua Comms DAC, the operator of Ireland's first dedicated subsea fibre-optic network.  The cable lands in Killala County Mayo and interconnects New York, Dublin and London.\u00a0 Aqua Comms is a provider of data connectivity and bandwidth infrastructure services for content providers, cloud-based networks, data centres, IT companies and the global media. Its network will be used by major multinational technology and telecoms companies to provide fast, secure data connections between Ireland, the US and UK and will enable the continued growth of the Irish digital economy.<\/p>  <p>  -  ISIF also rolled an existing (National Pensions Reserve Fund) commitment in daa plc's public bond, which was issued in 2008 (repayable in 2018), into a &euro;35 million commitment in a new 2028 public bond issuance by daa, the operator of Dublin and Cork Airports.  This continues ISIF's role as a long-term, strategic, domestic investor in daa.  Given the nature of the underlying business of daa, and the fact that the new bond issuance provides the underpinning long-term financing for the company, the ISIF commitment to the 2028 bond is considered suited to inclusion under the Connectivity Fund.<\/p>  <p>  Several other Connectivity Fund investment opportunities are currently being assessed under the ISIF's \"double bottom line\" mandate, which is to seek both commercial return and economic impact.

The debtor connections extensively consulted with NAMA regarding options for the portfolio including identification of potential parties for inclusion on a panel of credible bidders in the event of a loan sale. <\/p>  <p>  NAMA advise that sixteen potential\u00a0acquirers\u00a0were initially\u00a0considered, seven of which\u00a0were not included in the list of potential bidders based on advice from the loan sales adviser, Eastdil Secured,\u00a0as to their appetite and suitability for a portfolio of this type. I am further advised that NAMA, acting on the advice of its loan sale adviser and legal advisers, and the debtor connections agreed a list of nine potential credible bidders based on a number of criteria including financial capacity, experience in purchasing and managing similar portfolios and their interest in investing in assets similar to the underlying secured assets in the Tolka portfolio.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that NAMA initiated a targeted marketing process for the sale of the portfolio based on the advice of its loan sales adviser that, by comparison with all other disposal options, such an approach would significantly enhance the proceeds generated for NAMA. NAMA is prohibited by law from disclosing confidential information in relation to debtors and their assets and is therefore constrained from disclosing the particular considerations which formed the basis for the adviser's recommendation that a targeted marketing process would maximise the State's return in this particular instance.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA\u00a0that after the Project Tolka loan sale process commenced, bidders were precluded, under the terms of confidentiality agreements with NAMA, from contacting debtors without the written consent of NAMA or its loan sale adviser. I am advised that no such consent was sought.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the loans sales adviser engaged with six of the potential credible bidders to ascertain their level of interest in bidding for the portfolio. Following this consultation, three potential bidders were selected based on their interest in the portfolio and on their willingness to meet NAMA's minimum reserve price for the portfolio. The minimum reserve price had been established by reference to up-to-date independent valuations of the underlying secured assets. <\/p>  <p>  NAMA's adviser confirmed to NAMA that the short-listed panel of bidders was sufficient to ensure a competitive process and that the short-listed parties had sufficient funds to complete the transaction. I am advised that the process was predicated on the receipt of three competitive bids and would not have completed unless three such bids were received.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised that a high level of competitive tension was generated throughout the sales process and that three bids were received on the advised bid date for the transaction. NAMA accepted the highest bid which\u00a0 exceeded its minimum reserve price and independent valuations for the portfolio.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300052#WRE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":196,"content":"<p>Question No. 84 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Branch Closures","counter":197,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300052#WRE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":198,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[19081\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300052#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to have discussions with the banking sector on the provision of additional financial services through An Post, in view of the concerns in rural communities wherein bank branches are closing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":199,"content":"<p>I should stress at the outset that the Irish Government has no formal role in the commercial decisions of the banks as to their future business model and whether or not they will close particular branches.

Recruitment to apprenticeship is therefore driven by employers rather than by SOLAS or by education and training providers. \u00a0The 2014 Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland acknowledged that the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships is low as they operate in sectors that have traditionally low levels of female employment. SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage them to employ female apprentices\u00a0in these areas. Despite this the number of female apprentices remains low.<\/p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.\u00a0 In recent months, we have seen the first of these new apprenticeships with the new\u00a0Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship launching in September 2016 and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship\u00a0commencing in November 2016.\u00a0 13 further new apprenticeships will get underway in 2017, many of which\u00a0are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and I am confident that this will lead to a strong increase in female participation when these new apprenticeships are launched. <\/p>  <p>  As set out in the recently published Action Plan to Extend Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, my Department will, in conjunction with SOLAS, review the pathways to participation in apprenticeship in a range of diverse groups, including female participation, in light of the broadening of the apprenticeship system into new areas.

The Deputy will appreciate that several large scale projects and various schemes signalled during the period of the Medium Term Exchequer Framework are on-going and will only be finalised during the early years of the current Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2015\u00a0310 large scale school building projects were announced by my Department. With the exception of 14 new schools, the remainder are in respect of large scale extensions and\/or refurbishment projects. The combination of new schools and large scale extensions will deliver the additional 62,000 school places (43,000 Post-Primary school places plus 19,000 Primary school places) over the lifetime of the Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The expectation is that the completion of large scale projects on an annual basis over the lifetime of the Plan will be consistent with results from both 2015 and 2016 when 50 large scale projects were completed each year. \u00a0In 2015 a total of 27 new schools and 23 large scale extensions were completed while in 2016 a total of 30 new schools and 20 large scale extensions were completed. The 2015 completions provided 13,405 additional permanent school places while the 2016 completions provided 15,290 permanent school places. Although this level of provision is expected to reduce in the latter years of the Plan due to a lesser demand at Primary level for large scale projects to deliver additional school places and a greater emphasis on large scale refurbishment projects, the target provision of 62,000 additional school places can still be achieved. It should be noted that the announcement in November 2015 also alluded to the prospect of requiring new schools post 2018, a prospect that is kept under constant review.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure on Large Scale Projects in 2016 amounted to just over &euro;334m or 63% of the overall capital spend under Subhead D.3 &ndash; Building, Equipment and Furnishing of Primary and Post-Primary Schools. When combined with the Additional Accommodation Scheme expenditure reaches almost 80% of the 2016 spend under this subhead. This percentage level of expenditure on Large Scale Projects is projected to continue throughout the lifetime of the Capital Plan.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  All new schools and extensions are constructed in accordance with my Department&rsquo;s design and technical guidance documents. These documents include guidance on best practice in achieving energy efficient schools.\u00a0 All new school buildings must achieve a top A3 band Building Energy Rating (BER). The costs associated with providing such a high level of energy efficiency in new school buildings form part of the building works contract and as such are not calculated in isolation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Over the lifetime of the Capital Plan it is intended to replace all purchased temporary accommodation with permanent accommodation, where the need is established. To enable this development, my Department will be carrying out an assessment of the number of prefabs being used to deliver the curriculum. This will also determine whether or not individual prefabs need to be replaced in the context of the long-term accommodation needs of each individual school. When completed, this assessment will quantify the number of prefabs to be replaced. <\/p>  <p>  A Mid-Term Review of the Capital Plan is currently underway with a final report and recommendations to be presented to Government in the third quarter of 2017.\u00a0\u00a0My Department provided a detailed submission in early March to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform reflecting the on-going capital requirements of the education sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300052#WRE05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Digital Strategy for Schools","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300053#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[18746\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300053#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount of the &euro;210 million that was provided under the capital plan for the upgrade to school information and communication technology and wireless networks which has been spent; the number of schools this funding has gone to; the number of schools funding will be provided for; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":222,"content":"<p>The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 Enhancing Teaching Learning and Assessment, sets out the Department's vision for embedding ICT in teaching learning and assessment in primary and post-primary schools.

This is in effect what is often colloquially referred to as a grandfather clause.<\/p><p>In 2013, in response in particular to the lower than anticipated rate of applications for registration by technical assessment, an independent review of the arrangements in place for registration was undertaken by Mr Garret Fennell, Solicitor. Mr Fennell&rsquo;s report on the matter is available at: .\u00a0 The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht also examined the matter and published its Report on the Title of Architect (July 2013) which is available at: <\/p><p>Both reports, which were welcomed by my Department, made a number of recommendations intended to improve and streamline the arrangements for registration.

In 2016 the Architects Alliance of Ireland proposed a special entry route to incorporate the proposed development of a prescribed register admission examination as currently provided for under this section.  While the Act would allow me to prescribe such a register admission examination as a route to registration for eligible persons, neither I nor my Department have the remit or the competence to validate or approve the proposed register admission examination.

The Government has been actively exploring potential mechanisms that would facilitate investment in social housing, including the off-balance sheet potential of private institutional investment. \u00a0A number of private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the MTR scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property.\u00a0 They are seeking an alternative arrangement that would see the mortgaged property staying in the funding firm&rsquo;s ownership and the property itself leased back to the local authority in circumstances where the borrower is eligible for MTR and the borrower would therefore remain in their own home.\u00a0 <\/p><p>One of the outcomes of the Review is that in order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements. In advance of these pilots, a targeted market testing exercise is currently underway by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), on behalf of my Department, to test the suitability of the proposed enhanced leasing arrangements to ascertain if they would be viable for a mortgage to rent cohort.\u00a0 The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.<\/p><p>A detailed financial assessment of the structure of the funding of the MTR scheme will be undertaken in advance of the budgetary process for 2018.\u00a0 The assessment will be informed by the early impact of the other actions proposed by the review, as well as the outcome of the experience with the pilot lease arrangements, and the availability of financial resources overall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300055#WRH02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Rents","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300055#WRH02700"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[19097\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300055#WRH02800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department has directed local authorities to increase rent paid by persons (details supplied); if so, the reason for this increase; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>My Department has\u00a0not issued any instructions or advice to housing authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) recently regarding reviewing rents for social housing tenants.<\/p>  <p>  The making and amending of rent schemes is the responsibility of housing authorities as an integral part of their housing management functions, subject to broad principles laid down by my Department in Circular letter HRT 3\/2002 of 6 March 2002. \u00a0Where social housing units are provided by AHBs under Payment and Availability (P&amp;A) arrangements with local authorities, it is a condition of such funding that rents be determined in accordance with the differential rents scheme of the housing authority in which the house is situated, and AHBs will carry out rent reviews from time to in accordance with the particular rents scheme in question.\u00a0 Where sheltered housing is provided by AHBs under the Capital Assistance Scheme, my Department&rsquo;s guidance states that rents should be at levels which are reasonable having regard to tenant&rsquo;s incomes and the outlay of the AHB on the accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The reviewing of local authority housing rents is also a matter for individual housing authorities.\u00a0 Guidelines entitled &ldquo;Rent Assessment, Collection, Accounting and Arrears Control&rdquo;, prepared in 2001\u00a0by the Housing Unit (which subsequently became part of the Housing Agency) in conjunction with my Department and the City and County Managers Association, set out good practice in the administration of rent related matters.

Customers availing of this support prior to 1 January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1 January 2018.

A cost benefit analysis has not been carried out to assess the impacts.  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through on-going engagement with their lender to explore sustainable solutions.  The ongoing payment of this supplement on an indefinite basis will not address the longer term issues for people in serious mortgage arrears. <\/p>  <p>  In line with all schemes administered by my Department, any further extension of the mortgage interest scheme for existing customers would have to be considered in a budgetary context. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.  <\/p>  <p>  The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are now 32 specialist DMA advisors working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA service has helped almost 3,450 such borrowers.  <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, MABS provides a national network of court mentors who attend each listed repossession Court hearing countrywide. The mentors provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signpost them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,400 borrowers have been referred onward to MABS advisors through the court mentor service.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2016, a further initiative was announced by Government, known as Abhaile.  This scheme further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.   The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to access independent expert financial and\/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  To date, approximately 6,000 vouchers for services have been issued, in respect of over 3,670 principle private residences.  <\/p>  <p>  I am continuing to monitor the supports and services which the Department has put in place to assist homeowners in serious mortgage arrears.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300056#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Administration","counter":392,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300056#WRJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":393,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[19043\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300056#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will clarify his comments describing some community employment scheme participants as being persons who find it difficult to hold down a job; the basis for these remarks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":394,"content":"<p>Community Employment (CE) has its origins in 1994.  At that time, long-term unemployment was undermining the employability of many individuals and the capacity of communities to function as cohesive social structures. The alienation experienced by the long-term unemployed often reflected a sense of disempowerment in their communities.  CE acted as a resource for communities to identify their own needs and priorities and, over the years, it became a vital service to communities both in rural areas and areas of urban disadvantage.  It developed into a unique programme that integrates employment interventions and training for the individual with community services.  The programme addresses the multiple needs of people who are often far from &lsquo;employment ready&rsquo; and experiencing a range of social and economic problems by operating within local and community contexts and responding to the needs identified by a variety of community agencies. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, CE is a labour market activation programme which helps long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged groups to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine.  The programme assists participants to enhance and develop skills which can then be used in the workplace. <\/p>  <p>  Many people on the Live Register generally exit it again within a short-time frame, without any recourse to employment schemes or intensive activation measures.  However, some people do require more assistance and support to return to work and schemes like CE are designed to do just that.  These types of programmes deliver on two levels.  On the one hand, they provide a person who is unemployed with the opportunity of work experience and to develop new skills to prepare them for employment in the open labour market.  Secondly, they play a very important role in augmenting service delivery to local communities in key areas such as childcare, health and social care, drug rehabilitation and local amenities. <\/p>  <p>  Both participant and local communities have benefitted from these programmes.  In fact, I have seen this myself, at first hand, over the past few months when I visited various schemes throughout the country and spoke directly to participants about their experience on CE.  <\/p>  <p>  My commitment to CE is evident in the recent changes I announced which will widen the range of people who can take part.

The final agreed capital funding available for investment in information technology infrastructure and office equipment in 2016 was &euro;10.4m and &euro;8m in 2017.   <\/p>  <p>  The Department has agreed capital allocations for the remaining period of the Capital Plan &lsquo;Building on Recovery:  Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021&rsquo; i.e. 2018 - &euro;9m; 2019- &euro;9m; 2020 - &euro;8m and 2021 - &euro;8m.  However, the specific breakdown for information technology infrastructure has still to be determined. <\/p>  <p>  From January 2016 to end March 2017 the Department spent &euro;9.8m in supporting technical infrastructure.  The following outlines the progress made in 2016 and the key areas that the Department intends focussing on in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  -  Building on the significant investment made in 2016 there will be further investment in 2017 on the infrastructure in direct use by staff.  During 2016 some 4,000 new PCs were deployed, almost 600 PCs were upgraded, 786 laptops were made available to staff and 2,170 scanners were installed. The investment in the PCs was made to replace obsolete equipment and to deliver far more processing power at the desktop in support of business initiatives under the digital agenda.  The laptops were made available to field working staff to facilitate access to up-to-date data and to reduce maintenance of paper files.  The scanners are being deployed to allow capture of electronic versions of documents and reduce the size of the Department&rsquo;s paper data holdings.  This investment will continue in 2017 but on a lesser scale given that this was a major focus area in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  -  There will be further investment in new storage technology.  The volume of data that the Department maintains continues to grow. Data that was hitherto retained on paper is now being captured electronically and maintained centrally.  The investment in storage will be in traditional disk storage and also in WORM (Write Once Read Many) and solid state storage.  The investment in WORM will be used to store scanned images. The solid state technology will be deployed in support of big data initiatives and to help improve batch performance. <\/p>  <p>  -  All of the Departments offices are connected back to the central data centres located in Dublin.  Building on the investment already made in the Department&rsquo;s Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) there will be a major focus in 2017 on the Wide Area Network (WAN) and on delivering new and upgraded network links to these offices and to build varying degrees of resilience to these offices based on their workloads.  This will be a major investment for the Department in 2017 and will deliver high-bandwidth links that will sustain the Department for some years to come.<\/p>  <p>  -  The demand for computer room servers is ever present.  The investment here in 2017 will be targeted at replacing old equipment and on delivering new computer servers configured to best industry standards to support a range of business functions.  <\/p>  <p>  -  The Department&rsquo;s Unified Communications strategy is focused on centralising its telecommunications services and carrying all voice traffic over the main network.  There will be investment therefore in hardware and software infrastructure during 2017 in support of this strategy.<\/p>  <p>  -  There was a major focus in 2016 on investment in security technology. New anti-malware \/ anti-virus software was deployed to all devices.  A significant investment was made in new firewalls to further strengthen and maintain perimeter security. There will be continued investment in this area in 2017 to ensure that the Department&rsquo;s security systems stay current.<\/p>  <p>  -  As part of its commitment to the Digital Agenda the Department will start an investment in self-service technology during 2017.  The objective here will be to build on the services available through MyWelfare.ie and to facilitate facilitated and non-facilitated engagement by the customer with the services of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  -  Finally there were smaller investments made in such areas as computer room racking cabinetry, provision of printing services, purchase of software licences and provision of ancillary equipment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300056#WRJ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":426,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300056#WRJ04200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Travel","counter":425,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300056#WRJ04100"},{"type":"question","counter":426,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[18896\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300056#WRJ04200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he travelled abroad as part of the St. Patrick's Day celebrations; the locations he travelled to; the duration of the trip; the cost of the trip, including travel and accommodation in addition to other expenses incurred; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":427,"content":"<p>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day offers a unique opportunity to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic and political interests overseas, with levels of publicity and media attention unmatched by the national day of any other country.

The programme began in Italy&rsquo;s economic capital, Milan; with a series of events with state agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord B&iacute;a and Tourism Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Italy is an important partner for Ireland &ndash; indeed it&rsquo;s our ninth largest trading partner with annual trade exceeding &euro;12 billion annually.  Italy is also an important tourist market for us with over 300,000 Italians visiting Ireland annually and great potential to grow that market.

The resolution aims to contribute to substantive understanding of how human rights standards apply to older persons, and provides for consideration of the possible elaboration of a multilateral legal instrument on the rights of older people.  The resolution also renewed the mandate of the Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons, Ms. Rosa Kornfeld-Matte.  The establishment of this new mandate in 2013 was supported by Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Older persons already enjoy a number of important protections within the existing international framework although we recognise there are some shortcomings in terms of implementation.  <\/p>  <p>  International obligations to older persons are implicit in the core human rights Treaties, including the two Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and Political Rights.<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, since 1982, the international community has explored the situation of older persons, including by the adoption of the 1991 United Nations Principles for Older Persons and the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing in 2002.

Both Governments agreed on the need for intensive engagement to address outstanding issues and commitments to ensure the early establishment of an Executive.  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions, and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the Agreement as a whole, in the interests of all in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In this context I am representing the Government in the current intensive talks in Belfast.  These talks have two objectives.  Firstly, to allow the political parties to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Executive.  Secondly, to address the implementation of outstanding issues from previous Agreements.  The discussions are structured around a shared approach put forward by both Governments following on from talks last month where it did not prove possible for the political parties in Northern Ireland to reach agreement on the establishment of a power-sharing Executive before the statutory deadline of 27 March.<\/p>  <p>  Overall there is encouraging progress being made in this renewed phase but I am under no illusions about the challenge of resolving the core issues that remain outstanding.

However with resolve and determination from all the parties, and support and encouragement from the two Governments, I believe a successful outcome is possible. <\/p>  <p>  As part of my engagement with the Secretary of State and with each of the parties in the discussions in recent weeks, I have strongly emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland's interests can be effectively represented, as part of the process of the EU-UK negotiations which are about to commence.  I very much hope that the necessary agreement between the parties will be reached on formation of the Executive as soon as possible, so that it can directly represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in these negotiations which are of major significance. <\/p>  <p>  As the formal talks pause briefly for Easter, I encourage everyone to maintain informal contacts and to reflect on what can be achieved if, in the weeks ahead, an Executive is established that operates effectively and sustainably.  I am convinced that all parties are willing to play their part in reaching such a sustainable agreement which will provide for stable power-sharing government in Northern Ireland underpinned by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government as a co-guarantor of that Agreement and the peace process will continue to play its part in facilitating these ongoing talks, working with the British Government and encouraging all parties to reach agreement on the formation of a new Executive that is demonstrably in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300056#WRJ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Undocumented Irish in the USA","counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300056#WRJ05600"},{"type":"question","counter":441,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[19086\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300056#WRJ05700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to have further discussions with the United States authorities on immigration reform, in view of the concerns of the undocumented Irish; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":442,"content":"<p>The Government and Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic representatives in the United States of America continue to actively monitor the situation of the undocumented Irish in the United States.

The nature of many of the reform initiatives set out in ambitious plans such as the Public Service Reform Plan and the Public Service ICT Strategy is that up-front investment is sometimes required to deliver service improvements and greater consolidation and efficiency across the Civil and Public Service in the medium and long term.  Therefore, this can involve my Department taking on additional costs, including capital costs, in the short-term.  <\/p>  <p>  The total capital allocation to my Department's Group of Votes, excluding OPW, under the Capital Plan 2016-21 was &euro;32 million.  In 2016, IT Capital Expenditure was &euro;2.3 million on my Department's Vote, &euro;9.4 million on the NSSO Vote and &euro;1.2 million on the OGP Vote.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) invests and develops IT infrastructure on behalf of my Department, the Department of Finance, the NSSO and the OGP.  However, its broader role is to leverage ICT to gain efficiencies and to improve the effectiveness of service delivery across the Civil and Public Service.  The OGCIO takes the lead on driving forward the implementation of the Public Service ICT Strategy, working with Departments and agencies across the Public Service.  Good progress is being made in the five strategic themes of the strategy which are: Build to Share; Digital First; Data as an Enabler; Improve Governance; and Increase Capability.  For instance, under the Build to Share pillar of the Strategy, the OGCIO continues to enhance the Government Network that has been in existence for many years.  In 2017, as a result of this investment, the Network will operate at higher speeds, providing high capacity services to the wider Public Service.  The enhanced network will support agencies in the roll-out of new applications, new ways of working and engaging with the citizen.  <\/p>  <p>  The NSSO continues to make significant progress in its task to generate efficiencies as well as to enhance the effectiveness of the public service support infrastructure.  The NSSO investment in IT continues to develop the systems infrastructure so that the benefits of the Government's Shared Services programme can be realised.  The key areas under the programme are the PeoplePoint Shared Service Centre (HR and Pensions Administration), Payroll Shared Service Centre and Financial Management Shared Services.  <\/p>  <p>  The OGP invests in its IT systems to deliver on its mandate to drive procurement savings to the State.  The OGP is continuing to invest in the eTenders platform to support national and EU procurement requirements.  In 2017, a Customer Relationship Management \/ Workflow Management System, is being implemented to support OGP's Customer Service function and sourcing activities of the OGP and its sector partners. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300058#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Expenditure","counter":480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300058#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[18881\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300058#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the OPW's flood relief works and plans in respect of the east Meath and Louth constituency; the cost of such works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":482,"content":"<p>I am advised that construction commenced on the Northlands Estate, Bettystown Flood Relief works in late October 2016 with an estimated construction cost of &euro;1.5m and will take an approximately 1 year to complete. <\/p>  <p>  In 2016, the OPW approved funding of &euro;511,200 under the Office of Public Works' (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection scheme to Meath County Council for projects at Ashbourne and Woodtown, Co Meath.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, works commenced on the flood relief scheme at Bellurgan, Co.

The fragmented procurement arrangements across the public service which existed prior to this facilitated amongst other things suppliers charging different public service bodies different prices for the same goods and services.  This was not sustainable, as the State could not afford to continue to purchase works, goods and services in a manner that undermined the efficient delivery of services.<\/p>  <p>  All public bodies are keenly aware of the importance of maximising the value for money achievable when procuring any commonly acquired goods or services.  The central procurement frameworks and contracts established by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) have been designed to optimise benefits to the public service through the strategic aggregation of its buying power.       <\/p>  <p>  Central procurement frameworks are targeted at securing best value for money and facilitating contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints. In this regard, public bodies are encouraged to use these frameworks arrangements. The benefits arising from these central procurement frameworks include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency; enhanced service levels and legal certainty.  It is Government policy, as set out in Circular 16\/2013, that public bodies, where possible, should make use of all such central arrangements.   Where public bodies choose not to utilise central procurement frameworks they should be in a position to provide a value for money justification.   It should also be noted that the OGP issued Circular 10\/2014 which contains initiatives aimed at facilitating SME access to public contracts. <\/p>  <p>  The State spends around &euro;12 billion on goods, works and services each year. This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the public service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement. Developing a strategic approach to public procurement means that the state can deliver much needed public service in a sustainable manner at a time when Exchequer resources are limited. <\/p>  <p>  While each procurement arrangement is different, each and every procurement competition must adhere to the rules and timelines prescribed in the relevant regulations. Notwithstanding this the professional service provided by the OGP enables the delivery of compliant arrangements within the most expeditious time frame possible.  In particular, availing of OGP Frameworks offers a shorter timeframe than running standalone competitions. In terms of delivery of the OGP's programme of work, the OGP Schedule of Frameworks and Contracts sets out the OGP's service delivery plan for Q4 2016 to Q3 2017 and provides details of when key contracts and frameworks will be available for use by public sector bodies.

Primary Care Centres (PCCs)  facilitate the shift from acute care towards primary care because of the range of multi-disciplinary services they can provide and the role they can play in keeping people who don't need to be in an acute setting out of hospital.  <\/p><p>During the period of the Government&rsquo;s <i>Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021,<\/i>as part of the &euro;3 billion for investment in Health infrastructure, additional primary care facilities will be provided across the country.  This will build on the 99 PCCs already operational, of which 56 were delivered since March 2011.  <\/p><p>The mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors.  All potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered-provided-available, to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff.  In addition, the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing.  Delivery of primary care infrastructure is constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation. <\/p><p>The latest information provided to me by the HSE is that there are currently 37 projects in construction or at advance planning stage under the three delivery methods - 14 through Public Private Partnership (PPP), 12 direct build by the HSE and 11 by way of operational leasing.  In addition, there are a further 47 at early planning stage, all by operational lease. In relation to the 14 PPP projects, the HSE will pay the PPP company a total annual unitary charge payment of circa &euro;17m, in monthly instalments.  At the end of the 25 year contract, the centres will be handed over to the HSE who will become responsible for the facility management services provided by the PPP company.<\/p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s 2017 National Service Plan (Appendix 4) details the projected construction, equipping completion and operational dates for 22 PCCs that are under construction and to be completed in 2017 or Quarter 1 2018.

The Strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and well being so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural and family life in their own communities for as long as possible, thereby representing a vision for an age-friendly society.  The Strategy highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and well-being of our ageing citizens.  <\/p><p>At the launch of the Strategy, a commitment was made to publish an Implementation Plan to facilitate the translation of the Goals and Objectives of the Strategy into action on the ground. The approach to implementation originally included in the Strategy would have worked where a finite number of discrete and concrete steps could be taken after which the implementation could be deemed complete.  However, many of the objectives included in this Strategy are quite broad, and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future, rather than concrete objectives that can be delivered in the short term.<\/p><p>The Department has therefore formulated new arrangements to implement and monitor the  implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  The revised arrangements were approved by the Cabinet  Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 27 October, 2016.<\/p><p>The new arrangements establish mechanisms that will give stakeholder groups effective and on-going access to Government Departments and  State Agencies relevant to older people.  This includes  an annual Forum for stakeholders to identify what they consider to be their key priorities for Government for the coming year and the next three years; and establishing clear channels of communications between stakeholders and relevant Government Departments.  In this regard, a named senior official will be assigned to engage with stakeholder representatives on  issues relevant to their remit, in order that the priorities identified  by the stakeholders at the Forum can be pursued.  <\/p><p>The inaugural stakeholder Forum took place on 30 March 2017, and was attended by civic society organisations who are representative of the needs and views of older people in Ireland.  Following on from this successful Forum, the Department of Health, as secretariat, will open a dialogue with each of the Government Departments identified as having responsibility for the priorities agreed by stakeholders, in order that they will be aware of the issues for discussion prior to being contacted by a stakeholder representative group.  The Department of Health will meet with this stakeholder representative group in late 2017 to establish progress made and assist with any issues arising.<\/p><p>As part of the NPAS implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative has been established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies to measure the impact of the Strategy and establish an ongoing system for measuring and reporting on Positive Ageing.  The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and well-being linked to the Goals and Objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy. This will be done primarily through the development of Positive Ageing indicators to be published every two years. The Initiative is intended to provide evidence of the factors contributing to positive ageing, including at local level and ultimately inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland. The first national Positive Ageing Indicators report was published in 2016 and highlights many of the positive and negative aspects of growing old in Ireland.<\/p><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy and the activities of the HaPAI are strongly embedded within the vision and actions set out for Healthy Ireland, the Government-led initiative which aims to create an Irish society where people of all ages can enjoy good physical and mental health<b>,<\/b>and where well-being<b>is <\/b>supported at every level of society. The Healthy Ireland Framework was launched in 2013 and seeks to provide people and communities with<b><\/b>accurate information on how to improve their health and well-being and to make the healthy choices easier choices. Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and well-being and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and a number of new structures have been put in place to ensure that all sectors of society are given opportunities to participate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300061#WRO02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":651,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300061#WRO03000"},{"type":"question","counter":652,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[18979\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300061#WRO03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to put the home care or home help scheme and the provision of home care packages on a statutory basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p>It is Government policy to promote care in the community for older people so that they can continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible. <\/p><p>The only statutory scheme in place at present to support older people is the Nursing Home Support Scheme, commonly known as the <i>&lsquo;A Fair Deal&rsquo;<\/i>.

The first roll-out concluded in 2014 having reached 477,423 school children and 3,127 schools, representing 95% of primary schools.\u00a0 Building on the success of the programme, a Food Dudes Boost Programme was piloted and introduced in late 2014. It has a stronger focus on the Junior Cycle (junior infants to second class) who enjoy a 16-day tasting period, while Senior students (third to sixth class) take part in an 8-day tasting period.  By the end of this school year, Food Dudes Boost will have been implemented in 2,209 schools and reached 357,533 children.  It is expected that the Boost roll-out will conclude in the 2017\/2018 school year, that is in under 4 years compared to 9 years for the original programme. <table><tr><th>Participants<\/th><th>Schools<\/th><th>Students<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2014\/2015<\/td><td>683<\/td><td>114,397<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015\/2016<\/td><td>701<\/td><td>113,136<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016\/2017   (to date)<\/td><td>836<\/td><td>129,204<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017\/2018   (targets)<\/td><td>825<\/td><td>125,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>My Department and Bord Bia are currently considering the design of a further Food Dudes model, which will have a starting date in the 2018\/19 school year. It is envisaged that this will again focus particularly on Junior and Senior Infant classes, as early interventions have been found to have the greatest impact.\u00a0 It will also include measures to sustain the increases in consumption of fruit and vegetables achieved to date. A new EU framework, which will take effect from 1 August 2017 provides for some increase in funding.<\/p><p>Food Dudes has been evaluated several times. Each evaluation has shown increased fruit and vegetable consumption in the target group. An evaluation by UCD in 2011 showed that fruit consumption increased by 20% (from 58.5% to 78.5%) and vegetable consumption by 42% (from 11.5% to 53.5%).  The most recent evaluation was carried out by UCD in 2016 and comprised 3 studies - a longitudinal study which revisited children who had participated in an evaluation 6 years previously, a second study focused on Senior Cycle students and a third study focused on Junior Cycle students.  The longitudinal study was the first of its kind in Ireland.\u00a0 It showed that this particular group of children was consuming 13% more fruit and 6% more vegetables in 2016 than before they took part in the Food Dudes intervention in 2010. The second study (Senior Cycle) and third study (Junior Cycle) both showed that fruit and vegetables consumption increased following the Food Dudes intervention.  The programme was found to be most effective amongst the Junior Cycle, especially in the case of vegetables, where there was more than a fourfold increase in quantities brought in to school and consumed in school after the intervention. <\/p><p>Ireland is regarded as a leader in successful implementation of the EU School Fruit and Vegetables Scheme through the choice of the Food Dudes model, which is backed up by strong scientific evidence.  The EU has suggested Ireland as a good source of advice to a number of Member States, most recently, Finland who visited Ireland before Christmas to see Food Dudes Boost first hand.  Since that visit, Finland has made its first application for EU funding to implement a School Fruit and Vegetables Scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300062#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Development Programme Funding","counter":691,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300062#WRP01400"},{"type":"question","counter":692,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[18756\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300062#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the &euro;217 million allocated under the capital plan to 2016 for rural development, seafood development and forestry programmes has been spent; the progress made to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":693,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out below:<\/p><p>The  &euro;217 million capital allocated in 2016 to my Department referred to by the Deputy was increased to &euro;229m when the &euro;12m capital carried into 2017 from 2016 is taken into account.

These approvals under Tranches 1 to 5  allow farmers a three year window in which to complete their investment works and make a claim.  The 2016 outturn of &euro;7.8 million against the budget of &euro;35.8 million includes payments for only 309 TAMS II grants as well as  residual payments under the previous TAMS I schemes.  This clearly  indicates that many approval holders choose to delay activating those approvals in 2016 but I expect there will be far greater activity in 2017.  Furthermore for future tranches the validity period of the approvals has been reduced.<\/p><p>- Forestry &ndash; The new afforestation target of 6,500ha was achieved in 2016 but there was a lower than expected drawdown of premia payments for existing forestry for a number of reasons including where forest owners do not apply for their premia, possibly to allow  premia to build up to be claimed at some future date, or non-payment of premiums because of poor forest maintenance.

This means that we are committed to making energy savings of 31,950 gigawatt hours (GWh) by 2020. Our progress to date has seen a 12% improvement resulting from\u00a0investment under the Capital Plan\u00a0across the residential (which includes action to combat energy poverty), commercial and public sectors.  The amount of funding provided under the capital plan for energy efficiency measures in 2017 is &euro;82m.  This is an increase of &euro;20m on the &euro;62m allocated in 2016, which,\u00a0when combined with allocations for renewable energy, brings the total allocation under the Capital Plan for sustainable energy to almost &euro;100m in 2017.  This investment\u00a0will result in the saving of over 116,000 tonnes in carbon emissions,\u00a0reducing our overall dependence on imported fossil fuels and supporting around 3,000 jobs.  The following gives an overview of recent outputs in the sectors highlighted by the Deputy and the amount of funding allocated to them in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016 25,063 domestic buildings were covered by energy efficiency measures, including 7,786 low-income homes, where people are living in, or at risk of energy poverty.  This represented a full spend of the 2016 allocation to the Better Energy Programmes and also meant that 316 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy were saved as well as 78.5 kilotonnes equivalent of CO2 being avoided. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017 I have increased funding\u00a0for the residential sector, bringing the Better Energy Programme to &euro;74m.  This includes\u00a0&euro;8m for the expanded Warmth and Wellbeing energy efficiency and health pilot programme, a flagship project under the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty, and a further &euro;5m to a deep retrofit pilot programme, which will bring participating homes as close as possible to the Nearly Zero Energy Building standard. <\/p>  <p>  The supports for energy efficiency in the commercial sector\u00a0focus on providing enabling supports through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  Their commercial programmes comprise the Large Industry Energy Network (LIEN) and the SME support programme. \u00a0LIEN is a voluntary grouping of over 190 of Ireland&rsquo;s largest energy users which\u00a0SEAI supports to\u00a0share and achieve\u00a0best practice in energy management. \u00a0SEAI estimate that a potential energy spend of approximately &euro;25m was avoided by the LIEN\u00a0in 2015.\u00a0 For smaller enterprises the current focus\u00a0is on training and best practice supports. \u00a0SEAI has engaged with over 3,000 SMEs, providing strategic support, training funding, and advice for energy projects.\u00a0&euro;3.5m is allocated for\u00a0this sector in 2017.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The SEAI&rsquo;s most recent Annual Report on Public Sector Energy Efficiency Performance\u00a0shows that by end 2015\u00a0public sector bodies had achieved a 21% improvement in energy efficiency against a 2009 baseline with cumulative savings on energy spend to the end of 2015 of &euro;619million.\u00a0 To build on this progress, and drive the further effort required to meet the 33% target for improved energy efficiency assigned to the sector, I published the first Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy earlier this year. \u00a0I\u00a0have allocated further funding in 2017 in support of the Strategy\u00a0focusing on\u00a0&euro;5m\u00a0for two partnership programmes between the SEAI\u00a0and the OPW, and Department of Education and Skills, to fund replicable, pathfinder deep renovation projects in the central government property portfolio and in schools.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300064#WRR03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Projects","counter":829,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300064#WRR03500"},{"type":"question","counter":830,"qnumday":324,"qnumall":"[18791\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300064#WRR03600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the amount of funding provided under the capital plan for the renewable heat initiative; the amount spent to date; the progress made to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":831,"content":"<p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is a\u00a0commitment in the White Paper on Energy and the 2016 Programme for Government and will be the primary support mechanism in the heating sector designed to meet Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy obligations.

The new scheme design requires detailed economic analysis on the viability and cost effectiveness of supporting several renewable technologies, at various scales.  The Programme for Government recognises the importance of community participation in renewable energy projects in both the national and local interest.  This builds on the 2015 Energy White Paper commitment to widen the opportunity for community and citizen participation in renewable energy projects.  With this in mind, the development of the new RESS also includes an assessment of models for community participation in renewable energy projects. <\/p><p>  This work has identified many challenges facing community participation in renewable energy projects, including financial, technical, legal, infrastructural (including grid access) and institutional barriers, and appropriate policy measures to address these challenges are now currently being assessed.

My long-standing position on the gas network is that\u00a0it should be developed generally in rural Ireland to provide natural gas to as many areas as possible.  Accordingly, and against the backdrop of the energy policy White Paper, my Department is preparing to commission research and to have a report by year-end\u00a0into the potential role that natural gas could play in\u00a0supporting rural centres.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, I am interested in whether ways can be identified\u00a0to facilitate additional connections to the network contributing to rural development, without additional costs for all gas consumers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300065#WRS03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Services Provision","counter":882,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300065#WRS03100"},{"type":"question","counter":883,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[19136\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300065#WRS03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the measures the mobile phone and broadband taskforce identified to improve broadband connectivity in the amber areas in the short term (details supplied); the way in which residents of these areas can avail of these measures to improve their access to broadband; if there are options to avail of the reduced rate broadband services over the 4G mobile phone network, while they continue to wait for the national broadband plans or schemes to deliver same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":884,"content":"<p>The provision of telecommunications services, including mobile phone and\u00a0broadband services, is a matter for the service providers concerned which operate in a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent Regulator of the telecommunications sector, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).<\/p><p>I\u00a0am, however,\u00a0critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, including in the AMBER Intervention Area targeted by the National Broadband Plan State intervention, where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  Recognising this frustration, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with\u00a0Minister Humphreys to\u00a0identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate\u00a0how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the NBP State intervention.  The\u00a0report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites.\u00a0<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities,\u00a0ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.  The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum, I, together with my colleague Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group, which met for the first time on 8 March.  This group is driving and monitoring the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on\u00a0progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys. I am expecting the first such quarterly report in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>The benefits that the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report will bring will be felt across Ireland, including in the AMBER NBP Intervention Area.<\/p><p>In addition to the Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force, other initiatives are underway to enhance services across the State.  I have\u00a0signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will\u00a0provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.\u00a0<\/p><p>  In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate\u00a0this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  In terms of commercial investment, mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  However, as mobile services are a radio based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets and\u00a0the capacity of the network, as well as by\u00a0and proximity to mobile telephone antennas. <\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland and including in the AMBER Intervention Area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300065#WRS03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Information and Communications Technology","counter":885,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300065#WRS03400"},{"type":"question","counter":886,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[19285\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300065#WRS03500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the amount of funding provided under the capital plan for the information technology infrastructure across his department; the amount spent to date; the progress to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":887,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s Capital Investment Plan (2016 &ndash; 2021) includes an initial provision of &euro;275m for the National Broadband Plan (NBP).\u00a0\u00a0This represents an initial stimulus for the first five years of the NBP intervention,\u00a0with remaining payments being spread over the full 25 years of the contract.\u00a0 The amounts required by bidders will only be known after bidders provide their initial estimates of cost and subsidy requirements.\u00a0Total spend\u00a0to-date on the NBP under this Plan is just over &euro;5m.\u00a0<\/p><p>A\u00a0formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will rollout a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention area.

For example, parents availing of full-time childcare who currently have their childcare costs subsidised by &euro;95 per week will see their subvention rate rise to &euro;145 per week.

Air Traffic Control training is taking place and options to ensure the longer-term sustainability of Air Traffic Control services in Baldonnel are being identified and a mentor is also now in place to aid the newly appointed ATC Squadron Commander in Baldonnel.  These measures will facilitate a gradual extension of operational hours for air traffic control services in Baldonnel over the year, beginning this May, as newly qualified personnel develop their experience.<\/p><p>The Air Corps continues to provide a broad range of services on a daily basis for a diverse range of tasks such as Army and Naval Service support, the Emergency Aero - medical Service, maritime patrols and fishery protection, the Ministerial Air Transport Service, inter-hospital transfers and Aid to the Civil Power duties including the Garda Air Support Unit and cash escorts.<\/p><p>The level of availability of Air Corps aircraft for such tasks has reduced. This reduction is not due to cuts in personnel but largely because the Air Corps has experienced retirements of highly experienced personnel.  These retirements are outstripping the recruitment and training of replacement personnel.  The loss of experienced personnel is driven by a range of factors, including the availability of attractive job opportunities in the private and commercial semi-state sectors. <\/p><p>I want to assure the Deputy that, while there has been this loss of experienced personnel, there is significant work underway in the Defence Organisation ( civil and military)aimed at improving the capacity of the Air Corps.

The fourth ship is scheduled for delivery in mid 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements. <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper provides that the Air Corps will see the Cessna fleet replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks.  The aircraft specification is currently being prepared, and it is expected that the tender competition will be initiated and advertised on the e-tenders website in the near future.  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of two CASA 235s Maritime Patrol Aircraft by 2019, with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft. This would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. <\/p>  <p>  Also, a decision was made in 2016 to replace a PC-9M aircraft which was written off following a fatal crash in 2009.  The replacement PC-9M aircraft, scheduled for delivery this year from Pilatus Aircraft in Switzerland at a cost of &euro;5m plus VAT, will bring the fleet up to 8 and will assist in a required increase in pilot training in the Air Corps.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will continue to ensure that the Defence Forces is suitably equipped, in line with international best practice, to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300068#WRV04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"White Paper on Defence","counter":1054,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300068#WRV04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1055,"qnumday":408,"qnumall":"[18875\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041300068#WRV04800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the status of progress made towards an institute for peace support and leadership training to focus on international education in the field of peacekeeping and conflict resolution.","asker":"1305","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":1056,"content":"<p>The White Paper on Defence included a commitment to evaluating the potential development of a new Institute for Peace Support and Leadership Training at the Defence Forces Training Centre in The Curragh.
