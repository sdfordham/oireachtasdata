Portlaoise Hospital has developed a Winter Capacity Plan to assist in managing the demand for services over the winter period.

The report did not make a recommendation on increasing the number of genetic counsellors but rather that there is appropriate access to pre-conception genetic testing and counselling and that National Centres of Expertise be identified in accordance with European Union criteria for the care of patients with rare diseases. <\/p>  <p>  One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases. This programme was to be responsible, over time and among other functions, to assist with developing care pathways for rare diseases and facilitating timely access to centres of expertise.<\/p>  <p>  In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established in 2013 under the National Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division of the HSE. The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. This clinical programme is a channel for assisting with the advancement of a number of other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases; and in this vein, the programme designed a framework for the designation of Irish Centres of Expertise in cooperation with HSE Acute Hospitals Division in line with the recommendations stipulated in the national plan.<\/p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health encouraged designated Centres of Expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases in line with the national plan. ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients. Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patients' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work. <\/p>  <p>  Hence, the recommendations in the national plan that relate to empowering and protecting patients and carers, including treatment will be fulfilled in part through this process. It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU. <\/p>  <p>  With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases, Acute Hospital Divisions in the HSE and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated in June this year during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks. Three of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs. It is anticipated that the National Centre for Medical Genetics will have a role in these European Reference Networks in due course.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan. The national office was established by the HSE in June 2015. Its work is currently led by the NCPRD Clinical Lead, supported by an Information Scientist, part-time Administrative Officer, part-time Genetic Counsellor and by a 0.2FTE Consultant Geneticist. It is, among other functions, providing up-to-date information regarding new treatment and management options, including clinical trials. In addition, the post of Information Scientist for the office is being funded jointly by the HSE and the EU Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Palliative Care Services","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA04950"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[37961\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the refusal to grant funding for the redevelopment of the palliative care unit in Our Lady's Hospice and Care Unit in Harold's Cross, Dublin 6; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA05150"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[37777\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the struggles faced by persons suffering from the rare metabolic condition phenylketonuria, PKU, in accessing suitable very low protein food and protein substitute food products; his plans to address this issue and improve the range of such products available to persons on the long-term illness card list and generally available here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of products under the community drug schemes, including the LTI Scheme, in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA05350"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[37946\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures he is taking to address the deficits in the legislative powers given to the HSE in the 2007 Health Act in protecting vulnerable adults in different settings as outlined by the chief executive of HIQA recently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>A National Safeguarding Committee was established in December 2015 with the overarching remit to support the development of a societal and organisational culture which promotes the rights of persons who may be vulnerable and safeguard them from abuse.

At 42.3 it states that when prescribing medications, doctors must comply with Misuse of Drugs legislation and other relevant regulations and\/or guidelines. Whilst at 42.7 the Guide advises that doctors must be aware of the dangers of drug dependency when prescribing benzodiazepines, opiates and other drugs with addictive potential.<\/p>  <p>  In 2013 the Irish College of General Practitioners published guidance for its members on diagnosing and managing mental health difficulties in children and adolescents.  In June of this year the Early Warning Emerging Trends (EWET) subcommittee of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol, with the agreement of my Department, wrote to health care professionals highlighting the need for vigilance when prescribing and dispensing pregabalin and gabapentin, as these drugs present a risk of addiction and a potential for illegal diversion and misuse. Prescribers were advised to always undertake a risk benefit assessment prior to prescribing either of these medicines for patients under their care.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to benzodiazepines there are prescribing guidelines in place at national level for both general practitioners (GPs) and psychiatrists. The Good Prescribing Practice for Clinicians guidelines were published in 2002 to guide GPs about prescribing benzodiazepines. Standards of practice should ensure short term use of benzodiazepines, using the lowest dose possible and, where their use has been for longer than four weeks, clear evidence of education on reducing with a view to discontinuing. If this is not possible there should be clear documentation on reasons for continuing the prescription.<\/p>  <p>  The College of Psychiatry issued a Consensus Statement on the Use of Benzodiazepines in Specialist Mental Health Services in 2012. The College recommends that members who prescribe benzodiazepines should follow good practice guidelines for their use. This includes conducting regular audit of practice.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has written to all GPs outlining their levels of benzodiazepine and other hypnotics prescribing on the GMS scheme in an initiative to encourage better quality prescribing of these drugs. This was in line with a recommendation from my Department&rsquo;s 2002 Report of the Benzodiazepine Committee.  GPs received individualised and confidential reports every three months. The reports, compiled from PCRS data on the number of benzodiazepine and hypnotics prescriptions dispensed by pharmacists, allowed GPs to see exactly how many times they have prescribed these drugs in the preceding months.  Most benzodiazepines and the so-called &ldquo;z-drug&rdquo; zolpidem are already controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. Regulations and Orders made under the Misuse of Drugs Acts specify the level of control which apply to these substances.<\/p>  <p>  The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2016 was passed by the Oireachtas in July. Stricter controls will apply to certain psychotropic drugs including phenazepam, lisdexamphetamine, zopiclone and zaleplon. Controlling these substances in the Act was part one of a two-step process. The Act provides for the revocation and remaking of various Regulations and Orders which had been confirmed by the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Work on drafting various new Regulations and Orders is complex and technical in nature but is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. Among other things, these new Regulations will introduce stricter prescribing and dispensing rules on a number of psychotropic drugs including benzodiazepines and z drugs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Beds Data","counter":82,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA05750"},{"type":"question","counter":83,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[37864\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA05800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the number of available inpatient beds has reduced from 12,051 in 2006 to 10,473 in 2015 and 10,629 in 2016 to date; the number of psychiatry and long-term care beds that have been excluded since 2006 to show only acute beds in the 2015 and 2016 figures; the factors that determine the reason an inpatient bed in 2006 is no longer available in 2015 and 2016; if the physical infrastructure still exists for these beds; if so, the details of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1303","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":84,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA05950"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[37863\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100068#WRA06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to the budget announcement of additional funding being made to the NTPF, the evaluation mechanisms that are in place to ensure value for money in terms of the spend; the evaluation mechanisms that are in place to ensure satisfactory outcomes and number of treatments in accordance with the funding allocation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1303","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>Budget 2017 provides for the treatment of our longest waiting patients. &euro;20m is being allocated to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55m in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of this allocation the NTPF recently issued a Prior Information Notice stating that commissioning will recommence and they will be engaging with suppliers through competitive dialogue on the required optimum approach for future outsourcing of public patients.

Since then, approximately 6,500 patients have been removed from the waiting list nationally. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding outpatient waiting lists in particular, the HSE recently launched the Strategy for the design of Integrated Outpatient Services 2016-2020.  It seeks to improve waiting times for outpatient services by enhancing patient referral pathways and utilising technology to enable better planning.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provides for the treatment of our longest-waiting patients. &euro;20m is being allocated to the NTPF in 2017, rising to &euro;55m in 2018. Planning of these initiatives is currently being finalised. I will shortly be asking the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2017, working collaboratively with the NTPF, to address inpatient, daycase and also outpatient waiting times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100069#WRB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100069#WRB03000"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[37963\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100069#WRB03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Question No. 453 of 5 July 2016, if home help will be provided as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

I have not been in contact with the three survivor groups, as the work of the Scheme has now concluded. <\/p>  <p>    The total cost of the Scheme was just under &euro;34 million and payments of &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000 were made to 399 women, who met the criteria for an award.  All of the women have received their respective payments totalling &euro;29.85 million.  The majority of claimants were over 75 years and payments were made to women between the ages of 51 and 96 years.  185 women who applied to the Scheme could not establish that they had a surgical symphysiotomy.  Pubiotomy was frequently claimed but was established in only 1 case.  Significant disability was established in this case.<\/p>  <p>  As the Scheme was designed to be simple, straight forward and non-adversarial, the women were not expected to give oral testimonies as they might do in a court setting.  In the interests of accountability, the Scheme required each applicant to prove that she had a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in order to be considered for the assessment of an award.  The level of proof required was clearly set out in the terms of the Scheme.  The Judge worked with each woman or her legal representative to locate medical records.  The Judge met some women in different parts of the country where she considered this was necessary.  Where claims could not be reconciled with established facts, women were examined by relevant medical experts.  <\/p>  <p>  Judge Clark encouraged women who believed they had a symphysiotomy to apply to the Scheme, advising them that they did not give up their right to pursue their case through the courts.  It was only on accepting an award under the Scheme that a woman had to discontinue her legal proceedings.  The vast majority of women opted to do so. <\/p>  <p>  The brief given to Judge Clark in November 2014 was not an easy one.  At that time the advice to the Department of Health was that many women would face an uphill struggle in proving their claims in the courts, with an uncertain outcome, as each case would be adjudicated on its merits.  In her substantial Report Judge Clark has provided a comprehensive overview of the historical and medical context of symphysiotomy.

Healthy Ireland takes a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to improving health and well-being and the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and provides an overarching approach to addressing health inequalities among Travellers.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s first National Maternity Strategy - Creating a Better Future Together 2016 - 2026 which sets out the vision for the future of Ireland&rsquo;s maternity services.  The Strategy states that the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme will ensure that additional supports are provided to pregnant women from vulnerable, disadvantaged groups or ethnic minorities, and take account of the family's determinants of health.  <\/p>  <p>  In the context of these policy frameworks, the HSE addresses the health needs of Travellers by providing some traveller specific health services, largely in primary care, in order to link Travellers to mainstream services.  To this end, the Traveller Primary Health Units (THUs) have been set up throughout the country to provide primary health care to Travellers in a culturally appropriate service model which comprises a partnership of health professionals - G.P.s, dedicated Nurse Specialists and Public Health Nurses - and traveller link workers. <\/p>  <p>  The THUs teams have adopted a preventative\/well-being model that promotes better health by linking infants and women to preventative public health and screening programmes.  Improvements have been achieved in the rate of immunisation amongst traveller infants and increased presentation for developmental checks. Preventative programmes addressing cause specific issues for respiratory illness and other chronic conditions such as cardiovascular illness and Type 2 Diabetes are ongoing.  As respiratory illness is the single most common presenting illness amongst Traveller infants, health promotion education and awareness programmes, through the THUs, play an important role in addressing the lifestyle factors such as smoking that contribute to infant mortality. <\/p>  <p>  The THUs also provide advice on family planning and on pre and post natal care aimed at producing better health outcomes for mothers and infants.  The All Ireland Traveller Health Study found that the interval between births to mothers in the Travelling Community to be much shorter than that within the general population.  With the increase in contraceptive usage and breast feeding, which is being promoted by the THU's, the interval between births is expected to widen with the resultant beneficial impact on maternal health at birth and, consequently, on infant health and weight at birth.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Justice and Equality plays an important leadership role in developing a concerted response to Traveller needs, including health needs.  That Department is leading on the development of a new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy.  The Strategy aims to provide a set of specific actions that need to be taken to improve the situation for Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  It is envisaged that the Strategy will include agreed actions in relation to improving the health of travellers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100070#WRC02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabilities Assessments","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100070#WRC02650"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[37966\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100070#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number and cost of assessments of needs under the Disability Act 2005, between 2011 and 2015, that were contracted out to therapists in private practice and or carried out by agency staff; the reason HSE employed staff are not being used; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>In order to supplement the current service provided by the HSE and to reduce waiting times the HSE have contracted private therapists and agency staff to provide a service in identified areas.

It seeks to improve waiting times for outpatient services by enhancing patient referral pathways and utilising technology to enable better planning.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provides for the treatment of our longest-waiting patients.  &euro;20m is being allocated to the NTPF in 2017, rising to &euro;55m in 2018.  Planning of these initiatives is currently being finalised.  I will shortly be asking the HSE to develop a Waiting List Action Plan for 2017, working collaboratively with the NTPF, to address inpatient, day case and also outpatient waiting times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100071#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Staff","counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100071#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":190,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[38062\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100071#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the targets that will be in the 2017 HSE service plan for child and adolescent mental health service teams staff levels in CHO 5 next year to bring them closer to the target set in A Vision for Change; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":191,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100071#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Prices","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100071#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[37867\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100071#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the HSE negotiations with the pharmaceutical company responsible for the production of the cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, in respect of the effort to secure significant price reductions for the drug; when the process is due to conclude; if the pilot will continue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1330","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi.

The GP contracts review process will, inter alia, seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100072#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Departments","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100072#WRE02400"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[37993\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100072#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to alleviate the overcrowding crisis at Cork University Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1281","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>Trolley numbers nationally have been high in November due to increased ED attendances, greater incidence of infection in several hospitals and a high rate of elective activity in hospitals to address waiting lists.  <\/p>  <p>  It is unacceptable that patients wait on trolleys for long periods especially elderly and vulnerable patients.

The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.  NIAC recommended that the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  It is estimated that HPV vaccination will eventually save 60 lives annually in this country.<\/p>  <p>  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide.  In Ireland over 580,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  Negative publicity and misinformation is affecting the uptake of the vaccine.  We must ensure that people understand that the vaccine is safe and can save lives. <\/p>  <p>  Since early this year The HSE are working with other stakeholders to counteract negative publicity and misinformation about the vaccine.  The Irish Cancer Society held two public meetings in Galway and Cork.  These are two areas where uptake rates of the vaccine had reduced significantly.  These meetings included talks by renowned international HPV cancer expert, Professor Margaret Stanley, cervical cancer survivors and hospital consultants.<\/p>  <p>  The parents of girls in first year of second level school have been given a revised information leaflet, consent form and contact phone numbers for their local immunisation office.

In addition girls, who may have declined the first dose of vaccine, will get an opportunity to receive this when the school immunisation team revisits the school.<\/p>  <p>  Information about the vaccine and its benefits has been circulated to all school principals, management bodies, National Parents Councils and GPs.  The HSE have also met with the Department of Education and school management bodies.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, prior to the start of the 2016\/2017 school immunisation programme there was a coordinated local and national media campaign involving the Irish Cancer Society, HSE Communications and the National Cancer Screening Programmes.

This group was established by the Department of Health in 2015 and it has met on a number of occasions. <\/p>  <p>  One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases.  This programme was to be responsible, over time and among other functions, to assist with mapping and  developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise &ndash; nationally and internationally; in developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established in 2013 under the National Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division of the HSE.  The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  This clinical programme is a channel for assisting with the advancement of a number of other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases; and in this vein, the programme designed a framework for the designation of Irish Centres of Expertise in cooperation with HSE Acute Hospitals Division in line with the recommendations stipulated in the national plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Rare Diseases National Plan also recommended that &lsquo;the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases through a National Office for Rare Diseases develop the clinical and organisational governance framework that would underpin care pathways and access to treatment for rare disease patients, particularly in the context of transition from paediatrics to adult care'.<\/p>  <p>  As such the National Clinical Programme has developed a draft transition model of care which will be entering a consultation stage very shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health encouraged designated Centres of Expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases in line with the national plan. ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients.  Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patients' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work.<\/p>  <p>  Hence, the recommendations in the national plan that related to empowering and protecting patients and carers, and research on rare diseases will be fulfilled in part through this process.  It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU.<\/p>  <p>  With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases, Acute Hospital Divisions in the HSE and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated in June this year during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks.  Three of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014, the Minister for Health announced &euro;850,000 for investment into charity-led research priorities, which particularly benefits rare disease research.  Five charities were to provide matching funding bringing the total investment to &euro;1.9 million.  They were to share &euro;850,000 in State funding to take part in international research into rare medical conditions.  In 2016, the next cohort of projects was funded by the State with &euro;1.686 million, matched by charity funding of &euro;1.224 million.  The total funding of &euro;2.91 million is shared between 14 charities.  The next round of this joint funding initiative will open in 2017. The EU commission now intends to explore the possibility to further strengthen the collaboration between member states and the Commission in the area of research on rare diseases.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan.  The national office was established by the HSE in June 2015.  Its work is currently led by the NCPRD Clinical Lead, supported by an Information Scientist, part-time Administrative Officer, part-time Genetic Counsellor and by a 0.2 FTE Consultant Geneticist.  It is, among other functions, providing up-to-date information regarding new treatment and management options, including clinical trials. In addition, the post of Information Scientist for the office is being funded jointly by the HSE and the EU Commission.<\/p>  <p>  The NRDO has already performed a preliminary situation analysis of the existing rare disease registries and is in the process of assigning these known registries on our national Orphanet site, which is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU. The EU Commission has started the development of a European Platform on Rare Diseases Registration.  Its principal goal is to enable sharing and use of rare diseases patient data across Europe, among the multitude of existing patient registries, within and across rare diseases. <\/p>  <p>  A number of recommendations about access to appropriate drugs and technologies were contained in the plan.  One chief recommendation in this regard refers to the HSE developing a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies; and that the approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The HSE has advised my Department that its Acute Hospitals Division is developing the terms of reference, required membership and reporting relationship for this committee which will parallel the National Cancer Control Programme Technology Review Committee.<\/p>  <p>  This Committee will also be supported by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases Clinical Advisory Group.  The national plan for Rare Diseases recommended that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health &amp;amp; Patient Safety Bill be published.  The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  It is now being implemented by the HSE.  A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the Government in November 2015 and published on the Department's website. <\/p>  <p>  Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals.  The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, rare diseases have already been tabled on the agenda for North-South meetings.  Therefore, future work to deepen cooperation between both jurisdictions on rare diseases is anticipated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100073#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Departments","counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100073#WRF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[38053\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100073#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reasons for the substantial increase in emergency department overcrowding in St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital over the past two years.","asker":"1296","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p>Trolley numbers nationally have been high in November due to increased ED attendances, greater incidence of infection in several hospitals and a high rate of elective activity in hospitals to address waiting lists.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. <\/p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out below in tabular form the allocation of Community Garda&iacute; by Division as of 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available from the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>The Commissioner has advised that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises. In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.

The implementation of flood risk policy must address solutions for both properties assessed through the CFRAM Programme and for other at risk properties.  Each category will involve both structural and non-structural solutions.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the area of Riverview Estate, Tower, Blarney, Co Cork, it was identified as an area for\u00a0further assessment in the South Western CFRAM Programme.  It was initially assessed as part of the Lee CFRAM Study, the outputs of which have been incorporated into the draft Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMP) for the South Western CFRAM.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the public consultation on the draft flood risk management plans for the South Western CFRAM Study, including \u00a0the further assessment of Tower finished on 23 September, 2016.

Where the number of shares issued is based on and dependent on the level of business between the members and the cooperative or nominated purchaser and where the cooperative does not receive the market price for the shares issued, then the profit accruing i.e. the difference between the market value of the shares issued and the price paid for these shares, to the member is a trading receipt of the member's farming income and accordingly chargeable to income tax.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Capital Gains Tax (CGT) applies to the growth in the value of a capital asset.  For example, if an individual sells a share that grew in value after it was acquired, CGT would apply, subject to the availability of any exemption, on the increase in value.\u00a0 The matter at issue in the particular case, however, is the initial value of the shares received by farmers as a result of their trading relationship either with the co-op or the nominated purchaser.  The shares were a form of payment received for the milk supplied by the farmers and therefore, in the view of Revenue, the value of the shares forms part of the trading income for the relevant years.  It is this value which forms the base cost for CGT in relation to any subsequent disposal.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that the letter which issued to farmers was in the first instance\u00a0an enquiry as to whether the value of the shares received was included in the accounts for the years in question.

The bank understands that\u00a0this type of split can be necessary\u00a0in such mixed use lending cases, to meet the different regulatory obligations arising under the Mortgage Credit Regulations 2016, SME Lending Regulations 2015 and the Consumer Lending\/arrears regulation (CPC, CCMA).<\/p>  <p>  Permanent TSB has advised me that the bank offers business loans to both new and established small business enterprises to fund trading activities, and that the loans may be secured or unsecured.

Following the conclusion of the first macro prudential review, the Central Bank decided to refine the rules to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of the current framework.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst the Central Bank is independent in terms of macro prudential policy, the decision to adjust the regulations is welcome.  In particular the change to the ceiling on the loan to value (LTV) ratio for all first time buyers (FTB), should better support first-time buyers in accessing the required mortgage to buy a home.  Changes to the rules should also support increased construction and transaction activity and help to alleviate some of the pent-up demand in the rental market.

Under the legislation, the payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.<\/p>  <p>  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it must be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members.

Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period. This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.<\/p><p>A landlord may not terminate a Part 4 tenancy except in very clearly defined circumstances such as a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations in relation to the tenancy.  Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by the landlord vary depending on the duration of the tenancy but periods of up to 224 days are provided for under the Act.

Specifically, this linking rule provides that any two such periods of unemployment not separated by more than 26 weeks are treated as one such period.  Consequently, where a person makes a repeat claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit within 26 weeks of their previous claim, the repeat claim links to the earlier claim and no waiting days apply.  <\/p><p>I would emphasise that people who need financial support are not left without such support during &lsquo;waiting&rsquo; days.

The 2016 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;2.8 billion. <\/p><p>Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is a social assistance means tested payment.  Jobseeker's benefit is a social insurance benefit.  Social insurance benefits are not means tested payments but rather payments which are covered by pay related contributions.  Jobseeker's benefit is paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid. It is paid for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.<\/p><p>Since the extension of full social insurance cover to part-time workers from April 1991, a range of measures were introduced to the short-term illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit schemes in order to ensure that disincentives to employment were not created.  In the absence of these measures, a situation would exist whereby many workers on low incomes would have access to weekly social welfare payments in excess of their income from employment.  For instance, while someone earning &euro;31.17 a week or more would have been liable for PRSI Class A contributions, the maximum personal rate of illness and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in January 1993 was &euro;70.60 a week, i.e. the social welfare benefits available could have been more than twice the level of income from employment for some people.<\/p><p>To overcome the potential disincentives involved, new arrangements were introduced from January 1993 to relate the rate of benefit payable to the level of the claimant&rsquo;s earnings.  These measures were regularly updated to keep pace with changes in benefit levels. <\/p><p>Jobseeker's Benefit rates are graduated according to an applicant&rsquo;s earnings in the relevant tax year and reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit are payable where the average reckonable weekly earnings are less than the prescribed amount.  Under the current arrangements jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit recipients with earnings of less than &euro;300 per week in the relevant tax year &ndash; for claims in 2016, the relevant tax year is 2014 &ndash; get a personal rate ranging from &euro;84.50 to &euro;147.30, and reduced rates for qualified adults may also apply.

The insurance companies operate as commercial providers and as Minister for Health, I have no legal power to intervene in relation to any insurer&rsquo;s pricing strategies.<\/p><p>A community-rated health insurance market depends on inter-generational solidarity and requires a constant influx of young and healthy members to support the older, less healthy members. Lifetime Community Rating and &quot;Young Adult&quot; rates of premium were introduced last year to encourage young people into the market. Following on from their introduction, the number of people now holding private health insurance is 2.14 million, or 46% of the Irish population, which includes an increase of over 104,000 from January 2015 to January 2016. This upward trend has continued in 2016 when the market grew by a further 17,000 to end-September.

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependents.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they may face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  <\/p>  <p>  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  It is clear greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 113,200 as of 1st November this year.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I have recently received permission from Government for my Department to prepare the Heads and General Scheme of a Bill to give children in receipt of DCA automatic entitlement to a medical card.

As part of this process the manufacturer must submit the price at which it is seeking reimbursement for its product.  Under Clause 6.2.1 of the Framework Agreement the maximum supplier proposed price shall be no greater than the average of the currency-adjusted relevant price (being the ex- factory price or equivalent thereof and using the applicable Exchange Rate) applicable in such of the Nominated States in which the Medicine is available on the date of application.

Given that up to 43% of our agri-food products were exported to the UK in 2015, their decision to leave the EU reinforces the need for Ireland to continue to diversify and seek growth opportunities into other markets in order to minimise our dependence on any one market. \u00a0Indeed this principle of market development\u00a0is\u00a0already a key component of Food Wise. \u00a0We have been very active in recent years in\u00a0efforts to diversify\u00a0markets,\u00a0and in\u00a0aiming to\u00a0respond to consumer demands in emerging markets.<\/p>  <p>  In September, I led a very successful trade mission to China and Singapore, while my colleague, Minister of State Andrew Doyle led a Trade Mission to Vietnam and South Korea. I believe that these activities will prove very valuable in developing the rapidly growing Asian markets as important export destinations for the Irish agri-food sector. I also led a trade mission to Morocco and Algeria earlier this month.  These trade visits will continue to play a key role in our efforts to provide as many markets as possible for Irish agri-food products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100086#WRT03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry Expenditure","counter":767,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100086#WRT03200"},{"type":"question","counter":768,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[38450\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100086#WRT03300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount of legal fees paid by his Department in respect of tribunals of inquiry established by the State and any resulting legal action; if he will provide these broken down by tribunal and by year for 2006 to 2016, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":769,"content":"<p>The Legal Fees paid by my Department in respect of tribunals, broken down by Tribunal and by year 2006 to 2016: <table><tr><th>Tribunal<\/th><th>Year<\/th><th>Amount Paid<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Beef Tribunal<\/td><td>2006<\/td><td>&euro;147,403.62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2007<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2008<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2009<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2010<\/td><td>&euro;15,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2011<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2012<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2013<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2014<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2015<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2016 to date<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100086#WRT03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":771,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100086#WRT03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff Scheme Applications","counter":770,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100086#WRT03500"},{"type":"question","counter":771,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[38101\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100086#WRT03600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 566 of 11 October 2016 (details supplied), if a suitable source of funding is available within his Department that may be applicable to supplement a green energy project as previously detailed to his office, considering that the person has already been granted REFIT approval; if any such funding will be available through his Department at a future date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":772,"content":"<p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">While I cannot comment on an\u00a0individual\u00a0Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT) application, I can confirm that it is normal practice that\u00a0successful REFIT applicants\u00a0cannot avail of any additional grant aid under European Commission State Aid rules.<\/font><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">I have asked my officials to follow up with the REFIT applicant referred to by the\u00a0Deputy.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100086#WRT03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Projects","counter":773,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100086#WRT03800"},{"type":"question","counter":774,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[38115\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100086#WRT03900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding solar farms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":775,"content":"<p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The Programme for Government\u00a0contains a commitment to\u00a0facilitate the development of solar energy projects in Ireland.

The process of reform and improvement must be continuous.<\/p>  <p>  I would also note that Ireland is a strong performer in other international competitiveness rankings &ndash; this year, for instance, we are ranked 7th out of 61 countries in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook - an improvement from 16th in last year&rsquo;s report.<\/p>  <p>  In July of this year, the National Competitiveness Council published its annual Competitiveness Scorecard benchmarking report which provides an in-depth assessment of all aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness performance.  The Council found that while Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved in recent years &ndash; and has been central to recent strong economic growth, a number of threats persist, not least of which is Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The analysis contained in the Scorecard report is informing the development of the Council&rsquo;s annual policy report Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge 2016 which I will shortly be bringing to Government for consideration and which will contain a range of actions to enhance competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  My officials will continue to monitor publications such as the World Bank Doing Business report.  Further actions and reforms - driven by the 2017 Action Plan for Jobs which is currently being prepared - will enable us to further narrow the gap with the world&rsquo;s most competitive countries and improve the ease of doing business, ultimately helping us to achieve our objective of sustainable full employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100088#WRV02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":837,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100088#WRV02100"},{"type":"question","counter":838,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[38272\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120100088#WRV02200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if Government employment and export targets will be reviewed following the recent ESRI report, The Product and Sector Level Impact of a Hard Brexit across the EU; the way in which Irish exports to the UK would be the most exposed in the EU in a WTO tariff scenario post-Brexit leading to a reduction in 4% of total Irish exports; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":839,"content":"<p>The ESRI paper referred to by the Deputy examines only one possible scenario arising from the UK decision to leave the EU.
